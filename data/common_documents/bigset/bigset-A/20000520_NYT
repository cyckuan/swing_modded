AS USUAL, YANKEES FEEL AT HOME IN INDIANS' PARK
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Laughter echoed from the other half of the New York
Yankees' clubhouse before tonight's game. ``Look at Knoblauch,''
David Cone said, pausing in his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch was doing an impression of his teammate Jim
Leyritz: a miniature Yankees jersey jammed into his waistband with
the fabric stretched tautly over his torso, a No. 13 taped on his
back, and he was bent forward, bat waggling. Leyritz watched, his
smile cockeyed, and Knoblauch cackled gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch and the rest of the Yankees are much more relaxed now
that they have resumed hitting, scoring and winning. Friday night
they pounded the Indians, 11-7, for their fourth consecutive
victory against Cleveland here this year and their 25th in 34
regular-season games at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill had a single, a double and a home run, and Bernie
Williams drove in three runs for the Yankees (24-14), who have 20
runs and 29 hits in their last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pleased we were able to keep coming back at them,''
manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees placed shortstop Derek Jeter on the 15-day disabled
list with an abdominal strain and promoted the top prospect Alfonso
Soriano to play in his place. Soriano was used at third base in
April and was atrocious defensively, clearly uncomfortable playing
a position besides shortstop. Even while playing his natural
position Friday night, however, Soriano fumbled a couple of balls
anxiously before making plays and committing a throwing error that
led to three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano flew here from Rochester, N.Y. and did not share in the
Yankees' harrowing flight Thursday night. Bad weather kept their
flight on the ground in Newark for about three hours. And after
finally taking off and approaching the Cleveland area, the players
said, the plane circled repeatedly through lightning. ``I knew it
was bad when I saw the flight attendant start to panic,'' said
Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher.
</P>
<P>
   They landed with all but their psyches unscathed; this certainly
ranked among his worst flights ever, Posada said. And the weather
continued to haunt. The pitchers could not control the baseball.
Knoblauch drew a walk leading off the game, the first of 15 issued
by the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The walks led to many rallies and runs and an incredibly long
and slow game _ the first five innings lasted 2 hours 23 minutes _
and Knoblauch was often in the middle of what the Yankees' hitters
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knobby had some big at-bats, a couple of base hits,'' Torre
said. ``He's looked as comfortable as he has all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees trailed, 2-1, in the top of the fifth inning, and
after Shane Spencer and Ricky Ledee reached second and third with
nobody out, Cleveland's Dave Burba struck out Scott Brosius and
retired Soriano on a grounder. Knoblauch fell behind, no balls and
two strikes, and the rally appeared finished.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch worked his way back against Burba, taking a ball,
fouling off a pitch, taking two more balls, fouling off three more
pitches, and on the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Burba walked
Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   If Burba was exhausted, there was good reason _ by the end of
Knoblauch's at-bat, he had thrown 76 pitches in less than four
innings. Only a few knockout blows were needed to finish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really big, and it didn't surprise me,'' Torre said
of Knoblauch's lengthy at-bat. ``When he's fouling balls over our
dugout, you know he's waiting on the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, batting in the No. 2 slot again, followed Knoblauch's
walk with a three-run double. O'Neill doubled home Williams and
scored when Tino Martinez singled. Posada singled, finishing Burba;
the Yankees led, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had more work to do. Wiping his nose with his
sleeve time and again, Andy Pettitte was miserable, and he allowed
four runs in the fourth, the last three on Manny Ramirez's homer.
Knoblauch singled home the go-ahead run against Scott Kamieniecki
in the fifth, however, and two batters later, O'Neill clubbed a
two-run homer. Ledee blistered a two-run homer in the sixth,
increasing the Yankees' lead to 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, who relieved Pettitte in the fifth and pitched 2
2/3 innings, improved his record to 4-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star will publish a two-part series, with
sidebars and graphics, on Sunday and Monday, May 21 and 22, about
police nationwide circumventing state laws in order to keep drug
money they seize.
</P>
<P>
   The stories, with a home slug of DRUG-MONEY, are available for
use by clients of The New York Times News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Please note that while the stories are long, they are rich in

   In addition, The Star is offering a shorter version of the
DRUG-MONEY-I story, slugged DRUG-MONEY-SHORT.
</P>
<P>
   First-day package:
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MONEY-I Kansas City -- Local and state police nationwide
work with federal agencies to keep drug money they seize even
though many state laws clearly intend the money to go education or
other public funds. In fact, little-known provisions in most state
laws would block the way the police/federal partnership now works.
The police practice leads to aggressive searches and a loss of
civil liberties, critics say. By Karen Dillon. 3400 words.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MONEY-SHORT -- A shorter version of DRUG-MONEY-I. 1,500
words.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MONEY-SCHOOLS -- At least eight states want seized drug
money sent to public education. Others have other plans. But it
doesn't matter because police widely ignore the laws. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   Graphics: A graphic explaining how states want police to act and
what they actually do, plus a national map depicting states with
tough laws that are often being ignored by police.

</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MONEY-II Kansas City -- A few states have tried
unsuccessfully to prohibit police from circumventing their own
laws, making it clear the solution must come from Washington. But
the Justice Department won't address the problem and Congress just
lost its best chance in a decade. By Karen Dillon. (2600 words).
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-MONEY-REFORM -- A news analysis: The federal forfeiture
reform law passed by Congress in April does not match its
advertising. (1500 words).

laws, but it's the Justice Department that invented the system
allowing that evasion and taught police how to use it. (1000

AFTER WEST FINALS, IS IT A BREEZE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ There is an unofficial movement afoot to
drop the ``Western Conference'' label from the Western Conference
Finals that open today at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers had the NBA's best record this season,
67-15. The Portland Trail Blazers were second best, at 59-23. And
the watered-down East is an afterthought, so the argument goes;
this series is the de facto finals.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson doesn't endorse that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, these have been the two best teams in basketball this
season, there's no doubt about that,'' Jackson said, ``but will
they be the two best teams all the way through this? You don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's a funny thing, that you'll see in retrospect
going back in a championship year, that `X' team played the best
series against the championship team way back when. And they didn't
get challenged all the way through the rest of them. Or maybe
Sacramento will have played the best series against us if we were
able to go on and by good fortune win a championship. And would
people look back and say, `Hey, the best series they had was
Sacramento'? So what does that mean? . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you get to the finals against any of the teams that are
left out there in the East, they're going to provide the challenge
for you at that time. So it's not like whoever wins the West is a
shoo-in. Althoughby all intents and purposes, that's what people
want to make of it, that's not the reality of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Games coaches play: Jackson was dismissive when asked if he
was concerned about Portland coach Mike Dunleavy's assertion that
Shaquille O'Neal got away with illegal defense 57 times in the
Phoenix series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that Mike's concerned about the officiating,''
Jackson said wryly, ``and that Mike's concerned about counting
illegal defenses. That bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a coaching ploy to get the officials' attention?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got to play a series in hopes that the officiating
is in your favor or sees things your way, then I think we've
misconstrued what the game's all about,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy, meanwhile, took umbrage at assertions that the Lakers
were the underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's falling for that,'' Dunleavy said. ``I mean, they won
67 games. They're going to have two first-team All-NBA players in
Shaq and Kobe. . . . They're the favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive: At times, this series might well resemble an
Eastern Conference duel, a la Miami and New York. The Lakers scored
100.8 points a game this season but only 89.0 against Portland. The
Blazers averaged 97.5 this season but just 89.8 against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams are very good defensive teams,'' Ron Harper said.
``They are a very great defensive team. They've got speed, size and
they all know how to use the team thing, too. I think we're a good
defensive team because we've got Shaq behind us. Hard not be a good
defensive team when you've got Shaq behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper seemed unconcerned about Portland's speed and
athleticism, even though the Lakers had trouble containing the
speed and athleticism of the Kings and Suns in the prior two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Harper said, ``they're both at home right now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Film school: A new playoff round has brought a new intrigue
to the Lakers' film sessions. Jackson had been splicing scenes from
``American History X'' between basketball sequences. He's now using
``The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting started, so I can't really give you a
summary of what's going on right now,'' Derek Fisher said. ``But
hopefully as this postseason continues, I'll be able to give you
more insight into what's going on.''

... CORRECTS TO STANFORD PLAYING CAL NEXT, NOT WAKE FOREST 
STANFORD AND GEORGIA ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Those peep holes on the ends of tennis courts
work two ways. In addition to the fans getting a closer look, the
players can look beyond their court and sense the match's overall
mood.
</P>
<P>
   It was somber for the USC and UCLA women's teams, who suffered
one-sided defeats in the NCAA quarterfinals at Pepperdine. The
Trojans lost 5-1 to third-ranked Georgia, and No. 1 Stanford shut
out UCLA 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches don't like me to say that,'' UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt
said, ``but I can feel there wasn't as much cheering. You can tell
when people are up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Down was the operative word Friday. Although the 12th-ranked
Trojans(18-9) took almost an hour longer to lose than No. 9 UCLA
(17-9), not much went right for either team.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, the Bruins didn't win a set in losing in about 90
minutes. Schmidt came the closest, losing 7-5 and trailing 3-2 to
Jennifer Heiser at No. 5 singles when the Cardinal (29-0) had won
the necessary five matches.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else won more than three games in any set. After the
first sets were complete, UCLA had won just 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't let us into it,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For USC, not much more went right.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 1 singles Kara Warkentin, a slow starter of late, started
about as slowly as possible, losing 6-0 to fifth-ranked Aarthi
Venkatesan. Then Warkentin lost 6-3 and the match was over in less
than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 4 and No. 5 singles Jacqui Boyd and Anita Loyola lost in
an hour. Boyd lost the first set 6-4 when Lori Grey broke her at
love, then fell 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her serve is not one of her strengths, shall we say,'' USC
coach Richard Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola said she didn't let herself get patient and lost 6-2, 6-2
to Kelly Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Veronika Safarova won the first set 6-4 over Esther Knox, but
then her right shoulder started acting up, and Knox won the next
two sets 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It threw my game off completely,'' Safarova said. ``I can't
play as relaxed as I like.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And Tiffany Brymer, at No. 6 singles, played a grueling two
hour, 28-minute match before losing in three to Anne Nguyen. Brymer
won the first set 7-5 and had all of the momentum before losing 6-2
in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   USC's lone bright spot: Freshman Jewel Peterson, ranked 17th
nationally, earned USC's lone point with a 7-5, 6-4 win over
Marissa Catlin at No. 3 singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look for things that go wrong, you're going to find
them,''Gallien said. ``The trick is to drive yourself through. If
you don't, it demoralizes you. The tough teams keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Stanford, which faces Cal in a semifinal today at
2 p.m. Florida and Georgia meet at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal is so deep that when Teryn Ashley suffered back
spasms and couldn't play at No. 3 singles, coach Frank Brennan
moved everyone up one and put Keiko Tokuda at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In case any player had doubts, top singles player Marissa Irvin
suggested to look at this not as moving up a step but as facing a
new opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Tokuda beat Catherine Hawley 6-1, 6-3. Normal fourth singles
Lauren Kalavaria beat Amanda Basica 6-1, 6-3 and Gabriela Lastra
knocked off Abigail Spears 6-1, 6-2 in fourth doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, shuffling the deck is nothing new for Stanford.
Irvin, from Harvard-Westlake High, played in just her 22nd match
Friday because she has been preparing to turn pro after the NCAAs.
Ashley has been hurt before, as has freshman Laura Granville at No.
2 singles.
</P>
<P>
   They're healthy now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every NCAAs, they come out at their best,'' said Annica
Cooper, who lost 6-0, 6-3 to Granville, ``and it's tough to go
against that.''

FOREST 
PAC-10 HAS DEPTH BUT FALLS SHORT OF SEC
</HEADLINE>
 ... CORRECTS TO CAL BEATING WAKE(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The debate continues over which conference
ranks as strongest in college women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 put five teams into Friday's quarterfinals,
causing Florida coach Andy Brandi to declare: ``The Pac-10 right
now has the upper hand. They've had tremendous years and they
deserve to be called the best conference in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi made his comments early Friday. By the end of the day,
Brandi's Southeastern Conference had placed two in today's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Georgia, ranked second and third nationally, beat
Arizona State and USC. But Cal beat No. 4 Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Stanford survived, beating UCLA. The consensus is the
Pac-10 is deeper but not deep enough to knock off the SEC's top
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a semifinal (conference), and we're a quarterfinal
(conference),'' USC's Jacqui Boyd said. ``I think the gap is
narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players offered opinions as to what the Pac-10 needs to
do. They include being mentally tougher, playing more consistently
and having depth. Florida and Georgia play in hot and humid
conditions, and Stanford didn't miss anything with No. 3 singles
Teryn Ashley out with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a little tougher a little longer,'' USC coach
Richard Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his team. Yet except for Stanford, it
applied to the others.
</P>
<P>
   __ Time varies: In the NCAAs, as USC can vouch, you often don't
know when you'll play or when you'll finish.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's tournament in Gainesville, Fla., the Trojans
started at 8 p.m. and finished at 3:30 a.m. In Thursday's third
round, they started at 8 a.m. and finished at 11. In Friday's
quarterfinal against Georgia, they started at 11:50 a.m. _ 50
minutes late _ and finished at 2:18.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Richard Gallien didn't mind Thursday's early start
because he knew the time was guaranteed (it was first) and the
Trojans didn't have to wait around all day.
</P>
<P>
   Singles player Jacqui Boyd had a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to it,'' Boyd said. ``That wake-up call at 5
a.m. was rough. But I suppose it's better. It's getting hot and
we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Volunteers: A number of Pepperdine players are volunteering
around the tournament. This gives them a chance to hear what the
participants say about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends say, `It's bad for you, but we have a better
chance now,' '' singles player Ipek Senoglu said. ``I take it as
good. Not many teams could win the tournament, and we were one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were'' is the key word. Pepperdine, ranked seventh, is the
highest-ranked noncompeting team. The Waves were ousted in last
week's regional by No. 32 Louisiana State _ the lowest-ranked team
that participated. LSU lost to USC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting the best: The attendance over the first two days was
sparse. Yet one local high school player and her teacher father
played hooky to come watch.
</P>
<P>
   Hart High of Newhall's Jenny Munroe and her father, Dave, Hart's
girls' basketball coach, made the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny, a junior, wanted to see if she could play for one of the
top programs. She played No. 1 singles at Hart her first two
seasons but didn't last fall because it interfered with her
junior-tournament schedule.
</P>
<P>
   She has sent letters to several of the schools here, including
Duke,Arizona State, Notre Dame, Texas, Northwestern and Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Her verdict: ``They're too good. That's one reason I'm here to
watch: It helps you decide if you can play at this level.''

KNICKS ROLL A SEVEN, SENDING THE SERIES TO MIAMI FOR A FINAL GAME
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere along a seemingly doomed path, the New York
Knicks found healing powers from their pride to recover from an
18-point second-quarter deficit Friday night and extend their
second-round series with the Miami Heat to a deciding Game 7 Sunday
by taking Game 6, 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston, fouled by Dan Majerle, made two free throws with
17.6 seconds left to pull the Knicks ahead at last. And when
Miami's Anthony Carter missed a 3-pointer just before the final
buzzer, the Knicks had found a way to send the series back to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with elimination, and down by 18 points in the first half,
the Knicks managed to unearth the kind of desperate attitude that
served them so well in their improbable run to the finals last
season. Now, they have set themselves up to poke a hole in the
hearts of the Heat once more and give coach Pat Riley yet another
Knicks demon to jolt him from his sleep. The possibility must make
him shudder just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the Knicks have arrived in Miami for a
series-deciding game and left strutting to the next round. Now, the
pressure is on a Heat team Riley has threatened to dismantle if
they cannot get by their playoff ghosts. Although neither team has
come up with back-to-back victories in two years of playoff games,
the Knicks are often at their best when they can manufacture an
us-against-the-world mentality. And Game 7 in Miami Sunday
afternoon is the perfect setting to start building an edge that has
been missing in the Knicks at times this season.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Game 6, Houston admitted that he had detected a
missing ingredient in his team so far in their playoff run: hunger.
After last year's finals path carved against the odds by the
Knicks, this team has been in constant search of something to prove
this season, something to prod their pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you constantly have to prove yourself in this
league,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said before the game. ``I don't care
if it's a player, a coach or management. If it's true that we don't
think we have anything to prove _ and I don't believe that's the
case _ then it's a critical mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of urgency that should have motivated the Knicks was
not horribly apparent as the more aggressive and far crisper Heat
surged out to a shocking 43-25 lead with two minutes left in the
second quarter. During one stretch, the Knicks were 2 for 14
shooting under the pressure the Heat applied on defense. To make it
worse, there were plays like this: On a missed jumper by Carter,
the bulky Clarence Weatherspoon leaped above three Knicks and
retrieved the rebound. Then he was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   The boos quickly came down in buckets. When the Knicks closed
the score to within 45-30 at the half, they received a handful of
sarcastic cheers. As the Knicks exited at halftime, they were
shooting 27.5 percent and had turned the ball over nine times. The
Heat, led by Mourning's 13 points, were hitting only 34.3 percent
but had just three turnovers. They also were rewarded for their
assertiveness with 21 free-throw attempts; the Knicks had just
seven.
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, Chris Childs' pre-game guarantee seemed both
ridiculous and another sign of the arrogance that has made the
Knicks seem dangerously overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee a win,'' Childs boasted in the locker room an hour
before tip-off. ``Y'all go out and book your flight to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat made no such grandiose statements. They just went out
and played hard with as few mistakes as possible. Hardaway and then
Carter broke down the Knicks' guards by dribbling into the paint,
sucking a slow-reacting defense inside and then hitting the open
man for uncontested jumpers. Mourning bulled his way into the paint
against Patrick Ewing and either scored or took a trip to the
free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Knicks turned the ball over, the Heat ran out on
the break and finished strong. The Knicks just kept backing down.
And for once, rebounding was not an issue. It was the Knicks'
panicked execution in the face of the Heat's defense. A harried
Houston (3 for 9) continued to be invisible, while Latrell Sprewell
(2 for 6) rushed his shots. Once again, the bench play of Marcus
Camby and Kurt Thomas was less than spectacular. The two combined
for two points and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   With so much going wrong, Van Gundy needed a halftime speech to
resurrect his team's hopes. They weren't out of it. A 15-point lead
wasn't insurmountable even at their slow offensive pace.
</P>
<P>
   And in an instant, a supercharged group of Knicks started
flaunting their talent edge over the Heat. Using dribble
penetration by Charlie Ward to create open shots for Houston and
seizing the moment off a series of Heat misses from the perimeter,
the Knicks went on a blistering 11-2 run to close to within 47-41
with nine minutes left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game again. Suddenly, the Heat's 18-point
second-quarter lead was down to a manageable margin. A very sharp
Houston was not only scoring but making plays for his teammates by
passing off the drive. An energized Sprewell scored four straight
points to cut the Heat's lead to 50-45.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams then blew opportunities with missed free throws and
turnovers. Sprewell rushed several shots that went awry, Ewing
missed two jumpers, but the Knicks did cut the Heat's lead to four
points before they allowed Carter to hit a gutsy 3-pointer at the
shot-clock buzzer with 30 seconds left in the third. After a jumper
by Houston, the Knicks were down, 58-53, entering the fourth.

BLAIR AND HIS WIFE HAVE A NEW SON, THEIR 4TH CHILD
</HEADLINE>
  By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Cherie Blair, 45, the wife of Prime Minister Tony
Blair, 47, gave birth to a baby boy at a London hospital early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both mother and baby are doing well,'' a 10 Downing Street
spokesman said in a brief statement. ``Both the prime minister and
Mrs. Blair are delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair went to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on
Friday morning, and Mr. Blair followed in the late afternoon. There
was no word of a name for the baby, who due date was May 24.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is the couple's fourth child and the first to be born
to a sitting prime minister in 152 years. Their other children are
Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair, a prominent employment rights lawyer, worked up
until the last few days, appearing on Tuesday in the High Court to
argue a case for the Trade Unions Congress that challenged the way
Mr. Blair's government has introduced parental leave benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, modeled on a European Union directive, gives
parents the right to take 13 weeks off during the first five years
of their child's life, but the Blair government has restricted the
benefit to parents of children born after Dec. 15, 1999. Mrs.
Blair, who practices under her unmarried name, Cherie Booth, told
the justices that the limit unlawfully excluded 2.7 million people
who were already parents of children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of parental leave became an issue for the Blairs when
she noted in a speech to a legal group in London the experience of
the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, who took a week out
of the office to spend with his newborn daughter in March. Mrs.
Blair pointedly encouraged the ``widespread adoption'' of
Lipponen's ``fine example.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention turned to the prime minister, who let his decision on
how he would react be known in an interview in last Sunday's New
York Times Magazine. ``I know what people want me to say,'' he
said, ``but the truth is if I went away and stopped taking calls or
having any conversations, it just wouldn't be real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take more time off,'' he said. ``I'll try to cut down on
official things. You've got to have some common sense about it _
you want to spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up
the job.''

DC UNITED HAVING PROBLEMS; HERNANDEZ SET FOR DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PASADENA, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Galaxy might have its hands
full integrating newly acquired Mexican striker Luis Hernandez
while at the same time adjusting to a new lineup after losing three
starters _ Joey Franchino, Roy Myers and Clint Mathis _ to make
room for ``El Matador.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing in comparison to the disaster three-time MLS
champion D.C. United is going through.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer's proud dynasty has taken a number of
punishing blows this season. A couple more big punches could send
United sprawling to the canvas for good.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the focus will certainly be on Hernandez's MLS
debut when the Galaxy (5-0-5) plays host to United tonight at the
Rose Bowl, United (2-8-1), with the worst record in the MLS, needs
a victory like a heart needs a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the final third, we've not executed from day one,'' United
coach Thomas Rongen said. ``If we can get somebody who's willing to
step up and put the ball in the back of the net, we're looking at a
completely different scenario right now. That will come.''
</P>
<P>
   United hasn't played poorly, despite losing striker Roy Lassiter
to Miami as well as dealing with nagging injuries. But it seems a
wealth of good fortune in the past has suddenly turned. Even in
games in which it has looked dominant, it ends up walking away with
nothing to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting tired of it,'' United defender Jeff Agoos said.
``I would love to play absolutely poorly and win a game. We've been
playing great for eight or nine games, but it hasn't meant anything
on the scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid isn't convinced that
United's dynasty is through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their record is a surprise, but if you look at their games,
the results are really unfortunate,'' Schmid said. ``I think the
ball is bouncing against them a bit, but by no means do I
underestimate them as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not all of a sudden a bad team. They're a good team
going through a bad patch, which is a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a few more beatings to convince Galaxy defender
Danny Pena that United is a team in danger of missing the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to count them out,'' Pena said. ``I still think
at the end of the day they're going to be exactly where they want
to be. It's going to take at least three more losses to convince me
they're in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the (East) conference isn't really an issue for them.
If they can get into the playoffs and gain some momentum, you're
going to see what you saw last year, which is the dominant team
they have been since day one.''
</P>
<P>
   United defeated the Galaxy 2-0 in November to claim their third
MLS title. In their only meeting earlier this year at RFK Stadium,
the Galaxy returned the favor with a 4-0 thumping, the worst loss
in United history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they want to come out and return some favors,''
Schmid said. ``I expect them to be highly attentive to marking some
of our guys tightly. I would not be surprised if the game is very
physical in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy officials have looked forward to this meeting with United
from day one, hoping to lure more fans by handing out a free cap
for tonight's match. Adding Hernandez to the mix adds a welcomed
boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it makes for an even grandeur event,'' Schmid said.
``This is what you become a professional athlete for, to play in
these kind of events. There will be a buzz going into this game,
maybe the biggest we have have had in a few years.''

COMPANY FINED FOR FAILING TO DELIVER ON ITS PROMISE OF FREE AIRLINE
TICKETS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY TONY RIZZO, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Branson company that falsely promised free
airline tickets as part of a travel promotion will pay $30,000 to
Johnson County, Kan., residents, according to a court settlement
reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Surrey Vacation Resorts Inc. also will pay a $10,000 civil
penalty and $7,500 in investigative costs, under terms of the
agreement filed in Johnson County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged that customers reached by telephone were
promised four free tickets for attending a 90-minute presentation
at the company's Overland Park, Kan., office.
</P>
<P>
   One of those called was Tyler Garretson, an assistant district
attorney who handles consumer fraud cases.
</P>
<P>
   Garretson and others were told that the airline ticket offer
came with ``no strings attached,'' according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tickets, however, people who attended the
presentation received a piece of paper labeled as a ``Fly America''
vacation voucher.
</P>
<P>
   When the vouchers were mailed to an address supplied by the
company, a brochure was mailed back listing prices for hotel rooms
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers had to book minimum five- or 10-day stays at hotels
with prices ranging from $69 to $425 per night to get their airline
tickets, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors charged that failing to deliver the free tickets as
promised violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the subsequent investigation, the Johnson County district
attorney's office found 60 individuals or couples who said they
were promised, but did not receive, the four free airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the $30,000 settlement Friday, each of those
60 customers will receive $500.
</P>
<P>
   The company also must give copies of its sales pitches to the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The company's local attorney, Scott Gyllenborg, who signed the
agreement, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman did not respond to a telephone message left
Friday.

DODGERS MAKE LATE MAGIC AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The Los Angeles Dodgers are getting hits in situations
they didn't last year. They're jumping on opponents' mistakes, and
the bullpen is holding leads.
</P>
<P>
   So many things are different about the Dodgers now than they
were, and that Mark Kotsay's ball stayed in Pro Player Stadium
instead of going out might say the most. Things are certainly going
the Dodgers' way.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, the Dodgers rallied from a deficit
in the eighth inning to win, and for the third time, Jeff Shaw
closed it out as the Dodgers beat the Florida Marlins 5-3 Friday in
the opener of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre delivered the big hit, a two-run
double in the eighth to transform a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 lead.
Chad Kreuter added an RBI single as the Dodgers won for the fifth
time in six games. They are 5-4 with two games remaining on a
difficult four-city road trip that brings an end to a torturous
beginning of the season in which the Dodgers were rarely home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a momentum-turner right there,'' Shaw said. ``We didn't
seem to get the big hit last year like we are now. Adrian had the
big one. The big hit is coming in the sixth, seventh, eighth inning
every night. And it's a different guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's double provided the lead, but there were some skipped
heartbeats in the bottom of the inning when the Marlins had two
runners in scoring position and Mark Kotsay was batting.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay hit Shaw's first pitch deep to right field, only to
have Shawn Green catch it a step in front of the fence to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was gone,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who also doubled in the fourth inning, had similar
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   `Man, it was freakin' me out because I thought it was going to
go out,'' Beltre said. ``That's what I told Shawn Green after (the
game) when I saw him. I thought it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers continue to win games when the bullpen
keeps them close and the offense jumps on a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   After starter Chan Ho Park allowed three runs in six solid
innings, Matt Herges (2-0) held the Dodgers close for an inning
before they could rally off reliever Braden Looper (0-1). Gary
Sheffield started the inning with a double, Green was intentionally
walked and Karros grounded to third to move the runners into
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre thought the Marlins would intentionally walk him, but
Looper pitched and Beltre slammed a double high off the left-center
field fence to give the Dodgers the lead. They went on to win after
trailing entering the eighth inning for the fifth time in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a clutch hitter,'' Sheffield said. ``A lot of teams
forget about him and guys pitch around (Karros) and Shawn Green and
face him. The whole team respects each other. We know who our
Golden Boy is. He's the future. You have to take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Set-up man Terry Adams is apparently over the problem that
plagued him during his first few outings of the road trip, and is
pitching well in place of injured set-up man Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   Adams pitched a scoreless eighth, though it wasn't without a
threat. Preston Wilson and David Berg singled with two outs, but
Brant Brown popped out to third. Shaw then recorded his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the feeling is, especially with the bullpen, as long
as we stay close, we're going to get to them,'' Johnson said.
``Jeff Shaw, he's a consummate professional. He's going to make
them hit his pitch.''

GASOLINE PRICES IN KC AHEAD OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
 PRICES -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE EVERLY, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, _ Mo. For the first time, many Kansas City service
stations are posting prices of $1.50 or more for a gallon of
unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, gasoline prices are up again, with the national average
climbing to $1.49 for unleaded. And for once the Midwest, often the
home of the country's cheapest gasoline, is ahead of that average.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of months ago, in March, gasoline prices were on
the way down, thanks to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries' agreeing to produce more crude oil. Randall Espeland
recalls breathing a sigh of relief when he heard that news.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday the Kansas City resident could hardly believe the
$1.50 sign at an area gas station. ``I don't know what happened,''
he said. ``But this is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   So volatile have gasoline prices become recently that it's hard
to keep track. Earlier this week, AAA Automobile Club of Missouri
completed its survey of Kansas City area prices, and on Friday it
reported an average price at $1.42 a gallon for unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday morning, area service stations had raised prices
to at least $1.50. That's more than gas cost during the oil embargo
in the early 1980s or during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when
unleaded hit $1.25. The previous high this year was $1.46 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, the prices are not historically high.
Nevertheless, motorists are getting sticker shock. And for once the
Midwest isn't relatively well-off.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Energy Information Administration this week said the
average price for several Midwestern states was $1.50 a gallon.
That made it the second-most-expensive region in the agency's
survey. Typically, the Midwest has had some of the cheaper gas in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast, where taxes are higher and Californians must use
cleaner-burning gas that costs more, was the only region where
prices topped those in the Midwest. Motorists there paid an average
$1.60 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The usual suspects for higher gasoline prices are being blamed:
supply and demand. OPEC indicated this week that it had no
intention of further increasing oil production. Crude oil prices
have hovered at $30 a barrel, near their March highs, and demand
has increased as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old story,'' said Karen DesJarlais, a
spokeswoman for the Phillips Petroleum Co. in Bartlesville, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   John Felmy, director of policy analysis for the American
Petroleum Institute in Washington, said problems also had been
caused by a change in the formula for cleaner-burning fuel _ such
as that used in St. Louis _ that takes effect in June. The
situation in the Midwest has been aggravated by temporary outages
at some refineries.
</P>
<P>
   But is more afoot? Gasoline stockpiles are down about 7 percent
from a year ago, making prices sensitive to reports that supplies
are tight or demand is up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Right, a spokesman for the Missouri AAA, said the tighter
supply had been caused in part by ``capacity utilization'' _ the
percentage of refinery capacity used to produce gasoline _ being
down from a year ago. Felmy, however, said the percentage figures
were misleading and that more gasoline was being produced than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is also evidence that refineries are boosting profit
margins, particularly in the Midwest. Paul Ting, an analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney, said making gasoline had become more
profitable for U.S. refineries.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true for refineries in the Midwest that are
making $5 a barrel more than they were in the second quarter of
last year, he said. A barrel contains 42 gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   And with demand expected to increase to 130,000 barrels a day
this summer, consumers will hardly be in a position to bargain. The
use of gasoline this summer is expected to set a record, according
to the Energy Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency is forecasting ``extraordinarily'' tight
supplies until September, or when summer vacations are wrapped up,
so further price spikes are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they got it and we want it, they'll charge what the market
will pay,'' said Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the
Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association in Grain Valley.
``This is going to go on for awhile.''

 FAKE CONGRESS LOOKS INTO PROBLEM OF FAKE IDs SOLD ON WEB   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Getting a driver's license from the state of
Florida was easy for Susan Collins. So was securing a U.S. Army
Reserves identification card and a Boston University student ID.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins is a U.S. senator from Maine, not from Florida. She
isn't in the reserves and never attended Boston University. Collins
got the bogus credentials off the Internet to prove a point:
Anybody can do it and more people are doing it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   A five-month investigation by Collins' Senate staff uncovered
some 60 Web sites that either sell fake documents or the kits to
make them. Three sites _ including fakeidzone.com, traced to a
Lawrence man _ were used to illustrate how the system works.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a
hearing Friday on fake documents, which senators and witnesses said
are a disturbing byproduct of the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing and vastly underpublicized problem,'' said Sen.
Daniel Akaka, a Hawaii Democrat and subcommittee member. ``The
number of Web sites for making false IDs and documents is really
striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents reproduced using Internet capability and
computer technology include passports, green cards, bank loan
authorizations, Social Security cards, diplomas, birth certificates
and press credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who is chairwoman of the subcommittee, said she is most
concerned about how easy it is to create identifications that
falsely present someone as a police officer, FBI agent or other
government official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wide-scale availability of false identifications and
credentials on the Internet poses a serious new threat to
government and the integrity of government operations,'' Collins
said. ``I'm more convinced than ever that we need a crackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins would like to pass a law that clearly makes it illegal
to sell fake identification kits, just as it is illegal to sell and
use IDs themselves for unauthorized purposes. Current laws are
being skirted by promoting the IDs as ``novelty'' items, Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   States have various laws on false identifications and are having
a hard time keeping up with methods people can use to re-create
documents, said David C. Myers, identification fraud coordinator
for the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said 30 percent of the fake IDs that authorities now see
in Florida are produced on the Internet, up from 5 percent last
year and 1 percent two years ago. Some sites selling IDs get 10,000
inquiries a day and can generate $1 million in sales annually, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   K. Lee Blalack II, chief counsel and staff director of the
Collins subcommittee, testified Friday that it is almost impossible
to tell fake documents from real ones in many cases and that ``some
of these sites offer phony documents of a shockingly high
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Blalack and his staff issued 11 subpoenas for documents and
depositions and interviewed 40 witnesses. Among people subpoenaed
was Tim Catron of Lawrence, who Blalack said had the Web site
called fakeidzone.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site advertisement tried to sell kits to make ``novelty
IDs,'' such as driver's licenses, birth certificates, college
transcripts, diplomas and Social Security cards. Disks were
available for $19.95 on the site, which Blalack said is now closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide you with templates and step-by-step instructions on
what you need to create fake IDs so real you could fool your own
mother,'' the ad said.
</P>
<P>
   Catron declined to give a deposition to the committee on the
grounds it might incriminate him, Blalack said. Catron was not
accused of a crime by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Catron wouldn't comment when reached by a reporter. His lawyer,
Keith White of Lawrence, also wouldn't comment but said he is not
aware of any ongoing investigation of Catron by authorities and
that he has not been charged with any related offense.
</P>
<P>
   Blalack said billing records obtained by the committee found
that Catron received 652 orders and generated more than $12,000 in
revenue during a two-month period in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Blalack said Catron attempted to disguise the real location of
his Web site by registering it to an address and phone number in
the Philippines and an e-mail address originating in another small
country in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Payments were directed instead to an address in Pittsburg, Kan.,
and Catron was finally served with a subpoena by U.S. marshals in
Lawrence, Blalack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Catron's tactics...allowed him to market his products to a
wide audience with very little overhead cost and minimal risk of
criminal exposure,'' Blalack said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian L. Stafford, director of the U.S. Secret Service, said use
of false identifications to open bank accounts, pass checks, get
credit cards and obtain loans is rising rapidly and creating a
major challenge for his agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``False identification provides criminals with the anonymity
needed to perpetuate a myriad of fraud schemes,'' Stafford told the
subcommittee. Stafford and Myers said better fraud identification
training and strict enforcement of laws are two ways to address the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Williams, U.S. attorney for the Kansas District, said a
state and federal task force is being formed to study use of the
Internet for illegal purposes.

ANALYSIS: A CHANGE IN GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS quote in 1st graf)  
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudolph Giuliani has often been called operatic, but
little in his past prepared the audience for Friday's performance.
It was a new character on stage: vulnerable, affectionate,
introspective, indecisive, apologetic to his enemies, more
concerned with being ``better as a person'' than winning a
political fight.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies may doubt his conversion. One of his promises
Friday, to reach out to disaffected New Yorkers, was reminiscent of
the overtures he made to minority voters in his second inaugural
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever he does the rest of his term, there was no
mistaking the change in Giuliani Friday. He started off sounding a
bit like Lou Gehrig in ``The Pride of the Yankees.'' ``I'm a very
fortunate man,'' Giuliani said in response to the applause that
greeted him. ``The reason I'm such a fortunate man is that I have
people that love me and I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would not be ``a new Rudy,'' but then he promptly
talked about about becoming ``somebody who grows from the fact you
confront your limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I understand myself a lot better,'' he said. ``I think
I understand what is important to me better. Maybe I'm not
completely there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising to hear that intimations of mortality made
Giuliani reassess his life. But it was a shock to hear him confess
to a new sensation. For the first time, he had met a decision he
was having trouble making. For a moment he sounded almost like that
classic Hamlet on the Hudson, Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself unable to make, really make the treatment
decision yet,'' he said referring to his prostate cancer. ``And
about the decision to run, I was almost in the same position, not
being able to make it, which has never really happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his background as a prosecutor, Giuliani was
accustomed to making difficult decisions based on imperfect
information. Prosecutors, unlike politicians, are used to making
people unhappy. Giuliani prided himself on acting quickly and not
looking back.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked near the end of his second year in office to
name any mistakes he'd made, he could barely come up with anything.
He refused even to apologize for his endorsement of Mario Cuomo,
which left him politically isolated and unable to carry out some of
the most important reforms he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never revisit it,'' he said in October of 1995, a year after
the endorsement. ``You don't get the benefit when you make a
decision to know what you're going to know a year later. I made the
right decision based on the things that I knew at the time. I'm
actually proud of the decision, because it was an ability to take a
risk for what I thought was the good of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday he was having second thoughts about lots of things. He
promised to try to overcome ``the barriers that maybe I placed''
between himself and New Yorkers who didn't feel a part of the
city's good times. ``I'm going to dedicate myself to trying to
figure out how we can get them to feel that, too, including maybe
changes I have to make in the way I approach it, the way I look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the mayor's new persona go over with the public? The
reaction was mixed among an unscientific sample of people
interviewed on the streets of Brooklyn. Ken DiPreta, a writer out
walking his dog in in Cadman Park, was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really pretty self-absorbed of him,'' DiPreta said, ``to
suddenly realize, `Gee, maybe I haven't exactly been nice to people
as mayor.' All of us knew that he was like that. So to hear him
discovering normal human kindness like it was some great new
invention seems a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were willing to cut the mayor a break. ``He suddenly
became human,'' said Quentin Arthur, a law student standing outside
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. ``It's like tragedy had to strike
before he could see what he was like. I don't think it's an act. I
think he really probably does want to be a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's new priorities have been obvious to city officials.
``There's been a lot of self-examination,'' Nicholas Scoppetta, the
commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said.
``What's quite remarkable is that he has done a good deal of this
in public, and his declarations of where he finds himself have been
public, too. I find it all very moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him,'' Scoppetta said. ``He is going through an
extremely difficult time and doing it with the whole city watching
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides and friends have always said there's a softer
and gentler Rudy that the public never sees, and journalists have
always known that he can be charming when he sits down to dinner
with a glass of Chianti. But even at his most relaxed, even when he
was rhapsodizing about opera, he was not what you could call a
touchy-feely guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What moves me about opera is that you can express emotions in
a way that you can't when you just speak,'' he said one evening
five years ago after watching ``Tosca,'' but the emotions that
concerned him seemed to be mainly political. ``Tosca'' was one of
his favorite operas because it featured a struggle against
political evil.

 MU VETERINARIAN ENVISIONS A RONALD MCDONALD-tYPE HOUSE FOR SICK (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY LEE HILL KAVANAUGH, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ ``Big Dog,'' a German shepherd mix, strides into
the veterinary school. Her owner, Ed Shipman, reaches down and
gives Big Dog an affectionate rub on her belly, then a hug.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dog, 13, smiles back in her doggy way, her pink tongue
hanging out. She is happy.
</P>
<P>
   But Big Dog has no idea how sick she is.
</P>
<P>
   She has cancer. Shipman and his wife, Anita, have driven more
than two hours from Kansas City to bring Big Dog to the College of
Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Their
hope is that modern medical procedures like radiation and
chemotherapy might eradicate the cancer in Big Dog's body. Or at
least give them a little more time together.
</P>
<P>
   Time is precious to people whose pets are fighting serious
illness.
</P>
<P>
   But driving hours to and from Columbia to meet the needs of an
ailing pet can add more stress to an already difficult time. The
option of spending the night while a pet recovers from a medical
procedure can be nearly impossible if there is a football game or a
convention filling hotel rooms. And many hotels do not permit pets
at all.
</P>
<P>
   But pet owners may have another option if an idea from
veterinarian//oncologist Carolyn Henry becomes a reality. Barkley
House is envisioned as a homey place located within steps of the
veterinary school, where pets and their owners could stay during
treatments, especially radiation treatments that often require
daily doses.
</P>
<P>
   The house would be a Ronald McDonald-style home, perhaps even a
hospice center where dying pets and owners could visit together one
last time in privacy.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, pets are family, and owners will help them as
much as possible. A typical treatment regimen for cancer costs
between $1,200 and $2,200. But sometimes, costs for a cancer
treatment are met by anonymous donors or waived if the pet is
participating in a clinical trial to help animals and perhaps even
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Although pets do not suffer as much as people from the side
effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, they do suffer
anxiety when their owners are not nearby. That's why Barkley House
is needed, Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If owners could stay with their pets throughout the process,
both the pets and the owners would do better in the treatments,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people who view this as extravagant. I tell
people if you go down to the lake and spend $20,000 on a boat
because it makes you happy, why couldn't someone else spend money
on a pet that makes them happy every day?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea came to Henry in December, after she heard about a
similar house and a favorite patient died: an 8-year-old Great
Pyrenees, weighing 155 pounds and named Barkley. His owner, Sally
Truscheit of Kansas City, drove Barkley to the veterinary clinic in
Columbia for most of his treatments, but one month she broke her
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I was able to get a friend to take him'' to Columbia,
Truscheit said. ``It was such a comfort to talk with others in the
waiting room there, and learn that there are all these other people
going through the same thing. It was nice to be around people who
understand what you feel, that yes, you love this dog and you'll do
whatever it takes to make them feel better or more comfortable.
Being with others helped with the grief process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barkley lived for almost a year instead of dying in a few
weeks because of his treatments. I loved him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates to create Barkley House approach $250,000 to find the
property and build the house. But just the mention of the idea has
already garnered more than $11,000 in donations from pet lovers.
Although the veterinary school itself is not sponsoring the house,
the school has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 12,000 animals were treated at the school.
Owners who must leave their pets are called twice daily with
medical updates. Veterinarians also are compassionate with owners'
grief and conscientious of a pet's quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to talk with owners as much as possible, especially
with those whose pets die,'' Henry said. ``But sometimes we get too
busy to talk as much as we'd like. If there was a place for owners
to stay with their animals, they'd be around others who are also
going through the same grief of helping a terminally ill pet.
They'd be around people who understand and who don't judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley House would not be the first boarding house for sick
pets. In Pullman, Wash., Carmel Travis founded Lucas House in
September. She turned one floor of her house into four units where
pets can stay with their owners at night. During the day, the pets
receive medical care at the Washington State University Veterinary
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came up with the idea based on what I would have wanted if I
were going through this,'' said Travis, whose dog Lucas died but
was treated near her home. ``I've been hoping the concept would
catch on around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis said she didn't know of any other homes yet, but there
are several teaching veterinary hospitals around the country. The
need is there.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Columbia, another family arrives at the veterinary
school after driving three hours from St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy'' bounces into the waiting room, her four paws clicking
on the linoleum floor. She is a 10-year-old cocker spaniel, a
fluffball of orange curls and brown liquid eyes. A wagging stub of
a tail makes her whole body wiggle, and her people, the Nold
family, smile from ear to ear.
</P>
<P>
   But Sandy is sick. She has lung cancer. Thursday she received
her third chemotherapy dose. So far, her cancer treatment is
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was first diagnosed by her home vet, they told me
she'd live maybe two weeks,'' said Jane Nold, a nurse. ``The cancer
has spread to her lymph nodes but she's doing excellently.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy insists on kissing Jane Nold and her husband, Greg, as
Jane talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they treat Sandy as if she's my child instead of a
dog,'' Nold said. ``Everyone at work thought we were crazy for
spending money to treat her. I just decided she was worth more than
my kitchen floor that we were going to buy. The driving does get
hard because we have to stop a lot to let her go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But seeing her now, here, as she jumps around, this is a treat
for us. Every day that we have together is a gift. When she chases
a squirrel, or jumps after a ball, I never dreamed she could bounce
back from surgery so quickly. She's not in any pain. She eats well.
Yeah, we may be doing this treatment for us, but the quality of
life for Sandy is worth it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's given a lot to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have her around a little longer.''

 ORAL AIDS VACCINE TO BE TESTED IN AFRICA  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A unique oral AIDS vaccine built from genetically engineered
bacteria and aimed at the body's most vulnerable organs is being
developed at the research institute headed by famed virologist
Robert Gallo, scientists announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gallo himself cautioned that the vaccine is still
untested in humans, Dr. Francis Omaswa, Uganda's health services
director, said plans are already set for the first clinical trials.
The trials, to be conducted on volunteers in the East African
nation of 21 million people, could begin within 18 months, Omaswa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda is the one African nation to aggressively implement a
significant range of AIDS prevention services, Omaswa said, but 1.5
million people there are now infected by the AIDS virus, and more
than a million children have already been orphaned by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallo team's AIDS vaccine is the first designed as a pill to
be taken orally; other AIDS vaccines are in liquid form and must be
administered by injection. The pills would be inexpensive to
manufacture and easy to distribute widely and administer safely by
community health care workers, who would need little or no medical
training, Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's leading AIDS researcher
who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, said in a telephone interview Friday that the vaccine
developed by Gallo's team is ``theoretically the right approach.''
But, like Gallo, he warned, ``We've been fooled so many times about
new vaccines that I've hesitated to talk about this one until now,
but I really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Development of the vaccine at Gallo's Institute of Human
Virology at the University of Maryland is being supported by a
4-year-old activist organization called the International AIDS
Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative _ which is largely funded by the Rockefeller
Foundation, the William Gates Foundation and United Nations
agencies _ engages in what it calls ``social venture capitalism.''
Money is funneled to those researchers who guarantee that their
vaccines, if successful, will be produced cheaply and be readily
available to poverty-ridden Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although many drug companies have developed possible AIDS
vaccines, neither they nor federal agencies have earmarked a
significant part of their research money for the vaccine effort.
None has focused on an oral vaccine, and only one of the other 28
AIDS vaccines that have been clinically tested in the U.S. and
around the world has as yet  &LR; shown any real promise.
</P>
<P>
   That single promising vaccine, called AIDSVAX, must be
administered by injection, and is now in the final phase of human
testing in Thailand and in several American cities. It is made by
VaxGen, a Brisbane biotechnology firm whose scientists began
developing it more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is aware that what we desperately need is a
preventive vaccine,'' Gallo said in a telephone interview. ``And
while I'm not expecting this one to be a home run with the bases
loaded, it does look very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Lewis, vaccine research director at Gallo's
institute, said it has taken six years to develop the oral AIDS
vaccine, but now, he said, ``we want to make sure it moves into the
field as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the vaccine, the researchers have used the salmonella
bacterium. It is a common cause of food poisoning in industrialized
countries and the source of deadly typhoid fever in developing
nations where poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists remove one segment of genes from the salmonella
microbe so that it can no longer cause disease, then insert an
incomplete set of genetic material from HIV, the AIDS virus, into
the bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called DNA vaccine in pill form would then pass through
the intestinal tract and reach particularly vulnerable targets,
among them the rectum and the vagina, where moist mucus tissues are
a fertile breeding ground for HIV to replicate. The viral material
in the vaccine would then trigger what is called mucosal immunity,
as opposed to the cellular immunity that most other AIDS vaccines
are designed to induce.
</P>
<P>
   The new oral vaccine should cost less than $1 per dose,
according to the leaders of the AIDS Vaccine Initiative, which has
committed at least $3 million over the next three years for the
testing program in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Since the onset of the global AIDS epidemic, scientists have
watched as the virus continues to mutate. Today there are many
different strains in different regions of the world. As a result,
Gallo said, the Uganda vaccine _ if it proves effective _ would
only prevent the HIV strains prevalent in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But if the vaccine is useful there, then segments of other HIV
genes from other parts of Africa _ or from India and Southeast Asia
as well _ could be readily spliced into the salmonella microbes to
target populations in those regions, Gallo said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Vaccine Initiative was created in 1996 by a
group of AIDS activists and researchers angry at the slow pace of
vaccine development. They have since formed partnership agreements
with university researchers and health services in several European
and African countries.

TV TIPS HELP GIRL SAVE LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Who says TV is bad for your health?
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year-old Francesca Valencia learned the Heimlich maneuver
from a cartoon show, just in time to save a friend who was choking
on a jawbreaker that got stuck in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so grateful for that show being on,'' the hero's mother,
Elena Valencia, said Friday. ``I don't think my child would have
known about that had she not seen it on TV. I can appreciate the
fact that there are good programs out there that teach the children
as well as entertain them.''
</P>
<P>
   It all happened Monday when a group of kids were playing
handball and sucking on jawbreakers in front of Jessenia Lopez's
home. A piece of the hard candy suddenly slipped down the child's
throat. The Fremont Elementary School third-grader couldn't talk,
couldn't breathe - and thought she was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   As several girls ran for help, Francesca remained calm and
thought back to a cartoon on which a character did the Heimlich
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Six quick pumps of Jessenia's abdomen forced a gnarled
jawbreaker out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for her, I'd probably be dead,'' Jessenia said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mom also hailed the third-grader as a hero for the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no other words to say but: It's amazing,'' said
Jessenia's mother, Yvette Lopez, 34. ``We praised Francesca, and
wonder how she was able to stay there and not panic. We ran out
there, and we didn't know what we were going to do. She's
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters gave Francesca an atta-girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite amazing,'' said Los Angeles Fire Department
spokesman Bob Collis. ``It's unusual for someone that young to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Francesca brushes aside the praise, and instead casually walks
through her grace-under-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing on the corner, and she started choking, and I
ran up behind her, grabbed her, and did Heimlich on her,'' said
Francesca, who herself is barred from sucking on jawbreakers due to
a filling.
</P>
<P>
   She learned the Heimlich from an episode of the television
cartoon ``Hey Arnold,'' in which a character with all the bad luck
gets a hot dog stuck in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   In the cartoon, a friend reads about the Heimlich maneuver - Dr.
H.J. Heimlich's emergency technique involving short thrusts against
the abdomen just below the rib cage, forcing air up the windpipe to
dislodge an object stuck in the throat - and helps his friend. It
may have been funny in the cartoon when the hot dog shot out of the
character's mouth, but for Francesca, the horrific event was all
too real. Afterward, she thanked her guardian angel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that maybe if it doesn't work, she's not going
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessenia, too, is shaken by the incident. She vowed never to
suck on jawbreakers again, and thanked her friend for saving her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that she saved me, and that she was there, and that
she thought of it,'' Jessenia said.
</P>
<P>
   Mom, meanwhile, realizes that maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to get jawbreakers just before the kids went out to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was against my better judgment,'' she said. ``But all the
kids wanted them, and I go and get change, and I gave quarters to
all the kids. Then 10 minutes later, she's choking on a jawbreaker
at home. We were so shocked.''

   WASHINGTON _ Concluding that companies on the Internet have not
properly protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade
Commission has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose
tough consumer-privacy safeguards, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an unannounced vote taken on Friday, the commission approved
a staff recommendation to seek legislation giving the agency such
authority. The action followed a recently completed survey by the
commission that found that only about 20 percent of major companies
on the Internet had adequate standards for protecting the privacy
of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision comes as the agency has stepped up its
investigation of several major Internet companies over their use of
consumer data. It marks a sharp departure from the agency's
previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to
police itself.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sought by the commission would permit it to
regulate the kinds of notice given to consumers about use of
information about them, as well as whether consumers can block that
use. It would allow the commission to establish rules for keeping
the information secure from third parties. And it would authorize
the commission to penalize companies that violate privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials are preparing to brief members of Congress
about the proposal on Monday. The commissioners are also planning
to testify about the proposal at a hearing before the Senate
Commerce Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate who have been
the most vocal advocates for privacy legislation said this week
that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were
not strong, since the Republicans have largely sided with industry
and there are not enough legislative days remaining to pass a major
new measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the chances are virtually nil,'' said Rep. Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass, whose own privacy bill has stalled. ``The
Republican leadership is committed to not doing privacy this year
in any area.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless a group of nine Democratic senators led by Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., and John D. Rockefeller 4th, D-W.Va., are
preparing to introduce a measure next week that is similar to what
the commission has sought. The legislation also contains some
measures that appeal to Internet companies, most notably a
provision that pre-empts all state law on Internet privacy issues.
Industry executives have long sought the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, privacy concerns represent the only remaining
obstacle impeding consumers' full embrace of the Internet's ample
commercial opportunities,'' Hollings said on Friday. ``Advances in
technology have provided information gatherers the tools to
seamlessly compile and enhance highly detailed personal histories
of Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' he added, ``industry has to this point nearly
unanimously opposed even a basic regulatory framework that would
ensure the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet _ a basic
framework that has been successfully adopted in other areas of our
economy. My bill gives customers, not companies, control over their
personal information on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A report accompanying the commission's proposal for legislation
found that the industry had made significant progress in policing
itself, but not enough. Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the trade
commission, has said recently that there is a big role for
companies to monitor themselves, but that as the market develops,
there may also be a need for government to play a role as well.
Pitofsky has recently told oth- ers at the agency that while
self-regulation is a crucial element of protecting privacy rights,
he had also come to believe that the marketplace had developed
sufficiently to seek new authority to give the government tools to
prosecute those companies that do not police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups say any effort to give the commission new
rule-making authority would mark an unwarranted incursion by the
government into regulating cyberspace and could discourage the
development of many start-up Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this industry is the basis for a tremendous
economic boom, most of these companies in fact aren't making money
right now,'' said a top lobbyist for a major Internet and
entertainment company. ``To throw up new barriers that will make it
even more difficult to make money just doesn't make sense right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Varney, a former member of the trade commission who
now represents an industry group, said the agency already had
significant authority to crack down on companies that violated the
privacy interests of consumers by engaging in deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they already have authority and they have exercised
it,'' said Varney, an adviser to the Online Privacy Alliance, a
group of about 100 companies and associations interested in
Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates say the agency's track record is
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the privacy gap between the safeguards
in place and the intrusions seems to be growing not narrowing, and
that has as much as anything to do with the lack of enforcement at
the FTC,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a research organization that studies privacy
issues and technology. ``There is little indication that
self-regulation is working.''

FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS '81 `WONDERLAND' MURDER SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having twice escaped a murder conviction, the lead
character in one of Hollywood's seediest stories was indicted and
arrested Friday on federal racketeering charges linked to the
``Wonderland Murders'' 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury handed up a 16-count indictment against
former nightclub owner Eddie Nash of Tarzana, alleging he has led
an organized drug-peddling ring for 25 years and orchestrated four
brutal deaths at a Wonderland Avenue drug house in Laurel Canyon in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, now 71, was arrested about noon Friday at his home and is
being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown. A bond
hearing is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He faces life in federal prison if convicted on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is particularly spectacular, and particularly
notorious,'' said LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish. ``It is an interesting
case, a notorious crime, with notorious criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In two trials, prosecutors alleged that Nash, whose real name is
Adel Gharib Nasrallah, ordered the Wonderland murders in
retaliation for stealing drugs from him. A scene in the 1997 film
``Boogie Nights'' in which a porn star played by Mark Walhberg
steals drugs from a dealer is said to have been based on the theft
from Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury; Nash was acquitted
in the second. The indictment alleges that Nash bribed a juror and
one of the witnesses in the first trial, forcing a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's co-defendants in the Wonderland murders - former porn
star John Holmes, who died of AIDS in 1988, and Nash's bodyguard
Gregory Diles, who died in 1995 - also were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Nash did not return messages Friday afternoon. But
in a televised interview earlier this month, Nash told KNBC-TV
anchor Paul Moyer he never ordered the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is what I've said for the last 20 years: I
really did not kill anyone or have anything to do with the killing
of those people on Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that Nash, a convicted cocaine
trafficker, has been buying, transporting and selling large
quantities of heroin, cocaine and marijuana at Hollywood
nightclubs, his Tarzana home, and a North Hollywood auto body shop
since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges Nash with conspiring to defraud the
United States, wire fraud and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Nash and his associates, in order to protect the members of the
organization and the profits, engaged in murder, violence, threats
of violence, intimidation, bribes and money laundering, the
indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly accusing him of the 1981 murders, the
indictment says Nash conspired with Diles and Holmes to commit the
heinous slayings of Ronald Launius, 37; William DeVerell, 42;
DeVerell's girlfriend, Joy Audrey Miller, 46; and Barbara
Richardson, 22.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his 1990 acquittal, he cannot be tried again for the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Larson, who is prosecuting the
racketeering case, is confident about the case, yet cautious due to
Nash's long history and the case's complexities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex indictment that addresses a long series of
criminal activities by an individual who definitely left his mark
on L.A.,'' Larson said. ``In a 20-year period, he was involved in a
major narcotics conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash's arrest culminates a four-year investigation by the
Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigation Division, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of
Justice, and the LAPD's organized crime and vice units.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Alejandro
N. Mayorkas said, ``We believe that the dedication and persistence
of law enforcement has built a case against an individual who is
alleged to have participated in a series of crimes that warrant the
most aggressive prosecution in federal court.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's indictment also alleges that Nash planned an elaborate
fraud and money laundering scheme between August 1994 and November
1995 in which he designed a system to launder criminal proceeds
generated by associates of the enterprise and disguised ownership
of property owned by a member of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also names five associates. One man, Hovsep
Mikaelian, aka Joe McLean, 49, of North Hollywood, is alleged to be
one of Nash's closest allies.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in May 1997 of narcotics trafficking, excise
tax evasion, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, and
telecommunications fraud. He was sentenced in November 1999 to 14
years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mikaelian's brother, Hrant, 45, also of North Hollywood, is
alleged to have been involved in the enterprise's narcotics
trafficking efforts and wire fraud and money laundering schemes. He
pleaded guilty in May 1999 to involvement in an unrelated
international money laundering conspiracy and is set to be
sentenced later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Diramarian, 58, of Pasadena, is an accountant who is
alleged to have worked for Nash and the Mikaelians. He pleaded
guilty in February 1999 for his involvement in an unrelated
$600,000 tax evasion scheme and is set to be sentenced later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment was a relief for LAPD Chief Bernard C.
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of all of the investigative teamwork that went
into this very serious and complex case,'' he said in a statement.
``I have great confidence in the United States Attorney's Office to
vigorously pursue this prosecution.''

TAIWAN'S NEW LEADER ENDS DECADES OF NATIONALIST PARTY RULE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Chen Shui-bian was sworn in as president of
Taiwan on Saturday morning, a landmark for Taiwan's democracy but
the start of a risky period in relations between this prospering
island of 23 million people and a strengthening Chinese mainland
that claims Taiwan as its own.
</P>
<P>
   With his inauguration Saturday, Chen ended 50 years of rule _
much of it under martial law _ by the Nationalist Party that fled
from the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has
long advocated Taiwan's independence from China, Chen won a
three-way race in March, in the island's second election of a
national leader.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds Lee Teng-hui, 77, the flamboyant Nationalist who
became world famous for ushering democracy to Taiwan but whose
recent tenure was increasingly tainted by his party's vote-buying
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first peaceful transition of power from one
political party to another in Taiwanese history and probably in all
of Chinese history,'' said Wu Yu-shan, a political scientist at
National Taiwan University, in words that have not lost their
wonder to Taiwanese even though they have been repeated often since
Chen's victory. ``But this triumph is being overshadowed by the
prospect of deep tension across the Taiwan Straits.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in his first speech as presi- dent, Chen repeated
pledges not to declare independence unless Tai- wan comes under
attack, but he did not give Beijing the commitment to ``one China''
it demands, and serious new tensions seemed likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live freedom and democra- cy,'' he shouted as he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration took place in a brief ceremony inside the
presiden- tial palace a few minutes after 9 a.m. Chen bowed before
a picture of Sun Yat-sen _ who is claimed by both the Taiwanese and
the main- land governments as founding fa- ther _ then pledged to
uphold the Constitution and was handed the na- tional seal.
 &UR;  &LR;  Saturday's ceremony capped the storybook rise of Chen, 49, whose
intelligence and preternatural determination took him from
mud-house poverty to success as a corporate attorney before he
became involved, in 1979, in the dissident movement against the
Nationalists' authoritarian rule. He became a star of the
opposition after his election as mayor of Taipei in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Lu, 55, was sworn in as vice president. She is an
outspoken feminist and advocate of Taiwan independence with a law
degree from Harvard who spent more than five years in Nationalist
prisons in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Chen called for Taiwan's formal independence
from the mainland _ a step that Beijing has repeatedly said would
bring a military attack. Seeking to broaden his appeal among the
worried electorate and to placate the United States, which is
pledged to help defend Taiwan but does not want to be drawn into
war, Chen has moderated his position, though not enough to mollify
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen now says that since Taiwan already functions like a state
it does not need to declare independence. He has held out olive
branches to Beijing, proposing to talk about strengthened commerce
and even about the meaning of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing officials have expressed growing impatience with Chen's
refusal to accept their absolute precondition for any talks _ that
Taiwan is part of a single China.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Communist Party's flagship paper,
People's Daily, said that Chen has ``adopted an evasive and defiant
posture'' over the one-China principle and that his friendly
gestures ``lack sincerity.'' It reminded him that ``matters of
sovereignty are not for negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, China has warned that indefinite delay in
progress toward unity may be grounds for military action.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chen's long-anticipated inau- gural speech Saturday was almost
an anticlimax, devoted mainly to calls for domestic reconciliation,
cleaner politics and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the most scrutinized portion, on cross-straits ties, Chen
offered good will and pledged not to take formal steps toward
independence. As long as the mainland does not use military force
against Taiwan, he said, ``I pledge that during my term in office,
I will not declare independ- ence.''
</P>
<P>
   He made one cryptic reference to ``jointly'' dealing ``with the
question of a future `one China,''' which fell far short of the
kind of commitment Beijing has sought.
</P>
<P>
   The international turnout for Saturday's ceremony provided a
stark re- minder of China's relative power and its campaign to
isolate Taiwan diplo- matically. Listed as attending were only four
heads of state _ from Swaziland, Nicaragua, Palau and Nauru _
countries drawn from few- er than 30 states that have dared to
recognize Taiwan in return for its financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Representing President Clinton was Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a
former White House adviser. Although the United States sells
defensive weapons to Taiwan and has strong economic ties, senior
U.S. officials do not visit, because the United States, by
agreement with Beijing, does not grant formal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political status and relations with Beijing are always
central issues here. But Chen's strongest mandate from the
election, analysts say, was in domestic affairs, especially to
start cleaning up corruption in politics, including growing ties
between local Nationalist politicians and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   As he takes on these and other issues, Chen will be operating in
what for Taiwan is the novel territory of a divided government.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chen received less than a majority of votes in the election and
faces a legislature dominated by the Nationalists. Experts give him
good marks for cobbling together a multiparty cabinet that may
blunt some opposition. But many still wonder whether he can govern
with any force in a jumbled system of presidential and
parliamentary institutions that in the past was always controlled
by one disciplined party.
</P>
<P>
   In what many people here regarded as a master stroke, Chen
persuaded the former Nationalist defense minister and a retired
general, Tang Fei, to serve as prime minister. Tang is one of
several holdovers in the national security field, a deliberate
effort to assure various parties _ China, the United States and the
Taiwanese _ that Chen will not act rashly to incite China.
</P>
<P>
   Tang's powers relative to the president's are not clearly
defined, and he has lately been suffering complications from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet includes a mix of Nationalists, members of Chen's
party and others. But divisive questions have already been raised
within the Nationalist and the Democratic Progressive parties about
the party loyalty of those in the cabinet, and the extent to which
they should follow Chen's lead on issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Lee, the outgoing president, was forced from his job as
Nationalist Party leader, the Nationalists have been in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A new third party, led by James Soong, a former Nationalist, is
struggling to lure supporters from the legislative ranks and define
its role. And the Democratic Progressives have begun squabbling as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new government is going to be somewhat messy and
incoherent,'' said Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson
College in North Carolina who gives Chen high marks under difficult
circumstances. ``Chen is trying to put together a government that
can actually govern, and he had to violate the conventional rules
of party politics.''

DODGERS CLAIM NEEDED LEFTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After three months of looking the Los Angeles Dodgers
found a situational lefty for their bullpen. How long he lasts,
however, is the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The club claimed lefty Trever Miller off waivers from the
Philadelphia Phillies on Friday. He will join the Dodgers when the
club returns to Los Angeles to open a three-game series against
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a guy who can get left-handers out and he's had some
success,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``He should
complement our bullpen. We've been looking for a left-hander since
spring training, really. Hopefully, he's the answer''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will be Miller's fourth major-league team (Phillies,
Houston, Detroit), and he'll try to fill the situational-lefty
void. Lefties are hitting .258 (46 for 178) against Miller in his
four-year career and they were batting .261 (6 for 23) this season.
</P>
<P>
   But during the past three seasons, Miller was slightly better.
Lefties hit .228 with three homers and 19 RBI in 316 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (manager) Davey (Johnson) would use him against some
tough left-handers,'' Malone said. ``We like the guy and we've been
searching hard for one.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 26, was 0-0 with an 8.36 ERA in 14 games for the
Phillies before being placed on waivers and became expendable when
Jeff Brantley was activated. The Dodgers are pinning their hopes on
more consistency from Miller since he didn't allow a run in 10 of
his appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers paid $25,000 to acquire Mille and will pay the
prorated portion of the $280,000 he'll make this season.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Miller on the 40-man roster, the Dodgers
transferred ailing right-handed reliever Gregg Olson from the
15-day to the 60-day disabled list, retroactive to April 9.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller is activated Monday, it's likely lefty Onan Masaoka
will be sent to Triple-A Albuquerque if the Dodgers can't work out
a trade to ease the logjam of right-handers in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has spoken repeatedly with the Cubs about dealing one of
L.A.'s right-handed relievers to Chicago, but so far a match hasn't
been found. Meanwhile, Johnson spoke with Masaoka about better
understanding the type of pitcher the 22-year-old needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to use his legs, come over the top a little more,''
Johnson said. ``I don't want him throwing darts and getting by. I
want him to be the complete pitcher he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Investigation presses on: While the commissioner's office
continued its investigation into Tuesday's fight between the
Dodgers and fans at Wrigley Field, the players' association is
doing its own fact-finding in preparation of appeals to possible,
if not imminent, suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Several representatives from the players' association met with
numerous Dodgers to talk about what they saw during the
altercation. Many baseball and Dodgers officials believe heavy
fines and suspensions are coming for catcher Chad Kreuter and
potentially bullpen coach Rick Dempsey for their roles in the
melee. Many other Dodgers are expected to be fined, and more
suspensions are possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy Alderson (executive vice president of baseball
operations) already has spoken out and made it seem that's he's
going to do that,'' said Phil Bradley, special assistant to the
executive director for the players' association. ``That's all we
can do (is gather facts). You're dealing with (potential) civil
lawsuits from the fans and discipline from the commissioner's
office.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Elster delayed? Because of bad weather, the Dodgers didn't
get to their hotel in Florida until 3 a.m., so they canceled a
simulated game in which shortstop Kevin Elster was supposed to test
his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Elster was to bat against Orel Hershiser, play the field and run
the bases. Instead, he just ran the bases and reported no problem.
The plan is to have Elster participate in the simulated game today
and be activated Sunday. Shortstop Alex Cora is expected to be sent
to Triple-A Albuquerque when Elster's ready.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: Tom Lasorda, Dodgers senior vice president and
U.S. Olympic coach, was in the clubhouse before the game with
former Dodgers executive Ralph Avila, who was suspended from
baseball for one year for his dealings in the underage signing of
Adrian Beltre. Avila is retired, but if he returns to baseball he
must first serve his suspension.

JIROV EMPHATICALLY MAKES HIS CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Vassiliy Jirov believes he's the man who can give
Roy Jones Jr. a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The undefeated cruiserweight from Kazakhstan emphasized his
point once again Friday night at the Playboy Mansion, stopping
Esteban Pizarro with a one-two combination at 2:59 of a scheduled
10-round bout.
</P>
<P>
   Jirov, the IBF titleholder, is 25-0 with 23 knockouts. That's 92
percent knockouts, the highest rate among reigning champions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones, the undisputed light heavyweight champ, is
considering a move past cruiserweight to heavyweight to find a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Jones says there's no one out there to give him a
challenge,'' said Jirov's manager, Ivaylo Gotzev. ``Well, here's
somebody everybody knows, who's undefeated, who's a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones just has a lot of excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Pizarro (21-3-1, nine KOs) wasn't a meaningful gauge. The Puerto
Rican had fought only once in the past three years and was
completely overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Jirov controlled the scheduled 10-round nontitle fight from the
opening bell before putting Pizarro away with a hard left to the
belly and a right to the chin as Pizarro held his aching gut. He
went down and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike most of Jones' opponents, Jirov would seem to
have the proper credentials. He won a gold medal in the 1996
Atlanta Olympics and won the Val Barker Award as the best fighter
in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And, while he too hasn't faced exceptional competition, he
stopped capable Dale Brown and Saul Montana in recent fights and
has plowed through the remainder of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the 175-pound Jones decides he wants to move up only one
weight class, he wouldn't have to face a 200-pound heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   The cruiserweight limit is 190 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come down (in weight) to fight him,'' said Gotzev, whose
fighter walks around at about 192 pounds. ``We'll make 185,
whatever they want. . . . And we'll fight in Pensacola (Fla.,
Jones' hometown). And we'll turn around and knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones probably would be a heavy favorite if the two were to
meet. Most significantly, many believe no one even near Jones'
weight class can cope with his speed. That goes for Jirov, who is
talented but not exceptionally quick. Jirov said he could
compensate for Jones' speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fight for 12 rounds,'' said Jirov, who lives outside
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``You get tired and your speed comes down. My
punches will stop him before the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I punch a lot harder than light heavyweights (against whom
Jones is accustomed to fighting).''
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary fight, Butterbean beat a stringbean.
</P>
<P>
   Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch, all 346 pounds of him, stopped
211-pound stringbean Bill Johnson at 2:49 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   And Mia St. John of Calabasas, the former Playboy cover girl
fighting in her home ring, defeated Fran Alcantar by a unanimous
decision over four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   St. John (17-0, 10 KOs) won every round, but Alcantar (2-3, two
KOs) proved to have a good chin and wouldn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her on tape and she seemed to quit after a few rounds,''
St. John said. ``Tonight, I thought she'd quit, too, but she
didn't. She was tough.''
</P>

DICKSON BACK ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Add Jason Dickson to the growing list of
starting pitchers knocked out of the Anaheim Angels rotation
because of injury. Dickson, who made one start after missing two
weeks with a strained left hip flexor, went back to the disabled
list Friday, retroactive to May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson lasted only 1 innings in his start last Sunday when the
Rangers got him for four runs. Dickson was favoring the still-sore
hip and it affected his mechanics, which is the last thing the
Angels want for a pitcher coming off shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt fine but he wasn't as far along as we hoped,'' manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``We want to err on the side of caution. We
gave it a good amount of time but it wasn't healed. Obviously he
needs more time. He's too valuable a pitcher for us to not step
back and make sure he's 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two starters that were in the rotation at the beginning of
the season are still there now _ Kent Bottenfield and Scott
Schoeneweis. Ken Hill and Dickson are on the DL and Ramon Ortiz is
back in the minors. Also, Kent Mercker, who made two starts, is in
the hospital recovering from a brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strengths of the club throughout the organization
was depth in our starting pitcher, but that's being tested,''
Scioscia said. ``We've still got some good arms in the minor
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hinchliffe was called up from Triple-A Edmonton to take
Dickson's spot on the roster. In order to make room for Hinchliffe
on the 40-man roster, Tim Belcher was transferred from the 15-day
DL to the 60-day DL.
</P>
<P>
   __ More starters: The Angels will need yet another starter
sometime next week, at which point they might go to the minor
leagues for help, but it won't be Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said Brian Cooper and Seth Etherton have been pitching
particularly well, and one of the two likely will be called up to
start either Thursday against Minnesota or next Saturday against
Kansas City. Another possibility is Hinchliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is not an option, Scioscia said, because it would defeat
the purpose of sending him down in the first place. Also, Ortiz
suffered a slightly strained back in his last start for the
Trappers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ortiz needed to work on things, he needs to pitch on a regular
basis to find his command,'' Scioscia said. ''When Ramon has his
command again, he'll force his way into any rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lineup swaps: The Angels have considered flip-flopping No. 3
hitter Mo Vaughn and No. 4 hitter Tim Salmon in the lineup in an
effort to get Salmon's bat going. Salmon is hitting .245, but he's
get better pitches to hit with Vaughn hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible change is flip-flopping No. 5 hitter Garret
Anderson with No. 6 hitter Troy Glaus to get Anderson (.236) going,
but for now Scioscia will keep the lineup as is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel offense is our problem,'' Scioscia said. ``We've
been doing fine without the normal production of Tim and Garret.
We're going to be patient with those guys.''

JONES ENDS YEAR'S DROUGHT AGAINST DIAMONDBACKS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It had been 13 months since Bobby J. Jones' last
victory, and holding runners was not a priority. The New York Mets
right-hander sat out most of last season with a shoulder injury,
and he went down with a calf strain after three forgettable starts
this year. The game plan Friday night was simple: hold runners on
as well as possible, but concentrate on making quality pitches.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones was a bit slower to home plate _ 1.5 seconds, instead
of his usual 1.2, by manager Bobby Valentine's estimation _ and the
Arizona Diamondbacks easily got the first four of their club-record
seven stolen bases while he was pitching Friday night at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the throws from catcher Mike Piazza were far
from accurate. When Tony Womack stole second after leading off the
game with a single, Piazza bounced his throw off the pitcher's
mound. Piazza rolled his shoulders _ he has been bothered by
discomfort in his back since mid-April _ and sounded discouraged
about his throwing afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, none of it mattered. These days, games are won by
homers, not steals, and Piazza's two-run shot in the fifth inning
was the decisive blow in a 4-3 Mets victory. Jones worked six
innings, allowing three runs on six hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy right now _ very, very happy,'' Jones said.
``It's been a long time since I've pitched well, and I also got a
victory out of it. I felt good out there. It's good to know I can
still go out there and get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had command of all four of his pitches, including the
slider he worked on in two rehab starts for Triple-A Norfolk. In
his first three outings, he was throwing too many fastballs, acting
like a power pitcher _ ``That's not going to work for me,'' he said
_ and lacking confidence in his off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He knew things were different in the first inning Friday night,
when he fell behind Steve Finley, 2-0, with runners on first and
second and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't have the confidence or command of all of my
pitches, I've got to go to the fastball there,'' Jones said. ``I
threw a good changeup, he rolled over it and grounded it to
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The inning was over, and although the Diamondbacks would score
twice in the second after stealing three bases, including a double
steal while pitcher Todd Stottlemyre was trying to bunt, Jones was
on his way to a quality performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have good games; I'm going to have games that are
poor,'' said Jones, whose last victory came last April 17. ``But
every time I go out there, if I can take four pitches with me and
keep my team in the game, then good things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza gave Jones the lead with the homer, which he sent down
the left-field line _ the only place a ball could have gotten out
on a night where the wind was blowing straight in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He protected the lead in the seventh, when Womack tried to score
on a double by Jay Bell off Turk Wendell. Jon Nunnally threw to Rey
Ordonez, whose relay bounced several feet up the line. Piazza
pounced on it, recovered and swiped the tag on Womack, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike made one of the best plays I've ever seen,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is working with a new catching coach, John Stearns, but
he has still had trouble throwing out runners. Coming into Friday
night's game, Piazza had thrown out only 4 of 32 runners trying to
steal. (Mets pitchers also have three pickoffs, which count as
caught stealing.) Only Houston's Mitch Meluskey (2 of 23, for 8.7
percent) had a worse percentage among National League catchers than
Piazza's 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza takes pride in his defense, and he admitted he was
``throwing the ball pretty poorly'' Friday night, saying he was
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to just try to stay composed and not feel I can make up
for a good jump,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' final two stolen bases came in the ninth
inning, when Armando Benitez recorded his 10th save. Benitez, whose
velocity has fluctuated greatly at times this season, was throwing
hard, and keeping his pitches below the belt. His last pitch was a
backdoor slider to Womack, who struck out with Lenny Harris on
third to end the game.

ANGELS FIND A WAY

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It was a typical night in Anaheim on Friday,
with another Angels pitcher going to the disabled list and the
offense slamming four home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, though, was the performance by starting pitcher
Jarrod Washburn in the Anaheim Angels' 6-4 victory over the Kansas
City Royals before 26,561 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Dickson was the latest pitcher to land on the disabled
list, making his second trip there because of a strained left hip.
Troy Glaus hit two homers, and Garret Anderson and Tim Salmon each
hit one.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 11th save, but it was
all set up by Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn (1-1) gave up four runs (three earned) in 6 innings. It
was significant because it was the first quality start (six or more
innings, three earned runs or fewer) by a starter other than Kent
Bottenfield since April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Bottenfield, the Angels rotation has been a mess, as
injuries have torn the staff apart. Ken Hill, Kent Mercker and now
Dickson are on the DL. Ramon Ortiz is in the minors trying to find
his command.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a big boost from the bullpen as well Friday.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa retired all five batters he faced, and Percival
got the save despite giving up two hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a 3-0 lead, getting two runs in the second
inning when Anderson tripled and glaus followed with his 12th homer
of the season. Anderson made it 3-0 with a solo homer (No. 9) in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washburn had everything working early, retiring the
first 10 batters he faced before Jeff Reboulet's one-out single in
the fourth inning. Washburn worked his way out of that inning
unscathed, but he wasn't so fortunate in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran led off with a homer and Mark Quinn singled. One
out later, Rey Sanchez singled Quinn to third, and Quinn scored on
Johnny Damon's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez moved second on a walk to Reboulet, then scored on Mark
Sweeney's single to tie the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Washburn was hurt by shortstop Benji Gil's
error. Instead of what should have been a routine double play, Gil
booted Beltran's grounder and the Royals had runners on first and
second with nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn followed with a fly ball into the right-field corner,
where Tim Salmon made the catch. Joe Randa tagged and reached third
on the play, but Beltran slid past the bag trying to go from first
to second and was tagged out for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn, though, yielded a two-out single to Brian Johnson,
scoring Randa for a 4-3 Royals advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals lead lasted only until the bottom of the sixth, when
Salmon followed a single by Vaughn with a home run just inside the
left-field foul pole to give the Angels a 5-4 lead.

HERNANDEZ SET TO CONQUER U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Luis Hernandez is easily distinguished from
the other great soccer players who have worn Mexico's famed green
national team jersey.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is his long, flowing blond hair. Then there is his
trademark headband.
</P>
<P>
   But neither his hair nor his headband explain why Hernandez _
known as ``El Matador'' _ is adored by his countrymen. Simply put,
it's because Hernandez is what you call a Mexican's Mexican. To
him, wearing the red, white and green colors of Mexico is more a
matter of pride than responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He IS Mexican soccer at the moment,'' said Rigoberto
Cervantes, who covers soccer for Los Angeles' most popular
Spanish-language newspaper, La Opinion. ``The media from Mexico
that will follow him here is enormous. Luis is world-known, there
is a lot of pride with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Soccer officials are proud to have landed
Hernandez, who will make his debut for the Los Angeles Galaxy at 6
p.m. tonight at the Rose Bowl against D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was introduced to his new teammates Friday at Staples
Center. Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid was asked if Hernandez would start
tonight. Schmid then turned the question over to Hernandez: ``Are
you ready?'' Schmid asked Hernandez. ``Yes,'' replied Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is familiar with Galaxy players Cobi Jones and Robin
Fraser, who he has competed against during international games. He
even joked about defender Paul Caligiuri taking a few whacks at
him.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked why he's here, and what he hopes to accomplish,
he made it clear why he's making the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accomplished and achieved everything I wanted to in
Mexico,'' Hernandez said. ``As a man I'm looking forward to a new
challenge, to help soccer in the United States and hopefully win a
champions As for the future: ``After a year, I will have options to
play in Europe, but we will take that one step at a time,''
Hernandez said. ``My contract is with the Galaxy and that's where
my concentration is. I'm looking forward to playing with my new
teammates and learning brand of soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez signed a three-year contract with MLS on Tuesday and
was assigned to the Galaxy after the league purchased his contract
Monterrey Tigres for nearly $5 million. MLS forced the Galaxy to
part with three starters. Striker Clint Mathis and midfielder Roy M
to New York/New Jersey and defender Joey Franchino went to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans love Hernandez for the same reason they love fighters
who duke it out: He has the same grit. The 31-year-old striker ear
Hernandez is only 5-foot-7 and 160 pounds, but he's Mexico's
heavyweight, its biggest star. He's tireless, demands attention and
has what you call a striker's nose for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch his playing style, he's not someone who stands
around and waits for the ball,'' Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said.
``He's not the kind who says: `Hey, I'm here, you have to play the
ball to me.' He's the kind of player who's busy, active and rolls
up his sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   League and Galaxy officials are hoping Hernandez can be the
franchise player that will lead the team to an MLS championship,
something no other foreign star has done. The Galaxy has made two
appearances in the championship match, but lost to D.C. United both
times, in 1996 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's credentials are impressive. He won two Mexican
League championships with Necaxa (1994-95, 1995-96), a CONCACAF
Champions Cup title with Monterrey (1992-93) and was named the
Mexican Player of the Year in 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   He made a global impact in the 1998 World Cup in France, proving
he could score in clutch situations. He tallied four of Mexico's
eight goals in the tournament, and scored in injury time to help
Mexico tie Holland, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   His four goals earned him a tie for fourth place among the World
Cup scoring leaders with Brazil's Ronaldo and Chile's Marcelo
Salas.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is different from all the other Mexican players who
have ventured to Major League Soccer. Two of the most well known,
Jorge Campos and Carlos Hermosillo, previously played for the
Galaxy. Other notable Mexican players, Damien Alvarez, Hugo Sanchez
and Francisco Uribe, have played with Dallas (Alvarez and Sanchez)
and San Jose (Uribe).
</P>
<P>
   Campos arrived in his prime in 1996. He was flashy, personable
and had some great games, but he was a goalkeeper, not a scorer.
Campos was traded to Chicago after the 1997 season, never beat out
Fire keeper Zach Thornton, so he bolted to Mexico during the 1998
playoffs, missing out when Chicago won the MLS title.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo arrived in Los Angeles in 1998, but the speed in the
MLS overwhelmed him. He never fit in with the Galaxy, but he
managed 14 goals and 15 assists in 34 games. He left MLS to join
Club America of Mexico after the Galaxy's 2-0 title loss to D.C.
United this past November.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, big-name Mexicans have played in the United States, but
they haven't taken over MLS the way Marco Etcheverry (Bolivia),
Carlos Valderrama (Colombia) or Jaime Moreno (Bolivia) have.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadoran striker Eduardo Hurtado helped lead the Galaxy to the
1996 MLS title match, but he disappointed in 1997 and was
subsequently sent to New York/New Jersey. Thursday, New England
sold his rights to an Ecuadoran team.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez is different than all of them. He's MLS' biggest
foreign allocation and Mexico's biggest name.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, who met Hernandez for the first time Friday, says it's
not a question of will he or won't he work out. Schmid said
Hernandez is without peer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare Luis to some of the other Mexican players
that have come here, I don't think you can,'' said Schmid.
``There's never been a Mexican player of the quality of Luis
Hernandez in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Hernandez having a major impact on this team and a major
impact in this league. He's not a player who's not going to live up
to his promise. He's going to live up to it and exceed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez draws comparisons to other legendary soccer players
who previously played in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, Northern Ireland's George Best, who earned
fame with England's Manchester United, played for the Los Angeles
Aztecs of the North American Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs also landed Johan Cruyff, a member of Holland's famed
``Clockwork Orange'' national team. Cruyff came to Los Angeles
after a brilliant career with Ajax of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think us getting Hernandez is bigger than those two,'' said
Schmid. ``Cruyff was a name and recognition and so was Best, b
we're dealing with the biggest ethnic population in Southern
California, which are the Mexican-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Luis Hernandez, that's a much bigger
impression for them than a Best or Cruyff. Plus, you have to
remember back in the days of Best and Cruyff, there wasn't Internet
or satellite television, so it was difficult for people in the U.S.
to see Best or Cruyff play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there's nobody who doesn't follow soccer in the U.S.,
whether they're American, Mexican, Iranian, English or whatever,
that hasn't seen Luis Hernandez play. And those who have seen him
play appreciate his style because he's very industrious.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid believes Hernandez's skills and work ethic can only lead
to success for the Galaxy. Galaxy fans and all of Mexico will be
watching to see how he works out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some bumps along the road as we move forward
and until the timing and coordination gets down, but I'm very
confident it will work out,'' said Schmid. ``For it to work out is
just a matter of our attitude as a team and our attitude as a
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a matter of Luis' attitude, and everything I've heard
about Luis is he's a great person. And if his playing style is
anything like his personality, there won't be any problems.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN ODD YEAR YIELDS STRANGE FRUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the wee hours of a new day, a large throng milled
around the stands at Madison Square Garden, trying to get a peek at
the hero of Game 6, maybe even give a cheer. Patrick Ewing does not
get many ovations these days. But now, in the joy of the moment,
after the New York Knicks' 37-year-old center had so clearly been
the one to keep the Knicks' season from expiring, there were all
these Knicks fans who felt they had to linger and watch Ewing being
interviewed on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing sparked one of the more incredible comebacks in Knicks
playoff history Friday night. He refused to let the Knicks truly
hit bottom in the first half, when they trailed by as many as 18
points, and then he carried them to a 72-70 victory in the second.
And now, for the fourth time in four years, the Knicks are headed
to Miami for another deciding game against the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that I'm glad we won this game and we're
playing Game 7,'' Ewing said, after he had willed the Knicks to
survive. ``Anything can happen in Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no chants of ``Patrick! Patrick!'' as Ewing left the
floor at the end of Friday night's game. He's been around too long,
crossed too many bridges, for that type of giddy show of
appreciation. There was even that bittersweet mixture of groans and
cheers in the first half whenever he touched the ball. Although _
and this happens a lot with Ewing _ when the fans realized that
Ewing was the only Knick who wasn't waving the white flag in the
first two quarters, he drew a salute of respectful cheers and
applause whenever he came out the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ewing played 42 minutes Friday night, more than any
other player on either team except Latrell Sprewell. He scored 15
points, he grabbed 18 rebounds. More than any other Knick, he kept
his team alive. ``Jeff really didn't say too much at halftime,''
Ewing said, looking back to a moment when the Knicks were trailing
by 15. ``The guys just came together and said: `Look, we're not
ready to go on vacation. We have another half to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, halftime was one final chance
to exhort his players, to underline the message he had preached to
them 10 hours before as they went through a morning shoot-around.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy sat on a table after the shoot-around, talking to
reporters and trying to be positive with his team one defeat from
elimination. Someone asked him about the Knicks' backs being
against the wall; someone else about the Knicks' sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy was in no mood for cliches. ``I'm cliched out,''
he said. ``Forget desperate, urgent, us against them. We can make
it a cliche thing or we can make it a rebounding thing. What we
need to do is win one home game to get to the ultimate game.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything between these teams has seemed to rest on the slender
thread of a single shot. Allan Houston's last-second shot against
the Heat last May, Tim Hardaway's last-second miracle shot against
the Knicks last month, Anthony Carter's last-second miracle shot
against the Knicks in Game 3's overtime. And perhaps a last-second
shot Sunday, in Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   What was on Van Gundy's mind Friday morning weren't any of those
shots, but the recurring problems that underlined a lack of will,
not luck, on the part of the Knicks: a block-out problem on P.J.
Brown, a toughness problem going after loose balls, a team
rebounding problem.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy related how just an hour before he had addressed his
players and turned preacher. ``We need some people to set the
proper tone,'' Van Gundy said, his voice rising, as he recounted
what he told his team. ``This is how you rebound to win a big game.
This is how you guard to win a big game. This is how you pass to
win a big game. It starts with our starting lineup. Some guys have
been setting a good tone, some other guys in critical areas have
not been setting the tone we need. We're either going to do it
tonight, or we're going to be talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Van Gundy said, he put a pointed question to his
players. He wondered who, in their heart of hearts, really wanted a
Game 7 Sunday. ``Do you want the pressure of going back down there
for another ultimate game?'' Van Gundy asked. ``If you do, it will
be reflected in how we play tonight. If you sort of want to slide
off into vacation, that will also be reflected in how we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, more than any other Knick, answered Van Gundy's question.
He wanted a Game 7, and now he has it. And if Ewing has his way,
Van Gundy will be exhorting his team in next week's shoot-arounds
in the conference finals.

AVENGERS CONTINUE LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just in case anyone needed a reminder that this is
not the NFL, Avengers quarterback Todd Marinovich found out a new
drawback to playing in the Arena Football League on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   While running out to the field, Marinovich was hit in the eye by
a piece of debris from the pregame fireworks display at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see until the second half,'' Marinovich said.
``That was (difficult). They just have to quit those fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was just the latest woe to strike the hapless
Avengers, who lost to the Houston ThunderBears 51-36 before 10,781.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers (0-6) are still far from having to worry about
setting a league record for futility. The now-defunct Memphis
franchise lost 14 games to start the 1996 season, so they are quite
a ways off from worrying about that mark.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they have much to be proud of six weeks
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid mistakes. Turnovers. Stupid penalties,'' Avengers coach
Stan Brock said. ``We have different people but it's the same
story. We just have to keep working on things. That's all we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was rough night for Marinovich all around. Although he
completed 21 of 35 passes for 235 yards, he threw only two
touchdown passes with two interceptions. He also had at least four
passes dropped by Houston cornerbacks that easily could have been
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   His final interception was the costliest. Marinovich threw the
ball right into the hands of Houston's Ed Howard with 2:05 left
that ended any chance of an Avengers comeback. On the next play,
Hall found Ben Bronsonon a 18-yard touchdown pass to put the game
away, giving Houston a 45-29 lead with 1:51 left.
</P>
<P>
   Hall finished 23 for 35 for 228 yards and six touchdowns with no
interceptions. The real star, though, might have been Houston's
defense, considering it was giving up 58 points per game and
allowed 73 last week in aloss to Iowa. Or maybe it was just the
ineptness of the Avengers' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Another season-long weak spot _ the secondary _ continued to be
a nemesis. Houston wide receiver Bronson caught 12 passes for 164
yards and three touchdowns. The Avengers also continued to have
penalty problems, with 11 for 57 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A final lingering problem was the kicking game, as kicker Kyle
Pooler had an extra point blocked because of a bad snap, and a
50-yard field goal blocked as the first half ended.
</P>
<P>
   Pooler also missed a critical extra point in the fourth quarter
after the Avengers scored a touchdown to cut Houston's lead to
35-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a protection problem (with our kicks),'' Brock
said. ``There's no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first half was close, but the Avengers were burned late. The
ThunderBears made a huge play with 44 seconds left in the half, as
Hall hit Bronson on a 33-yard touchdown pass that gave Houston a
28-16 halftime advantage. Bronson had a big first-half, with eight
receptions for 95 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Former USC wide receiver Travis Hannah made his debut,
and caught five passes for 41 yards. Another newly signed player,
wide receiver Shannon Culver, caught four passes for 33 yards.

RED SOX BLANK TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Stanley swears his calendar was off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sure when I left for the ballpark it was May 19th,''
said the Red Sox first baseman. ``But when I got to the ballpark,
it was April 19th.''
</P>
<P>
   A raw, brutal wind from the East dropped the temperature to the
40s, the wind chill to the 30s, and reduced driven baseballs to
cans of corn Friday night at Fenway Park, but the weather couldn't
chill Boston's white-hot pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was wrong, but the calendar was right. Red Sox
pitchers have been nearly invincible in May, and Friday night Jeff
Fassero (5-1) featured a marvelous split-finger pitch in hurling
seven scoreless innings as the first-place Red Sox whitewashed the
Tigers, 3-0, at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout (with one helpful relief inning each from Rich
Garces and Derek Lowe) was the second consecutive by the Boston
staff and its third in the last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   And last Monday in Toronto, Pete Schourek only gave up an
unearned run in an 8-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing in, so make 'em try to hit it over the
triangle,'' said catcher Jason Varitek of his pitch-calling in the
breezy conditions. ``Maybe a guy hits a fastball away well, but
he's really got to `tater' it to hit it out to right-center. So you
say, `Hey, try to hit it out over the triangle right now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, for one, was sure no ball could be hit out against
the headwind when he smashed a ball in the fourth inning off
Detroit starter Brian Moehler (1-2) that seemed destined to clear
the bullpens. But right fielder Juan Gonzalez backed to the wall
and patiently waited for the wind to knock down Everett's drive
before hauling it in.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams, as usual, had an interesting take
on Everett's drive. The wind, yes, ``but they have a tall right
fielder, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had all of it,'' said Everett. ``But it was high
and the wind was able to get to it. Plus Gonzo (Gonzalez) is out
there with those long arms of his. If it's (Luis) Polonia out
there, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now fast-forward two innings to the sixth. The game is still a
tidy 0-0. The inning began with an unusual ``4-5'' scorebook
notation when Tigers second baseman Jose Macias made a quick,
heady, and daring decision on a hard grounder by Trot Nixon with
none out and Donnie Sadler on second.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all second basemen would have routinely thrown to
first on the play, especially with a runner as quick as Sadler, but
Macias fired to third baseman Dean Palmer to nail the sliding
Sadler. ``The kid made a heck of a play,'' said Williams.
``Especially with Sadler the runner. You don't see many second
basemen do that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nixon on first and one out, Brian Daubach struck out. That
brought up Everett, the wind still gusting straight into his face.
This time, though, on a 3-2 pitch from Moehler, Everett lashed a
screamer that even the wind couldn't prevent from clearing the
Detroit bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I hit the second one harder than the first one,'' said
Everett of his 13th homer. ``And I hit it lower, so the wind
couldn't do as much with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who also made a dazzling snag of a Bobby Higginson
smash at first base, closed out the scoring by hitting a low laser
into the screen in left-center to lead off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Red Sox pitching that deserved most of the
accolades. Friday night's shutout _ the team's first at Fenway this
season _ was Boston's sixth of the season and continued one of the
more remarkable streaks of pitching in recent years. The Boston
staff has now allowed one earned run or fewer in six of its last
seven games, going 6-1 with a 1.30 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching has just been tremendous,'' said Stanley. ``What
a great feeling it is as a hitter and defensive player to know that
your pitching staff is doing that well and you just have to scratch
and crawl and try to get a few runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, the Red Sox' team ERA is down to an outstanding 3.28,
the best in the majors, and nearly three-quarters of a run lower
than the second-best staff in the league, the Yankees. And Fassero,
a reclamation project six weeks ago, now has equaled his win total
from last season, when he struggled to a 5-14 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep feeding off each other,'' said Fassero of the
staff-wide success, ``and that's a big plus for us.''

KNICKS FORCE GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years, four elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetics be damned. The Knicks and the Heat don't care what
you, your Aunt Tillie, and Shaquille O'Neal think about the way
they play basketball. Laugh at their combined shooting percentages
(35 percent Friday night) all you want. They say it's sticky D and
heart and all that intangible stuff that makes their rivalry the
best current thing in American team sport.
</P>
<P>
   So we will be going to a Game 7, as if anyone expected
otherwise. The New York Knicks created Sunday's confrontation by
scoring the final 6 points of the game to give themselves a 72-70
victory over the Miami Heat at Madison Square Garden Friday night,
and so what if they only led for a total of 3 minutes 34 seconds?
They led when the final buzzer sounded, which is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Majerle stuck out his knee after being beaten by Allan
Houston in a high pick-and-roll situation with 17.6 seconds to go,
and Houston drilled a pair of free throws that held up as the
winning points when Anthony Carter, taking an inside-out feed from
Alonzo Mourning, missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Mourning had to
pass. Jeff Van Gundy had sent everyone but the Harlem Boys Choir at
the Miami center once he caught the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   New York got a huge effort from Patrick Ewing, who had 15 points
and 18 rebounds, the last of which was a vicious follow-up dunk of
a Chris Childs miss that pulled his team within 2 at 70-68 with
1:57 to go. ``Patrick was terrific tonight,'' said Van Gundy. ``I'm
always happy for him when he's successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks can also thank Houston (21) and Latrell Sprewell,
whose 15 points and nine rebounds don't indicate his third-quarter
heroics. New York entered the second half trailing by 15 (45-30)
after playing a horrid first half. It was Sprewell's all-around
energy at both ends that dragged his team back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of this rivalry, which enters playoff Chapter
24 Sunday, that one team will go through long periods in which it
needs a basketball cleric to come in to administer some sort of
last rites. New York had such a stretch in the second period,
making zero field goals in the final 5:56. Miami reciprocated in
the second half, scoring 9 points in one stretch of 10:20.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat were still in control, leading by 6 (66-60) with
4:28 left on a 3-pointer by Bruce Bowen and still leading by 4
(70-66) with 2:20 remaining on a second consecutive open jumper by
Carter, the happy beneficiary of New York's relentless inside
double-teaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the game, I thought, sort of in our hands,'' said Pat
Riley. ``We were up 6 and from there it went right downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley won't enjoy looking at the final two minutes. He'll wonder
how Ewing could outmaneuver Mourning (22 points, 10 rebounds) for
that big follow-up dunk, and he'll wonder what exactly was going
through seven-year veteran P.J. Brown's head when he rammed into
Childs in the backcourt with his team leading, 70-68. New York
already had the Mo, and Childs promptly tied the game. Things got
worse when Ewing knocked away an entry pass intended for Mourning,
setting up the fateful final possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolute madness,'' said Riley. ``Have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami was feeling pretty good about itself when a run of 11-0
put them up by a 43-25 score with 2:02 left in the half. The Knicks
were en route to a 27 percent (11-40) shooting half that also
featured a flagrant foul and a lane violation.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, for one, wasn't cocky. ``I didn't feel comfortable
with a 15-point lead,'' he declared. ``We knew they'd make a rush,
and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   A rush is one thing, but a 25-point second half when you're
trying to close out a series is another, and thus Miami slinks back
home to play New York on its own floor in an elimination game for a
third straight year. They lost the last two, but this time it's
going to be played in a new building, so perhaps they assume the
karma will be different.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, New York and Miami are going as far as you can go. We'll
get back to you when we have some new news.

HENDERSON HELPS MARINERS RALLY FOR FOUTH CONSECUTIVE WIN

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Rickey Henderson era in Seattle started a day
early.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson arrived just before the game Friday night, but he
wasn't in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   He was there for the finishing kick in a dramatic 7-6 Seattle
victory over Tampa Bay, scoring the first of two eighth-inning runs
that carried the Mariners to their fourth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, asked to pinch run after Jay Buhner drew a savvy walk
with the Mariners down a run, replaced Buhner as the crowd of
34,067 gave Henderson a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Even his teammates got a little of that good-time feeling going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey coming into the game like that was very dramatic,''
shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``It was very movie-like. I got
goose bumps when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just for Henderson _ signed as a free agent after
the Mets released him on Tuesday _ trotting out to first base.
Imagine the feeling when Henderson took off on a 2-0 pitch to Stan
Javier. The Mariners were trying to pull off a hit-and-run, and
Javier simply slaughtered the pitch, lining it over center fielder
Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, 41 but still in amazing shape and one of the best
base runners in the game, had to pause near second base to make
sure the ball would fall. Once that was no longer in doubt,
Henderson kicked it in like few players can, scoring standing up
when most players would have slid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited coming in like that,'' Henderson said. ``With
the fans cheering like that, it gives you a special feeling. This
is a good way to start. Everything here feels upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier, who earlier homered to break a 1-1 tie in the second
inning, capped the inning by scoring from third on a Mark McLemore
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Javier and McLemore both figure to see a dropoff in at-bats with
Henderson around, but both veterans turned in games that will keep
them in the Mariners' mix.
</P>
<P>
   Javier scored twice and drove in two runs. McLemore did a nice
impersonation of Henderson in the leadoff role, drawing two walks,
stealing three bases and driving in two runs with a single and the
game-winning fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   And DH Edgar Martinez was crucial to the victory, hammering out
three more hits and driving in two runs, his 10th and 11th RBIs of
the homestand. He's hit in 16 of his past 17 games and has raised
his average more than 100 points to .365.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar gets in a groove like this a lot,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``And when he does, he stays in them for a long time, much
longer than most players.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa, who came into the game in the seventh inning, picked
up the victory and Kazuhiro Sasaki, back in the closer's role for
the first time since giving up game-losing homers in back-to-back
appearances, took over to pitch a 1-2-3 ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to go with who I feel like in the closer's
role,'' Piniella said, making it clear that just by saving one game
Sasaki wasn't back as closer. ``I have confidence in Sasaki,
though, and he did a nice job tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson arrived just in time to suit up for the game. Although
he didn't start, he was a key focal point, even while sitting on
the bench. He comes to a Seattle team already in first place, and
Henderson made it clear he's ready to do what it takes to keep the
Mariners there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to come here and get a chance to play and help
this team,'' Henderson said. ``I thought in the back of my mind
that I'd like to play here, especially when Ken Griffey Jr. was
here, but it didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this team. It has a lot of talent. They've been playing
pretty good ball so far, and they have a nice lineup. The biggest
thing will be going out there and playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson pointed out that he's been in the postseason seven
times, and he hopes to be able to bring that experience to bear as
the Mariners go after their first playoff berth since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can bring experience to some of the younger guys, help them
out,'' Henderson said. ``When a club is motivated to win like this
one, you can help them get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson will get a chance to play every day and lead off,
manager Lou Piniella said. The two men met before the game, by
which time Piniella had decided against having Henderson rush into
action. But for the most part, Henderson will be the first name
Piniella writes down each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll need his rest, too, but he's going to play a lot,''
Piniella said. ``I want him in left and leading off, and that's
what he wants, too. And we'll let him show us what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is cool with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm motivated based on being happy,'' Henderson said. ``What
makes me happy is believing in the guys, believing in the manager
and having them believe in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the game to win, and if I can leave the game on a
winning note, that's what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Henderson is ready to give it up just yet. The deal he
struck with the Mariners includes a club option for the 2001 season
for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   To earn that payday, Henderson will have to prove that he's
worth it and still able to play even at his advanced _ for baseball
_ age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have it,'' Henderson said. ``And I still love the
game.

   Crunching Numbers on the Hustings

<P>
   They sounded at times as if they were running for
actuary-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years from now, the massive baby-boomer generation will
begin drawing benefits,'' declared Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore countered, ``The numbers just don't add
up, and under the Bush plan a serious reduction of our national
debt is simply impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue under discussion by the presumptive Republican and
Democratic nominees for president was a vital one, if not exactly
the sort that stops voters' hearts: how to protect the Social
Security system, which both candidates say is slowly going broke.
Speaking in Southern California, Bush announced a plan for
reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow
workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and
me,'' Bush said. ``He trusts the government to manage our
retirement. I trust individual Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued that Bush's plan misplaces its trust by exposing
workers' retirement money to the mercy of the markets and making it
impossible for the government to pay down the national debt. ``Tens
of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham
Business School,'' Gore said, ``would be placed in a situation
where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also revealed a protective streak with his
own investments. After Bush told reporters that Gore had a lot of
money in stocks, Gore replied that he had not invested in the
markets in 25 years for fear of an appearance of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over money matters came as a New York
Times/CBS News poll showed that most voters are thinking less about
candidates' detailed fiscal calculations than about how nice they
seem. Bush was favored over Gore in the new poll by 47 percent to
39 percent, and although more respondents liked Gore's stands on
the issues, they liked Bush even more as a person.

<P>
   Vermin. There it was in blue and white, highlighted for all the
cyberworld to see. Vermin at Le Bernardin. Vermin, ruthless and
undiscriminating, the great equalizer of the restaurant world.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for restaurants in the nation's toughest
town, as the New York City Department of Health began posting
inspection reports on the World Wide Web. From the humblest Dunkin
Donuts to the extra-chic Le Bernardin, their dirty linen, so to
speak, was on display.
</P>
<P>
   So intense was the interest in the misdeeds of the eating
establishments that the department's Web site was paralyzed within
hours of its opening on Wednesday morning. By the afternoon, the
site was getting 23,000 hits an hour, far more than it could
handle, and by Friday visitors were still being turned away because
of high traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site (http://207.127.96.244/webfood/search.htm)
provides summaries of inspection reports for each of the city's
18,000 restaurants. Some restaurateurs who felt scorched by the
reports complained that the Health Department did not provide
enough information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the staff at Le Bernardin, consistently rated one
of the finest restaurants in the city, bristled at the report of
``vermin or other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation
or service areas. What really happened, said Eric Ripert, the
restaurant's chef, was that an inspector found mice droppings in a
single bag of flour. ``We talked to our purveyor right away and
they changed all the flour,'' he said. ``I don't think we have a
mouse in the house.''

   Giuliani Abandons Campaign For U.S. Senate Seat
</P>
<P>
   What would a week in New York be without at least one jolting
development in the race for U.S. Senate? So it was that on Friday,
four days after Hillary Rodham Clinton was formally designated as
the Democratic candidate at her party's convention in Albany, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the race at a
packed-to-the-rafters news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only real surprise was how long Giuliani took to
make the decision, which came after three weeks in which it was
revealed that he was suffering from prostate cancer, that he had
struck up a close relationship with a woman who wasn't his wife and
that he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover,
after 16 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he needed to devote all his energy to deciding on
a course of treatment and running the city. The Republican Party
quickly turned to the future: at week's end, the most likely
replacement for Giuliani was Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island
Republican.

   Arrests in 1963 Bombing
</P>
<P>
   Justice delayed may not be justice served, but Alabama
prosecutors figure it is better than nothing. A grand jury indicted
Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry for the murder of four
black girls in the 1963 bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in
Birmingham. Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has been tried in the
case, one of the most heinous acts of the civil rights era. He was
convicted in 1977. Blanton and Cherry are both former Ku Klux Klan
members and have been suspects since the 1960s. Prosecutors plan to
use old and newly developed evidence.

   Kosovo Deadline Averted

   The Senate defeated a measure to set a deadline for withdrawing
U.S. ground troops from Kosovo, averting a foreign policy setback
for the Clinton administration. The Senate stripped a provision
from a military spending bill that would have cut off funds for the

approved an extension. The White House said the measure would
undermine the NATO operation in Kosovo.

   Court Rules on Rape Cases

<P>
   Almost from the moment of its passage in 1994, the Violence
Against Women Act was on a collision course with the Supreme
Court's new interest in setting limits on Congress' ability to
bring the federal government into areas of state concern. The crash
finally occurred when the court voted, 5-4, that the act's
provision permitting victims of rape and other crimes ``motivated
by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal court was
unconstitutional. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the law's chief Senate
sponsor, said the decision ``is really all about power: who has the
power, the court or Congress?''

   Even though he is running neck-in-neck with President Alberto K.
Fujimori in the polls, Alejandro Toledo dropped out of the runoff
in Peru's presidential race, saying he could not win on a playing
field fraudulently tilted against him. Fujimori apparently has a
clear shot at winning a third five-year term unless Toledo and the
international community put enough pressure on the government to
postpone the May 28 runoff election until mid-June. Fujimori said
he would not change the election date.

   The Fed Gets Serious
</P>
<P>
   Despite five quarter-point interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve over 11 months, the economy has kept roaring along.
So the Fed pulled out some heavier weaponry, raising rates by half
a percentage point to make clear that it will do whatever is needed
to head off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also hinted that further rate hikes are in the
pipeline, disappointing investors who had hoped for a sign that the
Fed was finished for the year. So far, though, there is not much
inflation for the Fed to extinguish.

   Women and Stress
</P>
<P>
   When humans encounter stress, they will, by instinct, choose
``fight or flight'' _ or so goes the accepted wisdom. The trouble
is, that wisdom is based largely on the study of men. But guess
what? According to a study in the journal Psychological Review,
women are different. Instead of slugging or running when demons
appear, they ``tend and befriend'' _ they stick together and
nurture children. A good thing, too, the study suggests: It would
have been an evolutionary disaster if no one had protected the
young.

   With the benefits of Latin America's fastest-growing economy
eluding them, thousands of Dominicans, tired of high prices and
blackouts, pulled the plug on the ruling party in presidential
elections. Although Hipolito Mejia, the candidate of the
left-center Revolutionary Dominican Party, just missed a majority,
he far outpaced his opponents. Facing an insurmountable margin,
Danilo Medina of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party declined to
pursue a runoff. Mejia has vowed to increase social spending and

   Visitors to the South Carolina Capitol will no longer see the

legislature gave in to years of pressure and voted to remove it.
But they won't have to look far to see it _ a smaller version will
now fly in front of the Statehouse. That has angered some black
officials and the NAACP, which plans to step up its boycott of the
state, but business leaders say they believe the issue will quickly
fizzle.

   Kosovo Deadline Averted
</P>
<P>
   The Senate defeated a measure to set a deadline for withdrawing
U.S. ground troops from Kosovo, averting a foreign policy setback
for the Clinton administration. The Senate stripped a provision
from a military spending bill that would have cut off funds for the
5,600 U.S. forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, unless Congress
approved an extension. The White House said the measure would
undermine the NATO operation in Kosovo.

   Court Rules on Rape Cases
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment of its passage in 1994, the Violence
Against Women Act was on a collision course with the Supreme
Court's new interest in setting limits on Congress' ability to
bring the federal government into areas of state concern. The crash
finally occurred when the court voted, 5-4, that the act's
provision permitting victims of rape and other crimes ``motivated
by gender'' to sue their attackers in federal court was
unconstitutional. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the law's chief Senate
sponsor, said the decision ``is really all about power: who has the
power, the court or Congress?''

   Presidents come and go, but Helen Thomas stayed at the White
House for 39 years. Thomas, who is 79 and covered John F. Kennedy
and every president thereafter for United Press International, quit
after the financially troubled news service was acquired by a group
with links to the Unification Church. ``I wish the new owners all
the best,'' Thomas said in leaving her employer of 57 years.
``Great stories, and happy landings.''

   Peru Challenger Drops Out
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is running neck-in-neck with President Alberto K.
Fujimori in the polls, Alejandro Toledo dropped out of the runoff
in Peru's presidential race, saying he could not win on a playing
field fraudulently tilted against him. Fujimori apparently has a
clear shot at winning a third five-year term unless Toledo and the
international community put enough pressure on the government to
postpone the May 28 runoff election until mid-June. Fujimori said
he would not change the election date.

   The Fed Gets Serious
</P>
<P>
   Despite five quarter-point interest rate increases by the
Federal Reserve over 11 months, the economy has kept roaring along.
So the Fed pulled out some heavier weaponry, raising rates by half
a percentage point to make clear that it will do whatever is needed
to head off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also hinted that further rate hikes are in the
pipeline, disappointing investors who had hoped for a sign that the
Fed was finished for the year. So far, though, there is not much
inflation for the Fed to extinguish.

   Women and Stress
</P>
<P>
   When humans encounter stress, they will, by instinct, choose
``fight or flight'' _ or so goes the accepted wisdom. The trouble
is, that wisdom is based largely on the study of men. But guess
what? According to a study in the journal Psychological Review,
women are different. Instead of slugging or running when demons
appear, they ``tend and befriend'' _ they stick together and
nurture children. A good thing, too, the study suggests: It would
have been an evolutionary disaster if no one had protected the
young.

   The sprawling fraud investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp. has lasted seven years, but prosecutors have finally won a
tentative settlement. The hospital giant agreed in principal to pay
$745 million in civil penalties to resolve allegations that it
cheated federal health programs. But the deal will not be finalized
unless the outstanding criminal investigations are resolved before
year's end.

   Dominicans Vote for Change
</P>
<P>
   With the benefits of Latin America's fastest-growing economy
eluding them, thousands of Dominicans, tired of high prices and
blackouts, pulled the plug on the ruling party in presidential
elections. Although Hipolito Mejia, the candidate of the
left-center Revolutionary Dominican Party, just missed a majority,
he far outpaced his opponents. Facing an insurmountable margin,
Danilo Medina of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party declined to
pursue a runoff. Mejia has vowed to increase social spending and
help farmers hurt by imports and privatization.

   Trucks and buses are among the last uncontrolled sources of air
pollution, but their turn has come, the Environmental Protection
Agency said. The agency is seeking a 97 percent reduction in the
sulfur content of diesel fuel over the next decade in an effort to
reduce smog and remove harmful chemicals from the air. Oil refiners
have volunteered a 90 percent cut. Hearings on the proposed rules
will begin soon.

   Visitors to the South Carolina Capitol will no longer see the
Confederate flag atop the dome as of July 1, after the state
legislature gave in to years of pressure and voted to remove it.
But they won't have to look far to see it _ a smaller version will
now fly in front of the Statehouse. That has angered some black
officials and the NAACP, which plans to step up its boycott of the
state, but business leaders say they believe the issue will quickly
fizzle.

   NEW YORK _ It was the most spontaneous _ and unexpected _ moment
at last week's annual ``up fronts,'' a four-day rite in which
network television executives nervously announce their new sitcoms
and dramas to advertisers in New York and bring in the casts of
current hit shows to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   As Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast, and Garth Ancier,
NBC's president of entertainment, introduced the stars of ``West
Wing,'' the audience at Lincoln Center stood for a prolonged
standing ovation, startling both executives and actors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the flaws of the Aaron Sorkin dramatic series about a
fictional liberal president and his White House staff, the audience
was saying, in effect, that a grown-up and unpatronizing show was a
source of rare pride to them. The show is successful, too.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the rest _ old and new _ that the public will
see this fall. And the refrain heard among media buyers, talent
agents and managers, and television executives at the elaborate
parties around the city was: Is this really the best that network
television can offer?
</P>
<P>
   The new shows include appealing comedy series with movie stars
like Bette Midler and Geena Davis. Others are simply replicas: The
NBC show ``Tucker,'' about a bright boy living with mother, seems
similar to the Fox hit ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' The CBS series
``The Fugitive'' mirrors the Harrison Ford film and the 1960s David
Janssen prototype. The NBC series ``DAG,'' about a secret
serviceman guarding a feisty first lady, recalls the 1994 film,
``Guarding Tess.'' And an Aaron Spelling NBC series, ``Titans,''
about an overrich, oversexed Beverly Hills family recalls, well,
most of Spelling's series.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously missing from most of the networks (except WB) were
new teen-age shows and clones of ``Friends'' (twentysomethings
living in New York), which proliferated in recent years. The reason
was simply that many of these shows have flopped or fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Even executives at the youth-centric WB Network seemed far less
assured this year than they were last year when they crowed that
they knew precisely what their audience wanted. For the first time
in its half-dozen years, the highly successful network stumbled,
partly because of some poorly received shows, partly because of the
loss of WGN, a Chicago station. Now WB is plainly seeking to push
the envelope with ``Grosse Pointe,'' which spoofs the kind of
teen-age shows that the network often offers; the actors are as
pretty as they are vain and vacuous. One of the show's producers,
Darren Star, helped create ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York preview came at an odd, maybe surreal, moment in
the ever-fluid world of television. The moment _ worthy of Terry
Southern _ came when ABC's huge hit, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' was briefly eclipsed last Sunday by the opening
episode of the CBS miniseries, ``Jesus.'' Variety's front-page
headline proclaimed: `` `Jesus' Tops Regis.'' (On Wednesday the
miniseries was toppled by the final episode of ``Beverly Hills
90210.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, not one but two behind-the-scenes dramas about
``The Brady Bunch'' have surfaced. In the NBC's drama ``Growing Up
Brady'' which is broadcast Sunday night at 9 p.m., viewers
immediately learn that Robert Reed and Florence Henderson, who
played the parents of the six Brady children, didn't like kissing
much because Reed, who died in 1992, ``likes men more than woman,''
says the actor playing Barry Williams, who played Greg, the oldest
son. It's that kind of show. Fox has a show in a similar vein.
</P>
<P>
   In their hunger to lure increasingly fickle audiences away from
cable and the Internet, network executives said selecting and
scheduling programs was a roll of the dice as well as a blend of
considerations. CBS, for example, picked up the medical drama,
``City of Angels,'' about a hospital in Los Angeles for another
season despite poor ratings. The show, one of the first dramatic
series with a predominately black cast and crew, has been a big
disappointment. By all indications, CBS picked up the series for
another season partly to avoid the ire of civil rights groups,
which pressured the networks last year to accelerate minority
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of what our position should be in terms of
minorities, in terms of diversity,'' said CBS president Leslie
Moonves. (But a decision by CBS not to add a series about a
Mexican-American family in East Los Angeles to its prime-time
lineup, which the network had been promoting, caused disappointment
among Hispanic groups).
</P>
<P>
   Moonves, echoing his competitors at NBC and Fox, was clearly
obsessed with the extraordinary success of ABC's ``Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire.'' The show dominates the television landscape. (ABC
added only two and a half hours of new series programs to its fall
schedule).
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' may prove vulnerable, said Moonves, who has
placed probably his top new show, the Bette Midler comedy, ``The
Bette Show,'' against the quiz show. ``I lay awake at night
thinking how to fight `Millionaire,''' he said. ``And I can't
figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Millionaire' slips,'' Moonves said, ``that will be my one
Christmas gift.'' His colleagues at NBC and Fox, looking uneasily
about toward the new season, are hoping for the same gift.

   ROUGEMONT, N.C. _ Racing commentators ticked off the aspects
surrounding Adam Petty's death last week at the New Hampshire
International Speedway: a fourth-generation racer killed at age 19
in a practice run, just weeks after the death of his
great-grandfather, Lee, a NASCAR champion three times over.
</P>
<P>
   Few pointed out that the young driver died a long way from
Daytona, Fla., and in the heart of Yankee country. But NASCAR has
traveled far since days when the first racers came roaring down
from the Blue Ridge Mountains in their bootlegging cars, itching to
find out who was the fastest. Today racers average 150 mph a lap
and over 200 on the straights.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe spread the fame of Junior Johnson, one of the greatest
drivers of the 1950s and '60s, who was sentenced to two years in
prison after he was caught firing his daddy's still. Wolfe's
Esquire article, ``The Last American Hero,'' later appeared in his
book, ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby.'' He
described Southern culture, carefully explaining that ``good old
boys'' were not necessarily old or boys.
</P>
<P>
   The South no longer needs translation. And along with country
music and culinary quirks like grits and red-eye gravy, NASCAR is
now part of American culture. Of the 21 race tracks in the Winston
Cup Series, the top races, only nine are in the Southeast. Since
1988 NASCAR has come to tracks in Nevada, Indiana, New Hampshire,
Arizona and California. There are also races in New York and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   While old-timers trained by outrunning revenuers, many of the
young ``shoes,'' including Jeff Gordon, NASCAR's current superstar,
learned their down-shifting and trail-braking at the Skip Barber
School, considered the Harvard of racing schools. Some even have
college degrees, and a few colleges like the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte offer courses in racing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, folks down South miss the bad old days when stock cars
raced on dirt and the drivers drank hard, banged one another's cars
and brawled after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel with the NFL,'' says Humpy Wheeler, the
longtime czar of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. ``In the
old days, it was just a bunch of thugs playing in the back yard on
a Sunday afternoon. Now it's in every living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the nation's living rooms has its price, and Wheeler
is clearly ambivalent about it. Part of that price, he said, is
formality. ``I'm the only one left with a nickname,'' he said.
``Used to be, everyone had a nickname _ Fireball Roberts, Banjo
Matthews, Tiny Lund.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days a seat belt might mean a length of rope tied
around a driver's waist. Cars, too, came right off the dealer's
stock on the showroom floor. When Bill France Sr. and other
racing-car enthusiasts gathered in Daytona Beach in 1947 to
establish the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, they
believed that ordinary people would want to watch what their own
cars could do. At the first official NASCAR-sanctioned race at the
old Charlotte Speedway in 1949, at least 10,000 spectators showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants was Lee Petty, a bakery truck driver
from Level Cross, N.C., who wrecked his borrowed Buick Roadmaster
and had to hitchhike home. But before his death this year at age
86, Petty went on to many victories, and watched his son, Richard,
his grandson Kyle and his great-grandson, Adam, become NASCAR
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona's first races were on the beach. In Georgia, Virginia
and the Carolinas, the tracks were cut into the red clay. The great
racing families of Atlanta started out running moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, change crept in. The dirt tracks were paved over.
NASCAR's first race on pavement at Darlington in 1950 had a
pear-shaped track because the owner wanted to preserve a minnow
pond.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about NASCAR has remained unchanged: It's still a
white man's sport. A few women compete at the lower levels. Charlie
Scott, a black man, won a Winston Cup race in 1963, but only a few
blacks race today; none at the top level. Costs and sponsors may be
factors: It costs $10 million to run a team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the sport changed forever when tobacco ads were banned
from television. R.J. Reynolds began to support NASCAR as a way to
advertise its products. The group's top series was renamed for
Winston cigarettes. The teams became more professional as the
purses grew; at least $2 million today compared to $1,500 in 1949.
Audiences grew, too. Estimates put attendance at the Winston Cup
Series races last year at 6 million; more than 150 million
television viewers watched.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities themselves became businesses. Among the most
successful is Richard Petty, whose cowboy-hatted profile identifies
his trucks and a line of products ranging from a limited 1991
edition of Pontiac Grand Prix automobiles to hot sauce. There is
now even a NASCAR Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, NASCAR's brightest star, has brought in a lot of young
male fans, but many old-timers see him merely as a winning machine,
and hard to identify with. ``We still haven't had that driver who
could do for us what Ali did for boxing, what Namath did for
football, what Babe Ruth did for baseball,'' Wheeler said. ``We
need the guy who can transport us out of the sport and into the
mainstream, who will take us onto the cover of Time rather than the
cover of Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler misses the old days. ``We still need that rough, tough,
good old boy who can mix it up on the track,'' he said. ``We don't
want 20 guys walking in wearing Brooks Brothers suits and Gucci
shoes, drinking tea down in the pit lane.''

Esquire article, ``The Last American Hero,'' later appeared in his
book, ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby.'' He
described Southern culture, carefully explaining that ``good old
boys'' were not necessarily old or boys.
</P>
<P>
   The South no longer needs translation. And along with country
music and culinary quirks like grits and red-eye gravy, NASCAR is
now part of American culture. Of the 21 race tracks in the Winston
Cup Series, the top races, only nine are in the Southeast. Since
1988 NASCAR has come to tracks in Nevada, Indiana, New Hampshire,
Arizona and California. There are also races in New York and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   While old-timers trained by outrunning revenuers, many of the
young ``shoes,'' including Jeff Gordon, NASCAR's current superstar,
learned their down-shifting and trail-braking at the Skip Barber
School, considered the Harvard of racing schools. Some even have
college degrees, and a few colleges like the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte offer courses in racing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, folks down South miss the bad old days when stock cars
raced on dirt and the drivers drank hard, banged one another's cars
and brawled after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel with the NFL,'' says Humpy Wheeler, the
longtime czar of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. ``In the
old days, it was just a bunch of thugs playing in the back yard on
a Sunday afternoon. Now it's in every living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the nation's living rooms has its price, and Wheeler
is clearly ambivalent about it. Part of that price, he said, is
formality. ``I'm the only one left with a nickname,'' he said.
``Used to be, everyone had a nickname _ Fireball Roberts, Banjo
Matthews, Tiny Lund.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days a seat belt might mean a length of rope tied
around a driver's waist. Cars, too, came right off the dealer's
stock on the showroom floor. When Bill France Sr. and other
racing-car enthusiasts gathered in Daytona Beach in 1947 to
establish the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, they
believed that ordinary people would want to watch what their own
cars could do. At the first official NASCAR-sanctioned race at the
old Charlotte Speedway in 1949, at least 10,000 spectators showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants was Lee Petty, a bakery truck driver
from Level Cross, N.C., who wrecked his borrowed Buick Roadmaster
and had to hitchhike home. But before his death this year at age
86, Petty went on to many victories, and watched his son, Richard,
his grandson Kyle and his great-grandson, Adam, become NASCAR
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona's first races were on the beach. In Georgia, Virginia
and the Carolinas, the tracks were cut into the red clay. The great
racing families of Atlanta started out running moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, change crept in. The dirt tracks were paved over.
NASCAR's first race on pavement at Darlington in 1950 had a
pear-shaped track because the owner wanted to preserve a minnow
pond.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about NASCAR has remained unchanged: It's still a
white man's sport. A few women compete at the lower levels. Charlie
Scott, a black man, won a Winston Cup race in 1963, but only a few
blacks race today; none at the top level. Costs and sponsors may be
factors: It costs $10 million to run a team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the sport changed forever when tobacco ads were banned
from television. R.J. Reynolds began to support NASCAR as a way to
advertise its products. The group's top series was renamed for
Winston cigarettes. The teams became more professional as the
purses grew; at least $2 million today compared to $1,500 in 1949.
Audiences grew, too. Estimates put attendance at the Winston Cup
Series races last year at 6 million; more than 150 million
television viewers watched.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities themselves became businesses. Among the most
successful is Richard Petty, whose cowboy-hatted profile identifies
his trucks and a line of products ranging from a limited 1991
edition of Pontiac Grand Prix automobiles to hot sauce. There is
now even a NASCAR Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, NASCAR's brightest star, has brought in a lot of young
male fans, but many old-timers see him merely as a winning machine,
and hard to identify with. ``We still haven't had that driver who
could do for us what Ali did for boxing, what Namath did for
football, what Babe Ruth did for baseball,'' Wheeler said. ``We
need the guy who can transport us out of the sport and into the
mainstream, who will take us onto the cover of Time rather than the
cover of Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler misses the old days. ``We still need that rough, tough,
good old boy who can mix it up on the track,'' he said. ``We don't
want 20 guys walking in wearing Brooks Brothers suits and Gucci
shoes, drinking tea down in the pit lane.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foday Sankoh, the Sierra Leone warlord whose thugs
made a tactic of hacking off the hands and limbs of children and
others, ended the week a prisoner under the guard of British
soldiers, but that is just the beginning of the story for the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Will other nations now insist he be brought to justice? Or will
there be another diplomatic pact with him, forged for a short-term
goal of pacifying his troops?
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is a stark situation that may compel democracies to
answer a bitter question that haunted most of the last century: How
much business can good guys afford to do with bad guys?
</P>
<P>
   The oft-expressed presumption in democratic societies these days
is that strongmen who inflict terrible crimes, whether on their
neighbors or on their own people, should pay for their wrongdoing.
But the reality has not been so simple. As the 1990s spawned
warlords from Yugoslavia to Haiti, from Cambodia to Africa, the
principle was often sacrificed to the pragmatic goal of striking
peace deals, no matter how shaky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomats look to the short term, they tend to think any
agreement is good,'' said Morton I. Abramowitz, a veteran U.S.
envoy. ``Diplomats like to export problems to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Sankoh's case, there are divisions in the Clinton
administration. While some officials argue strongly for bringing
the warlord to justice, others seem to believe that he still may
have a role to play in the evolving efforts to bring peace to
Sierra Leone _ or at least in freeing United Nations peacekeepers
whom Sankoh's rebels have taken hostage. The administration's
envoy, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is in the region now, is on good
terms with Sankoh's companion warlord, President Charles Taylor of
Liberia, and Sierra Leone officials have criticized him for
suggesting _ before Sankoh was detained _ that the he be included
in reconciliation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   What might be the logic of that? Consider past experience. In
Haiti, there was clear benefit when a U.S.-brokered deal allowed a
strongman, Gen. Raoul Cedras, to go into exile in exchange for a
peaceful landing of U.S. troops sent to restore President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslavia, the benefits were not so clear. In
1994, Western powers dealt with the Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic even though they knew he was responsible for war crimes
in the Balkans. His value as a guarantor of the Dayton peace
accords was considered more vital than serving justice, and the
accords did stop the killing in Bosnia. But they also left
Milosevic in a position to start the next war, in Kosovo. Only
during that war was he finally indicted by the U.N. tribunal for
Balkan war crimes. And he still remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   Will a pact be made with Sankoh? In the end, probably not, most
diplomats think. His crimes are too egregious and public outrage
too intense. But the possibility cannot be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Sankoh broke the Lome accord for peace in
Sierra Leone, an agreement that had granted him an amnesty and a
strong position in the Sierra Leone government, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright spoke as though another deal with any such
warlord could not be imagined. She told a conference on war crimes:
``We have to keep our eye on the prize: justice for the
perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week, faced with the collapse of U.N. peacekeeping
operations and another hellish descent into war in Sierra Leone,
the State Department sounded a different note. Richard Boucher, the
department's spokesman, repeatedly evaded questions about whether
Sankoh was a candidate for trial as a war criminal. Part of the
reason was concern for the safety of several hundred U.N.
peacekeepers who remain hostages of Sankoh's rebels. In other
words, the rebels can still create havoc, and Sankoh's presumed
power to control that group, the RUF, remains a bargaining chip _
just as Milosevic's power to fix problems he had created was his
strongest card in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, diplomats this time appear to be shrinking from dealing
with Sankoh, partly because of the nature of his crimes and partly
because he has such a bad record of keeping peace bargains he has
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have all the reasons to prosecute firmly established,''
said Diane Orentlicher, professor of law and director of the war
crimes research office at Washington University. ``There is no
doubt that the RUF committed atrocious war crimes and violated
international law. There is no question that Sankoh is not useful
as a peacemaker. And he's in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Orentlicher says there are a number of ways Sankoh could be
prosecuted _ either in Sierra Leone, in a foreign country or, less
likely, by a new U.N. war crimes tribunal for Sierra Leone. ``One
of the most remarkable developments in recent years has been the
willingness of states to explore novel mechanisms to ensure
accountability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most celebrated such approaches was called to mind by
the fact that Sankoh was being guarded by soldiers from Britain,
whose courts ruled that Gen. Augusto Pinochet could be extradited
to Spain to face trial for crimes committed in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   One of Britain's most prominent barristers, Geoffrey Robertson,
argued last week that a prosecution of Sankoh in Britain would be a
natural followup to the Pinochet case. Because Sankoh was now
effectively in British hands, Robertson said, ``Pinochet has opened
the door to a Sankoh trial _ this is the challenge that human
rights law now throws down to the diplomats.'' It should be
remembered, though, that in the Pinochet case, Britain's legal
authorities were more enthusiastic about allowing extradition than
was the British government, which would have had to face the
political and diplomatic consequences. And now, the government of
Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to show any enthusiasm for
hauling Sankoh into the Old Bailey for trial.

   Death puts a pretty effective end to most human endeavors. But
it will no longer stop us from e-mailing our friends and relatives,
thanks to a new Web site, www.FinalThoughts.com. The site archives
e-mail messages to be dispatched when subscribers shuffle off their
mortal coils. A ``guardian angel'' notifies FinalThoughts.com of
the subscriber's demise; the intended recipients receive e-mail
notes to visit the Web site for a message.
</P>
<P>
   Given the backgrounds available for subscribers' messages _
clouds, angels, flowers or hearts _ it isn't surprising that the
founder of FinalThoughts, Todd Krim, says, ``I hope no one uses the

   Death puts a pretty effective end to most human endeavors. But
it will no longer stop us from e-mailing our friends and relatives,
thanks to a new Web site, www.FinalThoughts.com. The site archives
e-mail messages to be dispatched when subscribers shuffle off their
mortal coils. A ``guardian angel'' notifies FinalThoughts.com of
the subscriber's demise; the intended recipients receive e-mail
notes to visit the Web site for a message.
</P>
<P>
   Given the backgrounds available for subscribers' messages _
clouds, angels, flowers or hearts _ it isn't surprising that the
founder of FinalThoughts, Todd Krim, says, ``I hope no one uses the
site for any spiteful or vindictive messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. If the following excerpts from memorable wills are any
guide, Krim may want to consider some other backgrounds _ daggers,
perhaps _ when offering the chance to get in a final zinger from
beyond the grave.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When David M. O'Brien, a government professor at
the University of Virginia, took his students on a tour of the
Supreme Court recently, they ended up in a private
question-and-answer session with a justice who abruptly turned to
presidential politics. He blurted out several hot-button issues
involving federalism, and said the future composition of the court
would dramatically affect the outcome of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vote carefully,'' the justice, a Republican appointee,
implored the students assembled in a stately white oak conference
room.
</P>
<P>
   To this justice, and to interest groups on the left and the
right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not so much about whether
Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the White House. It's about
whom Gore or Bush would put on the Supreme Court, where vacancies
are likely, if not in the next four years, then certainly in the
next president's potential second term. Three of the nine justices
are age 70 or older.
</P>
<P>
   In just about every speech, Gore warns that religious
conservatives like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell would ratify
prospects for the bench in a Bush administration. His advisers were
emboldened last week when the court, in a 5-4 ruling, overturned
parts of the Violence Against Women Act, in a rebuke to Congress'
efforts to use interstate commerce rules to preempt state powers.
That ruling, they said, would galvanize women who feel they have
been left more vulnerable to gender-motivated violence.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are just as determined to make the court a high
profile issue. As the Christian Coalition put it in a memorandum to
its members, ``The stakes of this first election of the new
millennium are extremely high: three Supreme Court judges.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds like hyperbole _ and, indeed, makes for
successful fund-raising appeals _ in this case it may be true. The
next president's most lasting legacy could be the Supreme Court,
which during the next presidential term will probably decide the
constitutionality of school choice and late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Vacancies will be all the more important because the court now
is as riven over the major issues of the day as is the House of
Representatives across the street. The president also can stock the
lower federal courts with judges to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the breathless warnings on both sides, there is no
evidence that voters think about the Supreme Court when they pick a
president. The subject is never cited on a list of top concerns of
voters, which typically include education and health care. Instead,
campaigns have traditionally made the court an issue to help turn
out the most loyal Democratic or Republican base voters _ but not
to attract independent and swing voters who will decide the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking a reporter's question about the relevance of the Supreme
Court in November, Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said,
``The American people are hanging on the 5-4 majority and the
federalism issue! In focus groups they talk about it all the
time!''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mellman, another Democratic pollster, explained, ``We've
never seen it being important. Everybody raises it because the
political cognoscenti believe it should be important _ and they
just can't believe that it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a reach to expect voters to elect a president
based on an imponderable: He may or may not appoint new justices,
who would then deliberate on issues that have yet-to-be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Only infrequently, when there is a drama like the nomination of
Clarence Thomas in 1991 or the failed nomination of Robert H. Bork
in 1987, does the public pay attention. With the most celebrated
exceptions of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized
abortion, and Brown vs. Board of Education, which in 1954 paved the
way for school desegregation, it is difficult for people to
translate their vote for president into how the Supreme Court might
alter their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush or Gore says, `Vote for me because in 2015 Medicare or
Social Security will be in better shape,' I don't think that's
going to motivate a lot of voters because of the lack of
immediacy,'' said Stuart M. Benjamin, a professor at the University
of San Diego School of Law who was a clerk for Justice David
Souter. ``That, in effect, is what voters are being asked to do
with the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that the court carries little political weight with
most voters _ and perhaps that his views could put off the
moderates he will need in November _ Bush never raises the subject.
When asked, he reassures conservatives by suggesting that his
nominees would be ``strict constructionists,'' uncomfortable with
Roe vs. Wade, though he has insisted he would not administer a
litmus test to make sure his running mate shares his anti-abortion
position.

</P>
<P>
   The hope among Democrats is that they might turn the court into

court to be more at the fore in this campaign, because in the next
several weeks it is expected to hand down decisions on a series of
controversial issues: federalism, partial-birth abortion, gays in
the Boy Scouts and a challenge to the Miranda warning, which
requires police to advise suspects of their rights before beginning
an interrogation.

<P>
   Ronald A. Klain, a former chief of staff to Gore and the member

be indifferent to court rulings like the one last week that
invalidated a central provision of the Violence Against Women Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of swing voters in this election are moderate women who
care about their lives and their rights,'' Klain said. ``Whether
the Supreme Court thinks that Congress has the power to enact a
statute to protect them from hate crimes will be an important issue
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined not to politicize the court, justices have an
unspoken rule that they do not retire in an election year (unless,
of course, Mother Nature leaves them no choice.) And, if possible,
they often try to stay put until the president who can replace them
is of the same party as the one who appointed them. It may well be
that none of them will budge over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after November, there is the possibility for retirements:
Justice John Paul Stevens, 80, is the oldest member of the court;
Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist is 75, and Sandra Day O'Connor is
70.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarence Thomas is good for another 50 years,'' said Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said of
the youngest justice, who is 51. ``But you've got Rehnquist and
Stevens and O'Connor who are along in years.''
</P>
<P>
   In making the case for the significance of the court as an issue
in November, Specter went so far as to construct a new, highly
unlikely, American voting bloc. ``The Supreme Court may be
important with the intelligentsia,'' he said. ``But that would be,
perhaps, a critical swing vote.''

   WASHINGTON _ The convicted murderer's commencement address to
the students at Antioch College in Ohio had to be recorded from one
of the phone calls he is allowed in the break from his maximum
security, 23-hour lockdown cell in Pennsylvania. The sound quality
was poor, the voice scratchy, but the convicted cop killer Mumia

Black Panther told the graduates from his prison. ``Show your
admiration for them by becoming them.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, and no less passionately, students elsewhere on
the campus were being inoculated against the ``absurd myths'' of
the Abu-Jamal cause, in the words of Maureen Faulkner, the widow of
the white Philadelphia policeman whom Abu-Jamal was convicted of
shooting to death in 1981. ``Yes, I do want Mumia Abu-Jamal to be
executed,'' she fervidly declared. The widow stood surrounded by a
group of police officers who, like the students and assorted other
activists drawn to the case across the past 19 years, sense the
approach of a defining moment in what has become an issue of
international concern about the state of criminal justice, capital
punishment and racism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, whose appeal to the federal courts for a new trial
could receive a response any day now, has become the most
recognizable death row inmate in the land as the United States
experiences the collective dissonance of taking the lead among
industrialized countries in executing criminals (and the rate
continues to rise), even as mainstream politicians increasingly
voice doubts about how capital punishment can ever be fairly meted
out to accused murderers who cannot afford a competent defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Hampshire Legislature voted final approval to
abolish the death penalty _ a moral gesture for the lawmakers,
since a gubernatorial veto was promised and no one is on death row
there. But the stand accentuated the growing call for a moratorium
on executions that was endorsed earlier this year by Gov. George
Ryan of Illinois, a pro-death penalty Republican suffering ``grave
concerns about our state's shameful record'' in meting out the
death penalty to people later found to be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium call has risen along with the tide of executions.
It was endorsed in 1997 by the American Bar Association. The
Nebraska Legislature followed suit. Even George Will, the
conservative columnist, cautions that ``skepticism is in order''
when it comes to executions, if only because of government's record
of failure and ineptitude in all manner of public service.
</P>
<P>
   The fairness of Abu-Jamal's conviction, which came during a
period of turbulent race relations in Philadelphia, has long been
debated, investigated and reinvestigated along starkly partisan
lines. ``It almost reminds me of the O.J. case,'' said Officer
Daniel Faulkner's old partner, Garry Bell, describing how factual
disputes about ballistics and witnesses have become dwarfed by such
issues as the morality of capital punishment, racism in the
judicial system and the nation's booming ``prison industrial
complex,'' as critics term the growing prison population and those
who administer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling; none of us here in 1981 could have
envisioned what is happening today,'' said Bell, while insisting
Abu-Jamal deserves execution.
</P>
<P>
   Some outside investigators are not so sure. ``The trial was
grotesquely unfair and included fabricated evidence,'' contends
Stuart Taylor, the legal affairs columnist for The National
Journal. Among other things, he notes that the police claim that
Abu-Jamal loudly, proudly, confessed to the shooting did not show
up in the official record until two months after the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, Abu-Jamal may not be the right poster boy to mobilize
persuadable people beyond the left,'' adds Taylor. He speculates
that some facts suggest the defendant, found wounded at the death
scene with his legally registered gun lying nearby, might indeed
have shot the policeman, but in an unplanned confrontation possibly
involving elements of provocation and self-defense. He might, in
other words, be neither guilty nor innocent in any unmitigated
sense.
</P>
<P>
   But Abu-Jamal, a black radio journalist long critical of the
Philadelphia police, never testified one way or the other at his
trial, rebuffing his court-appointed attorney as he complained of
rampant racism.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, today 45 years old, had no previous arrest record at
the time. He alleges that his constitutional rights were violated
wholesale by police, prosecutor and judge in his furious trial in
Philadelphia in 1982. While investigators like Taylor say he has
never clearly denied the shooting or explained his version of
events, his defenders insist only a fair retrial can establish the
facts and prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's cause, in any case, is clearly flourishing. His
charge that he had been railroaded by a racist system began
reaching an audience beyond Philadelphia in 1995, when National
Public Radio began broadcasting his prison life commentaries. They
were quickly dropped amid listeners' complaints, but by then the
world had been alerted and Abu-Jamal's celebrity-cum-notoriety
grew, vastly abetted by the World Wide Web, where argumentation
never ceases on behalf of convict (www.j4mumia.org and innumerable
other sites) and victim (www.danielfaulkner.com).
</P>
<P>
   Six thousand believers in Abu-Jamal gathered earlier this month
in Madison Square Garden in New York and thousands more
demonstrated in European capitals, blocking some Paris
intersections. When a five-member French delegation showed up last
month in Philadelphia with 50,000 protest signatures (``We
represent the city of Bobigny''), their path had been blazed by the
late French President Francois Mitterrand's widow, Danielle, who
visited Abu-Jamal in prison. His cause has drawn sympathy from
movie actors and world leaders, from Ed Asner to Nelson Mandela.
Amnesty International joined the call in citing ``a pattern of
events that compromised Abu-Jamal's right to a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the biggest international mobilization since the
Angela Davis case,'' said Leonard I. Weinglass, an experienced
leftist advocate who is handling the appeal for Abu-Jamal. His
conviction was twice upheld by the state court of appeals, while
the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear it in an earlier challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, for all the moratorium talk, capital punishment has not
yet emerged as an issue in this year's presidential arena. Gov.
George W. Bush has increasingly had to defend his stewardship of
Texas' death row, the nation's busiest. But Vice President Al Gore,
also a supporter of capital punishment, has not dared to press the
politically risky issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with the Abu-Jamal case now entwined with the capital
punishment issue, his supporters expect the pending court decision
to galvanize both causes, whether a new execution date is set or a
new trial is ordered. ``We're persisting,'' said Pam Africa, who
directs the Abu-Jamal website. ``This can only get bigger.''

   BEIJING _ The best moment of John Kamm's visit here came when he
was touring Beijing Prison and his host, an official from the
Ministry of Justice, received a call on her cell phone with
information about a political prisoner he had inquired about.
</P>
<P>
   In the car later, Kamm, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation, was told that Zhang Jie,
sentenced in 1989 to 18 years in prison for ``counterrevolutionary
propaganda and incitement,'' has had his sentence reduced by four
and a half years for good behavior and is due to be released in
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Although China suspended human rights dialogue with the United
States a year ago after its Belgrade embassy was bombed, it quietly
agreed a few months ago to resume exchanges with Kamm, who has
visited Beijing more than 50 times in the last 10 years to press
officials for information on its thousands of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   His latest three-day visit to Beijing, which ended Saturday, was
the first time he had been officially invited by the Ministry of
Justice. His repeated inquiries about specific prisoners, combined
with letters from members of Congress and other foreign
organizations, result in better treatment and often earlier release
of prisoners, Kamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're unknown (and) no one asks about them, they just sit
in their cells,'' said Kamm, an American who was a businessman in
Hong Kong for 23 years but now devotes most of his time to his Dui
Hua (''dialogue'' in Chinese) Foundation. He was a vice president
at Occidental Chemical Co. in Hong Kong and now does consulting in
industrial raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   He favors granting China permanent normal trade relations, which
Congress is scheduled to vote on this week, because he believes the
United States' annual review of China's trade status is no longer a
useful tool to influence the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   Although some human rights groups have suggested Beijing timed
his visit to influence the trade vote, Kamm said he recognizes that
China will make concessions to get things that it wants. He plans
to schedule his next visit for September, when the decision on
China's bid to host the 2008 Olympics will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm and three assistants scour Chinese publications searching
for political prisoners who are unknown outside China. They have
come up with 1,000 names in the past eight months, most of them
previously unknown and many of them associated with the 1989
democracy demonstrations that ended when the military opened fire
on protesters at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. At the time, little
was known about demonstrations in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly apparent to me the June 4
demonstrations took place all over the country in hundreds of
cities and towns,'' Kamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Shandong, the province in eastern China where Zhang was
arrested, has as many as 208 prisoners who were convicted of
``counter-revolutionary'' activities after the June 4 massacre.
Zhang, then 21 and unemployed, was sentenced to 18 years for making
a speech, Kamm said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that China is ``trying to dilute the stain of June 4''
by slowly releasing political prisoners arrested around that time.
He said officials confirmed for the first time that Chen Lantao, a
Shandong marine biologist arrested for making a speech, was
released at the end of April after serving less than 11 years of
his 18-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not afraid of these June 4 people coming out,'' he
said. ``Where they do draw the line is Tibet. I think some of these
Tibetans in there are so committed, (the Chinese) fear them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said very few Tibetan prisoners he has inquired about have
had their sentences reduced.

   WASHINGTON _ The convicted murderer's commencement address to
the students at Antioch College in Ohio had to be recorded from one
of the phone calls he is allowed in the break from his maximum
security, 23-hour lockdown cell in Pennsylvania. The sound quality
was poor, the voice scratchy, but the convicted cop killer Mumia
Abu-Jamal, living on death-row, sounded quite up to the pomp and
circumstance of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the lives of those people you admire,'' the one-time
Black Panther told the graduates from his prison. ``Show your

   ROUGEMONT, N.C. _ Racing commentators ticked off the aspects
surrounding Adam Petty's death last week at the New Hampshire
International Speedway: a fourth-generation racer killed at age 19
in a practice run, just weeks after the death of his
great-grandfather, Lee, a NASCAR champion three times over.
</P>
<P>
   Few pointed out that the young driver died a long way from
Daytona, Fla., and in the heart of Yankee country. But NASCAR has
traveled far since days when the first racers came roaring down
from the Blue Ridge Mountains in their bootlegging cars, itching to
find out who was the fastest. Today racers average 150 mph a lap
and over 200 on the straights.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe spread the fame of Junior Johnson, one of the greatest
drivers of the 1950s and '60s, who was sentenced to two years in
prison after he was caught firing his daddy's still. Wolfe's
Esquire article, ``The Last American Hero,'' later appeared in his
book, ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby.'' He
described Southern culture, carefully explaining that ``good old
boys'' were not necessarily old or boys.
</P>
<P>
   The South no longer needs translation. And along with country
music and culinary quirks like grits and red-eye gravy, NASCAR is
now part of American culture. Of the 21 race tracks in the Winston
Cup Series, the top races, only nine are in the Southeast. Since
1988 NASCAR has come to tracks in Nevada, Indiana, New Hampshire,
Arizona and California. There are also races in New York and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   While old-timers trained by outrunning revenuers, many of the
young ``shoes,'' including Jeff Gordon, NASCAR's current superstar,
learned their down-shifting and trail-braking at the Skip Barber
School, considered the Harvard of racing schools. Some even have
college degrees, and a few colleges like the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte offer courses in racing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, folks down South miss the bad old days when stock cars
raced on dirt and the drivers drank hard, banged one another's cars
and brawled after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel with the NFL,'' says Humpy Wheeler, the
longtime czar of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. ``In the
old days, it was just a bunch of thugs playing in the back yard on
a Sunday afternoon. Now it's in every living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the nation's living rooms has its price, and Wheeler
is clearly ambivalent about it. Part of that price, he said, is
formality. ``I'm the only one left with a nickname,'' he said.
``Used to be, everyone had a nickname _ Fireball Roberts, Banjo
Matthews, Tiny Lund.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days a seat belt might mean a length of rope tied
around a driver's waist. Cars, too, came right off the dealer's
stock on the showroom floor. When Bill France Sr. and other
racing-car enthusiasts gathered in Daytona Beach in 1947 to
establish the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, they
believed that ordinary people would want to watch what their own
cars could do. At the first official NASCAR-sanctioned race at the
old Charlotte Speedway in 1949, at least 10,000 spectators showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants was Lee Petty, a bakery truck driver
from Level Cross, N.C., who wrecked his borrowed Buick Roadmaster
and had to hitchhike home. But before his death this year at age
86, Petty went on to many victories, and watched his son, Richard,
his grandson Kyle and his great-grandson, Adam, become NASCAR
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona's first races were on the beach. In Georgia, Virginia
and the Carolinas, the tracks were cut into the red clay. The great
racing families of Atlanta started out running moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, change crept in. The dirt tracks were paved over.
NASCAR's first race on pavement at Darlington in 1950 had a
pear-shaped track because the owner wanted to preserve a minnow
pond.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about NASCAR has remained unchanged: It's still a
white man's sport. A few women compete at the lower levels. Charlie
Scott, a black man, won a Winston Cup race in 1963, but only a few
blacks race today; none at the top level. Costs and sponsors may be
factors: It costs $10 million to run a team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the sport changed forever when tobacco ads were banned
from television. R.J. Reynolds began to support NASCAR as a way to
advertise its products. The group's top series was renamed for
Winston cigarettes. The teams became more professional as the
purses grew; at least $2 million today compared to $1,500 in 1949.
Audiences grew, too. Estimates put attendance at the Winston Cup
Series races last year at 6 million; more than 150 million
television viewers watched.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities themselves became businesses. Among the most
successful is Richard Petty, whose cowboy-hatted profile identifies
his trucks and a line of products ranging from a limited 1991
edition of Pontiac Grand Prix automobiles to hot sauce. There is
now even a NASCAR Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, NASCAR's brightest star, has brought in a lot of young
male fans, but many old-timers see him merely as a winning machine,
and hard to identify with. ``We still haven't had that driver who
could do for us what Ali did for boxing, what Namath did for
football, what Babe Ruth did for baseball,'' Wheeler said. ``We
need the guy who can transport us out of the sport and into the
mainstream, who will take us onto the cover of Time rather than the
cover of Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler misses the old days. ``We still need that rough, tough,
good old boy who can mix it up on the track,'' he said. ``We don't
want 20 guys walking in wearing Brooks Brothers suits and Gucci
shoes, drinking tea down in the pit lane.''

   ROUGEMONT, N.C. _ Racing commentators ticked off the aspects
surrounding Adam Petty's death last week at the New Hampshire
International Speedway: a fourth-generation racer killed at age 19
in a practice run, just weeks after the death of his
great-grandfather, Lee, a NASCAR champion three times over.
</P>
<P>
   Few pointed out that the young driver died a long way from
Daytona, Fla., and in the heart of Yankee country. But NASCAR has
traveled far since days when the first racers came roaring down
from the Blue Ridge Mountains in their bootlegging cars, itching to
find out who was the fastest. Today racers average 150 mph a lap
and over 200 on the straights.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe spread the fame of Junior Johnson, one of the greatest
drivers of the 1950s and '60s, who was sentenced to two years in
prison after he was caught firing his daddy's still. Wolfe's
Esquire article, ``The Last American Hero,'' later appeared in his
book, ``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby.'' He
described Southern culture, carefully explaining that ``good old
boys'' were not necessarily old or boys.
</P>
<P>
   The South no longer needs translation. And along with country
music and culinary quirks like grits and red-eye gravy, NASCAR is
now part of American culture. Of the 21 race tracks in the Winston
Cup Series, the top races, only nine are in the Southeast. Since
1988 NASCAR has come to tracks in Nevada, Indiana, New Hampshire,
Arizona and California. There are also races in New York and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   While old-timers trained by outrunning revenuers, many of the
young ``shoes,'' including Jeff Gordon, NASCAR's current superstar,
learned their down-shifting and trail-braking at the Skip Barber
School, considered the Harvard of racing schools. Some even have
college degrees, and a few colleges like the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte offer courses in racing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, folks down South miss the bad old days when stock cars
raced on dirt and the drivers drank hard, banged one another's cars
and brawled after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a parallel with the NFL,'' says Humpy Wheeler, the
longtime czar of Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. ``In the
old days, it was just a bunch of thugs playing in the back yard on
a Sunday afternoon. Now it's in every living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the nation's living rooms has its price, and Wheeler
is clearly ambivalent about it. Part of that price, he said, is
formality. ``I'm the only one left with a nickname,'' he said.
``Used to be, everyone had a nickname _ Fireball Roberts, Banjo
Matthews, Tiny Lund.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days a seat belt might mean a length of rope tied
around a driver's waist. Cars, too, came right off the dealer's
stock on the showroom floor. When Bill France Sr. and other
racing-car enthusiasts gathered in Daytona Beach in 1947 to
establish the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, they
believed that ordinary people would want to watch what their own
cars could do. At the first official NASCAR-sanctioned race at the
old Charlotte Speedway in 1949, at least 10,000 spectators showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants was Lee Petty, a bakery truck driver
from Level Cross, N.C., who wrecked his borrowed Buick Roadmaster
and had to hitchhike home. But before his death this year at age
86, Petty went on to many victories, and watched his son, Richard,
his grandson Kyle and his great-grandson, Adam, become NASCAR
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona's first races were on the beach. In Georgia, Virginia
and the Carolinas, the tracks were cut into the red clay. The great
racing families of Atlanta started out running moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, change crept in. The dirt tracks were paved over.
NASCAR's first race on pavement at Darlington in 1950 had a
pear-shaped track because the owner wanted to preserve a minnow
pond.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about NASCAR has remained unchanged: It's still a
white man's sport. A few women compete at the lower levels. Charlie
Scott, a black man, won a Winston Cup race in 1963, but only a few
blacks race today; none at the top level. Costs and sponsors may be
factors: It costs $10 million to run a team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the sport changed forever when tobacco ads were banned
from television. R.J. Reynolds began to support NASCAR as a way to
advertise its products. The group's top series was renamed for
Winston cigarettes. The teams became more professional as the
purses grew; at least $2 million today compared to $1,500 in 1949.
Audiences grew, too. Estimates put attendance at the Winston Cup
Series races last year at 6 million; more than 150 million
television viewers watched.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities themselves became businesses. Among the most
successful is Richard Petty, whose cowboy-hatted profile identifies
his trucks and a line of products ranging from a limited 1991
edition of Pontiac Grand Prix automobiles to hot sauce. There is
now even a NASCAR Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, NASCAR's brightest star, has brought in a lot of young
male fans, but many old-timers see him merely as a winning machine,
and hard to identify with. ``We still haven't had that driver who
could do for us what Ali did for boxing, what Namath did for
football, what Babe Ruth did for baseball,'' Wheeler said. ``We
need the guy who can transport us out of the sport and into the
mainstream, who will take us onto the cover of Time rather than the
cover of Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler misses the old days. ``We still need that rough, tough,
good old boy who can mix it up on the track,'' he said. ``We don't
want 20 guys walking in wearing Brooks Brothers suits and Gucci
shoes, drinking tea down in the pit lane.''

   ROME _ The Vatican's belated disclosure of the third secret of
Fatima last week was a little like the FBI announcing that Elvis
is, in fact, dead.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that the long-suppressed prophecy contained a
vision of something that has already come to pass, the 1981
assassination attempt on John Paul II, deflated decades of
conspiracy theories and doomsday predictions (nowadays broadcast on
dozens of Fatima Web sites). Most third-secret devotees were
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima, revered by Roman Catholics as a place where the Virgin
Mary appeared to three Portuguese shepherd children in 1917, has
long held a broader fascination for people attracted to unsolved,
spooky mysteries. Fatima addicts maintain that the third secret was
so terrifying _ their conjectures ranging from schism to nuclear
annihilation _ that no pope dared reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   And, as is so often the case when the Vatican lifts a veil to
appease public opinion, it raises more questions. So many, in fact,
that the Fatima mystery lives on: The Vatican's effort to end
tabloid sensationalism and cultish obsession has already spawned
new conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   And doubting Thomases. The Rev. Nicholas Gruner, director of the
Fatima Center in Fort Erie, Ontario, who has a quarterly magazine,
``Fatima Crusader'' and a Web site (www.fatima.org), has been
lobbying for full disclosure since 1978. Immediately after the
Vatican announcement last week, Gruner said in a press release:
``We pray that the original will be photographically reproduced for
wide distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``original'' is believed to be a handwritten description of
the third secret by Sister Lucia de Santos, 93, the only surviving
Fatima witness, who became a Carmelite nun. Sister de Santos
declined to include the third part of the prophecy in her 1941
memoirs recounting the apparitions of the Virgin that, she said,
began on May 13, 1917. (May 13 is also the date that Mehmet Ali
Agca shot the pope. John Paul II, who has visited Fatima three
times, has credited the Virgin of Fatima with saving his life.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Fatima historians, Sister de Santos fell so ill in
1943 that her local bishop instructed her to write down the third
secret. Too scared to read it himself, he sent it to Rome in 1957.
Five popes declined to make the secret public _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend at Fatima, on May 13, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the
Vatican secretary of state, told 600,000 believers gathered to see
the pope that the prophecy revealed to the shepherds was a vision
of a ``bishop clothed in white'' who ``falls to the ground, amid
the corpses of those who were martyred, apparently dead, under a
burst of gunfire.'' He interpreted it as a prophecy of the 1981
shooting and said the Vatican would soon publish the secret, with a
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday was the first time the pope has ever addressed
the third secret. ``I thought it opportune to make public the
contents of the so-called third part of the secret,'' he told
believers at a general audience in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has not yet explained why its experts are certain
the vision referred to John Paul II and not, for example, to the
white-robed archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, who
was shot and killed by right-wing death squads on March 24, 1980,
while celebrating Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But that interpretation would clash with Fatima's anti-communist
mystique. The first of the so-called Fatima secrets supposedly
predicted the end of World War I and the coming of World War II.
The second secret, believers say, augured that Soviet communism
would spread, then collapse and Russia would convert to
Christianity. The latter vision made Fatima an ideological shrine
for anti-communists in the Cold War, and the shooting of an
anti-communist Polish pope neatly fit the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Scoffing at Wednesday's announcement as a ``made to measure
revelation,'' Gian Enrico Rusconi, a political scientist at the
University of Turin, wrote in the Turin daily La Stampa of the
pope-centered revelation as ``frankly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some believers were disbelieving. ``It's disappointing,''
Julio Estela, 33, a Portuguese car salesman, said after the
cardinal spoke. ``I think there is more.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone. ``I believe that the third secret also spoke
of crises and divisions within the church since the Second Vatican
Council,'' Rene Laurentin, a French monk and prominent theologian
of the cult of Mary, told Italian reporters. The chief exorcist for
the Diocese of Rome and the president of the International
Association of Exorcists, the Rev. Gabriele Amorth, said the
announcement left him ``perplexed.''
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants gave the Vatican points for spin control.
Fabrizio Rondolino, an adviser to former Italian Prime Minister
Massimo d'Alema, wrote in La Stampa, ``The dependency on ever
greater doses of the supernatural, from Padre Pio to Fatima,
responds to a strategic need of the church: to recuperate, in this
way, the unconventional forms of contemporary spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only person who took the Vatican announcement at
face value besides the pope was his would-be assassin. Among the
many conflicting statements that Agca, a Turkish national, gave
prosecutors in 1985 was a claim that the shooting ``is connected to
the third secret of the Madonna of Fatima.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the disclosure, Agca has given interviews saying he acted
alone _ up to a point. ``But Agca feels he was part of a larger
design, something bigger than he,'' said his lawyer, Marina
Magistrelli, who added that after the Vatican revelation, ``now
perhaps more people will believe him.''

   Crunching Numbers on the Hustings
</P>
<P>
   They sounded at times as if they were running for
actuary-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years from now, the massive baby-boomer generation will
begin drawing benefits,'' declared Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore countered, ``The numbers just don't add
up, and under the Bush plan a serious reduction of our national
debt is simply impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue under discussion by the presumptive Republican and
Democratic nominees for president was a vital one, if not exactly
the sort that stops voters' hearts: how to protect the Social
Security system, which both candidates say is slowly going broke.
Speaking in Southern California, Bush announced a plan for
reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow
workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and
me,'' Bush said. ``He trusts the government to manage our
retirement. I trust individual Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued that Bush's plan misplaces its trust by exposing
workers' retirement money to the mercy of the markets and making it
impossible for the government to pay down the national debt. ``Tens
of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham
Business School,'' Gore said, ``would be placed in a situation
where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also revealed a protective streak with his
own investments. After Bush told reporters that Gore had a lot of
money in stocks, Gore replied that he had not invested in the
markets in 25 years for fear of an appearance of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over money matters came as a New York
Times/CBS News poll showed that most voters are thinking less about
candidates' detailed fiscal calculations than about how nice they
seem. Bush was favored over Gore in the new poll by 47 percent to
39 percent, and although more respondents liked Gore's stands on
the issues, they liked Bush even more as a person.

   Using a Mouse to Check for Mice
</P>
<P>
   Vermin. There it was in blue and white, highlighted for all the
cyberworld to see. Vermin at Le Bernardin. Vermin, ruthless and
undiscriminating, the great equalizer of the restaurant world.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for restaurants in the nation's toughest
town, as the New York City Department of Health began posting
inspection reports on the World Wide Web. From the humblest Dunkin
Donuts to the extra-chic Le Bernardin, their dirty linen, so to
speak, was on display.
</P>
<P>
   So intense was the interest in the misdeeds of the eating
establishments that the department's Web site was paralyzed within
hours of its opening on Wednesday morning. By the afternoon, the
site was getting 23,000 hits an hour, far more than it could
handle, and by Friday visitors were still being turned away because
of high traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site (http://207.127.96.244/webfood/search.htm)
provides summaries of inspection reports for each of the city's
18,000 restaurants. Some restaurateurs who felt scorched by the
reports complained that the Health Department did not provide
enough information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the staff at Le Bernardin, consistently rated one
of the finest restaurants in the city, bristled at the report of
``vermin or other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation
or service areas. What really happened, said Eric Ripert, the
restaurant's chef, was that an inspector found mice droppings in a
single bag of flour. ``We talked to our purveyor right away and
they changed all the flour,'' he said. ``I don't think we have a
mouse in the house.''

   Giuliani Abandons Campaign For U.S. Senate Seat
</P>
<P>
   What would a week in New York be without at least one jolting
development in the race for U.S. Senate? So it was that on Friday,
four days after Hillary Rodham Clinton was formally designated as
the Democratic candidate at her party's convention in Albany, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the race at a
packed-to-the-rafters news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only real surprise was how long Giuliani took to
make the decision, which came after three weeks in which it was
revealed that he was suffering from prostate cancer, that he had
struck up a close relationship with a woman who wasn't his wife and
that he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover,
after 16 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he needed to devote all his energy to deciding on
a course of treatment and running the city. The Republican Party
quickly turned to the future: at week's end, the most likely
replacement for Giuliani was Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island
Republican.

   Arrests in 1963 Bombing
</P>
<P>
   Justice delayed may not be justice served, but Alabama
prosecutors figure it is better than nothing. A grand jury indicted
Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry for the murder of four
black girls in the 1963 bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in
Birmingham. Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has been tried in the
case, one of the most heinous acts of the civil rights era. He was
convicted in 1977. Blanton and Cherry are both former Ku Klux Klan
members and have been suspects since the 1960s. Prosecutors plan to
use old and newly developed evidence.

actuary-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years from now, the massive baby-boomer generation will
begin drawing benefits,'' declared Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore countered, ``The numbers just don't add
up, and under the Bush plan a serious reduction of our national
debt is simply impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue under discussion by the presumptive Republican and
Democratic nominees for president was a vital one, if not exactly
the sort that stops voters' hearts: how to protect the Social
Security system, which both candidates say is slowly going broke.
Speaking in Southern California, Bush announced a plan for
reforming the federal retirement-benefits system that would allow
workers to invest some of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and
me,'' Bush said. ``He trusts the government to manage our
retirement. I trust individual Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued that Bush's plan misplaces its trust by exposing
workers' retirement money to the mercy of the markets and making it
impossible for the government to pay down the national debt. ``Tens
of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham
Business School,'' Gore said, ``would be placed in a situation
where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also revealed a protective streak with his
own investments. After Bush told reporters that Gore had a lot of
money in stocks, Gore replied that he had not invested in the
markets in 25 years for fear of an appearance of a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth over money matters came as a New York
Times/CBS News poll showed that most voters are thinking less about
candidates' detailed fiscal calculations than about how nice they
seem. Bush was favored over Gore in the new poll by 47 percent to
39 percent, and although more respondents liked Gore's stands on
the issues, they liked Bush even more as a person.

   Using a Mouse to Check for Mice
</P>
<P>
   Vermin. There it was in blue and white, highlighted for all the
cyberworld to see. Vermin at Le Bernardin. Vermin, ruthless and
undiscriminating, the great equalizer of the restaurant world.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough week for restaurants in the nation's toughest
town, as the New York City Department of Health began posting
inspection reports on the World Wide Web. From the humblest Dunkin
Donuts to the extra-chic Le Bernardin, their dirty linen, so to
speak, was on display.
</P>
<P>
   So intense was the interest in the misdeeds of the eating
establishments that the department's Web site was paralyzed within
hours of its opening on Wednesday morning. By the afternoon, the
site was getting 23,000 hits an hour, far more than it could
handle, and by Friday visitors were still being turned away because
of high traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site (http://207.127.96.244/webfood/search.htm)
provides summaries of inspection reports for each of the city's
18,000 restaurants. Some restaurateurs who felt scorched by the
reports complained that the Health Department did not provide
enough information.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the staff at Le Bernardin, consistently rated one
of the finest restaurants in the city, bristled at the report of
``vermin or other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation
or service areas. What really happened, said Eric Ripert, the
restaurant's chef, was that an inspector found mice droppings in a
single bag of flour. ``We talked to our purveyor right away and
they changed all the flour,'' he said. ``I don't think we have a
mouse in the house.''

   Giuliani Abandons Campaign For U.S. Senate Seat
</P>
<P>
   What would a week in New York be without at least one jolting
development in the race for U.S. Senate? So it was that on Friday,
four days after Hillary Rodham Clinton was formally designated as
the Democratic candidate at her party's convention in Albany, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani quit the race at a
packed-to-the-rafters news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only real surprise was how long Giuliani took to
make the decision, which came after three weeks in which it was
revealed that he was suffering from prostate cancer, that he had
struck up a close relationship with a woman who wasn't his wife and
that he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover,
after 16 years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he needed to devote all his energy to deciding on
a course of treatment and running the city. The Republican Party
quickly turned to the future: at week's end, the most likely
replacement for Giuliani was Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island
Republican.

   `Millionaire' Cashes In
</P>
<P>
   After taking the television by storm, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' is about to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   With more time to sell to advertisers at higher prices than any
show has ever asked, ABC is poised to make profits on the game show
that will dwarf what any previous show has ever taken in. Estimates
for next season already range from $300 million to as much as $600
million _ the latter figure is possible if the show's ratings hold
up and ABC continues to broadcast the series year round.
</P>
<P>
   As the network television selling season kicked off last week,
advertising executives said ABC was asking for prices up to
$400,000 for every 30-second commercial in ``Millionaire'' next
fall. The show is expanding to four nights a week in the new
season, which means that ABC will be selling four hours a week in
this highest priced real estate on television. Each hour will
contain about 14 30-second commercials for ABC to sell. The show
costs about $1 million an hour to produce. Even after commissions
for advertising agencies, ABC could make up to $4 million in profit
on every episode.
</P>
<P>
   The prices are expected to vary, depending on the deals that ABC
strikes with advertisers to buy time on ``Millionaire'' in
conjunction with other shows. So all the profits may not be
directly assigned to ``Millionaire.'' But if its ratings hold up,
the show will certainly earn more profit than any previous show,
and may even approach by itself the most profit any network has
made in a television season, about $500 million.

<P>
   Americans love a conspiracy theory, whether it concerns the
murder of a president or the defeat of a boxer. And so it is that
Muhammad Ali, who easily dispatched Sonny Liston in the ring, may
never beat him in the arena of popular mythology and public
opinion. There, Liston may forever be bobbing and weaving, held up
by the famous ``phantom punch'' that floored him in their
heavyweight championship fight in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of that punch in the second fight between the men not
only refuses to die, it's making a comeback just in time for the
35th anniversary of the bout, May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Tosches' new book, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' (Little,
Brown), and a coming biographical movie starring Ving Raymes are
reviving old theories that the Mob or the Black Muslims or someone
besides Ali knocked out Liston.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to recall at this distance the hold these two
fighters held over the popular imagination, even among people who
had no interest in boxing. Among the fight crowd, no heavyweight
since Joe Louis in his early 20s carried such an aura of
invincibility as Liston. He stood 6 feet 1 inches and weighed about
215 pounds, big in an era of small heavyweights. But with his
15-inch fists, 17{-inch neck and menacing scowl, he appeared bigger
and more terrifying than the tape indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Liston also had a well-deserved reputation for violence. He had
learned to box in prison and had been an arm breaker for the St.
Louis mob, which controlled his career. Blinkie Palermo, who
controlled much of big-time boxing in the 1950s and also had ties
to ``Murder, Inc.,'' was one of Liston's patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Liston seemed to cow his opponents even before they stepped into
the ring. Floyd Patterson, from whom Liston took the heavyweight
belt, appeared almost paralyzed by fear. And Liston's punching
power, particularly a paralyzing left hook to the body, was
awesome. He could also take a punch, having once fought almost an
entire fight with a broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1964, at the time of the first fight, Cassius
Clay (as Ali was then known) was viewed by the boxing establishment
as little more than a sideshow freak. Screaming ``I am so pretty!''
and spouting rhymes that predicted when he would knock out his
opponents was not how tough guys were supposed to behave. Given his
youth (22 at the time) and his unorthodox style, which included
holding his hands at his sides and leaning away from punches, most
boxing writers thought the only question was whether Liston would
permanently injure or kill him. This was reflected in the odds at
fight time, which were 7-1 against Clay.
</P>
<P>
   And then Clay won in what may have been boxing's most shocking
upset.
</P>
<P>
   To watch that fight on video today, however, is not to see an
upset. Rather, one sees the fastest heavyweight in boxing history
battering an overconfident, undertrained and probably over-the-hill
champ (Liston's age was listed as anywhere from 29 to 31, but most
people believe he was some years older than the latter figure).
Liston was badly cut around both eyes (the left eye would require
the attention of a plastic surgeon), and was unable to answer the
bell for round seven, claiming an injury to his left shoulder. The
skeptics initially scoffed, but Dr. Alexander Robbins of the Miami
Beach Boxing Commission, one of seven physicians to examine Liston,
declared, ``There's no doubt in my mind the fight should be
stopped.'' In fact, Liston had torn his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later the men met again in Lewiston, Maine, Clay
now reborn as Muhammad Ali. As with the first fight, interest in
the fight far transcended boxing's usual boundaries. This time,
however, the odds were just seven to five in favor of Liston.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the first minute of the first round, Ali knocked
Liston cold, with a punch that almost nobody saw, even those at
ringside. Immediately, there were rumors of a fix _ that Liston had
taken a dive. The famous sportswriter Jimmy Cannon, who hated Ali,
called the fight a ``swindle of a charade.'' A New York Times
editorial predicted that ``a sport as sick as this one surely
cannot survive much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   What really happened? The fight was covered both by closed
circuit television and by a film camera. The broadcast tape
provides no help; the cameras were placed in both fighters'
corners, in such a way that the punching action was never clearly
seen unless both men were broadside to one of the lenses. The film
is only marginally better. It was shot from above the ring and from
an angle that completely obscures Ali's right hand and the left
side of Liston's jaw as the knockout punch was delivered. Both for
what it does and doesn't reveal, this has become boxing's Zapruder
film.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated published a frame-by-frame analysis of the
film in its June 7, 1965, issue, concluding that Liston was, in
fact, knocked out. In the first panel of a four-shot sequence, Ali
is seen pulling back to avoid a Liston jab; in the second, he is
planting his weight on his left foot, while throwing a short right
hand over Liston's left hand; in the third, the punch is just about
to land; in the fourth, Sonny's head is snapped sideways the force
of the blow, which actually lifts Liston's left foot _ the one his
weight was on _ off the canvas, as can be seen by the shadow under
Liston's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Liston doubled the blow's impact by stepping directly into it,
and Barbara Long, who covered the fight for The Village Voice and
was seated behind Ali's corner, recalled that Liston had reacted,
when hit, ``like a man on a bicycle hitting a low-lying branch.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also circumstantial evidence that argues in favor of a
knockout. No major crime figure was known to have made big money
from betting on Clay in the first fight; and in the second fight,
with the odds so close, it would have been impossible to make a
killing betting on either man. Nor has any Black Muslim
involvement, like a threat against Liston's life, ever been proven.

   Jim Murray, perhaps the most respected sportswriter in the
country at the time, never doubted what happened. ``What
happened?'' he wrote in The Los Angeles Times. ``Well, I'll tell
you what happened. Sonny Liston got the hell beat out of him is
what happened. This time I was looking for it and I saw it: an old
man groping his way into a speedy insolent reckless kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's shot seems right on target, but it's hard to knock out
a myth.

<P>
   Americans love a conspiracy theory, whether it concerns the
murder of a president or the defeat of a boxer. And so it is that
Muhammad Ali, who easily dispatched Sonny Liston in the ring, may
never beat him in the arena of popular mythology and public
opinion. There, Liston may forever be bobbing and weaving, held up
by the famous ``phantom punch'' that floored him in their
heavyweight championship fight in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of that punch in the second fight between the men not
only refuses to die, it's making a comeback just in time for the
35th anniversary of the bout, May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Tosches' new book, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston'' (Little,
Brown), and a coming biographical movie starring Ving Raymes are
reviving old theories that the Mob or the Black Muslims or someone
besides Ali knocked out Liston.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to recall at this distance the hold these two
fighters held over the popular imagination, even among people who
had no interest in boxing. Among the fight crowd, no heavyweight
since Joe Louis in his early 20s carried such an aura of
invincibility as Liston. He stood 6 feet 1 inches and weighed about
215 pounds, big in an era of small heavyweights. But with his
15-inch fists, 17{-inch neck and menacing scowl, he appeared bigger
and more terrifying than the tape indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Liston also had a well-deserved reputation for violence. He had
learned to box in prison and had been an arm breaker for the St.
Louis mob, which controlled his career. Blinkie Palermo, who
controlled much of big-time boxing in the 1950s and also had ties
to ``Murder, Inc.,'' was one of Liston's patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Liston seemed to cow his opponents even before they stepped into
the ring. Floyd Patterson, from whom Liston took the heavyweight
belt, appeared almost paralyzed by fear. And Liston's punching
power, particularly a paralyzing left hook to the body, was
awesome. He could also take a punch, having once fought almost an
entire fight with a broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1964, at the time of the first fight, Cassius
Clay (as Ali was then known) was viewed by the boxing establishment
as little more than a sideshow freak. Screaming ``I am so pretty!''
and spouting rhymes that predicted when he would knock out his
opponents was not how tough guys were supposed to behave. Given his
youth (22 at the time) and his unorthodox style, which included
holding his hands at his sides and leaning away from punches, most
boxing writers thought the only question was whether Liston would
permanently injure or kill him. This was reflected in the odds at
fight time, which were 7-1 against Clay.
</P>
<P>
   And then Clay won in what may have been boxing's most shocking
upset.
</P>
<P>
   To watch that fight on video today, however, is not to see an
upset. Rather, one sees the fastest heavyweight in boxing history
battering an overconfident, undertrained and probably over-the-hill
champ (Liston's age was listed as anywhere from 29 to 31, but most
people believe he was some years older than the latter figure).
Liston was badly cut around both eyes (the left eye would require
the attention of a plastic surgeon), and was unable to answer the
bell for round seven, claiming an injury to his left shoulder. The
skeptics initially scoffed, but Dr. Alexander Robbins of the Miami
Beach Boxing Commission, one of seven physicians to examine Liston,
declared, ``There's no doubt in my mind the fight should be
stopped.'' In fact, Liston had torn his biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later the men met again in Lewiston, Maine, Clay
now reborn as Muhammad Ali. As with the first fight, interest in
the fight far transcended boxing's usual boundaries. This time,
however, the odds were just seven to five in favor of Liston.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the first minute of the first round, Ali knocked
Liston cold, with a punch that almost nobody saw, even those at
ringside. Immediately, there were rumors of a fix _ that Liston had
taken a dive. The famous sportswriter Jimmy Cannon, who hated Ali,
called the fight a ``swindle of a charade.'' A New York Times
editorial predicted that ``a sport as sick as this one surely
cannot survive much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   What really happened? The fight was covered both by closed
circuit television and by a film camera. The broadcast tape
provides no help; the cameras were placed in both fighters'
corners, in such a way that the punching action was never clearly
seen unless both men were broadside to one of the lenses. The film
is only marginally better. It was shot from above the ring and from
an angle that completely obscures Ali's right hand and the left
side of Liston's jaw as the knockout punch was delivered. Both for
what it does and doesn't reveal, this has become boxing's Zapruder
film.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated published a frame-by-frame analysis of the
film in its June 7, 1965, issue, concluding that Liston was, in
fact, knocked out. In the first panel of a four-shot sequence, Ali
is seen pulling back to avoid a Liston jab; in the second, he is
planting his weight on his left foot, while throwing a short right
hand over Liston's left hand; in the third, the punch is just about
to land; in the fourth, Sonny's head is snapped sideways the force
of the blow, which actually lifts Liston's left foot _ the one his
weight was on _ off the canvas, as can be seen by the shadow under
Liston's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Liston doubled the blow's impact by stepping directly into it,
and Barbara Long, who covered the fight for The Village Voice and
was seated behind Ali's corner, recalled that Liston had reacted,
when hit, ``like a man on a bicycle hitting a low-lying branch.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also circumstantial evidence that argues in favor of a
knockout. No major crime figure was known to have made big money
from betting on Clay in the first fight; and in the second fight,
with the odds so close, it would have been impossible to make a
killing betting on either man. Nor has any Black Muslim
involvement, like a threat against Liston's life, ever been proven.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Murray, perhaps the most respected sportswriter in the
country at the time, never doubted what happened. ``What
happened?'' he wrote in The Los Angeles Times. ``Well, I'll tell
you what happened. Sonny Liston got the hell beat out of him is
what happened. This time I was looking for it and I saw it: an old
man groping his way into a speedy insolent reckless kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's shot seems right on target, but it's hard to knock out
a myth.

   WASHINGTON _ When French troops in Bosnia captured Momcilo
Krajisnik last month, making him the highest-ranking Bonsian Serb
in the custody of the war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, Western officials said his arrest was a warning to
those suspects still at large that they could not sleep so easily
any more.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials here and in The Hague sounded a lot less
smug.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav defense minister who was
indicted for crimes committed during Serbia's campaign against
Kosovo's Albanians, had just spent five days in Russia, where he
was received as a dignitary despite the fact that international law
obliged Russia to arrest the man.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic's visit dismayed supporters of the tribunal, but there
was little they or the State Department could do beside issue
public condemnations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the visit underscored the fundamental frustration
facing the tribunal. Despite its recent successes in arresting and
trying war crimes suspects from the former Yugoslavia, the most
senior military and political figures under indictment remain
safely out of reach, starting with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While they may have curtailed some activities _ Milosevic is
unlikely to risk a trip abroad _ their status as the world's most
wanted men has not scared them completely underground.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after Krajisnik's arrest, a respected Bosnian
newsweekly published a detailed account of the comings and goings
of Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of Bosnia's Serbs and
also a wanted man. The same report said that Ratko Mladic, who
commanded the Bosnian Serb army, often traveled from Serbia to
visit his farm in Bosnia, where he keeps bees, despite the presence
of 20,000 NATO-led peacekeepers. A month before, he had appeared at
a soccer match in Belgrade _ with bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration over the failure to catch these men prompted the
State Department to print up thousands of ``Wanted'' posters, to be
distributed in Bosnia, that offered $5 million for information
about their whereabouts. The effort drew immediate derision _ and
not just because the first batch was printed in English (a
Serbo-Croatian version appeared later), or because it included a
toll-free 800 telephone number that would work only in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright saying he had ``the information you are looking for.'' He
noted the most recent sightings of Milosevic and Mladic and even
gave Milosevic's address: 15 Uzicka St. in Belgrade, the
president's official residence. ( Helms asked that the reward money
go to a charity in North Carolina.)
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it's natural that Serbia would become a haven for
wanted Serbs. But Helms and some human-rights advocates accuse wary
NATO peacekeepers of letting parts of Bosnia become havens too, out
of fear that arrests would provoke retaliation from nationalists
who support the suspects.

Service for AMs of Sunday, May 21:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEDICINE-MERCHANTS (Omugo, Uganda) _ Melarsoprol is melarsen
oxide dissolved in propylene glycol _ literally, arsenic in
antifreeze. It kills 5 percent of those treated with it. But it is
the only medicine available to treat advanced sleeping sickness,
one of the historic scourges of Africa. The only alternative ran
out in July after the manufacturer abandoned it as unprofitable
when it turned out to be useless against its intended target,
cancer. Sleeping sickness is perhaps the most vivid example of the
disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the
fatal or debilitating diseases of the Third World's poor. A special
report. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-CITIZENSHIP (Geneva) _ Swiss law gives foreigners who meet
the residency requirements and have no criminal record the right to
apply for Swiss nationality as long as they are integrated into
Swiss society. But foreigners must virtually become more Swiss than
the Swiss to stand a chance of holding a passport. By Elizabeth
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   PERU-FUJIMORI (Lima, Peru) _ Alberto Fujimori faces a mounting
political crisis that will surely challenge his considerable pluck
and power. Alejandro Toledo, his opponent in the May 28 runoff
presidential election, dropped out of the race on Thursday.
Fujimori was left with an open field for victory, but one in which
his legitimacy and credibility would be questioned both here and
abroad. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Only two hours after Taiwan's
new president made his inaugural address, authorities in Beijing
released a surprisingly temperate response, charging him with a
lack of sincerity but not repeating the dire threats and invective
of recent weeks. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Beijing) _ The Clinton administration has argued
that Congress should vote for normal trade relations with China
because it will strengthen reformist forces in China. The vast
majority of influential Chinese agree. For millions of Chinese, in
fact, the congressional vote _ which, if positive, would ensure
China's full participation in the World Trade Organization _ has
taken on a transcendent aura beyond the boundaries of trade or
politics. By Elisabeth Rosenthal with Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-BILL (Washington) _ If the China trade bill slips
through Congress this week, as some supporters now expect, Sander
M. Levin, a Democrat who has voted against all of President
Clinton's major trade initiatives, will take some credit for
helping provide the margin of victory. Levin won backing from House
leaders late last week to amend the bill granting China permanent
trade ties, to establish a human rights and trade policy monitoring
commission for China. Vote counters on both sides of the aisle said
the proposal, co-sponsored by Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., has helped
recruit perhaps two dozen undecided lawmakers into the pro-trade
camp. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-RUSSIA (Warsaw, Poland) _ In Poland, long a trophy of
East-West competition and now one of NATO's newest members, the
installation of Vladimir Putin as Russia's president has raised new
questions about Moscow's intentions. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   BLAIR-BABY (London) _ Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister
Tony Blair, gave birth to a baby boy early Saturday, and hours
later, mother, father and son left the London hospital for a quiet
weekend in the privacy of 10 Downing St. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-MBEKI-AIDS (Undated) _ When President Thabo Mbeki of
South Africa said last year that AZT was too dangerous to give to
HIV-infected pregnant women, AIDS researchers and activists were
taken aback. The drug is commonly used to prevent transmission of
the disease to newborns. That reaction turned to shock when Mbeki
appointed an AIDS advisory panel that included researchers who have
postulated that HIV does not cause the disease, a position long
rejected by the overwhelming majority of doctors and scientists.
Now Mbeki is embarking on his first state visit to the United
States since succeeding Nelson Mandela as president last year, and
activists and those who treat AIDS are wondering how to greet him.
By Daniel J. Wakin.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-SEPARATISTS (Janthoe Baru, Indonesia) _ Separatists in
Aceh, a staunchly Muslim region on the northern tip of Sumatra,
have been fighting for independence since 1976 and pose a major
problem for President Abdurrahman Wahid as he tries to stabilize
his nation of 210 million people. Many people say that it is of far
greater urgency for Indonesia to stop Aceh from slipping away than
it was in the case of East Timor, which voted for independence last
year.

   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   ILL-DEATH-PENALTY (Chicago) _ Four months after he rekindled the
death penalty debate by imposing a moratorium on executions in
Illinois, Gov. George Ryan says he doubts any inmates will be put
to death while he remains in office. The governor, a Republican,
has appointed a commission to study ways to fix problems with the
death penalty and says he will not go ahead with executions unless
the panel can give him ``a 100 percent guarantee'' against any
mistaken death-row convictions. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT-MEXICANS (Detroit) _ When 18-year-old Jesus Lopez
arrived here 18 years ago, he was convinced that those Mexicans who
had come before him were crazy. ``In those days, over here there
was only burned-out houses,'' he recalled. But today, Detroit is
being hailed as the nation's new Mexican boomtown. A wave of new
arrivals started showing up here six years ago, most directly from
Mexico. They say they came to escape rising costs and growing
hostilities against immigrants in Arizona, California and Chicago,
and to reunite with older relatives who had been cashing in on
Detroit's labor shortage for more than a decade. By Nichole M.
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER-TREATMENT (New Orleans) _ Responding to a call to improve
the quality of cancer care in the United States, a leading cancer
organization said that it was working with other groups to develop
a national system to monitor how well each cancer patient is
treated. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   WONDERLAND-MURDERS (Los Angeles) _ Federal prosecutors have
reached back to history here to revive a sensational murder case,
unveiling an indictment that alleges that a former nightclub mogul,
his bodyguard and a pornography actor killed four people in the
Hollywood Hills nearly two decades ago. The ``Wonderland murders,''
so-named after the site, 4763 Wonderland Ave., where the killings
took place on July 1, 1981, proved a potent mix of seamy celebrity,
drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-BIO (Midland, Texas) _ Part 1: A Boy From Midland. Many of
the roots of George W. Bush's political philosophy as a
presidential candidate seem to go back to his childhood in Midland,
a conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from
25,000 when he was a little boy to almost 100,000 today. A special
report. Articles in this series will examine the lives of the
presidential candidates as the campaign progresses. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.

</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-WEBSITES (Undated) _ In the 2000 election, independent
and home-grown Web pages created by individual voters with some
Web-design skills and a little spare time are multiplying
exponentially. Often rivaling the sophistication of the official
Web sites, these grass-roots Web sites are a new way for ordinary
voters to engage in the political process _ a high-tech version,
many say, of putting a sign in a voter's front yard or a bumper
sticker on a car. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   POLTICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ A Republican invades Democratic
territory; Loophole inspires legislative end run; Internet

   MEDICAID (Washington) _ Hundreds of millions of dollars set
aside by the federal government to help provide health insurance to
poor people leaving welfare remains unused because states have not
claimed the money, a new accounting by the Department of Health and
Human Services shows. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   DC-MAYOR (Washington) _ If all continues to go well, the
nation's capital will be allowed out of the intensive care ward
fashioned by Congress sometime next year. The District of Columbia
will not only regain home-rule prerogatives lost in its profligate
past; it will also confirm the stewardship of Mayor Anthony A.
Williams, an unlikely politician as bland in his style as the paint
on the municipal walls. By Francis X. Clines.

   SANTA FE, N.M. _ As the site of the secret workshops of the
Manhattan Project, Los Alamos is known to history as ``the atomic
city'' _ the place where scientists harnessed nuclear power,
building the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. The Cerro Grande fire,
which burned on last week, was a reminder of how absurd it is to
believe that mankind can ever harness a force of nature. Los Alamos
learned to tap the power of nuclear energy. But it was brought to a
standstill by a different kind of chain reaction: ordinary fire.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the Los Alamos National Laboratory has steeled
itself against the possibility of a nuclear missile strike. It has
guarded against terrorists, spies and computer hackers. But the
threat that turned out to be most immediate was disquietingly
familiar: the tens of thousands of acres of neighboring Ponderosa
forests that crowd the Pajarito plateau and the adjacent Jemez
mountains, and which exploded, as had long been feared, into a
firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   A small ``controlled burn'' _ in Cerro Grande's aftermath, the
very term has become suspect _ was lit May 4 in a remote corner of
Bandelier National Monument, a canyon wilderness sheltering cliff
dwellings and stone-walled ruins of the ancient people called
Anasazi. The idea was to clear encroaching pines and other
combustible debris from an overgrown mountain meadow, making it
safer from fire. But winds unexpectedly pushed the flames beyond
the prescribed perimeter, and ultimately beyond imagination and
control.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours the fire had overwhelmed the small team assigned to
it. A ``back burn'' lit three days later to control the first blaze
_ literally fighting fire with fire _ raced out of control and
began sweeping toward Los Alamos. Before it was over, more than
47,000 acres of forest _ roughly three times the size of Manhattan
_ had been consumed in the biggest fire in the history of New
Mexico, a dry, heavily timbered state that has become accustomed to
mammoth conflagrations. Los Alamos was evacuated, its residents
returning to find more than 200 residences destroyed. Late last
week, the fire was on its way to being contained, but firefighters
predicted that it would continue burning for many days.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists at the lab who study complex systems like whirlpools
and thunderstorms _ not everyone there designs bombs _ often refer
to a phenomenon called ``sensitive dependence on initial
conditions.'' Chaos, for short. Tiny actions, the theory goes, can
have enormous, unforeseeable consequences. The idea has entered the
culture of popular science as ``the butterfly effect.'' A
mythological insect flapping its wings in Rio de Janiero causes a
hurricane off the coast of Louisiana. A small fire routinely lit to
clear a few hundred acres of tinder closes down a nuclear research
center.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters try to plan their intentional burns like lab
technicians preparing for an experiment. They gather data _ the
moisture content of the wood, the wind speed, the relative humidity
and temperature of the air. They plug the factors into a computer
model _ those assemblages of software that spin the comforting
illusion that nature can be contained by numbers. They take into
account the lay of the land, whether natural features like cliffs
and streams will help enclose the burning. And they consider how
likely it is that the plan could go awry (a factor crucial in the
postmortem of Cerro Grande) and what it would take to set it right
again.
</P>
<P>
   But one can never know how the butterfly will flap its wings. A
sudden wind or a moment of inattention can make the calculations
irrelevant. Whipped by gales like the ones that overtook Cerro
Grande, the fire creates its own weather, becoming so large that,
like a hurricane, it is given its own name.
</P>
<P>
   Results from a preliminary Interior Department investigation
laid the blame not on the precision of the data or the accuracy of
the calculations but on matters of human judgment. The fact that
strong prevailing winds were on the horizon was left out of a
National Weather Service report, and no one asked for the missing
data. Compounding this oversight, planners at Bandelier
underestimated the potential complexity of the situation _ how many
people and how much equipment they would need if the fire didn't
behave as it was supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   There was a list of other deviations as well, the seriousness of
which will be evaluated as investigators try to determine which
butterflies' flapping did most to spread the flames. Taken together
they tell a familiar story: there was a gulf between the way the
fire played out in the calculations of the planners and the way it
unfolded in the unforgiving real world.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and homeowners were eager to have a specific
villain to blame, but the culpability was far more diffuse.
Large-scale cattle grazing and the clear-cutting of timber in the
19th century, followed by decades of dutiful suppression of natural
wildfires, have conspired to produce thickets of highly combustible
pines all over the region.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Forest Service report warned that during the
next five years there was a 30 percent chance of a large fire
striking the woods around Los Alamos, sparked perhaps by one of the
numerous summer lightning storms. And a Department of Energy report
published last year concluded that ``a major fire moving up to the
edge of Los Alamos National Laboratory is not only credible but
likely.''

   The same danger threatens forests all over the West. At the same
time as Cerro Grande, two major fires in southern New Mexico were
burning, one ignited by a downed power line, the other by a
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Two devastating fires had come dangerously close to Los Alamos
in 1977 and 1996. After the second one, tinder was cleared to
create firebreaks. But protecting the town from something like
Cerro Grande would have taken a huge public works program _ a kind
of Manhattan Project involving saws and axes. Whether that would
have been as costly as the estimated billion dollars in damage the
fire has caused is now a matter of historical curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fire was burning on the grounds of a nuclear lab,
people downwind have naturally feared contaminated smoke. But air
monitoring indicates that the most significant radiation and toxins
released were the naturally occurring kind, as inevitably happens
when millions of sap-filled trees are set afire. Even when it comes
to pollution, nature again outdoes the efforts of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   Having been besieged by fire, Los Alamos will soon face another
elemental threat: water, when the annual rainy season begins in
late June or early July. Repelled by the ash-covered ground, and
undeterred by burnt-over vegetation, water is expected to sweep
down the canyons toward the Rio Grande, causing large-scale
erosion. How significantly trace contaminants in the soil _ both
from the lab and released naturally by the fire _ will add to the
problem is uncertain. But there is enough to fear from the water
and the silt itself.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists still debate what drove the Anasazi from their
stone settlements. Drought, warfare, boredom _ no one really knows.
The abandonment of Los Alamos was brief and the ruins will be
rebuilt. But it's hard to escape the conclusion that the modern
settlers were driven off the plateau by the cumulative force of
their leaders' own actions and indecisions. And by the illusion
that they were in control.

   ABU DIS, West Bank _ It took Yasser Arafat many years to arrive
at the gate of Jerusalem. But last week, when Israel conceded to
him full control of Abu Dis and two other villages, the chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization moved one step nearer to a
dream that had sustained him through his exile in Tunisia. The
villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem, but one with a bird's
eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is well known to be an intense symbolic focal point
for both Israelis and Palestinians _ as well as for Jews,
Christians and Muslims worldwide. But when the dusty neighboring
town of Abu Dis was finally given over to Palestinian control, it
briefly reminded everyone that even physical Jerusalem is a loaded
concept: Its borders, fixed on a map, are blurred on the ground in
an emotionally complicated, politicized way.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis epitomizes a reality usually obscured in the simplistic
public debate about Jerusalem and its fate: Just as the village is
integrated with the Jerusalem area geographically, economically and
socially, East Jerusalem itself is entwined with the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last week, but it was still left unsaid.
Jerusalem is rarely publicly discussed by Israeli or Palestinian
leaders in anything but black-and-white terms. It is the ``eternal,
undivided capital'' of Israel, on the one hand, and the future
capital of the Palestinian state on the other: seemingly
irreconcilable concepts that have led many intelligent politicians
to recommend that the issue be left unresolved in the current,
supposedly final, peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is very much on the table in the serious,
non-secret back-channel negotiations that are under way in
Stockholm. And experts agree that the private discussion will have
to be creative and realistic enough to take into account the
lessons of Abu Dis and acknowledge that the dynamic on the
Jerusalem issue shifted last week, even if quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when you are talking about sovereignty, the Palestinian
people will say we are in the sphere,'' said Zakaria al Qaq,
co-director of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and
Information in Jerusalem. ``It is no longer pure abstraction. That
battle for Jerusalem that was being waged long distance will now be
fought up close.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Israel's decision was hardly celebrated. In fact, as the
Parliament was voting to transfer the territory to the
Palestinians, the West Bank was aflame in violent confrontation
with the Israelis. When the intense violence died down,
Palestinians made it clear that they were not elated, even if they
were relieved. Israel was supposed to withdraw from 28 villages in
the Jerusalem area by last year under the Oslo peace agreement,
they said. Just three was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   And furthermore: Abu Dis looks like a village and, with raw
sewage flowing roadside, it smells like a village. No Palestinian
will ever mistake Abu Dis for Jerusalem itself. If the Israelis
intend it as an alternative capital for the Palestinians state,
which is what Barak seemed to be saying last week, Palestinians
find this an insult, a joke and a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abu Dis is closer to the heart of the contested city than
is the Israeli Parliament or the Israeli prime minister's
headquarters. After the physical transfer takes place, Arafat can
be photographed with his uniformed troops against the backdrop of
the famous minaret of the holy city's skyline. He can open an
office in the town's modern new governmental building and place his
desk chair in Jerusalem proper, since the building is reportedly a
few feet over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Israeli right wing reacted last week with audible
emotion _ anger. They saw the concession of Abu Dis to mean that
the peace talks had come to the endpoint they had long feared: a
negotiation over the status of Jerusalem itself. In tours of Abu
Dis, they found out what Palestinians know: Abu Dis and the other
two villages may not be Jerusalem, but on the ground that
distinction vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal border actually transects the town, so the only
way to tell where Jerusalem leaves off and Abu Dis begins is by the
city sidewalks that abruptly end. Abu Dis residents work in
Jerusalem, shop in Jerusalem and pray in Jerusalem _ whether or not
they have proper papers to move back and forth. There are seven
checkpoints leading to Jerusalem from the West Bank, one official
noted, but there are 70 roads and paths by which to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current municipal boundaries are irrelevant,'' said
Menachem Klein, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies. ``Abu Dis is part of Jerusalem functionally, just
as the 200,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem are part of the West Bank.
No Israeli or Palestinian leader can ignore this reality, whatever
they say publicly.''

Jerusalem, shop in Jerusalem and pray in Jerusalem _ whether or not
they have proper papers to move back and forth. There are seven
checkpoints leading to Jerusalem from the West Bank, one official
noted, but there are 70 roads and paths by which to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current municipal boundaries are irrelevant,'' said
Menachem Klein, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies. ``Abu Dis is part of Jerusalem functionally, just
as the 200,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem are part of the West Bank.
No Israeli or Palestinian leader can ignore this reality, whatever
they say publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a reality that existed when the Jordanians held East
Jerusalem and the West Bank, continued after the Israeli annexation
of East Jerusalem, and quietly redefined itself after the PLO
returned from exile and became the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Through his ministers, Barak has leaked some ideas for
addressing this reality, ideas more nuanced than his public
discourse. In addition to testing the potentially explosive notion
of internationalizing the Old City, they have floated the
possibility of ceding civil control of the Palestinian population
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In their public response, Palestinian officials sneered, since
the idea does not include land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abu Dis has been a prime example of just how completely
the Palestinians can control something that is not really theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Osman Nasser, a senior PLO veteran, was named the governor
of Jerusalem for the Palestinian Authority at the start of 1996.
Jerusalem proper being unavailable, he opened his main office in
Abu Dis, in a former Israeli military headquarters that originally
served as the mansion of a key clan _ the Erekat family of Saeb
Erekat, a senior negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   From the veranda, the Dome of the Rock seems a stone's throw
away. Inside, a three-dimensional replica of the dome graces the
governor's coffee table, and above it hangs a wall-sized photograph
of the dome-dominated skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in divisions between the West Bank and
Jerusalem,'' the governor said over a glass of sweet, hot tea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Jerusalem send representatives to the Palestinian
legislature and the Palestinian entity is part of their lives _ not
only politically but organically, since it is involved in their
schools, their health insurance claims, their properties and their
families. Palestinians regularly travel to Abu Dis so that the
governor can adjudicate their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinian Authority was created, Abu Dis has been
built up partly because of its proximity to Jerusalem and partly
for parochial reasons. Abu Ala, a senior PLO official and now the
Parliament speaker, re-settled there, in his clan's village, and
this created a boomlet. Abu Dis became home to the largest branch
of Al-Quds University, to many ministries and to the new government
building that everyone imagines to be the future Palestinian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Israel technically retained security control of Abu Dis until it
finally relinquished that last week. But the Jerusalem commander of
the Palestinian police is already based there, as are four branches
of Arafat's security forces _ minus their uniforms and supposedly
minus their guns.
</P>
<P>
   That is why even in Abu Dis, the Israeli vote was seen as a
largely symbolic step. It even raised fears among residents that a
border fence would be built to separate them from Jerusalem, and
that they and the Palestinian people would be left with their noses
pressed against the slats _ so close and so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are today closer than ever to Jerusalem,'' said Abdul
Rahman al-Shamali, the muezzin who calls Muslims to prayer at one
of five mosques in the conservative, religious town. ``But to be
frank, I am sad. I fear that it will end here. I fear that my heart
is going to be divided. Jerusalem is my heart.''

for Sunday, May 21, moved Saturday.

<P>
   This final budget adds YUGO-WARCRIMES-REVIEW and eliminates the
previously budgeted HEIGHT-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   LOSALAMOS-CHAOS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Theorists at the Los Alamos
lab who study complex systems ranging from financial markets to
thunderstorms _ not everyone there designs bombs _ often refer to a
phenomenon called ``sensitive dependence on initial conditions.''
Chaos, for short. Tiny actions can have enormous, unforeseeable
outcomes. The idea has entered the culture of popular science as
``the butterfly effect'': A butterfly flapping its wings in Rio de
Janeiro causes a hurricane off the coast of Louisiana. A small fire
routinely lit to clear a few hundred acres of tinder erupts into a
firestorm that closes down a nuclear facility and sends a plume of
smoke billowing into Texas and Colorado. By George Johnson. (Moved
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Abu Dis, West Bank) _ It took
Yasser Arafat many years to arrive at the gate of Jerusalem. But
last week, when Israel conceded to him full control of Abu Dis and
two other villages, the PLO chairman moved one step nearer to his
dream. The villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem but one with
a bird's eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock. By Deborah
Sontag. (Moved in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LISTON-CONSPIRACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans love a conspiracy
theory, whether it concerns the murder of a president or the defeat
of a boxer. And so it is that, Muhammad Ali, who easily dispatched
Sonny Liston in the ring, may never beat him in popular mythology
and public opinion. There, Liston may forever be held up by the
famous ``phantom punch'' that floored him in their heavyweight
championship fight in 1965. The myth of that unseen punch is making
a comeback just in time for the 35th anniversary of the bout. A new
book, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston,'' and an upcoming biographical
movie are giving new life to old theories that the Mob or the Black
Muslims or someone besides Ali sent Liston to the canvas. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   ABU-JAMAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For whatever symbolic figures may
be worth, Mumia Abu-Jamal, whose appeal to the federal courts for a
new trial could receive a response any day now, has become the most
recognizable death row inmate. And while the United States is the
industrialized world's leader in executions, doubts are now raised
by mainstream politicians about how this accelerating aspect of
criminal justice can ever be run fairly enough for accused
murderers who can not afford a competent defense. But is Mumia the
right poster boy for the anti-death-penalty movement? By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ To many interest groups on
both the left and the right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not
so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the
White House. It's about who Gore or Bush would put on the Supreme
Court, where vacancies are a good possibility during the next
presidential term. Three of the nine justices are age 70 or older.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ When racing commentators discussed
Adam Petty's death at the New Hampshire International Speedway last
week, few pointed out that he died far from Daytona, and in the
heart of Yankee country. NASCAR, once identified with the
Southeast, has traveled a long way since the first racers came
roaring down from the mountains in their bootlegging cars. By
Susanna Rodell.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SEASON-REVIEW (New York) _ After last week's annual four-day
rite in which network executives nervously announce their new
programs to advertisers, the question on the minds of media buyers,
talent agents and managers and TV executives at the elaborate
parties around the city was: Is this really the best that network
television can offer? By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   WILLS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excepts from some memorable and
bizarre wills.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   WARLORDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The capture of Foday Sankoh, the
notorious Sierra Leone warlord, highlights a longtime question:
Just how much business can good guys afford to do with bad guys?
The presumption in democratic societies these days is that
strongmen who inflict terrible crimes, whether on their neighbors
or on their own people, should pay for their wrongdoing. But the
reality has not been so simple. As the 1990s spawned warlords from
Yugoslavia to Haiti, from Cambodia to Africa, the basic principle
was often sacrificed to the pragmatic interests of striking peace
deals, no matter how dubious or shaky. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN-SECRETS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When the Vatican revealed that
the long-suppressed 1917 prophecy called the Third Secret of Fatima
was something that has already happened _ the 1981 assassination
attempt on Pope John Paul II _ many conspiracy theories and
doomsday scenarios were deflated. Fatima junkies had believed the
Third Secret was so terrifying that no pope dared reveal it. But
somehow the Fatima mystery lives on; the Vatican's effort to end to
tabloid sensationalism and cultish obsession has instead spawned a
new breed of conspiracy theories. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-WARCRIMES-REVIEW (Washington) _ Wanted, but how badly?
Despite the war crimes tribunal's successes in arresting and trying
suspects from the former Yugoslavia, the most senior military and
political figures under indictment remain safely out of reach. By
Steven Lee Myers.

CHIEF DENIES SYSTEMATIC CIVIL RIGHTS ABUSES IN LAPD
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Daily News Staff Writers Alexa Haussler and Rick Orlov
contributed to this story.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breaking his silence on the threatened federal
lawsuit against the LAPD, Chief Bernard C. Parks defended the
department's overall performance and denies it is guilty of
systematic civil rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview since the U.S. Justice Department
ultimatum was issued two weeks ago, Parks told the Los Angeles
Daily News that key deficiencies identified by the LAPD's Board of
Inquiry _ management oversight, training and tracking officer
misconduct _ already are being corrected and reforms are being
implemented in light of the Rampart Division scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that no one could go into our files and find
a use of force, an officer-involved shooting or a personnel matter
with which they would disagree,'' Parks said. ``But when you look
at the totality ... we don't see the actions or activities
citywide, or in the concentration (of Rampart).
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, if it was a pattern and practice, then the
management would condone the activities or actions of employees, or
the training perpetuates those activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department under acting civil rights chief Bill Lann
Lee, a former Los Angeles attorney, has threatened to sue the city
alleging ``a pattern and practice'' of civil rights violations by
the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the government's case, based on a four-year
investigation, have not been revealed to city officials, who are
negotiating a possible consent decree that could lead to
appointment of a federal monitor and allow a federal judge to
review the department's performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview late last week, Parks insisted the LAPD's
problems can be, and are being, corrected by the department's
management.
</P>
<P>
   Even as crime is dropping, Parks said problem officers are being
disciplined or retrained, as evidenced by a steep decline in
reported use of force, officer-involved shootings and vehicle
pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is not being addressed citywide or
departmentwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said that while dirty-cop-turned-informant Rafael Perez
and his partners engaged in a practice of illegally arresting
people, the department's investigations don't support a wider
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen that occur citywide, or in any kind of
conscious or orchestrated event,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a variety of ways people (officers) have gotten in
trouble, but many of them are isolated, where officers made poor
decisions. But that's not something that's condoned by the
department, nor is it a conspiracy among officers to do something
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks also expressed concern about the impact of a consent
decree that would give a monitor and federal judge oversight of the
LAPD, undermining, he said, the ability of any chief to run the
department successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think that in order to have some real benefit from the
chief of police, you've got to allow him to do his job,'' he added.
``If you say you need another layer of involvement, then there's no
incentive for chiefs to be honest and forthright in their
departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks' comments came as Los Angeles officials led by City
Attorney James Hahn have opened talks with Lee and other Justice
Department officials about reforming the LAPD in the face of
charges that there is a pattern of excessive force, false arrests
and unreasonable searches and seizures by officers.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic schools of thought on what violates the
relatively untested ``pattern or practice'' statute signed into law
under the 1994 Crime Bill, civil rights and government lawyers tend
to agree.
</P>
<P>
   One test is whether a department has engaged in a high number of
civil rights violations; the second is whether its management has
condoned or minimized egregious acts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mayor Richard Riordan's assurances the Justice
Department won't sue the city and that an agreement can be reached
that would maintain local control of the LAPD, there is no
indication federal attorneys are backing away from their consent
decree demand, with its oversight punch repugnant to Parks and
other LAPD managers.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and his Justice Department staff in a meeting last week gave
city leaders a six-inch stack of copies of consent decrees obtained
for police departments in Pittsburgh; Steubenville, Ohio; and the
New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Imposition of an LAPD consent decree has a unified lobby in
local civil rights groups and lawyers - some with close ties to Lee
or members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chief is wrong; it would be foolish to try to
litigate this case,'' said Michael Small, chief counsel for the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and a former
Justice Department civil rights division attorney in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Justice Department, the ACLU has seized on the LAPD's
Board of Inquiry review of the Rampart corruption scandal as an
admission of widespread civil rights violations. Parks calls that a
misinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reads like a road map to bring a pattern and practice
lawsuit at least for a failure to oversee Rampart CRASH (Community
Resources Against Street Hoodlums),'' Small said of the LAPD
internal investigation released March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chock-full of events on the street, and descriptions of a
management and supervision style that's the kernel of a pattern and
practice lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has urged the Justice Department to include racial
profiling remedies in any consent decree, following a federal
lawsuit filed in February alleging the constitutional rights of
minority drivers routinely are violated by LAPD officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know about the racial profiling lawsuit and we've
suggested that racial profiling be placed on the table,'' said
Small, who as a Justice Department attorney participated in
monitoring the Pittsburgh racial profiling element of that city's
consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has declined to discuss the details of the case. City
officials said they're encouraged they will be advised of the
specifics in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said today's police force is far different from the one
the Christopher Commission found in 1991 to contain dozens of
problem officers who had gone unidentified by the department or
were tolerated despite repeated citizen complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation has been obscured, he said, by the Rampart
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling reform from a civil rights perspective
is an LAPD order issued last month requiring watch commanders to
review the probable cause for all people who are jailed, and to
check them for injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said Rampart was a vector that pointed out systemwide
indifference among officers to the correct processing of
incarcerated persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were not paying attention when arrestees were put into
custody,'' Parks said. ``People were being taken off the street and
taken to jail without the review of a supervisor. Rampart alerted
us to it, but it's a systemwide issue. We corrected it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks claims a series of other measures show the LAPD is
addressing its shortcomings and moving in the right direction.
Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --Discretion to reject citizen complaints has been removed from
area supervisors, who culled out so many complaints in the past
that citizen concerns were severely underreported. The number of
citizen complaints under department review jumped from 1,800 in
1997 to about 5,000 in each of the last two years, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   --Citizens can no longer stop investigations by rescinding
complaints. An unusual number of rescinded complaints were recorded
at Rampart CRASH, where people said officers intimidated them to
recant.
</P>
<P>
   --Captains who sit on disciplinary boards of rights have been
instructed by Parks to impose suitably severe penalties on officers
found guilty of administrative allegations. In 1998 and 1999, a
total of 100 officers were fired. Over the previous seven years, 95
officers were fired, LAPD records show.
</P>
<P>
   --A complete review of discipline would show more officers are
punished for verbal or physical abuse of citizens, Parks contended.
A review of 1998 terminations showed six officers fired for on-duty
transgressions involving force, verbal abuse or lack of probable
cause. The other 48 officers were fired for a variety of on- and
off-duty infractions.
</P>
<P>
   --Officers are more likely to be assigned to a desk job for
serious violations that fall short of termination, and sometimes
forfeit the right to carry a weapon, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   --The reconstitution of CRASH into anti-gang units that are
trained in gang abatement, but restrained from doing major
narcotics work, has been completed. Before Perez was convicted of
stealing $1 million worth of cocaine from a department evidence
locker, he said he and other cops gave drugs to informants, planted
evidence on suspects and sold drugs.
</P>
<P>
   --Limiting use of informants to detectives, and in rare
instances to other officers with advance permission, is now
standard policy.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said in his estimation the department has finally done
what its critics have demanded for decades: reviewed and then
talked about itself candidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we haven't broken the code of silence in our (Board of
Inquiry) report, then when does this code of silence get broken?''
</P>
<P>
   Small, the ACLU's chief counsel, said complaints of LAPD officer
mistreatment continue to pour into the office.
</P>
<P>
   (THIRD TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``hundreds'' of complaints alleging racial
profiling in stopping minority drivers, Small said there is
considerable anecdotal evidence of continued civil rights
violations on the streets of minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard hundreds of other people who have had terrifying
encounters with gang units over the last couple of years and
continuing to the present day - so much so as to suggest the
Justice Department is right on in saying there is a pattern and
practice of abuse across town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John W. Harris, who grew up in Watts, said that in the
absence of empirical evidence to substantiate an across-the-board
civil rights accusation, the perception of such a pattern persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually manifests itself in people sharing stories. A
certain person is stopped and harassed for no apparent reason;
minority drivers get stopped more often than white,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Justice Department lawyers have been provided with
such anecdotal evidence in support of minority communities'
insistence that the infection of police abuse persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the stories we hear, it's not just some rogue cops at
Rampart; we're talking about lawless officers all over town,''
Small said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the department faces a long road to complete the
reform process and re-establish its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Central is a new computer tracking system, which would
efficiently give managers the kind of narrative on problem officers
necessary to make informed decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The existing system _ subject to harsh Justice Department
criticism _ is more an indicator of problems, but prone to failure
if managers don't follow up with time-consuming paper research. A
federal grant to improve the system was never used by the
department _ an issue that has been seized on by critics of the
LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said ultimately no single reform is the panacea, but
rather the integration of better systems with better-trained
managers is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has solidly backed him in the face of intense
criticism, and Parks said he will not back down in his beliefs
about reforming the LAPD, nor will he walk away from the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll continue on as chief as long as the city allows me to,''
he said. &QL;

THOUSANDS OF HOMES ATTEST TO LAE ARCHITECT'S ENDURING INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten thousand families in the San Fernando Valley
can thank him for their distinctive homes.
</P>
<P>
   But few know the name Edward H. Fickett, the man responsible for
that signature look.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the ``creator of the San Fernando Valley'' and the
``Frank Lloyd Wright of the '50s'' by magazines of that time,
Fickett died a year ago May 21 at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   During his five-decade career, he designed lavish resorts,
government projects, and mansions for Joan Crawford and other
Hollywood stars. But the legacy probably enjoyed by more people
than any other is the collection of tract homes Fickett specialized
in during the 1950s and '60s. They cover Southern California, with
10,000 built in the Valley alone.
</P>
<P>
   They feature expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. Open kitchens
connect to dining rooms. Wood, brick and glass are used throughout.
And each of the huge windows leads to a patio or garden area, ``to
bring the outside in,'' as Fickett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to create luxury homes at affordable prices.
Something that was geared toward the middle class,'' said his wife,
Joyce Fickett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would put in 14-foot high ceilings and glass walls. It made
it look like you had this huge, huge home,'' even if it was only
1,600 or 2,000 square feet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fickett designs appeared on the covers of Sunset, Better Homes &AMP;
Gardens, American Home, Architectural Digest and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were admired within the industry and magazines,'' said
Richard Fish, a retired architectural photographer who lives in a
Fickett home in the Valley community of Encino that he and his wife
bought 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-generation Angeleno, Fickett created homes for Ava
Gardner and Dick Clark, and a residence on Switzerland's Lake
Geneva for Charlie Chaplin. He designed the original Sands Hotel in
Las Vegas, and the passenger and cargo terminals at the Port of Los
Angeles, for which he won one of his numerous national awards. He
supervised construction of Pacific bases while with the Navy in
World War II, and devised the master plans for Edwards and Norton
Air Force bases.
</P>
<P>
   But in between the high-profile jobs, he designed stylish
residences for average families - fighting the trend of plain,
cookie-cutter creations other architects churned out to meet the
exploding housing demand.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, the greatest boom time in the Valley's
history, the population surged from 500,000 to 1.2 million. Many of
those arrivals were World War II veterans starting families and new
jobs, and looking for their own slice of the new suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the poor guy trying to get that first home, Fickett
designed it for him,'' said Tiger Palmer, 83, who's been selling
real estate in the Valley since 1958. The first five houses he sold
were Ficketts, in the San Fernando Valley community of Sherman
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor GI when he came out, he couldn't afford more than
$12,000'' for a home, Palmer said. ``He designed those homes, and
gave them everything someone would pay $20,000 for.''
</P>
<P>
   They had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, copper plumbing and
metal-framed windows that wouldn't rot like wooden ones, Palmer
said. And Fickett saved money by using colored plaster instead of
paint, concrete slabs instead of wood floors and carports instead
of garages, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the pioneer in modern, low-cost housing,'' Palmer said.
``He was what you called the gift to the poor man. He gave a home
that was more than just a couple of bedrooms and a bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his homes are real sleek and modern,'' he said. ``He was
20 years ahead of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Fickett said her late husband's desire to provide splendid
homes at modest prices originated during his childhood, when the
Great Depression forced his family to move from a mansion in Laurel
Canyon to a cramped apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Fickett, a tall, youthful, gregarious man, whom passers-by often
mistook for Jimmy Stewart, attended the architecture school at the
University of Southern California. But once again, hard times
intervened and forced him to leave after his first year and go to
work for his father, a building contractor.
</P>
<P>
   On one job, for actress Irene Dunne, he walked into the kitchen
for a glass of water and found her crying at the table. She said
the renowned architects she'd hired from New York and Italy
couldn't translate her vision. Fickett asked what she wanted, and
began drawing plans on the back of her blueprints as she spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my son! Keep going! This is what I want. They haven't
understood,'' Joyce Fickett said Dunne told her husband, then still
a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, an anonymous donor paid Fickett's way back to
USC, completely covering his tuition, books, room and board. Years
later, Dunne confirmed it was her.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During his career Fickett designed 60,000 structures, including
the pool complex at Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park, which he completed
three months before he died.
</P>
<P>
   He designed the new extension to the Nethercutt Antique Car
Museum in Sylmar, as well as the Bistro Gardens restaurant in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   He began the historic and seismic renovation of City Hall tower,
under then-Mayor Tom Bradley. And he restored to its original
design the city's first fire station, which had been gutted in a
blaze, but which reopened last year as the African-American
Firefighter Museum in South Central L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Fickett had the respect and admiration of his colleagues,
winning the highest honors of the American Institute of Architects.
But Fickett never was a household word, a brand name like Frank
Lloyd Wright, or even as famous as other L.A. architects of the
era, such as Richard Neutra or Rudolph Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've always asked myself. Why isn't Fickett
better known?'' said Annie Constantinesco, a Beverly Hills
real-estate agent who has lived in a Fickett house in Sherman Oaks
since 1988. ``He did not like publicity. I don't think he put
himself forward. He did not give interviews - maybe he wasn't
looking for the limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Fickett said he was exceedingly modest, even with her, and
recalled a trip they took to the exclusive La Costa Resort and Spa
north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they were packing to leave, ``he said, 'Joyce, what do
you think of this place?' I said, 'It's beautiful.' He said, 'What
do you think of it architecturally?'''
</P>
<P>
   He finally confessed to designing the resort and its 36-hole
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fickett drew up plans for hotels in Reno and Palm
Springs, resorts in La Paz and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and 17 homes
for the glitterati in Malibu, many of them along one stretch of
Broad Beach Road.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to foster an interest in architecture among
students at universities nationwide by forming the AIA Lecture
Series in the 1950s. He toured the country with Wright, Neutra,
Schindler, R. Buckminster Fuller and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   During one lecture tour, Fickett picked up Wright at the
Biltmore Hotel to drive him to their speaking engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to show him some of the newer stuff that had been
done, and he drove him through the San Fernando Valley,'' Joyce
Fickett said. ``He apologized: 'I'm sorry to drive you through this
area that's not very pleasing architecturally.' Wright replied,
'Don't worry, my son. These are just temporary.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Fickett homes have endured, though - winning awards and even
recognition as cultural monuments, in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fickett house, it's instantly recognizable,'' Constantinesco
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take Neutra or some of the other guys of the same
period, maybe they did fewer, but more interesting (designs) in
terms of architecture,'' she said. But the Fickett houses, even
though they ``are not luxurious houses, they allowed the
medium-sized budget to have a very comfortable floor plan. And it
was certainly suited to the California climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish, the photographer who owns an Encino home designed by
Fickett, said at the time the architect was a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what a Fickett house was, even though it doesn't have
the fame of the steel-and-glass modernists,'' Fish said, such as
Neutra, Schindler, or Pierre Koenig.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of average buyers in the '50s and '60s knew the
reputation as well. They wanted a home, not an icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were asking for Fickett homes. They said, I want a
Fickett.'' Palmer said. ``He played it very quiet. He wasn't
handing out cards. He just was quiet and did a hell of a job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Taking a break from a boisterous campaign rally the
other day in the colonial city of Cajamarca, President Alberto
Fujimori pointed to a dark cloud gliding over his head and cried,
``Let there be rain for the farmers!''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, the sky poured open, and thousands cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Fujimori laughed into his microphone.
``Everything is coordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   It has often seemed that way over the last 10 years, as Fujimori
effectively confronted an array of plagues _ from hyperinflation to
terrorism to an invasion of narcotics traffickers, from war with
Ecuador to massive flooding caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   But only a day after Fujimori played with the clouds over
Cajamarca, he faced a political crisis that will surely challenge
his considerable pluck and power. Alejandro Toledo, his opponent in
the May 28 runoff presidential election, dropped out of the race on
Thursday. Fujimori was left with an open field for victory and the
prospect of a third five-year term, but one in which his legitimacy
and credibility would be questioned both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori now faces the possibility of unending protest marches,
criticism from Washington and other capitals, and even, perhaps,
economic sanctions from the U.S. Congress and the Organization of
American States that could impede his fight against drug
trafficking and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old president, who is the son of Japanese
immigrants, was able to face down international pressures after he
suspended the operations of his own Congress and Supreme Court in
1992 because he had overwhelming popular support. But now Peru is
badly split, with university students and labor unions preparing to
mount the biggest street protests in more than a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, in effect, has become a victim of his own success. Now
that he has virtually defeated the terrorists of the Maoist Shining
Path, a growing number of Peruvians are seeking an easing of his
authoritarianism. In the last three years, even as the terrorism
waned, Fujimori did not ease his hold on power. He tightened it.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori decided he could run for re-election even though the
constitution prohibits three consecutive terms. He had three judges
dismissed by Congress when they disagreed with his legal
interpretation that the constitutional term limit did not cover his
first term because it was completed before the constitution itself.
He then established control over several television networks
through legal maneuvers, and withdrew Peru from the jurisdiction of
a regional human rights court.
</P>
<P>
   His powers were amply on display in the first round of the
presidential race when all television networks, save for one cable
channel, virtually boycotted his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been manipulating so much that even if he won fairly,
people wouldn't believe it was a fair process,'' said Enrique
Zileri, editor of the political magazine Caretas. ``Whatever
happens, Fujimori becomes a much weaker president who will be
discredited internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernan Chaparro Melo, a pollster, said, ``With 57 percent of the
people continuing to believe the election process is unjust, we are
entering difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori has had his back to the wall before, and he has
always shown himself to be a leader of great resourcefulness and
impeccable timing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, Fujimori has emerged from his early
campaign slumber and appeared eager for a fight. He told
enthusiastic campaign rallies that he would not accept a
postponement of the election even before Toledo demanded that the
vote be put off several weeks to give foreign election observers
time to test computer software installed to count the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has sharpened his message, arguing more forcefully that
he is the one candidate strong enough to lead this desperately poor
and often chaotic country. Taking on his greatest weaknesses, he
pledged an all-out attack on unemployment and confronted his
foreign critics with diatribes designed to inspire Peruvian
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need foreigners to tell us how to hold elections,''
Fujimori told a crowd in the city of Trujillo shortly after
Toledo's announcement that he was dropping out of the race if the
election was not postponed.
</P>
<P>
   After underestimating Toledo, an U.S.-educated business school
professor who rose meteorically in the weeks before the first round
vote, Fujimori finally began taking him on _ calling him a
rudderless, indecisive leader who only knows how to turn to
Washington, Buenos Aires and European capitals for political
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's magic was amply on display last week as he toured the
north of the country. He laughed, danced and gleefully tossed
cassettes of his campaign songs to passers-by who thrilled at
seeing their president.
</P>
<P>
   As a brass band played his campaign theme song, Fujimori went
into a fevered jig on the stump as a throng of more than 10,000
went wild. ``My advisers tell me I shouldn't dance,'' Fujimori
laughed, ``but I can't help myself!'' It was the kind of populist
touch that led him to landslide victories in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his heavily accented English for effect, he told the
crowd, ``They ask: `What is happening in Peru?''' Then answering
the question firmly in Spanish, he said, ``We've had a government
the last 10 years that has been decisive and has never ducked the
tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   To crowds that filled the central plaza of Cajamarca, a highland
city of magnificent baroque churches, luscious cheeses and lyrical
poets where the Incas made their first stand against the Spanish
invaders in the 16th century, Fujimori called on the crowd to cheer
loud enough so the Argentine government could hear.
</P>
<P>
   He snickered at Toledo for traveling to Buenos Aires to consult
with President Fernando de la Rua and former President Raul
Alfonsin.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his opponents, he said: ``If they were really
democrats and really trusted the people, they wouldn't complain all
the time in Washington and Buenos Aires. They show by going abroad
that they don't care about the votes of the Peruvian people.''

<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas _ The fourth-grade classroom erupted in titters
as George W. Bush, one of the class clowns, faced his friends. He
had quietly used an ink pen to draw a beard and long sideburns on
his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Frances Childress, grabbed George by the arm,
yanked him out of class and marched him down the long corridor to
the principal's office near the main entrance to Sam Houston
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at him,'' the principal, John Bizilo, recalls
Childress telling him. ``He's been making a disturbance in class.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step was pretty obvious for anyone in the 1950s version
of the West Texas oil town of Midland: Bizilo told George to bend
over and then reached for his paddle, the thickness of a Ping-Pong
paddle but narrower and twice as long. Bizilo gave George three
``licks,'' and the boy's shrieks filled the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit him, he cried,'' Bizilo remembered. ``Oh, did he
cry! He yelled as if he'd been shot. But he learned his lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the roots of Bush's political philosophy as a
presidential candidate _ including his belief in tough love for
juvenile offenders _ seem to go back to his childhood. Midland, a
conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from
25,000 when he was a little boy to almost 100,000 today, mirrors
Bush's optimism, his faith in business and his doubts about an
activist government. While playing Little League baseball, running
for class president, or even sobbing in the principal's office,
George W. Bush absorbed West Texas values that many old friends say
are central to understanding who he is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his political philosophy comes completely from the
philosophy of the independent oil man,'' said Joe O'Neill, a fellow
rapscallion in childhood. ``His homage to his parents, his respect
for his elders, his respect for tradition, his belief in religion,
his opposition to abortion _ that's the philosophy he grew up with
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself, in a long interview about his roots, made a
similar point. ``I don't know what percentage of me is Midland,''
he said, ``but I would say people, if they want to understand me,
need to understand Midland and the attitude of Midland.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in the soil of Midland that Bush has said he would like to
be buried when he dies, and it was to Midland that he returned in
the 1970s to marry and start a family. It gave him an anchor in
real America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has often said that ``the biggest difference between me and
my father is that he went to Greenwich Country Day and I went to
San Jacinto Junior High.'' That may be an exaggeration of the
younger Bush's populist credentials, because he is also a product
of Andover, Yale and Harvard. But there is still something to it.
</P>
<P>
   The father, chauffeured to and from private school in
Connecticut in a black sedan, suffered politically because of the
perception that he was a blue blood who could not relate to
ordinary people. The younger Bush also has been tainted by the idea
that he was born into privilege with a visa to effortless wealth
and prominence. Yet George W. Bush actually had a rather ordinary
childhood, and his years biking around small-town streets in jeans
and a white T-shirt left him with a common touch that is among his
greatest assets as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands Bubba because there is more Bubba in him,''
Karl Rove, the longtime political adviser to the Bushes, told a
reporter in 1992, when Bush's friends were still carefree enough to
say colorful things about him. ``He is clearly the wild son _ even
today. Part of it is rooted in Midland, where he grew up in an
ordinary neighborhood, where houses are close together and risk was
a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Midland childhood is a striking contrast to that of another
boy growing up at the same time, Al Gore, who instead of being
paddled in Bizilo's office was attending the elite St. Albans
School in Washington, swimming in the Senate pool and listening on
an extension as his father the senator spoke on the telephone to
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Midland, impatient with ideas and introspection, was a world of
clear rights and wrongs, long on absolutes and devoid of ethical
gray shades. It may be the source of some of Bush's greatest
political strengths, the unpretentiousness and mellow bonhomie that
warm up voters, and also of his weaknesses, including an image of
an intellectual lightweight that is underscored whenever he mixes
up the likes of Slovenia and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMTOWN IN BLACK AND WHITE
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why Midland does not support a postcard
industry. It rests on an expanse of flat, baked nothingness. Even
its residents, searching for a kind analogy, fumble a bit before
coming up with ``moonscape.'' The surrounding land, home to
tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes, would depress even a camel, but in
the 1950s it had one redeeming feature _ it was loaded with oil.
</P>
<P>
   The oil made Midland a boomtown, attracting ambitious
businessmen like the elder Bush and many other out-of-staters.
These people made for a conservative town but not a redneck one;
Midland had a large proportion of geologists, engineers, lawyers
and accountants, and Ivy League college graduates were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recalls it in Norman Rockwell pastels, and so do many other
residents. Children bicycled everywhere on their own, crime was
almost nonexistent and if anyone suspicious _ say, someone with a
beard _ showed up in town, then-Sheriff Ed Darnell (known as Big
Ed) would stop him, escort him to the edge of town, and tell him to
``get out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet what no one volunteers is that it was also rigidly
segregated in those days, like most places in the South. Black
children went to their own school rather than to Sam Houston
Elementary with George Bush. The bus station and train station had
separate waiting rooms for blacks and whites, and there were
separate, dilapidated drinking fountains marked ``colored'' at the
stations and at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes' first encounter with West Texas racism came when
they casually invited a black man, working for the NAACP, to come
by their temporary home in neighboring Odessa. The man had the tact
to stay away, but neighbors heard about this and warned the elder
George Bush to stop these invitations unless he wanted to be tarred
and feathered.
</P>
<P>
   Racial slurs were routine, and young George picked up the words
from neighbors. Once when he was about 7 years old he used one in
the living room in front of his mother, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Proctor, who lived across the street and was playing
with George at the time, remembers watching as Bush grabbed her son
by the ear and dragged him into the bathroom. She washed his mouth
out with soap as he spluttered indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family was probably the only one around that didn't use
racial slurs,'' Proctor said. ``I probably didn't realize it was
wrong until I saw that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the racism directed at blacks, there was a measured
respect for the Mexicans who came over the border to work in the
oil fields. As a boomtown, Midland needed laborers and welcomed
Mexican immigrants, who were regarded as hard-working and thrifty.
Some friends find an echo of that attitude in Bush's efforts to
push the Republican Party to reach out to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw these people cross the border and just wanting a good
job,'' recalls Randall Roden, a neighbor boy and friend. Roden
recalls going out with George and his father to an oil well and
spending the night sleeping in the back of the Bushes' station
wagon as the crew _ Mexicans among them _ struggled to get the well
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I formed the very strong impression, and I think George has
the same one, that these people came for economic opportunity and
worked very hard,'' Roden said. ``If you wanted a Mexican worker to
have a new pair of boots, you'd have to buy it for him. Because if
you gave him money, he'd send it home.''
</P>
<P>
   GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, though born in 1946 in New Haven, Conn., while
his father was still an overachieving student at Yale, moved to
West Texas when he was not quite 2 and grew up in this nurturing
environment. These days, as the son of a president and scion of a
wealthy family, he is often perceived as a child of privilege, but
neighbors in those days insist that in the 1950s that was not the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family in the Northeast had money, mostly earned on
Wall Street, but the elder George left all that behind to make his
own fortune in West Texas. Equipped with connections but initially
without seed money, George and Barbara Bush and little George,
their firstborn, settled in a tiny apartment in the hard-driving
oil town of Odessa, where they shared a bathroom with a
mother-daughter team of prostitutes living next door.
</P>
<P>
   Local people say that you raise hell in Odessa but raise a
family in nearby Midland, a much more respectable place. So, after
a one-year interlude in California, the Bushes moved to Midland,
living initially in a bright blue 847-square-foot bungalow on a
newly built street in which every home was identical _but painted
bright colors to make them seem different. It was called Easter Egg
Row, because the houses looked like colored eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The family prospered in the oil business and moved into a series
of nicer houses in Midland, culminating in one with a swimming
pool. But this was not as much of a draw as it might have been.
Just down the street lived Peggy Porter, one of the cutest girls in
school, and because she had a pool as well, it was in much greater
demand than the Bush family's.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally George W.'s grandfather, Sen. Prescott Bush of
Connecticut, would visit and cause a mild stir in the neighborhood.
But for the most part, the Bush family was regarded as fairly
typical of the out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gov. Bush is often seen as a princeling, the son of
a president, the scion of a famous family, and Al Gore as more of
his own man. But in the 1950s and early 1960s, it was the other way
around. Back then, the name George Bush belonged only to an obscure
Texas businessman. George W.'s closest connection to the White
House was that he was a descendant on his mother's side of Franklin
Pierce, the 14th president. In contrast, in those days ``Albert
Gore'' was virtually a household name, belonging to a prominent
senator (the present candidate's father and namesake) who was
sometimes mentioned as presidential or vice-presidential timber.
The senator lost his seat in 1970 and faded into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet young George was not some country hick, and he also learned
to fit into the world of his Connecticut grandparents. The family
regularly spent part of the summer at the family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, and in 1954 the father took George and his
best friend, Randall Roden, to Washington to see the White House,
the Capitol and a baseball game with the Washington Senators (whose
later incarnation would move to Texas and become the Rangers, owned
in part by George W. Bush).
</P>
<P>
   They had lunch at the senator's home in Georgetown, and a
thirsty Randall promptly demonstrated the distance from Midland to
Georgetown by drinking from his finger bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When they are tracked down, the runny-nosed boys and girls who
once played dodgeball at Sam Houston Elementary School, while now
scattered around the country, offer recollections that are very
similar: Midland was an idyllic place in which to grow up, and
George W. Bush was a very typical child. In contrast to other
recent presidential candidates, Bush in childhood is remarkable
primarily for his ordinariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't any different from anybody else,'' recalled Robert
A. McCleskey, a playmate. ``You read about Clinton and Gore and how
at that age they were planning to be president. Not Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Bush's ambition was to be another Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All George ever wanted to be was a Major League baseball
player,'' recalled a buddy, Terry Throckmorton. ``That's all he
ever talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   A STUDENT OF BASEBALL
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever accused Bush of being an intellectual, and the
indifference to books started early. Childhood friends recall Bush
reading only two sets of books for pleasure _ the Hardy boys and a
series of mystery books about baseball. As one asks about his
reading habits, there are a few snickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we sit around in those days reading books?'' asked
McCleskey, smiling broadly. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   George and Barbara Bush led a drive to build a school library
(the school did not previously have one), but books were not a
major part of a boy's childhood in Midland. Erstwhile
acquaintances, while deeply admiring of the Bushes' goodness and
decency, have trouble recalling early signs of greatness in the
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, I never did think about what he might do in life,''
said Austine Crosby, his third-grade teacher. ``He was just a good,
well-rounded young man, and he did his work.''
</P>
<P>
   And academically?
</P>
<P>
   ``He was OK,'' Crosby said, a bit defensively. ``He was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   So was he in the top quarter of his class academically?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in the upper half, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he did not distinguish himself as a student, former
classmates describe him as smart and blessed with an excellent
memory. He had a passion for baseball statistics, a first-rate
collection of baseball cards and a reputation as such a shrewd
trader that boys were careful not to agree to a trade with George
Bush without thinking it over very carefully.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, George came up with a scheme that showed
remarkable ingenuity and helped make his collection of baseball
cards the best around. He began sending baseball cards to famous
players, enclosing return postage and a cheery good-luck message,
and asking the players to autograph the cards and send them back.
</P>
<P>
   This way, he got autographed cards from Mickey Mantle, Willie
Mays and other famous players. Some of those cards are now worth
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lifelong adoration of baseball began when he and other
neighborhood boys would go early to school to play ball. Bizilo,
the principal, would take off his jacket, loosen his tie and hit
balls for the boys to field.
</P>
<P>
   George was a good ballplayer, friends say, a bit on the small
side but making up for it with enthusiasm and aggressiveness. He
played catcher for the Cubs, a Little League team, and made it to
the town's Little League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   BECOMING A TEXAN
</P>
<P>
   Midland may not have had the best schools, George's onetime
playmates say, but _ like Hot Springs, Ark., where Bill Clinton
grew up _ it offered a nurturing environment and self-confidence
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an assurance that you have growing up in a place like
Midland, a self-confidence and a real genuine interest in
connecting with people,'' said Marge Petty, the other politician in
the group (a Democratic state senator in Kansas).
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it was in Midland that Bush first learned to fit
in, even if his parents were Yankees and his grandfather a senator.
That ability to adapt and bridge groups has never left him.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Midland values were remarkably unshaken by the 1960s.
Some Midland alumni say they let their hair grow a bit longer, but
_ like George W. Bush _ they mostly stood with the establishment
instead of rejecting it. Very few seem to have protested
significantly against the Vietnam War, seriously used drugs,
thought of police as ``pigs,'' denounced their parents as
oppressors or picked up a copy of Das Kapital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a town of embedded values,'' Bush recalled, adding that
it had ``a heavy dose of individualism and fairly healthy
disrespect for government.'' Asked if his own skepticism about the
role for government is a product of Midland attitudes, Bush paused
and finally nodded, saying: ``I think there's a parallel there, I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Midland was steeped in optimism, and for many people growing up
here in the 1950s, the moral of childhood was that the system
worked, that anyone who struggled enough in that baking desert had
a good chance of finding oil and striking it rich. The trajectory
of the Bush family itself, from the apartment with the shared
bathroom to the sprawling house and pool, underscored the point.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson lasted with George W. for years,'' said Bill
Minutaglio, a Texan who has written a biography of Bush. ``I think
he truly believes that people can win the lottery if they work
hard, that if they put their nose to the grindstone it'll all work
out without government help or intrusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy for government seems a little odd, from afar,
because in those days the oil business depended heavily on quirks
in the tax code to encourage investments. Still, when the people of
Midland sought a theater, a hospital and a new baseball diamond,
they did not ask the government but raised money themselves and
turned out on the weekends to do much of the work on their own.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush talks about ``compassionate conservatism'' or
``faith-based initiatives,'' he evokes what classmates remember as
the spirit of Midland of the 1950s. Asked if that is what he has in
mind, Bush interrupts half-way through the question. ``Yeah,
absolutely,'' he said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Midland are convinced that Bush is sincere when
he preaches compassion and calls for a ``responsibility era.'' But
some also admit that it is fair to question the relevance of
lessons from a town where raw capitalism made so many people rich
and where community spirit wove such a strong safety net.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVING A FAMILY LOSS
</P>
<P>
   In addition to church groups, various civic organizations were
also active, and one of the local rituals for children was the
meetings with cookies and milk at the home of a nice old lady who
represented the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The cookies were digested more thoroughly than the teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terrible to animals,'' recalled Throckmorton,
laughing. A dip behind the Bush home turned into a small lake after
a good rain, and thousands of frogs would come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would get BB guns and shoot them,'' Throckmorton
said. ``Or we'd put firecrackers in the frogs and throw them and
blow them up.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was not blowing up frogs, young George _ always restless
and something of a natural leader _ would lead neighborhood
children on daredevil expeditions around town, seeing how close
they could come to breaking their necks. George also quickly
acquired a colorful vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgie has grown to be a near-man, talks dirty once in a
while and occasionally swears, aged 4 and a half,'' his father
despaired in a letter to a friend in 1951. In another letter four
years later, he lamented: ``Georgie aggravates the hell out of me
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one terrible interruption in this relaxed life,
occurring when George was 7. He was at school, lugging a record
player to Bizilo's office along with his friend Bill Sallee, when
he saw his parents' green Oldsmobile drive up in the parking lot.
At first he thought he saw his 3-year-old sister, Robin, through
the window.
</P>
<P>
   But his eyes were playing tricks on him. His parents had come to
break the news to him that Robin had just died of leukemia. The
loss staggered the Bush family, and some friends say that George's
closeness to his mother dates partly from his efforts to comfort
her at that time.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's hair began to turn gray, though she was just 28,
and she often dissolved into tears. George's father worked hard and
traveled frequently, and so the boy spent much more time with his
mother than his father _ acquiring in particular her lacerating
wit.
</P>
<P>
   Robin's death is something that he has talked about rarely with
friends, and even some of his roommates at boarding school and
college did not know about her. But occasionally when the moment
was right, he would confide to friends about his tears and grief at
the time, about his incomprehension that Robin could have been
dying without his parents telling him.
</P>
<P>
   Close friends say he had nightmares for years afterward. The
death also left him as a quasi-only child, for his next-oldest
sibling, Jeb, was 6 and a half years younger. Neil and Marvin were
9 and 10 years younger than George, and Dorothy was 13 years
younger. So while George occasionally used Jeb as a punching bag in
childhood squabbles, and always relished his role as elder brother,
most of the time his playmates and confidants were friends and
roommates rather than siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Robin's death, George returned to school. Most of the
time, the despair was hidden, and on the surface he soon reverted
to the wise-cracking imp they had known before.
</P>
<P>
   THE SEEDS OF LEADERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political debut appears to have come in the
seventh-grade, although both he and his wife, Laura, (who was in
the same seventh-grade but barely knew him) say they have no
recollection of it. Classmates recall that he ran for seventh-grade
class president against Jack Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Jack was a formidable candidate, and four years later at Boys
Nation he would be elected vice president, defeating a personable
candidate from Arkansas named Bill Clinton. Yet in running against
George, Jack was less fortunate, and classmates say that George was
elected by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for George because he was cuter,'' recalled Peggy
Porter Weiss, ``and in the seventh-grade that's what counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, former classmates say that if they had been told that one
of their number would become a presidential candidate, they would
not have thought of George Bush. Instead, they say, the assumption
would have been that it would be Bill Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, as bright and ambitious as he was athletic, beat out
George Bush on the football field and was the first-string
quarterback on the seventh-grade team ( Bush was the second-string
quarterback). Wood eventually became the junior high school and
high school student council president and even headed the statewide
association of student councils. If any young man in Midland seemed
destined for the White House, classmates remember, it was he.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, the only thing I ever ran for,'' said Wood, now a
lawyer and a bit flattered and amused by the memories of his
classmates, ``was the school board.''

   ABU DIS, West Bank _ It took Yasser Arafat many years to arrive
at the gate of Jerusalem. But last week, when Israel conceded to
him full control of Abu Dis and two other villages, the chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization moved one step nearer to a
dream that had sustained him through his exile in Tunisia. The
villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem, but one with a bird's
eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is well known to be an intense symbolic focal point
for both Israelis and Palestinians _ as well as for Jews,
Christians and Muslims worldwide. But when the dusty neighboring
town of Abu Dis was finally given over to Palestinian control, it
briefly reminded everyone that even physical Jerusalem is a loaded
concept: Its borders, fixed on a map, are blurred on the ground in
an emotionally complicated, politicized way.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis epitomizes a reality usually obscured in the simplistic
public debate about Jerusalem and its fate: Just as the village is
integrated with the Jerusalem area geographically, economically and
socially, East Jerusalem itself is entwined with the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear last week, but it was still left unsaid.
Jerusalem is rarely publicly discussed by Israeli or Palestinian
leaders in anything but black-and-white terms. It is the ``eternal,
undivided capital'' of Israel, on the one hand, and the future
capital of the Palestinian state on the other: seemingly
irreconcilable concepts that have led many intelligent politicians
to recommend that the issue be left unresolved in the current,
supposedly final, peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerusalem is very much on the table in the serious,
non-secret back-channel negotiations that are under way in
Stockholm. And experts agree that the private discussion will have
to be creative and realistic enough to take into account the
lessons of Abu Dis and acknowledge that the dynamic on the
Jerusalem issue shifted last week, even if quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when you are talking about sovereignty, the Palestinian
people will say we are in the sphere,'' said Zakaria al Qaq,
co-director of the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and
Information in Jerusalem. ``It is no longer pure abstraction. That
battle for Jerusalem that was being waged long distance will now be
fought up close.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Israel's decision was hardly celebrated. In fact, as the
Parliament was voting to transfer the territory to the
Palestinians, the West Bank was aflame in violent confrontation
with the Israelis. When the intense violence died down,
Palestinians made it clear that they were not elated, even if they
were relieved. Israel was supposed to withdraw from 28 villages in
the Jerusalem area by last year under the Oslo peace agreement,
they said. Just three was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   And furthermore: Abu Dis looks like a village and, with raw
sewage flowing roadside, it smells like a village. No Palestinian
will ever mistake Abu Dis for Jerusalem itself. If the Israelis
intend it as an alternative capital for the Palestinians state,
which is what Barak seemed to be saying last week, Palestinians
find this an insult, a joke and a deal-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abu Dis is closer to the heart of the contested city than
is the Israeli Parliament or the Israeli prime minister's
headquarters. After the physical transfer takes place, Arafat can
be photographed with his uniformed troops against the backdrop of
the famous minaret of the holy city's skyline. He can open an
office in the town's modern new governmental building and place his
desk chair in Jerusalem proper, since the building is reportedly a
few feet over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Israeli right wing reacted last week with audible
emotion _ anger. They saw the concession of Abu Dis to mean that
the peace talks had come to the endpoint they had long feared: a
negotiation over the status of Jerusalem itself. In tours of Abu
Dis, they found out what Palestinians know: Abu Dis and the other
two villages may not be Jerusalem, but on the ground that
distinction vanishes.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal border actually transects the town, so the only
way to tell where Jerusalem leaves off and Abu Dis begins is by the
city sidewalks that abruptly end. Abu Dis residents work in
Jerusalem, shop in Jerusalem and pray in Jerusalem _ whether or not
they have proper papers to move back and forth. There are seven
checkpoints leading to Jerusalem from the West Bank, one official
noted, but there are 70 roads and paths by which to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current municipal boundaries are irrelevant,'' said
Menachem Klein, a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies. ``Abu Dis is part of Jerusalem functionally, just
as the 200,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem are part of the West Bank.
No Israeli or Palestinian leader can ignore this reality, whatever
they say publicly.''

<P>
   It is a reality that existed when the Jordanians held East
Jerusalem and the West Bank, continued after the Israeli annexation
of East Jerusalem, and quietly redefined itself after the PLO
returned from exile and became the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Through his ministers, Barak has leaked some ideas for
addressing this reality, ideas more nuanced than his public
discourse. In addition to testing the potentially explosive notion
of internationalizing the Old City, they have floated the
possibility of ceding civil control of the Palestinian population
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In their public response, Palestinian officials sneered, since
the idea does not include land.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abu Dis has been a prime example of just how completely
the Palestinians can control something that is not really theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Osman Nasser, a senior PLO veteran, was named the governor
of Jerusalem for the Palestinian Authority at the start of 1996.
Jerusalem proper being unavailable, he opened his main office in
Abu Dis, in a former Israeli military headquarters that originally
served as the mansion of a key clan _ the Erekat family of Saeb
Erekat, a senior negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   From the veranda, the Dome of the Rock seems a stone's throw
away. Inside, a three-dimensional replica of the dome graces the
governor's coffee table, and above it hangs a wall-sized photograph
of the dome-dominated skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in divisions between the West Bank and
Jerusalem,'' the governor said over a glass of sweet, hot tea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Jerusalem send representatives to the Palestinian
legislature and the Palestinian entity is part of their lives _ not
only politically but organically, since it is involved in their
schools, their health insurance claims, their properties and their
families. Palestinians regularly travel to Abu Dis so that the
governor can adjudicate their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Palestinian Authority was created, Abu Dis has been
built up partly because of its proximity to Jerusalem and partly
for parochial reasons. Abu Ala, a senior PLO official and now the
Parliament speaker, re-settled there, in his clan's village, and
this created a boomlet. Abu Dis became home to the largest branch
of Al-Quds University, to many ministries and to the new government
building that everyone imagines to be the future Palestinian
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Israel technically retained security control of Abu Dis until it
finally relinquished that last week. But the Jerusalem commander of
the Palestinian police is already based there, as are four branches
of Arafat's security forces _ minus their uniforms and supposedly
minus their guns.
</P>
<P>
   That is why even in Abu Dis, the Israeli vote was seen as a
largely symbolic step. It even raised fears among residents that a
border fence would be built to separate them from Jerusalem, and
that they and the Palestinian people would be left with their noses
pressed against the slats _ so close and so far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are today closer than ever to Jerusalem,'' said Abdul
Rahman al-Shamali, the muezzin who calls Muslims to prayer at one
of five mosques in the conservative, religious town. ``But to be
frank, I am sad. I fear that it will end here. I fear that my heart
is going to be divided. Jerusalem is my heart.''

CHINESE SEE U.S. TRADE BILL AS VITAL TO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CHINA-TRADE-BILL)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL with JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Clinton administration has argued that Congress
should vote for normal trade relations with China because it is in
the United States' national security interest, strengthening
reformist forces in China. And the vast majority of influential
Chinese agree.
</P>
<P>
   These Chinese say their country is at a tipping point in its
history: A yes vote on normal trade could propel it forward to
greater liberalization and engagement with the West. A no vote from
Congress would be seen as a slap in the face, throwing China back
into conservatism and anti-American hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is not how this vote will affect this or that
industry,'' said Zhou Daichun, a commercial lawyer in Beijing.
``What's important is that this is an opportunity to push for
reform and reorganization in China, and without that impetus many
reforms are impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If China is refused, it will give encouragement to
conservatives here,'' he said. ``And if you think about the
reaction to the embassy bombing last year _ and how much the
bombing affected Zhu Rongji _ you can imagine how serious that
could be,'' he added, alluding to the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last year, which reduced the
influence of China's Western-leaning prime minister and created
virulent anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Chinese, the congressional vote _ which, if
positive, would ensure China's full participation in the World
Trade Organization _ has taken on an aura that transcends the
boundaries of trade and politics.
</P>
<P>
   A broad array of influential Chinese _ top government officials,
publishers, bankers, artists, lawyers and pro-democracy advocates _
have come together in extraordinary agreement on the issue,
investing their hope for progress in China in a contentious trade
vote occurring 10,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Trade experts say the implementation of agreements in China is
likely to be slow and difficult. But Chinese government leaders and
economists hope the normalization of trade with the United States
will help close inefficient state enterprises. Authors and artists
here are convinced it will reduce censorship. Lawyers suggest it
will force China's mercurial judges to follow the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``For China, joining WTO is not just about trade concessions,''
said Xu Xiaonian, a financial analyst at China Investment
Construction Corp. ``There is much, much more at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who have the most at stake are some of China's top
leaders _ President Jiang Zemin and Zhu, the country's chief
proponent of the trade deal. Both have long campaigned for closer
economic ties with the United States, a position that became much
more controversial in China after last year's embassy bombing,
which the United States has said was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   These leaders want to open the Chinese market through the World
Trade Organization, in part to attract new investment. But also
they are counting on international trading rules and the pressure
from increased foreign competition to force forward the
government's stalled economic reform plans _ from closing bankrupt
factories to breaking up state monopolies and phasing out state
housing.
</P>
<P>
   While Zhu believes that such reforms are essential, they have
proved politically difficult and the government is far behind
schedule. Local industries have resisted downsizing and giving up
state perks. Huge state businesses, like China Telecom, have
refused to cede an ounce of power.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Zhu are personally vulnerable, too, since they have
pushed the trade pact despite the misgivings of internal opponents,
who remain suspicious of the United States or who worry that
competition will cause destabilizing unemployment in China's state
industries. And if Congress snubs China, it will seriously weaken
both their policies and their standing, injecting new tension into
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote doesn't pass, that will be a disaster for Jiang
and Zhu since they are the main architects of the current foreign
and economic policies, and these both depend on getting PNTR,'' or
permanent normal trade relations, said a senior researcher at a
government policy institute here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they fail, they will have a tough task persuading
ministries, provincial leaders and the military to go along with
their reforms _ especially the military, who believe that China has
been too soft on the U.S. and on Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials say that a no vote would have long-term
repercussions, forcing a quick end to Zhu's career, and making it
harder for Jiang to anoint a like-minded successor when he steps
down as head of the party in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But in Beijing, when people sit at Starbucks discussing the U.S.
trade bill, it is not the fate of the party _ or even business _
that is the focus of concern. In fact, many people who have never
agreed with China's leaders find themselves similarly invested in
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I support WTO, and of course this will be a very,
very big thing here,'' said Zhang Yuan, a successful film director.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, whose work includes a current hit and several prior
movies that have been banned, said he hoped for ``more creative
space'' and less interference from government censors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, it will open doors to more investment into
cinemas and the film industry, and that's good,'' he said. And he
predicted that joining the world trade body would ``push the
leadership to relax its restrictions on subject matter'' so that
Chinese films could compete with the influx from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Even those normally at odds with the government appreciate the
trade deal, convinced that the U.S. pork _ cars and dollars that
are expected to flow into China if the trade vote passes _ will
bring with it greater appreciation for liberal ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``WTO membership might not serve to invoke a democratic
breakthrough immediately, but it will certainly make Chinese people
exposed as never before to liberal values and democratic
institutions,'' said Liu Junning, who was recently fired from his
job at the Chinese Academy of Social Science for his reformist
political stance. ``Opening up is sometimes more important than
reform for China.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the past 20 years, Chinese have seen how economics can
drive vast social change. Most Chinese are infinitely freer than a
decade ago _ to travel, to make work choices, even to joke about
the government _ even though the Communist Party has maintained a
political monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transformation of the economy that started in the 1980s
has had all sorts of political and cultural effects in the last
decade, and that's true despite 1989 and the lack of significant
political reform,'' said Zhang, the director, referring to the year
when the government violently suppressed demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   A commitment to the World Trade Organization will set off a new
round of social and political changes, experts here say. ``The
political and social effects will be much more immediate than the
economic, said Yan Xuetong, a researcher at the Chinese Institute
of Contemporary International Relations.

</P>
<P>
   In state sectors like banking, insurance and telecommunication,
which would all have to open up to foreign companies, managers
would have to change their practices in order to survive, often
with an extended ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   Banks would have to come up with better loan programs to help
the poor with college tuition, and factories would have to honor
contracts that are now routinely breached. But Yan said the biggest
boon would be less tangible, ``changing people's attitudes and
their psychology in important and positive ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In some areas _ like law _ the link between joining the world
trade body and social change is quite direct. Zhou, the lawyer,
said he likes to think of WTO membership as ``reformatting''
Chinese business and legal culture.
</P>
<P>
   He said that many offices in China, including the trademark
bureau, are run according to internal regulations that are not
publicly available. But, he predicted, if China enters the World
Trade Organization, ``disputes like this will be solved by the
courts, not by bureaucratic means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement will affect not just trade law and copyright law
but also civil and criminal procedure laws,'' he said. ``Entry into
WTO will help clean up and regularize the legislative and judicial
systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, the influence will be more subtle. An Dun, a
best-selling author and journalist, welcomes the trade bill for the
increased copyright protection it will bring to a country where
pirated books and compact discs generally outnumber legitimate
ones.
</P>
<P>
   But An, who has at times clashed with authorities over her frank
discussion of teen-age pregnancies, infidelity and prostitution,
said she also has a larger hope: that joining the world economic
community will lead to greater freedom of speech, so that she can
write some books she still dares not write today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the structure of publishing can't change quickly,
because publishers are controlled by the state,'' she said, sipping
tea in a stylish suit, about to fly off on a national book tour.
``But the control is a deep thing, partly in people's minds. And
with more intellectual commerce between China and the West,
people's thoughts and concepts can change.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others predicted that more liberal trade practices might
induce the government to adopt a new publishing law that would
permit private publishers, albeit with some restrictions _ a
proposal that has been circulating in government circles for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their nearly boundless hope for the trade deal, most
informed Chinese acknowledge that it will also mean considerable
economic pain. Indeed, many people in and out of the government see
the trade deal as a kind of tough love that will help the central
government make the difficult changes that it is unable or
unwilling to make by itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is no leader like Deng Xiaoping, and the
leadership must strike a balance between different political
groups,'' said Xu, the financial analyst. ``They lack the power to
overcome the resistance of groups who are hurt by reform and that's
why globalization has been slowing down, like a train losing steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are counting on outside forces, on global
competition, to overcome that resistance and push the
transformation of the economy. And they are willing to risk higher
unemployment and instability in the short term for economic
efficiency and growth in the long run, as they see few other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   With hopes running so high and a new deal between China and the
European Union now sealed, a no vote from Congress would be
emotionally devastating, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this agreement is so good for us, they would not see
rejection of this trade measure as just an act of Congress, but as
a major restatement of policy _ a declaration that we see them as
the enemy,'' said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national
security adviser. ``The consequences could be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock will be greatly magnified because the Chinese media
have not said much about the heated debates in the United States,
featuring mostly supporters instead.
</P>
<P>
   Even many well-informed Chinese never understood that passage
was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China doesn't get PNTR, people will regard it as American
hostility to China,'' said Yan Xuetong. ``Even though they know the
administration has to get the support of Congress, since the
American political system is so different from ours, it's hard for
them to understand.''

NO EXECUTIONS IN ILLINOIS UNTIL SYSTEM IS REPAIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Four months after he rekindled the death-penalty
debate by imposing a moratorium on executions in Illinois, Gov.
George Ryan says he strongly doubts that any inmates will be put to
death while he remains in office.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Republican, has appointed a commission to study
ways to fix problems with the death penalty, but says he will not
go ahead with executions unless the panel can give him ``a 100
percent guarantee'' against any mistaken convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we'll ever go back to the death penalty as we
knew it, as long as I'm governor,'' Ryan said in an interview on
Friday. The governor halted executions in the state after 13 men
were sent to death row before being exonerated by new evidence.
``If this commission comes back and says we can't give you a 100
percent guarantee, if they can't tell me the system will be
flawless, I've got an obligation to say that I can't go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The action by Ryan, a longtime proponent of capital punishment,
has helped to renew the national debate on the death penalty. In
imposing the moratorium, Ryan had described the capital-punishment
system as ``so fraught with error'' and said it ``has come so close
to the ultimate nightmare, the state's taking of innocent life.''
</P>
<P>
   A national survey in February found support for the death
penalty at 66 percent, its lowest level in 19 years. Some 12 states
have seen legislation introduced this year to halt executions. On
Thursday the Legislature in New Hampshire voted to abolish capital
punishment, the first state to pass such a bill since the Supreme
Court allowed executions to resume nearly 24 years ago. The
governor of New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, vetoed the
measure on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The death-penalty commission appointed by Ryan will examine the
cases that led to wrongful convictions in Illinois. The panel is
being led by Frank McGarr, a former federal judge; Thomas Sullivan,
a former U.S. attorney; and Paul Simon, a former Democratic
senator. William Webster, the former director of central
intelligence and of the FBI, will be a special adviser to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission includes law-enforcement officials, prosecutors,
defense lawyers, a businessman and the novelist Scott Turow, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, a death-penalty opponent, said it was difficult to
imagine that the panel could deliver an iron-clad guarantee to Ryan
that, even with certain improvements in the legal system, no
innocent person would be convicted of a capital crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible we'll come to the conclusion that there's no
way to salvage the death penalty,'' Simon said. But he said he was
speaking for himself, not the commission, and added that a majority
of the 14 members of the panel support capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not give the panel a timetable for its
recommendations. But Simon said the three chairmen agreed to finish
the work and deliver findings within about six months.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said the commission would focus largely on the legal
representation given to people on death row, who are often
indigent.

<P>
   The death penalty, after years of being seen as something of a
dead letter in American politics, has lately spawned increasing
debate. There are 3,600 people on death rows nationwide, and 87
death-row inmates have been freed since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is expected to be the
Republican nominee for president, has said he strongly believes
that no innocent person has been executed in his state, which leads
the nation in executions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls showing that a majority of Americans favor the
death penalty, Ryan said he received much more praise than
criticism for imposing a moratorium. ``A lot of people are telling
me it was the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty
Information Center, said notable concerns about executions have
been voiced lately by conservatives, including Pat Robertson, the
television evangelist; Oliver North, the former Senate candidate;
and George Will, the columnist. Tom Osborne, the Republican nominee
in the Nebraska Senate race, has taken a strong stance against the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened since Governor Ryan's moratorium,'' Dieter
said. ``It's hard to imagine that what happened in Illinois,
especially the wrongful convictions, hasn't had some effect on what
people are thinking.''

   OMUGO, Uganda _ Jabbing, apologizing and then jabbing again, it
took Harriet Ayikoru nearly 20 minutes to find a usable vein
beneath the sleeves of the sad old Tweety Bird T-shirt that Sentina
Drajiru wore, and when the melarsoprol went in, Drajiru winces.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again she lightly touched her arm to show exactly
where she felt the sharp tip of the pain as the medicine simmered
up it.
</P>
<P>
   It was like eating chili peppers, she said, only it was inside
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you use this drug, the vein is spoiled,'' said Ayikoru, a
nurse in the thatched clinic here. ``As it is corrosive, it erodes
the inside layer. So the relapses like her are the hardest cases _
the scar tissue is there even six months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol, invented almost 70 years ago, is melarsen oxide
dissolved in propylene glycol _ literally, arsenic in antifreeze.
It kills 5 percent of patients treated with it. But it is the only
medicine available to treat advanced sleeping sickness, one of the
historic scourges of Africa, which was nearly wiped out 50 years
ago but has made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative ran out in July. The manufacturer, which
abandoned it as unprofitable when it turned out to be useless
against its intended target, cancer, has made one last batch,
enough for 1,000 patients. But 300,000 people are infected each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping sickness is perhaps the most vivid example of the
disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the
fatal or debilitating diseases of the Third World's poor.
</P>
<P>
   These ailments go untreated or badly treated not just because
the poor cannot afford the drugs they need, though that is a
serious problem, but because the drugs themselves do not exist. The
pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invent them.
Companies decline to invest the huge sums needed to chase a cure
they know their potential customers cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   According to IMS Health of Westport, Conn., a marketing research
firm that studies the industry, Africa accounts for 1 percent of
world drug sales, while North America, Japan and Western Europe
account for 80 percent. It is for them the companies invent a
stream of high-priced, highly profitable drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor have no consumer power, so the market has failed
them,'' said Dr. James Orbinski, international president of Doctors
Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres, the medical agency whose
work in war zones and in the Third World won it the Nobel Peace
Prize last year. ``I'm tired of the logic that says, `He who can't
pay, dies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical executives reluctantly concur with his
assessment. Told that the industry's critics say it would rather
find a cure for a bald American than a dying African, Francois
Gros, a spokesman for Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical
company that makes three of the four sleeping sickness drugs,
ruefully acknowledged: ``That's not completely wrong. We know
what's happening in the Third World, but we don't act.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to explain: ``We can't deny that we try to focus on
top markets _ cardiovascular, metabolism, anti-infection, etc. But
we're an industry in a competitive environment _ we have a
commitment to deliver performance for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictable Behavior
</P>
<P>
   Health experts also recognize this reality. ``A blockbuster drug
makes them $1 billion to $1.5 billion a year,'' said a senior World
Health Organization official. ``If you're running the R &AMP; D
department of one of these companies, you're under a lot of
pressure, and they're going to invest in things they see a market
for. Their behavior is perfectly predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many health policy-makers now argue that the
world's governments must somehow force the world's pharmaceutical
manufacturers to turn their attention to diseases like sleeping
sickness, malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and the various
burrowing worms that kill or cripple millions each year in Africa,
Asia and South America. The last truly new drug for tuberculosis,
for example, which kills 2 million people a year, was invented more
than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they say, rich nations must either pay the
manufacturers directly, offer them tax breaks, dangle before them
the carrot of longer patents on their most lucrative drugs, or, in
acute crises, simply allow poor countries to declare health
emergencies and seize the patents to make their own generic
versions or buy them from India, Brazil or other countries that
ignore Western patent law.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   (Earlier this month, five major pharmaceutical companies
announced that they were entering negotiations with WHO to
voluntarily lower their prices on their AIDS drugs to Africa by as
much as 80 percent. But last week, at a global convention of health
ministers at WHO's headquarters in Geneva, the ministers of many
poor nations said that was not enough. They asked the WHO to create
a database of all prices for AIDS drugs, including the cheapest
generics from countries that do not honor U.S. or European patents,
and to help them change their patent laws so they could buy them.)
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry invests $27 billion a year in
research, but most of that is a hunt for drugs to lengthen or
brighten the lives of consumers who are already relatively healthy.
Among the biggest sellers are drugs to grow hair, relieve impotence
or fight cholesterol, ulcers, depressions, anxiety, allergies,
arthritis and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies will always aim for maximum profits
by marketing a new obesity drug rather than pioneering a novel
malaria treatment,'' said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who heads the Doctors
Without Borders campaign to get affordable drugs into the more than
80 countries where the group works. ``When new vaccines or
medicines are developed, most of the world's population is left out
of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Market research is now just as important as science in guiding
the decisions of pharmaceutical companies. While executives decline
to say publicly how much potential profit a drug must have to
interest them, many spoke privately to WHO researchers doing a 1998
study of why new tuberculosis drugs were not being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major companies are aiming for $1 billion at peak sales,''
the study concluded. ``Targets vary for companies, but many want to
generate a minimum of $200 million per annum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scourge Is Back
</P>
<P>
   According to a study led by Pecoul, of the 1,233 new medicines
patented between 1975 and 1997, only 13, or less than 1 percent,
were for tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Even of those, only four came from efforts by pharmaceutical
companies to cure humans. The nine others came from work done by
the U.S. Army for the Vietnam War or from research on drugs for
livestock or for the pet market, which industry representatives say
could be a gold mine. Already, Novartis makes a drug to treat
separation anxiety in dogs and Pfizer has one to treat canine
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   No major company is doing new research on sleeping sickness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The town of Omugo in northwest Uganda, a strip of crumbly red
clay stores and thatched mud houses that resemble chocolates in
straw hats, is at the center of the sleeping sickness epidemic that
goes deep into both war-torn Congo and war-torn Sudan nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial-era programs that sprayed insecticide, cleared
riverine brush, treated patients and moved whole villages away from
fly-infested areas are no more than an ancestral memory now. Fifty
years of shifting civil wars have rebuilt the two reservoirs of the
disease: biting flies and untreated people.
</P>
<P>
   And a new outbreak has begun in Uganda's southeast, said Dr.
Dowson S. Mbulamberi, who heads the Ugandan Health Ministry's
efforts against vector-borne diseases like sleeping sickness. His
is a daunting task. Uganda's public health budget amounts to $12
per citizen per year, less than the cost of one tsetse fly trap.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping sickness is actually far too benign a name for human
African trypanosomiasis. The illness is spread by the bite of
tsetse fly, the scissor-winged glossina species found from Senegal
to Somalia to South Africa. In its saliva, the small fly injects a
protozoan that it picks up from feasting on another infected
person.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms start with low fevers, itchy skin, joint pain and
lethargy. But weeks later, when the parasites enter the brain,
patients begin hallucinating or acting wildly. They have been known
to chase family members with machetes, shout all night, throw
themselves into latrines, and pillage other villagers' plots of
cassava or bananas to feed ravenous appetites. Their skins get so
sensitive that cool water or a gentle touch makes them scream. Only
at the end do they lapse into a lassitude so great that they cannot
feed themselves. Then they sink into a coma and die.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, British tsetse control reportedly included ``fly
boys'' _ young men who stood shirtless in the bush slapping flies
and were paid a bounty for each killed. Because the fly likes dense
brush near water, the illness particularly affects women and the
babies they carry on their backs as they collect water or wash
clothes. If infected, even babies must suffer melarsoprol
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft Blamed, Too
</P>
<P>
   Villagers fear sleeping sickness so much that some laboratory
workers say they are testing for malaria, which is known to be
treatable. In the villages, rumors say it is spread by eating pork,
by sex and by witchcraft, said Martin Andama, who visits villages
to test people for the disease as part of a Doctors Without Borders
program.
</P>
<P>
   Jovina Oleru, a woman who was cured and returned to nurse her
son, still stubbornly believes that she is sick because her family
is angry at her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband only paid three cattle for me when I got married,
and I have given him three children,'' she explained. ``So my
family really got nothing for bride-wealth, and they feel bad about
me and perhaps wish me to die.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she indicated, made more sense to her than the idea that
flies make humans sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitalization'' here is cheap; the 60-foot-long ward has a
cement floor, brick walls, a straw roof and plastic sheeting for
windows. Patients are charged nothing, but each has to bring an
``attendant'' from home, who sleeps on the floor, collects firewood
and cooks over a fire in the brick hut in the field outside.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One day recently Alfred M. Guma, 32, a farmer who grows sorghum
and tobacco on his small plot near Omugo, smoothed the rough brown
blanket on his cot in the ward where he was waiting out the 21-day
stay required for melarsoprol treatment. He was in Stage 2, meaning
the parasites had reached the spinal fluid bathing his brain, which
is serious, though the disease had been caught early.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother Steven had a mental breakdown,'' he said. ``He
began to see things that others could not see _ wild animals, dead
people coming to him at night. He feared having a bath and became
aggressive if you touched him, jumping back as if he had touched
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14-year-old Steven, the family finally improvised an
ambulance: They used old clothing to tie him into a box on wheels
behind a bicycle and took him to a hospital. That was five years
ago; Steven, cured, is now in high school.
</P>
<P>
   4 Drugs That Work
</P>
<P>
   Only four drugs are known to work against sleeping sickness and
all four are in trouble. Their problems show how the open
marketplace that works so well for Americans still fails the
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   One is from Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant. Three are
made by Aventis, whose headquarters are in Strasbourg, France. That
is a coincidence; Aventis was formed in a chain of mergers of
French, German and American companies, three of which just happened
to make drugs used against trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
   At $50 for a course of treatment, melarsoprol is relatively
inexpensive, and Aventis has promised to keep making it for as long
as it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a terrible drug _ you don't feel proud injecting
it,'' said Dr. Christine Genevier, director of the Doctors Without
Borders program in Uganda. ``It's caustic, it burns them, and you
don't know if you are going to save your patient or kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a strain of melarsoprol-resistant sleeping sickness is
spreading. Up to a quarter of the Omugo patients have it, so even
if they survive the painful injections they may die anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky product,'' admitted Alain Aumonier, director of
international corporate policy for Aventis. ``We won't claim the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The second drug, Eflornithine, known as DFMO and sold under the
name Ornidyl, is the best treatment for those melarsoprol-resistant
patients. Originally developed as an anti-cancer drug, its
usefulness against sleeping sickness was uncovered by chance in the
1980s; it proved so spectacular at pulling people out of their
final comas that it was nicknamed ``the Resurrection Drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is expensive _ about $210 per course. Worse, the
manufacturer, a U.S. subsidiary of Aventis, abandoned the compound
in 1995 when it proved ineffective against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, pressed by WHO and Doctors Without Borders, whose
supply was running out, the company found 500 pounds of a precursor
chemical in Indianapolis and made one last batch of 7,800 vials.
The chemical is difficult to work with because it is unstable and
corrodes piping; assuring a steady supply would mean building a
whole new production line, Aumonier said, which the company
declines to do.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in December, it signed the patent rights over to WHO,
which is seeking a new manufacturer. An Egyptian candidate proved
unable to meet quality standards. A Texas company offered to make
it at $60 a vial, treble the old price. That is too much; the
search goes on.
</P>
<P>
   A More Exciting Prospect
</P>
<P>
   Aumonier said Aventis made the last batch and turned over the
patent out of a sense of charity. ``And now we feel trapped by what
we've done,'' he said. ``We are reproached for not doing enough
when we could have done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to the disgust of Pecoul, interest in the precursor
chemical has suddenly soared because it might prevent the growth of
facial hair in women. Gillette, the razor company, is doing
research on it, ``because they think it might be a huge market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The third drug is Pentamidine, which is useful only against
Stage 1, when the parasites are confined to the blood. Treatment
takes only 10 days. Under the brand name Lomodine, the drug has
been around since 1941. But in the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s it
was slightly reformulated and renamed Pentacarinat, and its price
soared from $1 a vial to $30 when it was found to work against
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, once one of the chief killers of
people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price increase, the manufacturer, a British company
that became part of Aventis last year, has been supplying it free
to WHO for use against trypanosomiasis. But last year, Aumonier and
health agency officials said, Aventis told WHO it wanted to raise
the price gradually to market level, probably $14 a vial, by the
year 2004. The health agencies protested and the company is
reconsidering, Aumonier said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Suramin, made by Bayer, which has been used
since 1920, also only against Stage 1. It costs less than $50 per
course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It has no other uses, so, a 1999 WHO report said, ``Bayer wished
to stop production, but maintained it on the grounds that no other
alternatives were available.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz-Jozef Bohle, a Bayer spokesman, said the company was
trying to be a good corporate citizen, and was discussing the
supply of three drugs for tropical diseases with the WHO.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry's Case
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical industry executives say they cannot be expected
to shoulder the burden of diseases of the poor alone. ``The
industry has never been philanthropic,'' said Gros, the Aventis
spokesman. ``It has always produced products with an aim to getting
a return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   If rich nations are unwilling to pay for drugs for poor ones, if
poor countries continue to spend fortunes on weapons and if their
doctors keep leaving to work in the West, he said, it is not the
fault of the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that statement `Access to medicine is a human right,'''
said Aumonier of Aventis, quoting an aphorism frequently used by
health advocates. ``But it's a right that should be enforced by the
whole community. May I suggest that the pharmaceutical industry is
only part of that community? It also includes the health care
system, the social system, even the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to be done if the poor are too poor to buy drugs on the
free market? Does government act sufficiently? To say to industry,
`You make money, so you must enforce this human right alone' _
this, somewhere, is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cause of Chaos
</P>
<P>
   Bohle made a similar point, saying Bayer was willing to make
some drugs available cheaply, but wiping out an epidemic took much
more: hospitals, follow-up tests, record-keeping, tsetse fly
control and other elements.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Berman, who works with Pecoul at Doctors Without Borders,
said he was troubled by such industry arguments. ``OK, they didn't
actually cause the problem,'' he said. ``But are they an important
factor in the drugs not being produced? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're there we can distribute them,'' he said. ``The
limiting factor for us is price. But when a company abandons a
drug, there's chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking account of the trend of the last decade in which many
companies have been forced into mergers because their relatively
low stock prices made them tempting targets to competition, Bohle
conceded that Bayer did little research on tropical disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to relativize this,'' he said. ``A company can
support some research without being paid off, but not much.
Especially with the pressure on shareholder value. I remember when
shareholder value was not important at all, and now it's the main
driver. There's always the threat of being taken over.''

THREE STATES AUDITION FOR PLUM ROLE: HOLLYWOOD EAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., N.Y.)   By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are the bouquets and bonbons of the
economic-development world, and these days they are raining down on
Robert De Niro, the Academy Award-winning actor, and Miramax Films,
which are still looking for a place to build a sprawling film
studio.
</P>
<P>
   New York state is down on one knee, pledging a road and perhaps
even a sewer system. New Jersey is whispering sweet nothings about
sales tax exemptions and possibly a direct capital investment. And
Connecticut, though hush-hush about its exact courtship strategy,
is also dangling tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since a tentative film studio deal between
New York City, De Niro and Miramax Films collapsed, the three
states have wasted no time in wooing the taciturn film star and his
influential partner, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax.
Officials say they are eager to pick up the ball they believe Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani dropped.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that the partners felt burned when the Giuliani
administration announced in October that it had chosen another set
of developers to build studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Giuliani
had, after all, tried out his best Godfather imitation for De Niro
and then held a glittering news conference in Brooklyn about their
collective vision for a sound stage complex there.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's sudden shift in favor of other developers (after
administration members decided that that group would build the
studios faster and require less city money) apparently did not dim
the interest of De Niro in creating a film studio in the New York
region. Although a record number of films and television shows have
been shot in New York and New Jersey in recent years, members of
the movie industry and state officials have long complained about
the area's shortage of sound stages, which has forced filmmakers to
go to Los Angeles and Toronto for indoor photography.
</P>
<P>
   The leading studio site contenders appear to be properties in
the city of Yonkers, N.Y., in southern Westchester County, and in
the Hudson County, N.J., town of Harrison, two municipalities
desperate to redevelop their industrial waterfronts with the sort
of sexy centerpiece that the movie partners could provide. De Niro
and Weinstein had briefly considered sites in New York City, but
they have zeroed in on those two tracts, according to someone who
went on some of the tours.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Miramax, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Co., nor De
Niro's company, TriBeCa Productions, would comment on their quest
for a parcel. But people who have met with the actor and Weinstein
and have seen architects' sketches for the two sites say their plan
goes beyond a large film studio to include housing and possibly
stores and restaurants. Such elements could make the proposal more
attractive to investors skittish about the possibility of studios
sitting empty between productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dire need for studios in New York,'' said Charles A.
Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp., New York
state's economic development agency. ``The problem is these things
do not work by themselves. They do not generate enough money, so
they have to have some additional development with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some developers and film executives doubt whether Miramax and
TriBeCa Productions will ever get a shovel in the ground. They cite
a series of grand plans for film studios in recent years that
either evaporated or were drastically scaled back, mostly for lack
of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned late last year, for instance, was an ambitious plan to
build a television and movie studio complex on top of a Manhattan
office building at Houston and West Streets. The $160 million
project, called Hudson River Studios, was to include five sound
stages. But the developers lost their financing after two soap
operas that had committed to using the space pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after years of robust growth, the number of feature
films shot in New York City actually fell by 12 last year to 209.
The Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting is quick to
point out that film production was down slightly nationwide as
well. But the office still contends that there is not enough studio
space in New York to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. They cite a glut of studio space in Los Angeles
and fear an eventual glut in the New York region, too, especially
if the developer selected for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York
Studios, realizes its plan for 11 sound stages. The development
group, led by Douglas C. Steiner, is demolishing buildings at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   And Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens is adding a seventh
studio, but its president, Hal G. Rosenbluth, said: ``We're pushing
the envelope to believe you can build dozens of stages and actually
fill them. We're never going to displace Hollywood. All the
creative decisions to green-light things are still in Los Angeles,
and the majority of the actors, directors and producers live in
L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials in New York and New Jersey are downright bubbly,
promoting the superiority of their respective sites as they
assemble incentive packages for De Niro and Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is more coy. Edward Dombroskas, executive director
of the state's film office, said the filmmakers ``are looking at a
couple of different sites, but I can't reveal where they are.''
Dombroskas was also hush-hush about incentives, but did say breaks
on sales and property taxes were available to companies locating in
so-called entertainment zones.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the filmmakers are looking at a former steel
plant on the Passaic River in Harrison, according to local and
state officials. In 1998, an independent film production company in
Manhattan, the Shooting Gallery, settled on the same 41-acre site
for a grandiose studio plan with 15 sound stages and a $75 million
price tag. That plan was abandoned for a much smaller project in
Manhattan, on Leroy Street in the West Village.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison officials think a Miramax-De Niro studio would have a
better chance of succeeding given the principals' track records.
The mayor of Harrison, Raymond J. McDonough, said he met with
representatives of TriBeCa Productions and Miramax only three weeks
ago, and ``they asked me how they could obtain all the property in
the redevelopment area.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials are offering several lures, from financing
through the Hudson County Improvement Authority to annual payments
to the studio company over 10 years that would represent a portion
of the state income tax revenue generated by the new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gualberto Medina, New Jersey's secretary of commerce, said the
state was also considering a direct investment of money in the
project and was working with the filmmakers on a ``joint request
for proposals'' from potential real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state officials said the Harrison property would be
perfect for a studio complex: It has a cavernous column-free
building with 103,000 square feet and a 100-foot-high ceiling, and
it is across the street from a PATH train station. Gregory J.
Castano, the lawyer for the Harrison Redevelopment Agency, said,
``No other site offers a building like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yonkers site, a former wire factory, also has a building
with a 100-foot ceiling, sans columns, although it is smaller, at
30,000 square feet. The 13-acre parcel may be a bit cramped for a
mixed-used development, but it is a striking location, sitting
alongside the Hudson River, with the wooded cliffs of the Palisades
across the way and the Manhattan skyline to the south. It, too, is
convenient to public transportation, with a Metro-North Railroad
stop only a couple of hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring main building, which is clad in unfortunate
powder-blue panels, was recently used to film a scene from ``Sleepy
Hollow'' _ a nighttime shot of a cornfield that entailed hauling in
600 tons of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girth of the walls, the thickness of the floors, the
enormity of the space _ it's got such character,'' said Paul W.
Adler, the general manager of commercial services for Prudential
Rand Realty, which represents the property's owner, BICC PLC.
``Some of the offices look like something you could film a Bogart
movie in.''
</P>
<P>
   BICC, a transportation and development company in London, is
talking to Weinstein and De Niro about a joint venture, Adler said.
That would also enable the company to oversee a necessary
environmental cleanup of the site, estimated to cost $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, the economic development chairman in New York state,
said the state reached out to the filmmakers after learning that
they were looking in New Jersey last fall. While New York would not
contribute ``seed money'' to the studio project, the state could
help with infrastructure improvements and savings on sales tax, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing here is to get them to build studios in New
York,'' Gargano said. ``That's a very important industry, and it's
good for New York state. New Jersey is ahead of us because they've
been dealing with them longer.''
</P>
<P>
   So are De Niro and Weinstein stringing along New Jersey and New
York, the same way that the Giuliani administration treated them?
State and local officials say their eyes are open. ``They've been
candid that they're looking at other areas,'' said Castano, the
lawyer for the Harrison Redevelopment Agency, ``and we've known
that from the beginning.''

   OMUGO, Uganda _ Jabbing, apologizing and then jabbing again, it
took Harriet Ayikoru nearly 20 minutes to find a usable vein
beneath the sleeves of the sad old Tweety Bird T-shirt that Sentina
Drajiru wore, and when the melarsoprol went in, Drajiru winces.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again she lightly touched her arm to show exactly
where she felt the sharp tip of the pain as the medicine simmered
up it.
</P>
<P>
   It was like eating chili peppers, she said, only it was inside
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you use this drug, the vein is spoiled,'' said Ayikoru, a
nurse in the thatched clinic here. ``As it is corrosive, it erodes
the inside layer. So the relapses like her are the hardest cases _
the scar tissue is there even six months later.''
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol, invented almost 70 years ago, is melarsen oxide
dissolved in propylene glycol _ literally, arsenic in antifreeze.
It kills 5 percent of patients treated with it. But it is the only
medicine available to treat advanced sleeping sickness, one of the
scourges of Africa, which was nearly wiped out 50 years ago but has
made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative ran out in July. The manufacturer, which
abandoned it as unprofitable when it turned out to be useless
against its intended target, cancer, has made one last batch,
enough for 1,000 patients. But 300,000 people are infected each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping sickness is perhaps the most vivid example of the
disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the
fatal or debilitating diseases of the Third World's poor.
</P>
<P>
   These ailments go untreated or badly treated not just because
the poor cannot afford the drugs they need, but because the drugs
themselves do not exist. The pharmaceutical industry has little
incentive to invent them. Companies decline to invest the huge sums
needed to chase a cure they know their potential customers cannot
afford.
</P>
<P>
   According to IMS Health of Westport, Conn., a marketing research
firm that studies the industry, Africa accounts for 1 percent of
world drug sales, while North America, Japan and Western Europe
account for 80 percent. It is for them the companies invent a
stream of high-priced, highly profitable drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor have no consumer power, so the market has failed
them,'' said Dr. James Orbinski, international president of Doctors
Without Borders. ``I'm tired of the logic that says, `He who can't
pay, dies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical executives reluctantly concur. Told that the
industry's critics say it would rather find a cure for a bald
American than a dying African, Francois Gros, a spokesman for
Aventis, the French-German pharmaceutical company, acknowledged:
``That's not completely wrong. We know what's happening in the
Third World, but we don't act.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to explain: ``We can't deny that we try to focus on
top markets _ cardiovascular, metabolism, anti-infection, etc. But
we're an industry in a competitive environment _ we have a
commitment to deliver performance for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A blockbuster drug makes them $1 billion to $1.5 billion a
year,'' said a senior World Health Organization official. ``If
you're running the R&AMP;D department of one of these companies, you're
under a lot of pressure, and they're going to invest in things they
see a market for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has never been philanthropic,'' said Gros. ``It
has always produced products with an aim to getting a return on
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   If rich nations are unwilling to pay for drugs for poor ones, if
poor countries continue to spend fortunes on weapons and if their
doctors keep leaving to work in the West, he said, it is not the
fault of the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many health policy-makers now argue that the world's governments
must somehow force pharmaceutical manufacturers to turn their
attention to diseases like sleeping sickness, malaria,
tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and the various burrowing worms that
kill or cripple millions each year in Africa, Asia and South
America. The last truly new drug for tuberculosis, for example,
which kills 2 million people a year, was invented more than 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, they say, rich nations must either pay the
manufacturers directly, offer them tax breaks, offer them longer
patents on their most lucrative drugs, or simply allow poor
countries to declare emergencies and seize the patents to make
their own generic versions or buy them from India, Brazil or other
countries that ignore Western patent law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry invests $27 billion a year in
research, but most of that is a hunt for drugs to lengthen or
brighten the lives of consumers who are already relatively healthy.
Among the biggest sellers are drugs to grow hair, relieve impotence
or fight cholesterol, ulcers, depressions, anxiety, allergies,
arthritis and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies will always aim for maximum profits
by marketing a new obesity drug rather than pioneering a novel
malaria treatment,'' said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who heads the Doctors
Without Borders campaign to get affordable drugs into the more than
80 countries where the group works. ``When new vaccines or
medicines are developed, most of the world's population is left out
of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Market research is now just as important as science in guiding
the decisions of pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major companies are aiming for $1 billion at peak sales,''
concluded a WHO study of why new TB drugs were not being made.
``Targets vary for companies, but many want to generate a minimum
of $200 million per annum.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a study led by Pecoul, of the 1,233 new medicines
patented between 1975 and 1997, only 13, or less than 1 percent,
were for tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Even of those, only four came from efforts by pharmaceutical
companies to cure humans. The nine others came from work done by
the U.S. Army for the Vietnam War or from research on drugs for
livestock or for the pet market, which industry representatives say
could be a gold mine. Already, Novartis makes a drug to treat
separation anxiety in dogs and Pfizer has one to treat canine
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   No major company is doing new research on sleeping sickness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only four drugs are known to work against sleeping sickness and
all four are in trouble. Their problems show how the open
marketplace that works so well for Americans still fails the
world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   One is from Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant. Three are
made by Aventis, whose headquarters are in Strasbourg, France. That
is a coincidence; Aventis was formed in a chain of mergers of
French, German and American companies, three of which just happened
to make drugs used against trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
   At $50 for a course of treatment, melarsoprol is relatively
inexpensive, and Aventis has promised to keep making it for as long
as it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a terrible drug _ you don't feel proud injecting
it,'' said Dr. Christine Genevier, director of the Doctors Without
Borders program in Uganda. ``It's caustic, it burns them, and you
don't know if you are going to save your patient or kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a strain of melarsoprol-resistant sleeping sickness is
spreading. Up to a quarter of the Omugo patients have it, so even
if they survive the painful injections they may die anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky product,'' admitted Alain Aumonier, director of
international corporate policy for Aventis. ``We won't claim the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The second drug, Eflornithine, known as DFMO and sold under the
name Ornidyl, is the best treatment for those melarsoprol-resistant
patients. Originally developed as an anti-cancer drug, its
usefulness against sleeping sickness was uncovered by chance in the
1980s; it proved so spectacular at pulling people out of their
final comas that it was nicknamed ``the Resurrection Drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is expensive _ about $210 per course. Worse, the
manufacturer, a U.S. subsidiary of Aventis, abandoned the compound
in 1995 when it proved ineffective against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, pressed by WHO and Doctors Without Borders, whose
supply was running out, the company found 500 pounds of a precursor
chemical in Indianapolis and made one last batch of 7,800 vials.
The chemical is difficult to work with because it is unstable and
corrodes piping; assuring a steady supply would mean building a
whole new production line, Aumonier said, which the company
declines to do.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in December, it signed the patent rights over to WHO,
which is seeking a new manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Aumonier said Aventis made the last batch and turned over the
patent out of a sense of charity. ``And now we feel trapped by what
we've done,'' he said. ``We are reproached for not doing enough
when we could have done nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, interest in the precursor chemical has suddenly
soared because it might prevent the growth of facial hair in women.
Gillette, the razor company, is doing research on it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The third drug is Pentamidine, which is useful only against
Stage 1, when the parasites are confined to the blood. Treatment
takes only 10 days. Under the brand name Lomodine, the drug has
been around since 1941. But in the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s it
was slightly reformulated and renamed Pentacarinat, and its price
soared from $1 a vial to $30 when it was found to work against
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, once one of the chief killers of
people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price increase, the manufacturer, a British company
that became part of Aventis last year, has been supplying it free
to WHO for use against trypanosomiasis. But last year, Aumonier and
health agency officials said, Aventis told WHO it wanted to raise
the price gradually to market level, probably $14 a vial, by the
year 2004. The health agencies protested and the company is
reconsidering, Aumonier said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Suramin, made by Bayer, which has been used
since 1920, also only against Stage 1. It costs less than $50 per
course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   It has no other uses, so, a 1999 WHO report said, ``Bayer wished
to stop production, but maintained it on the grounds that no other
alternatives were available.''

CANDIDATE OPENS RACE WITH ATTACK ON HILLARY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island came roaring into the
race for senator from New York on Saturday, attacking Hillary
Rodham Clinton as a ``far-left, extremist'' candidate who has ``no
real rationale for serving here other than as a steppingstone to
some other position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her ambition is the issue,'' Lazio declared in an
interview, as he formally announced his candidacy in a race that
has been upended by the decision of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to step
aside for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's remarks came as Republican leaders in New York and
Washington lined up behind the candidacy of the Suffolk County
Republican, who had himself suspended his campaign last year in
deference to party leaders who wanted Giuliani as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio announced a two-day trip around the state, an aggressive
come-out-of-the-box approach intended to discourage any other
Republicans who might be thinking about challenging him, as well as
to push the Conservative Party into falling behind his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of Lazio's comments _ he repeatedly criticized
Clinton's credentials and ideology _ suggested that the campaign,
with the change in candidate, was going to be harsh and fast-paced.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers have already begun to attack Lazio as extreme
and conservative, noting that he had supported many of the
initiatives of the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they
tried to discredit his candidacy before he had a chance to find his
groundings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, responded to Lazio's
comments Saturday morning by saying: ``It sounds like the same old
negative attack politics. He hasn't even formally announced, and
already he's on the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he considered himself ``a centrist, a mainstream
Republican.'' ``We're conservative, right-of-center on budget and
tax issues, national security issues,'' he said. ``And I think
we're realistic on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his Democratic opponent as ``far left,'' adding:
``She's part of the discredited philosophy that helped lead New
York to ruin during the Cuomo years. I think we've turned the
corner and we don't want to go back to those failed days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lazio jumped at almost every opportunity to
criticize Clinton. He responded vigorously when asked if he would
make an issue out of the fact that Clinton did not live in New York
before this year, a subject that Giuliani frequently raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real thing,'' he said. ``I don't have to try to be
someone else. I was born here. I went to school here. I fished in
these waters. I clammed in its bays. I graduated from our schools.
My children were born in New York state. I've lived here my whole
life. There will be no question of my commitment to this state.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, Clinton was hurt both by the fact that she
had never lived in the state where she wants to serve, and because
of the cloistered life she lived as a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know New York if you have bodyguards around you all
the time,'' he said. ``You've got to know what it's like to ride
the subways, to drive your own car, to buy your own gas, to buy
groceries here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people can see through who Hillary Clinton is, and
they will have a chance to know Rick Lazio as the real deal,'' he
said.
</P>

<P>
   Lazio's announcement on Long Island came as his campaign sprang
almost overnight into full life. Workers at his headquarters in
Suffolk County answered the phone ``Lazio 2000,'' early Saturday,
and Lazio's Web site urged voters to contribute money, addressing
what his aides acknowledged on Saturday was one of the more vexing
problems he faced in his contest against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Newly hired staff members flew up from Washington, with a
notable representation from the presidential campaign of Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee. That is because
Lazio's media adviser, Michael Murphy, performed the same role for
Alexander in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lazio campaign staff struggled through a chaotic
morning, as they grappled with such questions as which town Lazio's
headquarters was located in (Bay Shore) and the area code (631),
from an onslaught of news media that abandoned Giuliani at City
Hall for Lazio's headquarters on Long Island with startling speed.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers and state Republican leaders, concerned that
Giuliani's prolonged exit had dealt Clinton a strong early
advantage, moved to tap down even the most remote prospect that
Lazio would face any competition for the party's nomination.
``There is no question Lazio will be the candidate,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Across New York state, Republican leaders fell in line with Gov.
George Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers,
and proclaimed not only their support for Lazio but also their
belief that he would prove to be a formidable opponent to Clinton,
despite the obvious obstacles he faces now. (Some Republicans went
so far as to privately suggest that he was a better candidate than
Giuliani would have been.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The race at the end of the day is going to be about who best
can serve New York, and based on his record in Congress, it's
clearly going to be him,'' said Zenia Mucha, the chief political
aide to Pataki. She said that Lazio ``understands what it means to
be a New Yorker. She's in the process of learning. His basic
philosophy is a smaller role of government for the people. Her
basic philosophy is that government has all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of Long Island, bowing to this reality, withdrew
from seeking the Republican nomination. He said Saturday morning
that he did not want to cause any division within the Republican
party, and mentioned Pataki's enthusiastic endorsement of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's circles on Saturday, the debate was not over
whether the candidate should attack Lazio, but when. Unlike
Giuliani, Lazio is barely known to most New Yorkers, so the
immediate struggle is a race to see which side succeeds in defining
Lazio first _ both in remarks on the campaign trail and in
television advertisements _ over the next few weeks. All of this
suggests that this campaign will, in fact, be harsher and more
pointed than the Clinton-Giuliani race ever had a chance to become.
</P>
<P>
   There was definite worry in Republican circles that Lazio would
have been a stronger candidate had he had an earlier start, which
would have allowed him more time to raise money, get the experience
he needs to run a race, and become better known to New Yorkers.
Republicans, though, emphasized repeatedly that Lazio would be a
strong candidate, because he appeared to have a hunger for the job
that Giuliani never evinced, and also because Lazio was more in
tune with Republican positions on issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After the president of Florida State University, Talbot
D'Alemberte, dared to suggest last fall that a star wide receiver
serve a jail sentence before returning to play football, some of
the irate letters he received were telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare you treat Athletic Director Hart and Coach Bowden as
mere subordinates,'' wrote an alumnus, Ron Lawrence. ``I will never
give another penny to the university as long as you are president
of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   When outstanding athletes or popular coaches get in trouble,
college presidents like D'Alemberte face extraordinary pressure;
they must weigh the lofty moral and educational standards of their
schools against students, sports fans, wealthy alumni and donors
demanding success on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the contending forces _ and the potential risks to a
university's reputation _ been more evident than at Indiana
University last week, when the legendary basketball coach, Bob
Knight, escaped dismissal even though the president, Myles Brand,
and the university trustees concluded he had a long history of
abusive behavior, including choking a player and bullying a
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   To many people outside Indiana, the decision seemed odd, a
capitulation to a powerful coach with a persistent three-decade
record of inappropriate words and actions. But within the state,
where many members of the political power structure are alumni of
Indiana University, and Knight is a celebrity whose name is more
widely known than the governor's, the decision to give Knight one
more chance made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the state, more people view him as a case of the
positives outweighing the negatives,'' said Murray Sperber, an
English professor at Indiana who writes books on college sports and
has long been a critic of Knight. ``That explains the pressures on
Brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say Knight's case illustrates the great divide
between the ideals of universities and the reality of big-time
college sports: in many schools, athletics have become a potent
entertainment business, with coaches and athletes who become media
stars and help market schools, attracting donations and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``College sports becomes the bridge between the elite culture of
the university and the mass culture outside the university upon
which the university depends,'' said Dr. Allen L. Sack, the
director of the sports management program at the University of New
Haven. ``In the midst, holding up that bridge, are the college
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, officials at the University of Minnesota and
the University of Tennessee have struggled with allegations of
academic fraud by athletes, while the University of Nebraska dealt
with accusations that star football players physically abused
women. The University of Vermont canceled part of the hockey season
earlier this year because of hazing, and Providence College
expelled three basketball players last week over an assault.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brand insists that he made the decision to give
Knight ``one last opportunity'' without regard to pressure from
alumni and Hoosier basketball fans, who staged a demonstration on
campus and flooded Brand's office with e-mail messages. Several
alumni organizations also threatened to stop giving to the
university, said Michael Pegram, a booster who organized the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may have been people who said, `I won't give money
anymore,''' Brand said in an interview. ``All those issues have to
be totally ignored in the decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brand said he and most of the nine-member board of
trustees had been leaning toward dismissing Knight until the
basketball coach posted an apology on the Internet. Then Brand met
at his home with Knight and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he told Knight that the trustees were on the verge of
voting to dismiss him. But during a three-and-a-half-hour
conversation, he said, Knight persuaded him to recommend penalities
instead. For the first time, Knight accepted responsibility for his
past actions and promised to rein in his temper, Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he believed that the university had been culpable as
well. For 29 years, he said, officials had either ignored Knight's
abusive behavior or let him off with light sanctions, setting
``implicit rules'' that Knight could behave as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Brand recommended to the trustees that Knight
be given one last chance. The coach was fined $30,000, suspended
for three games and ordered to abide by a strict code of conduct or
face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever sanction I gave him would not have been enough,''
Brand said. ``The meat of the issue were the directives about how
he's expected to behave in the future and if he doesn't, he doesn't
have a second chance anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy decision to make was to terminate Bob Knight,'' Brand
added. ``I knew there was a groundswell of interest outside the
state to terminate him.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even inside the state, opinion was divided. Trustees said they
had received hundreds of letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was down the middle,'' John Walda, the board president,
said ``It was either `This was a witch hunt begun by the media and
you should ignore it,' or `It's about time, you should get rid of
Coach Knight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another trustee, Ray Richardson, a former state legislator, said
the decision was a no-win situation politically for the board. A
poll by The Indianapolis Star last month showed about 55 percent of
state residents thought Knight should remain as coach and about 39
percent said he should not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge segment of Hoosiers that feel that he's done
some nasty things, but they weren't necessarily ready to fire
him,'' Richardson said. ``I was trying to figure out what would
please the people in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he had been prepared to vote to dismiss Knight,
but changed his mind after Brand told the board of Knight's sincere
promise to change. ``Knight's never had an incentive to control
himself,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members, however, said the trustees' decision had
irreparably damaged Indiana University's reputation. ``It sends the
message that athletics are more important than academics, that
marketing and revenue streams mean more than scholarships,'' said
Dave Pisoni, a psychology professor.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida State University, the pressure on D'Alamberte to keep
the football team's star receiver, Peter Warrick, on the field was
more overt. One donor threatened to withdraw a $1 million
contribution, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had been charged with another football player and a
department store cashier in a $600 shoplifting scheme. Warrick's
lawyer, John Kenny, along with the football coach, Bobby Bowden,
and athletic director, Dave Hart Jr., had worked out a plea
agreement with the Tallahassee prosecutor, Willie Meggs. Warrick
would plead guilty to a misdemeanor, and he would serve 30 days in
jail after the football season.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alamberte said it was university policy, set after two
previous cases involving players convicted of crimes, that Warrick
must pay his debt to society before returning to football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had that policy, and I thought I made it clear to everyone
all along that was going to be my policy,'' D'Alemberte said in an
interview. ``A lot of people got outraged, in part because it
looked as if everything had been worked out and I was stepping
in.''
</P>
<P>
   His office immediately received more than 600 letters and e-mail
messages, denouncing him as well as supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two or three major donors who were sending me
messages that they were not going to give the gift they had
promised,'' he said. ``The best thing for a university president to
do is to stake out a ground that he feels comfortable with and stay
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried alumni and other Seminole football fans also bombarded
the prosecutor, himself an alumnus, with angry mail. They lobbied
sympathetic state legislators to use their influence. ``I had
hundreds of phone calls,'' said state Sen. Jim King of
Jacksonville, also a graduate of Florida State. ``I thought the
phone would never stop ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Warrick's lawyer brokered a new deal. Instead of
jail time, Warrick was allowed to do community service _ picking up
trash for 30 days _ after admitting his guilt. D'Alamberte
permitted Warrick to rejoin the football team before doing the
community service, reasoning that the punishment was much less
severe than jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line I have drawn looks at the result produced by the
criminal justice system,'' he said. ``The judgment here is `This
has been pretty minor.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles went on to win the national championship at the
Sugar Bowl, in large part because of Warrick's outstanding play.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, university officials respond in varying ways when
coaches and athletes face possible suspension or dismissal. The
facts vary, and so do the outside pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Providence College, a small Roman Catholic school in
Rhode Island with a well-respected Big East basketball program,
came down hard on members of the basketball team for their role in
an assault last month.
</P>
<P>
   Three players projected as starters next season were expelled.
``An assault on a student goes to the very heart of who we are,''
the college president, the Rev. Philip A. Smith, said. ``This is
not a basketball issue for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, elected officials have even urged universities to
take strong action. The University of Vermont canceled the
remainder of the hockey season last January after Gov. Howard Dean
intervened in the wake of a hazing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the team had alleged in a lawsuit that he had
been degraded during hazing. Among other things, he said he had
been forced to wear women's panties and to parade naked at a party
while holding the genitals of other freshman players.
</P>
<P>
   University officials had investigated the allegations last fall,
but had had difficulty penetrating a wall of silence among the
hockey players, said the president, Dr. Judith Ramaley. The coach,
Mike Gilligan, had planned to suspend each player for one game on a
rotating basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged at what had gone on,'' Dean said in an
interview last week. ``My concern was that the university didn't
appear to be taking any action.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean made a rare appearance before the board of trustees, where
he is an ex officio member, and made his feelings known. University
officials then asked the state attorney general to investigate the
allegations. Under oath, several hockey players admitted they had
not told the truth earlier and provided details. Ramaley then
canceled the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Although hockey is the most popular college sport in the state,
Ramaley said she had not been pressured by fans or alumni to go
easy on the players. Indeed most Vermont alumni seemed to support
canceling the season, she said. The problem had been getting to the
bottom of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned to our shock the students had lied,'' Ramaley said.
``We ended up making a statement about character.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Indiana's decision to keep Knight on may have also
been about character, critics say. Knight's flamboyant and volatile
style has kept him and his teams in the public eye for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a media star of heroic proportions,'' said Sack of New
Haven. ``You are messing with an American institution, who stands
for all that popular culture and mass culture holds in high
regard.''

presidential candidate George W. Bush, none is so bold _ or such a
long-shot _ as this: ``I'm going to win California,'' he said
recently in the state that could go a long way toward determining
this year's White House race. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

the trappings of a busy family in the year 2000. Their
three-bedroom ranch in this suburb south of Dayton bristles with
technology including four computers, four phones and an answering

half-century disappeared? No word processing, e-mailing or cordless
telephones. No dishwasher, clothes dryer or microwave. That's what
we wanted to find out when we went looking for a family who would
forgo all modern conveniences _ essentially live in a 1950s bubble
_ for seven days. (DeBrosse, Dayton Daily News)

 &HT;    California win for Bush is an uphill battleBy Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Of all the bold ambitions harbored by GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush, none is so bold _ or such a
long shot _ as this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to win California,'' he said recently in the state
that could go a long way toward determining this year's White House
race.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of talk that has the California GOP _ fresh out of
in-state heroes _ convinced that the Texas governor can ignite a
Republican renaissance in a state that's become about as Democratic
as a big state can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an uphill fight. The game of government is a one-party
game in California right now,'' said Mark Sheppard, chairman of the
Young Republican Federation of California. ``In this election, the
California Republican Party, because of Governor Bush, has a unique
opportunity to redeem ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But in politics, one party's poster boy is the other party's
punch line. Among California Democrats, Bush is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is funny,'' said Garry South, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis'
top political adviser, ``because he doesn't have the slightest
chance of carrying California.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan rhetoric aside, the facts are clear. Vice President Al
Gore cannot win the presidency without winning California, which
has 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Bush can get
to the White House without carrying California, but a win here
could seal it.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats, on the cutting edge of a national effort
to cast Bush as out of the mainstream, are now working to prevent a
Bush win by portraying him as standard-issue right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Bush as some kind of new Republican, they say.
Forget about Bush connecting with California Hispanics, who have
been alienated and energized by GOP support here for measures
ending affirmative action, bilingual education and benefits for
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   And, Democrats here say, forget about Bush carrying California,
one of only three states where Democrats have the Governor's
Mansion, both U.S. Senate seats, a majority of the U.S. House
delegation and majorities in both state legislative chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure in Texas he looks like a compassionate conservative
because Texas is so far to the right,'' said South. ``In that
landscape he really does seem like a sensible moderate. In
California, the guy looks like a right-wing wacko.''
</P>
<P>
   In his East Los Angeles office, Hector Barreto, co-chairman of
the Bush campaign here and the son of a wealthy former Kansas City
businessman, acknowledges that the Republicans are up against a
tough set of facts, including their failures in California and a
general feeling that the state has done well under Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But tell them not to let the facts blind them,'' he said,
echoing the Bush believers' mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, in stylish Westwood, Gerry Parsky, Bush's
California chairman, isn't letting the facts cloud the optimism he
feels from his 21st floor office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, if you look at history,'' he says in the face of
the litany of why a Republican can't carry California. ``But I
think you're wrong if you look at this candidate and the progress
he has made so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Through monthly visits and a series of major policy speeches out
here, Bush is working on the moderate image and trying to connect
with Hispanics, who could make up as much as 15 percent of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a reasonable person,'' said Parsky, a venture
capitalist whose daily commute is a private plane flight from a San
Diego suburb. ``He is not an extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   But California Democrats already have a TV ad campaign in mind
to push the W.-stands-for-wacko message. Party strategist Bob
Mulholland sees a commercial featuring footage of Bush and Bob
Jones University President Bob Jones III during the now-famous
February speech at the conservative South Carolina college.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if Bush Jr. comes to California and says, `I'm a different
kind of Republican,' then we go up on the air on choice and guns.
It takes his knees out from under him. He is not a different kind
of Republican. We got him, babe,'' said Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers seem to support the Democrats. An American Research
Group survey completed May 1-9 among 600 likely California voters
showed Bush trailing Gore 50 percent to 36 percent. And no
anti-abortion rights candidate has won a major race here since the
elder George Bush did it in 1988. All 10 U.S. Senate races since
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision have been won by candidates,
including two Republicans, who favored abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Recent presidential elections out here have been GOP disasters.
In 1992, the elder Bush, who conceded the state, picked up only 33
percent of the vote. In 1996, GOP nominee Bob Dole, who also made
no real effort, got only 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And then it got really bad for Republicans. In 1998,
then-Attorney General Dan Lungren lost the gubernatorial race to
Democrat Davis by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether two years ago was an aberration or the
beginning of a trend,'' said Lungren, who believes a combination of
1998 events _ including an anti-union initiative that riled and
roused labor _ contributed to his landslide defeat. ``No one can
make an accurate prediction now about what will happen in November.
But George Bush is doing those things he needs to do to put himself
in position to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll, which has been measuring California politics
since 1947, found that Davis beat Lungren ``in nearly every region
of the state and piled up majorities among Democrats, independents,
moderate and liberal voters, men and women and across all income,
age, educational, race and ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis carried the Hispanic vote by a 78-17 margin. A poll
conducted for the Southwest Voter Registration Education project
late last year showed Bush within one percentage point of Gore
among Hispanics in Florida, Texas, Illinois, California and New
York, states that account for about 80 percent of the Hispanic
population.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, Bush trailed by a whopping 27 percentage
points. California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente, a co-chairman of the
Gore campaign here, said that trend will persist through Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he wants to do for the nation what he has done for
Texas,'' said Bustamente, eager to call attention to ethnically
insensitive comments of two Bush appointees. ``My response is 'No
thanks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health Commissioner William Reyn Archer, a Bush appointee,
recently apologized after saying that young, unmarried Hispanics
lacked the belief ``that getting pregnant is a bad thing.'' Another
Bush appointee, Charles Williams of Marshall, recently resigned as
chairman of the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and
Education after it was revealed he had testified in a 1998 lawsuit
that terms such as ``porch monkey'' were not racial slurs. He also
said that blacks didn't mind being called ``niggers'' 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dealing with California Democrats' efforts to
link Bush to his appointees' comments, the Texas governor's
things-to-do list includes undoing the political damage lingering
from ex-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's support of the propositions
ending bilingual education, affirmative action and benefits for
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Bush takes no position on bilingual education, saying instead
that he is interested in results and is willing to let local school
officials decide the best way to go.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the 1994 California proposition that ended benefits,
including education, for illegal immigrants. The measure was later
ruled unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   But some political scientists say the differences will be lost
on California Hispanics who won't look beyond the party label.
Michael Latner, a Field Poll project manager, saw nothing in the
March primary that indicates Bush is making progress among
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't appear as though Hispanics are distinguishing him
as a different type of Republican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State University political scientist Larry Gerston
agrees, saying Bush will be ``very hard-pressed'' to avoid being
``lumped in with Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged the hurdle, saying, ``It's going to be
tough just because I've got 'Republican' by my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Barreto believes Bush has to carry 40 percent of the Hispanic
vote to carry California. In the state's nonpartisan primary in
March, with all presidential contenders on a single ballot, Bush
pulled only 18 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to exit
polls. Gore took 55 percent. The GOP candidates combined for 36
percent, a statistic Parsky sees as cause for optimism. But
Bustamente believes Bush is California dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very cynical thing to think you can speak a little
Spanish and ride in a Cinco de Mayo parade and then represent the
interests of a community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That work has to begin now as Democrats try to marginalize Bush
on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs the risks the possibility of being Lungrenized,'' said
Latner. ``Lungren was not a far-right conservative by any means
when the election began. But Davis was successful at using issues
such as gun control and abortion and staying on that message and
hammering that into the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland and other California Democrats like to say their
state is the most ``anti-gun'' in the nation, and Bush's ties to
the National Rifle Association will prove politically fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, says Mulholland, is ``the most anti-choice, pro-NRA and
pro-voucher Republican presidential nominee ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsky believes Bush can overcome the effort to hand the
right-wing image on him, but it will take a three-pronged approach
complete with constant visits by the candidate, a strong TV ad
campaign and a grassroots effort.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky says he has a commitment from the Bush campaign to
compete ``at the highest level possible'' on all facets of the
campaign, and that the effort won't just be a sleight of hand to
force Gore into spending money in California.
</P>
<P>
   As state chairman, Parksy is in charge of the grassroots part of
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem, however, is that some of the best foot
soldiers in that effort are not second-guessing their support for
the propositions that alienated many Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them gathered for lunch last week in a flowery meeting
room in Orange, a solidly Republican part of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The ladies of the Orange Republican Women Federated are
unapologetic about their support for the measures ending bilingual
education, affirmative action and benefits for illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we went to another country and tried to be in their
country we would have to learn their language,'' Patricia Welch, a
club vice president. ``And the same thing with benefits. We
wouldn't get benefits. If I moved to Italy, for instance, I would
not get benefits from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Club member Charlotte Bell still believes affirmative action
made her daughter a victim of reverse discrimination when she was
denied admission to UCLA's nursing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was qualified. A lot of the other people they were
accepting were not qualified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's meeting began with longtime member Mary Widdows
leading the Pledge of Allegiance and bemoaning the fact that local
Hispanics and Vietnamese fly the flags of their homelands more
often than other local residents fly the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like them coming here and getting welfare within 24
hours,'' said Widdows, daughter of German immigrants. ``That's not
fair to us who are paying huge taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the sentiment Bush wants permeating the
campaign. But San Jose State political scientist Gerston says all
of those issues could fade in importance if the state's now-golden
economy starts to show some tarnish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom is this is a Gore state for a lot of
reasons, not the least of which has been the coincidence of the
phenomenal economic recovery of California with the successes of
the Clinton administration.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to run against prosperity, according to Gerston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we talk with our hearts and we vote with our
wallets. And no one does that more than California,'' he said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two- two pitch...''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Caray is perched, Buddha-like, in a radio booth high above
home plate at Turner Field. He's warming up: 45 minutes before the
Braves' next-to-last exhibition game, Caray is pronouncing into a
dead microphone a phrase that, as Atlanta baseball's radio and TV
announcer the past 24 seasons, he has repeated . . . tens of
thousands of times? Hundreds of thousands? He leans again into the
dead mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two -two pitch...''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be here in the booth to know it's Caray. That
voice. One of the most distinctive styles in sports broadcasting,
it doesn't require that you even be a baseball fan to recognize it.
Caray's delivery _ a nasally, sweet-sax honk at the high end, with
the low notes kept nice and warm in the back of his throat _ has
crackled over the airwaves so many years it's now part of the
region's ambient summer soundtrack, like crickets and lawn mowers
and kids squealing under a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been there so long he's become an icon,'' says Allen
Ginsberg, director of special projects for BBDO South ad agency.
``When people hear his voice, they just identify it with baseball
games.''
</P>
<P>
   More memorable than the sound, however, is the tone. When not
ramped up to describe the Braves '95 World Series victory (``Yes!
Yes! Yes!''), or Sid Bream's slowpoke, pennant-clinching expedition
from second base to home plate in the '92 playoffs (``Braves win!
Braves win! Braves win!''), Caray puts the dead into deadpan _ a
dry, wry, wily inflection that courts crankiness, sarcasm and the
kind of summer's-night, old-friend knowingness that comes from
having seen most of what he's seeing many times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip is like balsamic vinegar on a fine salad,'' says Jeff
Hullinger, WAGA sportscaster and the radio voice of Falcons
football. ``He has a little vinegar in him, and that's such an
important part of a good meal. So many places around the country
have these vanilla-voiced guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say things that drive me and John (Schuerholz, Braves
general manager) up the wall,'' adds Braves president Stan Kasten.
``He's always testing the boundaries. He lives for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's never malicious,'' he says. ``That's why he's
freakin' lasted so long.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 15 minutes before the game. Caray leans into that dead mike
one last time. Nobody else in the booth has paid any attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-two pitch...'' Caray says again, the same way he said
it the two other times: deliberate, detached, self-mocking. It's
Skip Caray doing Skip Caray.
</P>
<P>
   He then pushes away from the mike and heads toward the press box
food court. He has a wide man's rolling, canoe-rocking walk, and on
his way out says to no one in particular, ```The two- two
pitch...As long as I can say that, I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   `I GOT GRANDCHILDREN I'D LIKE TO SEE GROW UP'
</P>
<P>
   At 60, the middle rung on a broadcasting dynasty that started
with his father, Harry, and continues with his son Chip, Caray is
attempting these days to be something more than all right. He has
announced this year (during Braves games, on Neal Boortz's radio
show) that he intends to be a ``new, mellow Skip.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeover is prompted by two concerns that reached critical
mass last season. The first: Caray's grouchy, even Grinchy persona
on WSB radio's pregame show, where he flashed little patience for
callers wanting to know, for instance, how to compute a player's
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The second: his health, on which decades of road-trip-style
drinking took a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at (WSB) thought I was being too hard on callers,''
Caray acknowledges. ``I don't think so, but I decided I'd be Mr.
Mellow. Ever since I quit drinking, I look at things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray says he hasn't had any alcohol since New Year's Day; he
drinks water during games and treats himself to a diet soda
afterward. He's lost 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had enough,'' he says, sipping water inside his soaring
house where he lives with Paula, his wife of 24 years, and
18-year-old Josh, the youngest of four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older, it (alcohol) gets tougher to handle,''
Caray adds. ``I was told that cirrhosis of the liver was a
longshot. I got grandchildren I'd like to see grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   His new mellowness caught a lot of people by surprise. While WSB
radio group general manager Dave Meszaros said Caray was
cooperative and ``not defensive'' when they met following last
season to discuss his call-in show demeanor, other employers have
had a different experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most difficult employee I've ever had in my life,''
says Bob Wussler, former executive vice president of Turner
Broadcasting who now runs a media consulting business in
Washington. ``He wanted to show up late and go home early. He never
wanted to read the promos. We had epic battles over contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to deal with him, including Ted (Turner),''
Wussler adds. ``But at the end of the day, he did whatever you
wanted him to do. It was just getting him to the point of agreeing
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray's handling of pregame callers came to a head last season
when sports talk-show hosts at rival 790 The Zone regularly blasted
what they viewed as Caray's abrupt, rude manner with fans phoning
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very irritated by his treatment of callers,'' says
790 afternoon host ``Steak'' Shapiro, who admits fanning the flames
to gig the competition. ``It sounds like the last place he wants to
be is in front of a mike talking to listeners. When I started to
trumpet that, the response was huge. People said, `Finally,
somebody is calling this guy out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Others recall an off-the-air Caray who could be gregarious and
generous one minute (``I know him as a guy who'd give you the shirt
off his back _ just don't try to take it,'' says on-air sidekick
Joe Simpson), then bitingly short-tempered the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get crazy about any little thing. He'd get
furious,'' says his brother Chris Caray, retired from a St. Louis
travel business. ``He was a piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's a new man _ it's really spooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with age,'' Chris adds. ``There's a part of all of us
that continues to grow, even in our 50s and 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inside his home on a late Thursday afternoon, Caray is .
. . mellow. He looks over at a visitor and asks, ``You want a
drink?''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor blinks back. A few minutes earlier, Caray had gone
on about how he doesn't miss the booze one bit.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``Just because I don't drink 'em doesn't
mean I can't still pour 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes to the kitchen and puts together a whiskey and
water. Just a splash. Pours it with a fine, schooled hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a really good drink.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAYOR OF RUSH STREET
</P>
<P>
   Caray learned to pour 'em from the best: his father, the late
Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray. It was his father who taught
Caray to love baseball, pushed him into broadcasting, showed him
what a good time the profession could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my dad in his underwear many times, coming out of the
bathroom, stubble on his face after a hangover, going to work,''
Caray recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was an institution in St. Louis through four decades, then
a national institution as the Cubs announcer on WGN in Chicago. He
cried ``Holy cow!'' after every homer, led Wrigley Field fans in
``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
was known as ``the mayor of Rush Street,'' the bar-lined avenue he
virtually called home. In his later years, his bombastic style and
thick, black-rimmed glasses became a campy imitation on ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   He died two years ago, at age 83. His funeral was televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked broads and booze and never tried to fool you,'' Caray
says. ``Dad was a fun guy, and I miss him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray grew up, in St. Louis, the son of that institution. A
tricky spot: Sometimes good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Caray's parents divorced when he was barely a teen, a
high-profile, highly affecting circumstance. The day after the
divorce, Caray saw it headlined in a St. Louis newspaper. Something
like: Caray's Wife Throws Him Out at Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day was the longest walk to school of my life,'' he
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   It also might be the moment that the no-excuses,
quit-your-whining template that underpins Caray's character _ from
his caustic humor to his frank impatience _ was born. His mother,
Dorothy, now 81 and living with Caray's sister near Atlanta,
remembers him never complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a girl in my class who came from divorced parents,
and we talked about how people use divorce as an excuse for what
they do,'' Caray recalls. ``We were like a support system for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   With a younger sister and brother, Caray lived mostly with his
mother, a shy woman with a dry humor. For Caray's siblings, their
father's visits were often off-the-wall stopovers of the
hard-drinking life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were difficult times _ I couldn't really describe it,''
says his sister Patricia Caray, retired from Coca-Cola. ``It could
be tough, but the love was still there. Sometimes you had to remind
yourself of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Skip is not the kind of person who'd think about (the
divorce) one way or the other. He'd look at it as the hand he was
dealt and play it. He really loved his father _ to be his father's
son was all he could ever want.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry took his oldest son to spring training each year, and on
road trips with the Cardinals each summer. Skip loved it. He still
remembers the train rides, listening to coaches tell stories for
hours in hotel lobbies, mingling with players like they were
neighborhood dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any heroes in baseball _ I knew the players on a
first-name basis,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Caray was a good high school athlete, but a knee injury turned
him into what he calls the first requirement of a sports announcer:
a frustrated athlete. He was in the booth by junior high school,
doing his own radio sports report on powerhouse KMOX. His
relationship with broadcasting was as natural as it was with
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never afraid of the mike,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted him to become a broadcaster and Caray, who
earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, never
considered anything else. Why would he? His father's life was a
rolling party, and he made more money than a lot of players.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
</P>
<P>
   After announcing minor-league baseball in Oklahoma and Georgia _
he was the voice of the old Atlanta Crackers in '64 and '65 _ Caray
arrived in Atlanta for good in 1969, to do Hawks basketball. He was
30, married and had two children. But the marriage broke up (``I
was too young''), the kids moved back to St. Louis with their
mother, and Caray followed in his father's hard-living footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got divorced just when birth control came into being, and
before AIDS became a problem _ every night was New Year's Eve,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights were spent at the now-defunct Brave Falcon Lounge,
that attracted that era's men on the make _ sportsmen, lawyers,
salesmen _ and plenty of women wanting to make it with them. For a
while, Caray had his mail delivered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dewar's and water and let's see what happens,'' he
says. ``God, I loved that place. For the most part I was with good
friends. The laughs _ the laughs were so much better than the
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he adds, ``A lot of the happiness was superficial. A little
booze and a young lady and you sorta forget about missing your
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray eventually met his second wife there. Paula Prather owned
the hairstyling salon Caray went to next door, and she'd stop by
the Brave Falcon after work. She turned down a bunch of Caray's
advances; born in Georgia, she didn't know anything about baseball
or Harry Caray. ``I just sorta stumbled into it,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1976. Caray adopted Paula's young daughter, and
a few years later they had Josh. When he wasn't on the road, Caray
became a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   Says oldest son Chip, now a Cubs announcer, ``That's where
there's a difference with my grandfather (Harry): My dad had a
greater appreciation for the importance of family at a younger age.
While he loves his job, he doesn't live for his job, like my
grandfather did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather loved meeting and talking with people all the
time _ that was his personality. My dad can't do that. Nobody's
like Harry Caray. And nobody can be.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ONLY A GAME
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now, with the Braves' decade-long success,
the degree of utter lousiness Caray described for fans of those
early Hawks and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad with the Hawks that Kasten, then the team's
assistant general manager, challenged Caray nightly by finding an
obscure word for him to work into the broadcast: syzygy, homunculus
_ like that.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bob Costas recalls in the middle of one Hawks blowout
Caray giving viewers permission to turn off their sets, as long as
they patronized the station's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the greatest thing I heard an announcer
say,'' Costas says. ``It breaks that wall, where the announcer is
telling the fan, `I'm thinking what you're thinking.' It was, like,
subversive.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray kept it up when he joined the Braves. ``Ted (Turner) told
me, `I don't know anything about this (stuff), say whatever you
want.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did: He'd page through a TV Guide during a game to see what
else was on; give scathing reviews of the sci-fi B-movies that then
filled TBS's schedule; instituted a ``punchline of the day,'' with
viewers sending in dirty jokes that couldn't be told on the air, to
which Caray would read only the punchline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Skip's humor really came in. His imagination would
run amok,'' says broadcasting partner Pete Van Wieren, who joined
the Braves the same year as Caray. ``We were out of some races so
early that there were no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lean years are what carved Caray's unhyped,
it's-just-a-game style that, because of TBS's cable reach, became
familiar around the country. ESPN anchor Rich Eisen remembers
imitating Caray while growing up in New York, and now regularly
imitates him during ``Sports Center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the voice. They come up to me in airports and ask
me to do it,'' Eisen says. ``I'm a New Yorker, and I never thought
I'd be known for doing an imitation of a guy who does baseball in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Skip, you get a kind of good-natured world weariness,''
adds Costas. ``I'm sure he's too low-key for some people, in the
same way Harry could be too over the top. But those of us who have
an interest in broadcasting and baseball have an appreciation for
what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry was broad enough that everybody got him. Only the
intelligentsia get this.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU EITHER LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM
</P>
<P>
   An hour before another game. Caray's hunched over a live mike
inside a cramped WSB radio hut in Turner Field's centerfield
pavilion _ ``Skip-in-a-box,'' some at WSB call the setup _ hosting
the pregame show. He's fielded a half-dozen calls so far and been
nice as pie.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's enamored of the new, mellow Skip. For some, his
doesn't-suffer-fools-gladly approach was a cult find. Chipper Jones
compares him to ``not Rush Limbaugh, exactly . . . He's the Neal
Boortz of play-by-play.'' Boortz says he should have a forum on
``60 Minutes'': ``He'd make Andy Rooney look like a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate baseball but I never turn off the pre-game show,'' says
Marcia Killingsworth, Georgia native and public relations manager
at Georgia Public TV. ``The people who call are so passionate about
the Braves, and the tone Skip uses when he responds to some of
their minutia _ it's so dry, honestly, I almost drive off the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People either love him or . . . dislike him,'' adds Braves
pitcher John Smoltz. ``I've grown to really like him. The first
time I listened to the pregame show, I couldn't stop laughing.
People say he's a rude son-of-a-gun, but I know how many calls he
has to deal with and it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz grins. ``I'm thinking of getting somebody to call him up
and ask a really stupid question. Just to see how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that person be Rob in Stone Mountain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where and how,'' begins a caller identified on a computer
screen inside the WSB hut only as Rob in Stone Mountain, ``should I
consolidate my student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray's confused. He asks Rob to repeat the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' says Rob. ``Where and how should I consolidate my
student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray is trying to decide if this is the kind of call he'd so
famously boot in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a job and then pay 'em off . . .'' Caray begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rob interrupts. ``Is Clark Howard around?''
</P>
<P>
   Rob's got the wrong show. Caray tells him to try back another
time and breaks for a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to make me mad,'' he says off the air. ``A
simple'' _ he uses an expletive phrase _ ``would have been an
appropriate answer. But I'm going to be this way all year. Until I
lose it. If I lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Caray smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles!

   ``He used to get crazy about any little thing. He'd get
furious,'' says his brother Chris Caray, retired from a St. Louis
travel business. ``He was a piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's a new man _ it's really spooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with age,'' Chris adds. ``There's a part of all of us
that continues to grow, even in our 50s and 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inside his home on a late Thursday afternoon, Caray is .
. . mellow. He looks over at a visitor and asks, ``You want a
drink?''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor blinks back. A few minutes earlier, Caray had gone
on about how he doesn't miss the booze one bit.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``Just because I don't drink 'em doesn't
mean I can't still pour 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes to the kitchen and puts together a whiskey and
water. Just a splash. Pours it with a fine, schooled hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a really good drink.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAYOR OF RUSH STREET
</P>
<P>
   Caray learned to pour 'em from the best: his father, the late
Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray. It was his father who taught
Caray to love baseball, pushed him into broadcasting, showed him
what a good time the profession could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my dad in his underwear many times, coming out of the
bathroom, stubble on his face after a hangover, going to work,''
Caray recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was an institution in St. Louis through four decades, then
a national institution as the Cubs announcer on WGN in Chicago. He
cried ``Holy cow!'' after every homer, led Wrigley Field fans in
``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
was known as ``the mayor of Rush Street,'' the bar-lined avenue he
virtually called home. In his later years, his bombastic style and
thick, black-rimmed glasses became a campy imitation on ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   He died two years ago, at age 83. His funeral was televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked broads and booze and never tried to fool you,'' Caray
says. ``Dad was a fun guy, and I miss him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray grew up, in St. Louis, the son of that institution. A
tricky spot: Sometimes good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Caray's parents divorced when he was barely a teen, a
high-profile, highly affecting circumstance. The day after the
divorce, Caray saw it headlined in a St. Louis newspaper. Something
like: Caray's Wife Throws Him Out at Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day was the longest walk to school of my life,'' he
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   It also might be the moment that the no-excuses,
quit-your-whining template that underpins Caray's character _ from
his caustic humor to his frank impatience _ was born. His mother,
Dorothy, now 81 and living with Caray's sister near Atlanta,
remembers him never complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a girl in my class who came from divorced parents,
and we talked about how people use divorce as an excuse for what
they do,'' Caray recalls. ``We were like a support system for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   With a younger sister and brother, Caray lived mostly with his
mother, a shy woman with a dry humor. For Caray's siblings, their
father's visits were often off-the-wall stopovers of the
hard-drinking life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were difficult times _ I couldn't really describe it,''
says his sister Patricia Caray, retired from Coca-Cola. ``It could
be tough, but the love was still there. Sometimes you had to remind
yourself of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Skip is not the kind of person who'd think about (the
divorce) one way or the other. He'd look at it as the hand he was
dealt and play it. He really loved his father _ to be his father's
son was all he could ever want.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry took his oldest son to spring training each year, and on
road trips with the Cardinals each summer. Skip loved it. He still
remembers the train rides, listening to coaches tell stories for
hours in hotel lobbies, mingling with players like they were
neighborhood dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any heroes in baseball _ I knew the players on a
first-name basis,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Caray was a good high school athlete, but a knee injury turned
him into what he calls the first requirement of a sports announcer:
a frustrated athlete. He was in the booth by junior high school,
doing his own radio sports report on powerhouse KMOX. His
relationship with broadcasting was as natural as it was with
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never afraid of the mike,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted him to become a broadcaster and Caray, who
earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, never
considered anything else. Why would he? His father's life was a
rolling party, and he made more money than a lot of players.
</P>
<P>
   LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
</P>
<P>
   After announcing minor-league baseball in Oklahoma and Georgia _
he was the voice of the old Atlanta Crackers in '64 and '65 _ Caray
arrived in Atlanta for good in 1969, to do Hawks basketball. He was
30, married and had two children. But the marriage broke up (``I
was too young''), the kids moved back to St. Louis with their
mother, and Caray followed in his father's hard-living footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got divorced just when birth control came into being, and
before AIDS became a problem _ every night was New Year's Eve,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights were spent at the now-defunct Brave Falcon Lounge,
that attracted that era's men on the make _ sportsmen, lawyers,
salesmen _ and plenty of women wanting to make it with them. For a
while, Caray had his mail delivered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dewar's and water and let's see what happens,'' he
says. ``God, I loved that place. For the most part I was with good
friends. The laughs _ the laughs were so much better than the
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he adds, ``A lot of the happiness was superficial. A little
booze and a young lady and you sorta forget about missing your
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray eventually met his second wife there. Paula Prather owned
the hairstyling salon Caray went to next door, and she'd stop by
the Brave Falcon after work. She turned down a bunch of Caray's
advances; born in Georgia, she didn't know anything about baseball
or Harry Caray. ``I just sorta stumbled into it,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1976. Caray adopted Paula's young daughter, and
a few years later they had Josh. When he wasn't on the road, Caray
became a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   Says oldest son Chip, now a Cubs announcer, ``That's where
there's a difference with my grandfather (Harry): My dad had a
greater appreciation for the importance of family at a younger age.
While he loves his job, he doesn't live for his job, like my
grandfather did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather loved meeting and talking with people all the
time _ that was his personality. My dad can't do that. Nobody's
like Harry Caray. And nobody can be.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ONLY A GAME
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now, with the Braves' decade-long success,
the degree of utter lousiness Caray described for fans of those
early Hawks and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad with the Hawks that Kasten, then the team's
assistant general manager, challenged Caray nightly by finding an
obscure word for him to work into the broadcast: syzygy, homunculus
_ like that.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bob Costas recalls in the middle of one Hawks blowout
Caray giving viewers permission to turn off their sets, as long as
they patronized the station's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the greatest thing I heard an announcer
say,'' Costas says. ``It breaks that wall, where the announcer is
telling the fan, `I'm thinking what you're thinking.' It was, like,
subversive.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray kept it up when he joined the Braves. ``Ted (Turner) told
me, `I don't know anything about this (stuff), say whatever you
want.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did: He'd page through a TV Guide during a game to see what
else was on; give scathing reviews of the sci-fi B-movies that then
filled TBS's schedule; instituted a ``punchline of the day,'' with
viewers sending in dirty jokes that couldn't be told on the air, to
which Caray would read only the punchline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Skip's humor really came in. His imagination would
run amok,'' says broadcasting partner Pete Van Wieren, who joined
the Braves the same year as Caray. ``We were out of some races so
early that there were no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lean years are what carved Caray's unhyped,
it's-just-a-game style that, because of TBS's cable reach, became
familiar around the country. ESPN anchor Rich Eisen remembers
imitating Caray while growing up in New York, and now regularly
imitates him during ``Sports Center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the voice. They come up to me in airports and ask
me to do it,'' Eisen says. ``I'm a New Yorker, and I never thought
I'd be known for doing an imitation of a guy who does baseball in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Skip, you get a kind of good-natured world weariness,''
adds Costas. ``I'm sure he's too low-key for some people, in the
same way Harry could be too over the top. But those of us who have
an interest in broadcasting and baseball have an appreciation for
what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry was broad enough that everybody got him. Only the
intelligentsia get this.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU EITHER LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM
</P>
<P>
   An hour before another game. Caray's hunched over a live mike
inside a cramped WSB radio hut in Turner Field's centerfield
pavilion _ ``Skip-in-a-box,'' some at WSB call the setup _ hosting
the pregame show. He's fielded a half-dozen calls so far and been
nice as pie.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's enamored of the new, mellow Skip. For some, his
doesn't-suffer-fools-gladly approach was a cult find. Chipper Jones
compares him to ``not Rush Limbaugh, exactly . . . He's the Neal
Boortz of play-by-play.'' Boortz says he should have a forum on
``60 Minutes'': ``He'd make Andy Rooney look like a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate baseball but I never turn off the pre-game show,'' says
Marcia Killingsworth, Georgia native and public relations manager
at Georgia Public TV. ``The people who call are so passionate about
the Braves, and the tone Skip uses when he responds to some of
their minutia _ it's so dry, honestly, I almost drive off the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People either love him or . . . dislike him,'' adds Braves
pitcher John Smoltz. ``I've grown to really like him. The first
time I listened to the pregame show, I couldn't stop laughing.
People say he's a rude son-of-a-gun, but I know how many calls he
has to deal with and it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz grins. ``I'm thinking of getting somebody to call him up
and ask a really stupid question. Just to see how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that person be Rob in Stone Mountain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where and how,'' begins a caller identified on a computer
screen inside the WSB hut only as Rob in Stone Mountain, ``should I
consolidate my student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray's confused. He asks Rob to repeat the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' says Rob. ``Where and how should I consolidate my
student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray is trying to decide if this is the kind of call he'd so
famously boot in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a job and then pay 'em off . . .'' Caray begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rob interrupts. ``Is Clark Howard around?''
</P>
<P>
   Rob's got the wrong show. Caray tells him to try back another
time and breaks for a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to make me mad,'' he says off the air. ``A
simple'' _ he uses an expletive phrase _ ``would have been an
appropriate answer. But I'm going to be this way all year. Until I
lose it. If I lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Caray smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles!

 &HT;    Going out in style
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For the first time in 12 years, you and your
parents finally see eye-to eye on your choice of outfits: the cap
and gown.
</P>
<P>
   But as with every other get-up you've tried to sneak past the
'rents, your under-gown attire will be a series of compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Since it can get rather hot under that gown, and graduation
ceremonies seem to go on forever, try wearing something
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only outfit that 'breathes' less than a graduation gown is
a space suit,'' said Marne Loveman, marketing and development
associate at Party411.com. ``Nothing is worse than a graduate who
squishes across the stage, so think light, airy fabrics like cotton
and linen.''
</P>
<P>
   Women should look for a nice dress or skirt that does not extend
below their gown, which, according to Jostens, should hit about
midway between their knees and ankles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the school has specific rules (and many do), please
make sure that Miss Graduate is wearing something easy and elegant
_ a simple dress or a skirt and blouse would be perfect,'' Loveman
said. ``Whatever she chooses, what's underneath should be in a
light color if her graduation gown is white, or yellow. Not only is
it cooler, but nothing ruins the look of that hard-earned
graduation gown more than seeing the faint outline of the magenta
dress underneath _ which, of course, you won't even notice until
the pictures come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys also feel the tug of looking nice in cap and gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on school customs, Mr. Graduate may need to wear a
tie,'' Loveman said. ``If so, this is the time to borrow a rep
(ribbed silk) tie or foulard (soft, lightweight silk, rayon or
acetate fabric made in a twill weave) from Dad to wear with a
neatly pressed shirt in white, blue or another pale color. Either a
spread collar or button down, both are perfectly fine. Even if a
tie is not required, it looks so much better that you ought to
bribe him to do it. Don't insist on dress trousers; neatly pressed
casual khaki or olive drab is fine. However, draw the line at jeans
and shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sedberry, college administration counselor at Waco High
School, said the administration always tries to remind graduating
seniors that this is an important event and they should try to act
dignified in their appearance and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them to wear a dark color under your (red) gown,''
Sedberry said. ``We also suggest they wear short sleeves because
often it's hot and they have to stay in (their gowns) for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable part of the graduate's attire is their
shoes. Any type of dress shoe should be fine, but just remember if
you can't walk around in them everyday without tripping and
falling, then it might be best to wear a different, more
comfortable pair. The last impression you want to leave your
classmates with is of you falling face-first on the stage or into
the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls should go with a moderately dressy shoe,'' Loveman said.
``Boys need to wear either a loafer or dress shoe. Graduation is
not the place for flip-flops . . . tennis shoes or bunny slippers,
regardless of the gender of the graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedberry added: ``Students need to wear shoes that are
appropriate _ not tennis shoes, but dress shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveman said parents should explain to their children that
graduation ceremonies are meant to be a formal, important event not
a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor is graduation the time for your kid to affix a message out
of masking tape letters to the top of their mortarboard or the back
of their gowns,'' Loveman said. ``Do your best to discourage it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedberry agreed: ``We do discourage that because this is a
serious time.''

 &HT;    A wall of words comes tumbling down
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Periodically there come in one's life Rubicons that
must be crossed, and one of these for Dr. Vivian Bearing is the
matter of punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   The lead character in Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning
play, ``Wit,'' is a pedant for whom commas and commitment are
paired. ``Nothing but a breath _ a comma _ separates life from life
everlasting,'' her old professor E.M. Ashford declaims in a scene
that defines the play's deceptive conflict. ``It is very simple
really. With the original punctuation restored, death is no longer
something to act out on a stage, with exclamation points. It's a
comma, a pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Bearing, like her mentor, is a scholar, a ranking authority, she
lets us know, on the poetry of John Donne. She is also a
50-year-old woman dying of ovarian cancer. Between the two _ the
contingency of life and the confines of one particular cubbyhole in
the English department _ are no distinctions. ``I know all about
life and death. I am, after all, a scholar of Donne's Holy Sonnets,
which explore mortality in greater depth than any other body of
work in the English language.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit,'' as audiences have learned for themselves and drama
critics have ably pointed out, is a play about mortality and about
professional vanity. But it is also a play about the failure of
language. Therein lies, of course, the irony _ a word Bearing uses
with a literary critic's proprietary relish. (``Irony,'' Bearing
tells the audience with blue-nosed formality, ``is a literary
device that will be deployed to great effect.'')
</P>
<P>
   Things are never (ironically) quite as they seem, and among them
is communication between people who have every reason for mutual
understanding and yet are imprisoned by their private tongues. Even
here, the word ``imprisoned'' is not quite right because they have
chosen _ for reasons of pride _ to close the cell door behind them.
Knowing only the lingua franca of their subspecialty, they talk
past one another in a profusion of polysyllables. The nub of the
matter _ that she is going to die _ is buried in language, the very
medium by which one person connects with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``In invasive epithelial carcinoma,'' the lead oncologist tells
her, ``the most effective treatment modality. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As he's speaking, Bearing is adjudicating what he'd said moments
before:
</P>
<P>
   ``Insidious. Hmm. Curious word choice. Cancer. Cancel.''
</P>
<P>
   The words, accurate enough in their technical meaning, obscure
more than they reveal. In doing so, they impose a conversational
distance between doctor and patient that both _ for their separate
reasons _ use as emotional protection.
</P>
<P>
   It is only slightly different with her doctor's understudy, a
young man who, it turns out, took Bearing's course in 17th-century
poetry while an undergraduate. Jason Posner remembers her; she does
not remember him. Both are competitively intelligent, fearful of
making a mistake, fencing with every word. Now it is the student
who has the advantage. When the diagnosis is malignancy, literary
criticism is at even greater discount. But his patient's illness
only presents Posner with another intellectual puzzle to be solved,
not a life that has met its implacable enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Disease, as Susan Sontag wrote in ``Illness as Metaphor,'' is
the nightside of life, ``a more onerous citizenship. Everyone who
is born owns dual citizenship in the kingdom of the well and the
kingdom of the sick. Although we prefer to use only the good
passport, sooner or later each of us is obliged, at least for a
spell, to identify ourself as citizens of that other place.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wit,'' the duality is seen in the further dimension of
reason vs. feeling. In an opening scene that elicits laughter
because of its pomposity, Bearing _ speaking to the audience _
says, ``How are you feeling today? Great. That's just great.'' It
is not, she says, her usual way of speaking:
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend toward something a little more formal, a little less
inquisitive, such as, say, `Hello.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But people ask how she's feeling, and she must answer: ``Should
one reply, `I feel good,' using `feel' as a copulative to link the
subject, `I,' to its subjective complement, `good'; or `I feel
well,' modifying with an adverb the subject's state of being?''
</P>
<P>
   These, too, are intellectual puzzles, and she's reached the
point where she just says, ``I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet feel is not what she habitually does, anymore than her
doctors do, and when the armor of intellect cracks she is exposed
and vulnerable. On her deathbed, her old mentor, a Dr. E.M.
Ashford, visits her. Words can no longer protect her, and she had
never allowed them to deepen her. She had used them to hide from
life. Her old teacher had seen it years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper's not the point,'' Ashford is shown telling Bearing
when she was an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vivian,'' teacher tells student, ``you're a bright young
woman. Use your intelligence. Don't go back to the library. Go out.
Enjoy yourself with your friends. Hmm?''
</P>
<P>
   She went outside, briefly. Students were on the lawn, ``talking
about nothing, laughing. The insuperable barrier between one thing
and another is . . . just a comma? Simple human truth,
uncompromising scholarly standards? They're connected? I just
couldn't . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And back to the library she went, to bury herself in texts, safe
from the world, safe from life.

IN COLLEGE SPORTS, DISCIPLINE IS OFTEN BENCHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: This is a 1,050-word abridgment of the 2,000-word
COLLEGE-SPORTS-DISCIPLINE) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the president of Florida State University, Talbot
D'Alemberte, dared to suggest last fall that a star wide receiver
serve a jail sentence before returning to play football, some of
the irate letters he received were telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare you treat Athletic Director Hart and Coach Bowden as
mere subordinates,'' wrote an alumnus, Ron Lawrence. ``I will never
give another penny to the university as long as you are president
of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   When outstanding athletes or popular coaches get in trouble,
college presidents like D'Alemberte face extraordinary pressure;
they must weigh the lofty moral and educational standards of their
schools against students, sports fans, wealthy alumni and donors
demanding success on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the contending forces _ and the potential risks to a
university's reputation _ been more evident than at Indiana
University last week, when the legendary basketball coach, Bob
Knight, escaped dismissal even though the president, Myles Brand,
and the university trustees concluded he had a long history of
abusive behavior, including choking a player and bullying a
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   To many people outside Indiana, the decision seemed odd, a
capitulation to a powerful coach with a persistent three-decade
record of inappropriate words and actions. But within the state,
where many members of the political power structure are alumni of
Indiana University and Knight is a celebrity whose name is more
widely known than the governor's, the decision to give Knight one
more chance made sense.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say Knight's case illustrates the great divide
between the ideals of universities and the reality of big-time
college sports: in many schools, athletics have become a potent
entertainment business, with coaches and athletes who become media
stars and help market schools, attracting donations and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``College sports becomes the bridge between the elite culture of
the university and the mass culture outside the university upon
which the university depends,'' said Dr. Allen L. Sack, the
director of the sports management program at the University of New
Haven. ``In the midst, holding up that bridge, are the college
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, officials at the University of Minnesota and
the University of Tennessee have struggled with allegations of
academic fraud by athletes, while the University of Nebraska dealt
with accusations that star football players physically abused
women. The University of Vermont canceled part of the hockey season
earlier this year because of hazing, and Providence College
expelled three basketball players last week over an assault.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brand insists that he made the decision to give
Knight ``one last opportunity'' without regard to pressure from
alumni and Hoosier basketball fans, who staged a demonstration on
campus and flooded Brand's office with e-mail messages. Several
alumni organizations also threatened to stop giving to the
university, said Michael Pegram, a booster who organized the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brand said he and most of the nine-member board of
trustees had been leaning toward dismissing Knight until the
basketball coach posted an apology on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he met with Knight for several hours and Knight
persuaded him to recommend penalities instead. For the first time,
Knight accepted responsibility for his past actions and promised to
rein in his temper, Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said he believed that the university had been culpable as
well. For 29 years, he said, officials had either ignored Knight's
abusive behavior or let him off with light sanctions, setting
``implicit rules'' that Knight could behave as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Brand recommended to the trustees that Knight
be given one last chance. The coach was fined $30,000, suspended
for three games and ordered to abide by a strict code of conduct or
face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members, however, said the trustees' decision had
irreparably damaged Indiana University's reputation. ``It sends the
message that athletics are more important than academics, that
marketing and revenue streams mean more than scholarships,'' said
Dave Pisoni, a psychology professor.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida State University, the pressure on D'Alamberte to keep
the football team's star receiver, Peter Warrick, on the field was
more overt. One donor threatened to withdraw a $1 million
contribution, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had been charged with another football player and a
department store cashier in a $600 shoplifting scheme. Warrick's
lawyer, John Kenny, along with the football coach, Bobby Bowden,
and athletic director, Dave Hart Jr., had worked out a plea
agreement with the Tallahassee prosecutor, Willie Meggs. Warrick
would plead guilty to a misdemeanor, and he would serve 30 days in
jail after the football season.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alamberte said it was university policy, set after two
previous cases involving players convicted of crimes, that Warrick
must pay his debt to society before returning to football.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alemberte's office immediately received more than 600 letters
and e-mail messages, denouncing him as well as supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two or three major donors who were sending me
messages that they were not going to give the gift they had
promised,'' he said. ``The best thing for a university president to
do is to stake out a ground that he feels comfortable with and stay
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried alumni and other Seminole football fans also bombarded
the prosecutor, himself an alumnus, with angry mail. They lobbied
sympathetic state legislators to use their influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Warrick's lawyer brokered a new deal. Instead of
jail time, Warrick did community service _ picking up trash for 30
days _ after admitting his guilt. D'Alamberte let Warrick rejoin
the team before doing the community service, reasoning that the
punishment was much less severe than jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line I have drawn looks at the result produced by the
criminal justice system,'' he said. ``The judgment here is `This
has been pretty minor.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles went on to win the national championship at the
Sugar Bowl, in large part because of Warrick's outstanding play.

<P>
   MIDLAND, Texas _ The fourth-grade classroom erupted in titters
as George W. Bush, one of the class clowns, faced his friends. He
had quietly used an ink pen to draw a beard and long sideburns on
his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Frances Childress, marched George to the
principal's office at Sam Houston Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been making a disturbance in class,'' the principal, John
Bizilo, recalls Childress telling him.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was pretty obvious for anyone in the 1950s version
of the West Texas oil town of Midland: Bizilo told George to bend
over and then reached for his paddle, the thickness of a Ping-Pong
paddle but narrower and twice as long. Bizilo gave George three
``licks,'' and the boy's shrieks filled the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit him, he cried,'' Bizilo remembered. ``Oh, did he
cry! He yelled as if he'd been shot. But he learned his lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the roots of Bush's political philosophy as a
presidential candidate _ including his belief in tough love for
juvenile offenders _ seem to go back to his childhood. Midland, a
conservative, up-from-the-bootstraps town that has grown from
25,000 when he was a little boy to almost 100,000 today, mirrors
Bush's optimism, his faith in business and his doubts about an
activist government. While growing up, George W. Bush absorbed West
Texas values that many old friends say are central to understanding
who he is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his political philosophy comes completely from the
philosophy of the independent oil man,'' said Joe O'Neill, a fellow
rapscallion in childhood. ``His homage to his parents, his respect
for his elders, his respect for tradition, his belief in religion,
his opposition to abortion _ that's the philosophy he grew up with
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself made a similar point. ``I don't know what
percentage of me is Midland,'' he said, ``but I would say people,
if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland and the
attitude of Midland.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has often said that ``the biggest difference between me and
my father is that he went to Greenwich Country Day and I went to
San Jacinto Junior High.'' That may be an exaggeration of the
younger Bush's populist credentials, because he is also a product
of Andover, Yale and Harvard. But there is still something to it.
</P>
<P>
   The father suffered politically because of the perception that
he was a blue blood. The younger Bush also has been tainted by the
idea that he was born into privilege with a visa to effortless
wealth and prominence. Yet George W. Bush actually had a rather
ordinary childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Midland childhood is a striking contrast to that of another
boy growing up at the same time, Al Gore, who instead of being
paddled in Bizilo's office was attending the elite St. Albans
School in Washington and listening on an extension as his father
the senator spoke on the telephone to President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Midland was a world of clear rights and wrongs, long on
absolutes and devoid of ethical gray shades. It may be the source
of some of Bush's greatest political strengths, the
unpretentiousness and mellow bonhomie that warm up voters, and also
of his weaknesses, including an image of an intellectual
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The oil made Midland a boomtown, attracting ambitious
businessmen like the elder Bush and many other out-of-staters.
These people made for a conservative town but not a redneck one;
Midland had a large proportion of geologists, engineers, lawyers
and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Children bicycled everywhere and crime was almost nonexistent.
Yet what no one volunteers is that it was also rigidly segregated,
like most places in the South. Racial slurs were routine, and young
George picked up the words from neighbors. Once when he was about 7
years old he used one in front of his mother, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Proctor, who was playing with George at the time,
remembers watching as Bush dragged her son into the bathroom. She
washed his mouth out with soap as he spluttered indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family was probably the only one around that didn't use
racial slurs,'' Proctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the racism directed at blacks, there was a measured
respect for the Mexicans who came to work in the oil fields. As a
boomtown, Midland welcomed Mexican immigrants, who were regarded as
hard-working and thrifty. Some friends find an echo of that
attitude in Bush's efforts to push the Republican Party to reach
out to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I formed the very strong impression,'' recalls Randall Roden,
a neighbor boy and friend, ``and I think George has the same one,
that these people came for economic opportunity and worked very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, though born in 1946 in New Haven, Conn., while
his father was still a student at Yale, moved to West Texas when he
was not quite 2. The Bush family in the Northeast had money, but
the elder George left all that behind to make his own fortune in
West Texas. Equipped with connections but initially without seed
money, George and Barbara Bush and little George, their firstborn,
settled in a tiny apartment in the hard-driving oil town of Odessa.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They later moved to Midland and into a series of nicer houses as
the family prospered.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gov. Bush is often seen as a princeling, and Al Gore
as more of his own man. But in the 1950s and early 1960s, it was
the other way around. Back then, the name George Bush belonged only
to an obscure Texas businessman. In contrast, ``Albert Gore'' was
virtually a household name, belonging to a prominent senator (the
present candidate's father and namesake).
</P>
<P>
   Yet young George was not some country hick, and he also learned
to fit into the world of his Connecticut grandparents. The family
regularly spent part of the summer at the family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, and in 1954 the father took George and his
best friend, Randall Roden, to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The boys and girls who once played dodgeball at Sam Houston
Elementary School offer recollections that are very similar:
Midland was an idyllic place in which to grow up, and George W.
Bush was a very typical child.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, his ambition was to be another Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``All George ever wanted to be was a Major League baseball
player,'' recalled a buddy, Terry Throckmorton. ``That's all he
ever talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever accused Bush of being an intellectual, and the
indifference to books started early. Childhood friends recall Bush
reading only two sets of books for pleasure _ the Hardy boys and a
series of mystery books about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we sit around in those days reading books?'' asked Robert
A. McCleskey, a playmate, smiling broadly. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstwhile acquaintances, while deeply admiring of the Bushes'
goodness and decency, have trouble recalling early signs of
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, I never did think about what he might do in life,''
said Austine Crosby, his third-grade teacher. ``He was just a good,
well-rounded young man, and he did his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he did not distinguish himself as a student, former
classmates describe him as smart and blessed with an excellent
memory. He had a passion for baseball statistics, a first-rate
collection of baseball cards and a reputation as such a shrewd
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Midland may not have had the best schools, George's onetime
playmates say, but _ like Hot Springs, Ark., where Bill Clinton
grew up _ it offered a nurturing environment and self-confidence
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a town of embedded values,'' Bush said of Midland, adding
that it had ``a heavy dose of individualism and fairly healthy
disrespect for government.''
</P>
<P>
   The city was also was steeped in optimism, and for many people
growing up here in the 1950s, the moral of childhood was that the
system worked, that anyone who struggled enough in that baking
desert had a good chance of finding oil and striking it rich.
</P>
<P>
   The antipathy for government seems a little odd, from afar,
because in those days the oil business depended heavily on quirks
in the tax code. Still, when the people of Midland sought a
theater, a hospital and a baseball diamond, they did not ask the
government but raised money themselves and turned out to do much of
the work.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one terrible interruption in his relaxed
childhood, occurring when George was 7. He was at school when he
saw his parents' green Oldsmobile drive up.
</P>
<P>
   His parents had come to tell him that his 3-year-old sister,
Robin, had died of leukemia. The loss staggered the family, and
some friends say that George's closeness to his mother dates partly
from his efforts to comfort her at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The death left him as a quasi-only child, for his next-oldest
sibling, Jeb, was six and a half years younger. Neil and Marvin
were 9 and 10 years younger, and Dorothy was 13 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's political debut appears to have come in the
seventh-grade. Classmates recall that he ran for class president
against Jack Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Jack was a formidable candidate, and four years later at Boys
Nation he would be elected vice president, defeating a personable
candidate from Arkansas named Bill Clinton. Yet in running against
George, Jack was less fortunate, and classmates say that George was
elected by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for George because he was cuter,'' recalled Peggy
Porter Weiss, ``and in the seventh-grade that's what counted.''

EDITORIAL: AFTER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   California's decision in 1996 to outlaw the use of race in
public college admissions was widely viewed as the beginning of the
end for affirmative action at public universities all over the
United States. But in the four years since Californians passed
Proposition 209, most states have agreed that killing affirmative
action outright would deepen social inequality by denying minority
citizens access to higher education. The half-dozen states that are
actually thinking about abandoning race-sensitive admissions
policies are themselves finding that the only way to enlarge the
minority presence in college without such policies is to improve
dramatically the public schools that most black and Latino students
attend.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these states are keeping a close eye on California,
Texas and Florida, where ``percentage systems'' have sprung up to
replace affirmative action. Under these systems, students who
achieve a specified ranking in their high school graduating classes
are guaranteed admission to state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, the so-called 4 percent plan
guarantees college admission to everyone in the top 4 percent of
high school graduating classes statewide. Minority enrollment,
which crashed after Proposition 209 passed, has rebounded at the
second-tier colleges. But the decline has continued at the flagship
colleges, UCLA and Berkeley _ largely because the high schools in
black and Latino neighborhoods routinely fail to offer the advanced
placement courses that are readily available in white neighborhoods
and that are taken into account when the elite colleges make
admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California has
challenged this arrangement in a class-action lawsuit. Having
eliminated the race-sensitive policies that once compensated for
these inequalities, California is now being forced to deal with the
inferior public schools that made those policies necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas has learned a similar lesson since a
federal court ruling forced it to abandon race-based admissions
policies in 1996. Black and Latino enrollment dipped precipitously
in the first year, but rose again after the legislature passed a
law guaranteeing college admission to all students who graduate in
the top 10 percent of any public high school class.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission attributed
this success to innovative recruiting, mentoring and tutoring
programs. But the overwhelming lesson in Texas is that the public
schools from which minority students come must be improved if these
students are to perform at the top levels at the University of
Texas. Texas now forces public schools to keep academic achievement
records by race, and penalizes schools that allow black and Latino
children to fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is currently embroiled in a fight over
an executive order that outlaws race-based admissions at the state
universities _ while guaranteeing admissions to the top 20 percent
of high school classes. Bush's order was meant to render moot a
ballot initiative on affirmative action that Republicans feared
would heighten black turnout in this year's presidential election.
The 20 percent rule seemed non-controversial and even generous _
until Bush found that roughly two-thirds of additional black
students who might benefit from the rule had been so neglected in
high school that they had failed to graduate with the necessary
credits for admission to the state university system. The state is
now pushing public schools that serve black students to provide
better course offerings.
</P>
<P>
   What all these states have learned is that the only real way to
make race-sensitive policies unnecessary is to guarantee black and
Latino children from poor communities a realistic chance at a
decent education that prepares them for college. To kill the
policies before those guarantees are in place is to court civic
disaster.

EDITORIAL: TRIALS FOR THE KHMER ROUGE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 20:
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after the Khmer Rouge killed more than a million
Cambodians, surviving leaders of the terror may finally be
prosecuted for their crimes. The United Nations recently reached an
agreement with the government of Cambodia that could establish a
credible judicial process for handling the cases. The court would
be in Cambodia and require the cooperation of the Cambodian leader,
Hun Sen, who had been seeking to cripple any prospect of
independent justice. He has now agreed _ orally at least _ to
substantial safeguards against his ability to manipulate the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's judicial system has neither the competence nor the
political independence to conduct fair trials on its own.
International participation is essential. At issue has been a
legitimate demand by the United Nations that the tribunal include a
foreign prosecutor with sufficient independent authority to issue
indictments. Under a compromise proposed by the United Nations,
co-prosecutors _ one foreign and one Cambodian _ would issue
indictments. Disputes between them would be resolved by a judicial
panel comprising three Cambodian judges and two foreign judges. A
``super majority'' of four judges would be required to quash an
indictment, meaning that the foreign judges could thwart any effort
by Hun Sen to override indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The new framework should make it possible to prosecute senior
Khmer Rouge officials with whom Hun Sen cut deals of immunity in
exchange for political loyalty. Some issues have yet to be ironed
out, including control over witness protection and extradition of
suspects who might flee Cambodia. There would still be room for Hun
Sen to try to manipulate the trials themselves. Cambodian judges
will have a say in the outcome of the trials as well as in
procedural rulings.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Hun Sen will carry out his end of
the bargain. But if he does, the trials would be conducted under
the careful scrutiny of international observers as well as the
Cambodian public. Breaches of due process will be duly noted and
widely condemned. Any miscarriage of justice will do harm both to
Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge terror and to the
credibility of the United Nations. If it becomes clear that justice
is not being done, the United Nations must be prepared to suspend
its participation and walk away.

 &HT;    BRITAIN'S BLAIR, A DADDY AGAIN, IS MOVED BY THE EXPERIENCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON, Jr. 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While he's unwilling to knock off a few weeks to be a
full-time daddy, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is expected to
bend his schedule to serve the needs of his new son.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's hard-driving attorney wife Cherie gave birth to Leo, the
couple's fourth child, early Saturday morning. It is the first
birth to a sitting prime minister in 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its being a novel advent because of the stature
of Leo's mom and dad, the birth and pregnancy also have been
watched closely because of his parents' ages: Blair is 47, and his
wife is 45.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cherie Blair's much chronicled pregnancy went without a
hitch, and the birth was natural and routine. It was the first
delivery that the prime minister attended in person.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to reporters in Downing Street Saturday afternoon, the
blue-jean clad prime minister was obviously moved by the
experience. ``It was the first time I've seen the whole thing
through, and it was quite a struggle, really,'' said Blair after a
night that had provided him little time for sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like any father who sees their baby born. It is a very
moving experience,'' he said. ``He's a gorgeous little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo was born four days ahead of schedule at 12.25 a.m. British
time (7:25 p.m. Eastern Time) and weighed 6 pounds 12 ounces. In a
bit of revenge for Cherie Blair, who has been displayed in her
heavily pregnant
</P>
<P>
   glory without mercy by British newspapers, the birth came too
late for the papers to indulge in their usual headline frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping past reporters staked out overnight at the hospital,
the Blairs returned to their Downing Street apartment immediately
after the delivery. The first glimpse of the new baby is not
expected until next week. For weeks, Britons have been debating
whether Blair would follow the leanings of his wife and Labor
Party, which support paternal leave, or the dictates of his
renowned workaholic personality.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who has said he expects to change his share of diapers,
has ruled out taking a full leave. Instead he said he will adopt a
vacation work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously will try to do as much as possible to cut down in
that period what I'm doing,'' Blair said in a recent interview.
``But I still have to run the country; that still has to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before heading to the hospital to give birth, Cherie
Blair _ who uses her maiden name Booth at work _ argued in court to
force her husband's government to expand Britain's new parental
leave law to cover
</P>
<P>
   parents of children born before the provision was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Cherie Blair _ a very successful lawyer _ caused a
buzz when she criticized the long hours demanded in today's
workplaces and encouraged employers to strike a balance between
work and family.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Finland's prime minister had availed himself of
his country's paternity leave laws to take time off from office.
``I, for one, am promoting a widespread adoption of this fine
example,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   The British public apparently is fine with the idea of the prime
minister's leaving Parliament for parenthood. A Gallup poll in the
Daily Telegraph on May 15 found that 57 percent believe Blair
should take time off and ``let others take important decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that 60 percent of Britons believe that
someone ``who carries the heavy responsibilities that the Prime
Minister does should play an active part in caring for the new
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Bookmakers had been taking bets on what the child might be
called, with Leo installed as 2-1 favorite. Yogi, Teddy and Rupert
were offered at 1,000-1. The baby was named after Blair's father.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs' other children are sons Euan, 16 and Nicky, 15, and
daughter Kathryn, 12. The couple has worked with success to keep
them out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair informed her husband of her condition in September,
on the eve of a major party conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a moment to forget,'' Blair recalled a few weeks
later. ``I think I said you're joking' and she said 'No, I'm
not.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked, you know, the usual questions and I did get round to
saying that's wonderful, darling. But that was after a few
minutes.''

PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE GIVES BIRTH TO BABY BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair,
gave birth to a boy on Saturday, and hours later mother, father and
son left the London hospital for the privacy of 10 Downing St.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cherie and the baby are absolutely fine,'' Blair told
reporters outside the official residence. ``He's a gorgeous little
boy, and they are just resting now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth child for the Blairs and the first baby born to a
serving prime minister in 152 years, Leo Blair arrived at 12:25
a.m. weighing 6 pounds 12 ounces. He was named for Blair's
76-year-old father, whom the prime minister called at his home in
Shrewsbury, Shropshire, with the news shortly after returning to
Downing Street at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, 45, had a natural childbirth, and Blair said he
was present in the delivery room. ``It was quite a long labor,'' he
said. ``It went on for quite a few hours, but it is quite a
struggle in the end for Cherie, and I think she is very relieved
it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired but relaxed in an open neck blue button-down shirt
and carrying a mug of coffee, Blair, 47, said: ``I feel like any
father who sees their baby born. It's very moving really, and if
any of you have been through it, you'll know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby, he said, had been ``really good through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' he continued, ``you forget how tiny they are,
and also changing nappies in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added, ``It's quite an experience, but it's worse for
Cherie, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been tremendous interest in the arrival of a new
Blair, but the family delivered on its wish to keep the event as
private as possible. Except for the curbside news conference and
the flowers that kept arriving at the famous black front door with
the white 10 on it, the day was much like any other Saturday at the
Downing Street residence where the Blairs have made a point of
trying to produce as normal an upbringing as possible for their
family.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's other children, Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn,
12, have been kept out of the public spotlight, and judging by the
first day of his life, little Leo will also.
</P>
<P>
   A single bobby kept guard outside, and a construction team
worked noisily with spades, hammers and a pneumatic drill on a
leaking fire hydrant on the pavement opposite the brown brick
building housing the family apartment. Asked if he was worried he
might be waking the Blairs' newborn son, the drill operator, Chris
Southam, 28, said, ``I don't feel guilty because I have to work
seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first bouquets to arrive were ones from the queen and
Prince Philip and from the Conservative party leader, William
Hague, 39, who was obliged by repeated questions to say that yes,
he and his wife, Ffion, did intend to start a family as soon as
they could.
</P>
<P>
   With so few images to play, television news spent the day
interviewing astrologers, baby magazine editors, parental rights
advocates and bookmakers, who had made Leo a 2-to-1 shot as the
best bet for the name.
</P>
<P>
   Blair had gone to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital at noon
Friday. The prime minister followed in the evening, with an aide
carrying an overnight bag that was all the evidence the Saturday
morning newspapers needed to make the imminence of the new arrival
their page one headlines.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Saturday's Independent captured the mood. ``The
rumors started at lunchtime,'' it read. ``A 45-year-old woman had
gone into labor, and Fleet Street prepared to give birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The original announcement that Blair was pregnant came on Nov.
18 after word leaked to one of London's tabloid newspapers. Cherie
Blair had surprised her husband with the news in late September as
he worked in his office preparing the speech he was to deliver days
later to the annual Labor Party conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a moment to forget, but I do a little because I was
so shocked,'' Blair said in an interview published last Sunday in
The New York Times Magazine. ``Delighted, of course, but really
shocked. I think I said, `You must be joking,' and she said, `No,
I'm not.' I asked, you know, all the usual questions. And I think I
did get around to saying, `That's wonderful, darling.' But that was
after a few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, a prominent employment rights lawyer, continued
working almost up to the birth, her last court appearance last week
appropriately dealing with the issue of parents juggling career and
family. On Tuesday she argued a case for the Trade Unions Congress
that challenged the way Blair's government has introduced parental
leave benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, modeled on a European Union directive, gives
parents the right to take 13 weeks off during the first five years
of their child's life, but the Blair government has restricted the
benefit to parents of children born after Dec. 15, 1999. Cherie
Blair, who practices under her unmarried name, Cherie Booth, told
the justices that the limit unlawfully excluded 2.7 million people
who were already parents of children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   The whole matter of parental leave became an issue for the
Blairs when she noted in a speech to a legal group in London the
experience of the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, who
took a week away from the office to spend with his newborn daughter
in March. Cherie Blair pointedly encouraged the ``widespread
adoption'' of Lipponen's ``fine example.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention turned to Blair, who let his decision on how he would
react be known in the Times Magazine interview. ``I know what
people want me to say,'' he said, ``but the truth is if I went away
and stopped taking calls or having any conversations, it just
wouldn't be real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take more time off. I'll try to cut down on official
things. You've got to have some common sense about it _ you want to
spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up the job.''

CHINA REACTS MILDLY TO TAIWAN'S CHANGE OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Only two hours after Taiwan's new president
gave his inaugural address, authorities in Beijing released a
surprisingly temperate response, charging him with a lack of
sincerity but not repeating the dire threats and invective of
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In his first speech as president on Saturday, Chen Shui-bian
promised that unless the mainland attacked Taiwan, he would not
declare independence, change the country's official name of
``Republic of China,'' or take other overt steps to establish
Taiwan's formal independence.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Chen had called for just such acts in years past, it
was a measure of how far he has traveled to gain support among
Taiwan's nervous majority and to avoid provoking Beijing into a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen, whose Democratic Progressive Party still includes many
champions of independence, did not say Taiwan was a part of ``one
China,'' as Beijing has repeatedly demanded.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, Taiwan officials were studying China's
response even as inaugural parties continued, and did not issue a
statement. But independent experts were intrigued by the lack of
expected belligerence and a tantalizing reference to conditions for
possible negotiations over economic and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's response was more moderate and gentle than we
expected,'' said Yang Kai-huang, an expert on cross-strait
relations at Soochow University. ``I think that China prefers to
talk rather than go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   In a famous story in Chinese history, Yang said, you give your
enemy a soft response as a test. If he does not pay you back with
good will, then you have every justification to come back with
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe China is using this strategy,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual exchange is couched in the fine semantical
distinctions over phrases like ``one China'' and ``two states''
that have taken on huge weight in the debate over Taiwan's future,
but may appear to outsiders to be little more than wordplay.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing considers Taiwan to be a vital part of Chinese territory
that was separated during the civil war that ended in 1949, when
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan. Chen, in his newly
moderate stance that still leaves Beijing enraged, says Taiwan does
not need to declare independence, because in practice it is already
a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, ratcheting up the pressure, Beijing has said
that indefinite delay in progress toward reunifying Taiwan with the
motherland could be cause for war. It has lambasted Chen, who was
elected in March, for failing to adopt ``one China'' as a starting
point in future relations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, China says it can grant Taiwan exceptional
autonomy, greater than Hong Kong's, if it will only accept the
notion of unity.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Chen, in a speech that was mainly devoted to
domestic concerns and Taiwan's progress toward democracy, did not
discuss reunification, but rather the need to build ``conditions
for cooperation through good will.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, in an ambiguous statement that, given his
background, seemed to be half an olive branch, ``We believe that
the leaders on both sides possess enough wisdom and creativity to
jointly deal with the question of a future `one China.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, in an unusually quick response, predictably called Chen
``insincere'' on the central issue of unity. The statement, issued
by the Communist Party Central Committee and the government's
Taiwan Affairs Office, said, ``The new leader adopted an evasive
and ambiguous attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the new leader of the Taiwan authorities expressed that
he would not go in for `Taiwan independence,' he should have
attached no condition to it,'' said the statement, carried by the
New China News Agency. ``Still less should he have refuted the
reality that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of
China by saying that one China is something in the `future.'''
</P>
<P>
   But compared with recent threats, the statement seemed mild.
Even more intriguing was the discussion of specific conditions
under which negotiations between the mainland and Taiwan might
begin. Chen, during his campaign for the presidency, said he was
ready to talk about relaxing restrictions on direct transportation,
commerce and communications across the Taiwan Strait _ something
that Beijing has long sought.
</P>
<P>
   The statement Saturday said that the suspended negotiations
between a Chinese semigovernmental group, the Association for
Relations Across the Strait, and a Taiwanese counterpart could
begin again if the two sides ``will express in their own way orally
that both sides across the strait stick to the `one China'
principle,'' as China says the two sides did in 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Beijing and Taipei differ in their explanation of what exactly
was agreed to on the meaning of ``one China'' then, but in 1992
they were able to set the issue down long enough to hold meetings
and consider more practical issues.
</P>
<P>
   A second condition for new talks laid down by Beijing was that
``the Taiwan authorities make a clear-cut commitment that they will
not advocate the `two-states theory.'''
</P>
<P>
   This refers to the statement last year by outgoing President Lee
Teng-hui that Taiwan and China enjoyed a ``special state-to-state''
relationship, rather that one of a locality to the center. The
words caused a crisis and led China to end all negotiations with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's security officials have already said they do not intend
to use the offending phrase, but add that it merely described
reality. So depending on how much China wants to talk, this
condition could be declared met or not.
</P>
<P>
   It remains doubtful that Chen can agree, right now, even to an
oral statement that there is only ``one China,'' many experts
believe. Before he can make any bold moves on policy toward the
mainland, Chen needs to build more of a consensus in his party and
the society, said Bau Tzong-ho, a political scientist at National
Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
   So the more tempered statement from Beijing on Saturday may not
be a breakthrough, these experts said. But it may force Taiwan to
weigh anew how far it can bend its own ideal in order to keep China
talking rather than shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen's words on cross-strait issues Saturday were
designed to avoid provocation, the entire speech carried a subtext
that could not please leaders in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of his talk was not devoted to the confrontation
with the mainland but rather the state of Taiwan's hard-won
democracy, the need to root out corruption, economic and
environmental goals, and devotion to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The speech ended with Chen shouting: ``Long live freedom and
democracy! Long live the people of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, noted Andrew Yang, who heads a defense research
institute here, ``The speech carried heavy symbolism that Taiwan is
an independent country already.''

FORMER CRITICS OF TRADE BILL ARE SWAYING VOTE IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Neb., Colo.)   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the China trade bill slips through Congress this
week, as some supporters now expect, Rep. Sander M. Levin, D-Mich.,
who has voted against all of President Clinton's major trade
initiatives, will _ ironically _ take some credit for helping
provide the margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Levin won backing from House leaders late last week to amend the
bill granting China permanent trade ties to establish a human
rights and trade policy monitoring commission for China. Vote
counters on both sides of the aisle said the proposal, co-sponsored
by Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., has helped recruit perhaps two dozen
undecided lawmakers into the pro-trade camp.
</P>
<P>
   China has called the proposed commission an interference in its
internal affairs. The Republican leadership had been cool to the
idea. Clinton administration officials had kept their distance.
Labor unions and some human rights groups have called it weak.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin's proposal has proven crucial to Democrats, and a few
Republicans, who have found it politically impossible to vote for
trade deals in recent years because labor unions and consumer
groups oppose them so strongly. If critics call it a fig leaf,
supporters are hailing it as an innovative tool to keep political
pressure on China even while granting it long-sought guaranteed
trade access to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited to see what he would come up with before I decided,''
said Diana L. DeGette, D-Colo., who announced her support for the
Clinton administration's top remaining legislative priority after
Levin detailed the commission's structure on Friday. ``My
constituents care a great deal about human rights and want to see
something done on this front.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was modeled on the Helsinki Commission, which inspected
human rights conditions behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold
War. Levin envisions that Congress and the White House will appoint
high-level commissioners, including members of Congress and
distinguished outsiders, who could monitor conditions in China and
report to both branches.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the commission would issue a report recommending
legislative or administrative steps that might help raise pressure
on China to improve its human rights conditions, though it would
not have the power to enforce its recommendations. The commission
could study ways of turning up the heat on Beijing that are not
inconsistent with the World Trade Organization, including some
kinds of sanctions and U.S. policy toward loans from international
aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A second part of the Levin-Bereuter proposal enacts into law
provisions that would help the United States fight sudden surges of
imports from China. Both provisions won backing from the Republican
leadership last week, which agreed to include them as part of the
bill that would grant China permanent trade status. A vote in the
House is expected to take place Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levin represents a heavily unionized district of Michigan. With
unions increasingly wary of foreign trade deals that open markets
and threaten industrial jobs, Levin hasn't met many trade
agreements he likes. He voted against the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided late last year to find an alternative to a
straight vote on China's trade status. He said he wanted to
``reshape globalization'' so that trade deals would promote human
values, not just the free shipments of goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that trade and globalization can be forces for
good, and we can't stop them,'' Levin said. ``But we have to shape
them. In China's case, you can't just vote yes and trust that
social and economic changes will come along together.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and consumer groups have criticized the proposal as
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a well-meaning effort,'' said Thea Lee, a senior official
at the AFL-CIO and an outspoken opponent of the China trade bill.
``But it's redundant with what's already done and may even be
counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights groups are less dismissive, though many say
that the Levin commission could be much stronger if it had the
power to force a Congressional vote on its recommendations each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be stronger and we think that there's a chance it
will be stronger before this is finished,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk
of Human Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jendrzejczyk said the Helsinki Commission had real influence on
Soviet bloc nations, but that China, unlike the former Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, had not signed a treaty permitting review and
inspection of human rights.

 &HT;    HAITIANS VOTE SUNDAY AMID FEAR AND PESSIMISM
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    With Palm Beach Post photos, available on the server 
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Andiel Adlace(cq) sits on a small patch
of dusty, hot cement in the midst of this capitol city's teeming
agricultural market, trying to earn a little money selling ripe
coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   Her impoverished, faction-torn country will hold its first
elections in several years Sunday, but Adlace is more concerned
with putting food on her family's table than politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll vote for whoever gives me money,'' she tells a foreign
visitor. ``Give me $500 Haitian dollars (about $125 in U.S.
currency) and I'll bring 25 people to vote however you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Her offer draws laughs from her fellow vendors, but it sums up a
lot about this desperately poor country, which has languished in a
state of confusion and limbo for the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   International observers hope that Sunday's vote might somehow
help Haiti emerge from its chaos with a functioning government that
can begin to address the crippling problems of poverty, illiteracy,
disease and corruption that have beset this Caribbean nation for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But optimism _ like money and jobs _ is in short supply on the
dirty, crowded streets of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is not.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's people have learned the hard way that election season is
too often a killing season.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 15 people have been murdered in the past few months,
most of them members of groups opposed to the dominant Lavalas
Family Party of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are for local and legislative offices, and
Aristide isn't running, although he will likely run for another
term as president this fall. But the former Catholic priest's image
and influence towers over everything here.
</P>
<P>
   He swept into office 10 years ago as a visionary, populist
reformer, but was removed by a military coup, then re-installed by
a U.S. intervention in 1994. His term ended in 1996, but his
handpicked successor, Rene Preval, took over as president.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say Aristide still runs the country from
behind the scenes, and that over the past decade he has morphed
from a charismatic advocate of the people into a strongman
surrounded by corrupt, violent cronies. Haiti is little better off,
many say, than the days when its feared dictators, ``Papa Doc'' and
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, ran the country like a family fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my country but I am pessimistic,'' said John Max
Toussaint(cq), who earns a living ferrying people and goods around
the capitol in his truck. ``Haiti right now is a bad country, with
too many bad people. I don't think democracy will work in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials hope that won't be the case, but have been
alarmed by the rash of pre-election violence. A small delegation of
Congress members will be on hand to observe the elections, along
with a team from the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States views with deepest concern the climate of
insecurity that prevails in Haiti,'' State Department spokesman
James Rubin said last month. ``Acts of violence, threats and
political intimidation must end now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if violence and ballot irregularities don't mar the
elections, the winners will face daunting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has languished for decades as the poorest nation in the
hemisphere, with some 80 percent of its 8 million people illiterate
and dirt poor. Estimates on unemployment range as high as 65
percent, while those who do work subsist on an average income of
$200 to $500 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of impoverished people have set out for the United States
in rickety boats through the past decade, with dozens drowning at
sea and hundreds more stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has spiraled into near paralysis in recent years,
although a boom in the drug trade has seen new banks, gas stations
and mansions sprouting amidst the Port-au-Prince slums.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the capitol, the countryside is a contrast of stunning
views and human squalor. Only about the size of Maryland, Haiti's
mountainous terrain leaves villages only a few hundred miles from
the capitol nearly inaccessible. The once-lush mountains have been
stripped of trees for fuel, leaving eroded slopes and exhausted
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Politics here has always been a rough-and-tumble battle among
various factions of the military and the tiny, moneyed elite.
Aristide promised to be something different when he came to power
in 1990, a priest from the lower classes who spoke a fiery Creole,
the language of the poor. But the hopes of many have dimmed over
the past decade as Haiti lurched into another period of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The past 16 months have been one of the most unsettled stints in
the nation's long-troubled history. President Preval allowed the
Parliament to leave office in early 1999 when their terms ended,
and repeatedly postponed new elections. He and a small coterie of
followers have been running the country by decree, testing the
patience of international donors who have withheld about $500
million in aid because the country has no functioning legislature
to help distribute the money.
</P>
<P>
   Elections have been postponed three times since December, and
violence has grown more common as pressure to finally hold the vote
has mounted. Last month one of the nation's most prominent radio
personalities was murdered, followed by the machete killing of the
campaign director for the opposition Haitian Christian Democratic
Party. Just weeks ago, a mob set fire to the headquarters of
another opposition coalition called ``Common Ground,'' burning it
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The violence seems likely to intimidate some of Haiti's 4
million voters, many of whom are registered for the first time
thanks to a $12 million, U.S.-backed registration drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to vote,'' said Anna Chery, 27, who sells fried
bananas and chicken legs on a street corner. ``I'm afraid there's
going to be more trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are brave enough to visit the polls will face a
dizzying array of choices. Some 29,000 candidates will be running
for more than 7,000 offices, with more than 20 parties on the
ballot. With so many illiterate voters, the ballots have pictures
of the candidates, along with symbols for the parties _ icons such
as a clump of bananas, a stalk of corn, or a capped bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous symbol is a table, which represents Aristide's
Lavalas Family party and stands for giving all Haitians a seat at
the nation's table. In an unheard-of campaign innovation, a small
plane circled over Port-au-Prince's slums last week, towing a
banner urging voters to support ``the table.'' Another plane loosed
thousands of brightly-colored leaflets bearing Aristide's picture,
which fluttered to the ground and were snatched up by excited
children and curious adults.
</P>
<P>
   But few seem to hold much hope that voting will win them a seat
at any table, or put more food on the bare ones in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a registration card, but I'm not going to vote,'' said
Evelyne Duverge(cq), who sells dried beans in the market. ``Hungry
people can't vote.''

   DETROIT _ When he was a boy growing up in west-central Mexico,
Jesus Lopez and his brothers would load agave leaves onto the backs
of donkeys and haul them to factories to be converted into tequila.
Along the way, he would dream of living in a place with electricity
and abundant water.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream never included Detroit. Lopez had not even heard
of it until the day that his brothers and many in Jesus Maria, his
hometown, packed their bags and headed to Motor City. When an
18-year-old Jesus Lopez arrived here, he said, he was convinced
that those who had come before him were crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, over here there was only burned-out houses,''
he recalled. ``Who would want to live here? It was not good.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, 18 years later, the view is much different in
southwest Detroit, where many of this city's immigrants from Mexico
live. So much has changed that it is being hailed as the nation's
new Mexican boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   Scorched shells of houses are being bought and resurrected by
scores of skilled Mexican tradesmen. They have snapped up dozens of
the old Victorians and duplexes for as little as $20,000, and they
have nearly doubled the population to 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Their impact is undeniable. The three local Roman Catholic
parishes have each added two weekend Masses in Spanish to
accommodate new arrivals, who started showing up six years ago,
most directly from Mexico. They say they came to escape rising
costs and growing hostilities against immigrants in Arizona,
California and Chicago, and to reunite with older relatives who had
been cashing in on Detroit's labor shortage for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   West Vernor Avenue, the main strip here, is lined with evidence:
Mexican bakeries, paleta (Popsicle) shops, taquerias, tortilla
factories, Mexican grocery stores. Since 1994, about 35 businesses
have opened and dozens have expanded, business groups said. An $8
million mercado and welcome center will be built next year. Amid
the abundance of Spanish signs, it is easy to overlook the golden
arches of McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody over here saw the opportunity we did,'' said Lopez, who
left a 10-year construction career five months ago to open his own
taqueria. ``Where we come from, you work all your life to have a
house, a business, and you still don't get nowhere. That's why we
work hard to make this good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Donald Hanchon of Most Holy Redeemer Catholic Church
said: ``These are people who are determined to be an asset. You see
it in the churches, where they're helping with children and
services. They genuinely want to make this a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanchon said he believed that the renovation of run-down houses
here was forcing drug dealers to find new dens.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the families settling here come from villages in
Jalisco, the Mexican state renowned for producing tequila, mariachi
music and rancheros, Mexican cowboys. More than 40,000 of the
people who live in southwest Detroit are either from Jalisco or
have relatives there, said Maria Elena Rodriguez, who is a Detroit
native and president of the Mexicantown Community Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the businesses are named to honor Jalisco and its towns,
like Arandas, Jesus Maria and San Ignacio. The connection is so
strong that caravans of adults and children load up their cars each
January and return to the towns to celebrate las fiestas
patronales, a 10-day festival held in honor of patron saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go back, so they know we are proud to be from Mexico, from
Jalisco,'' said Guadalupe Guzman, 70, who moved here to work in the
steel factories in 1950. He and his family return to Jesus Maria
every year.
</P>
<P>
   It took two decades for 32-year-old Jose Zamudio to believe the
stories that his brothers and sisters told about the untapped
opportunities in Detroit. Even after five of them came here from
San Ignacio, bought homes and found jobs, Zamudio refused to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too ugly,'' he said. Zamudio and his wife, Anna, chose
instead to go to Oakland, Calif. But after four years of working
for $10 an hour and living in cramped apartments, they gave up and
moved back to Mexico. They built a home and had three children.
</P>
<P>
   Then two years ago, when the whole family had obtained visas,
they decided to give the United States another try, in Chicago this
time. They stayed three months. The pressure of having five people
in a $600-a-month one-room apartment was too much. Now they are
gambling on Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, their gamble has paid off. Zamudio is earning $18 an
hour as a bricklayer for a construction company. Six months ago, he
and his wife bought a three-bedroom duplex for $40,000. But what
thrills Zamudio most is seeing how much his family _ five brothers
and sisters and 19 nieces and nephews _ and others from back home
have done to help rebuild southwest Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it, it's like little Jalisco,'' he said. ``We never
knew people of our towns building this kind of business. They show
if you fight and fight, you reach your dreams.''

SWISS POLICY ON CITIZENSHIP STIRS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ When Alija Huskic and his wife, Suzana, left Bosnia in
1991, just before war erupted there, they chose Switzerland for
refuge because of its reputation for good works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anyone there, but we knew that Geneva was the
symbol of the humanitarian tradition,'' Huskic said. After moving
to the city that is the base for the International Red Cross,
Huskic, now 41, who had trained as a mechanical engineer, began
work as a caretaker for two estates. His wife found a job as a
nursery school teacher. Their daughter, Nina, went to school. They
mastered French, and slipped easily into Swiss society.
</P>
<P>
   In three more years, they will be eligible to apply for Swiss
passports.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed until March, when 48 naturalization applications
in a blue-collar suburb of the Swiss city of Lucerne were defeated
in a popular vote. All those turned down were Turks or people from
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection has stirred debate across Switzerland, beginning
in Emmen _ the Lucerne suburb _ which in April halted review of its
250 pending naturalization requests amid charges that its vote on
the issue amounted to racist selection.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced that it would study simplifying the
process of becoming a citizen, and revived proposals to allow the
children of foreigners born in Switzerland to get passports more
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Europe warned that the country's system left
``room for discriminatory practice,'' a finding that made the Swiss
bristle, particularly after the international criticism of their
actions in World War II, which included turning away Jewish
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss law gives foreigners who meet the residency requirements
and have no criminal record the right to apply for Swiss
nationality as long as they are integrated into Swiss society. What
the Emmen vote made clear is that foreigners must virtually become
more Swiss than the Swiss to stand a chance of holding a passport.
</P>
<P>
   As part of what some media have dubbed the ``fondue test,''
local officials usually stop by the applicant's house to check on
the way the family lives, the level of cleanliness and neatness,
and, some say, even what they eat. ``Whether our house is clean or
not does not indicate whether we are fit to be citizens,'' said
Huskic, who nonetheless notes that the future of his 17-year-old
daughter Nina lies in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Diltz, a member of the Emmen legislative body, sees no
problem with asking that foreigners be assimilated. ``If they want
to be Swiss, it's not enough if they just try to speak the
language. They must do more,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, suspicion of foreigners has been
aggravated by the record number of people from the Balkans who have
flooded into Switzerland. Federal policy bars such asylum seekers,
who are viewed as transients, from working.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment has been fueled by perceptions that many foreigners
engage in crime, particularly drug trafficking. Overall, one in
five are non-Swiss in the country of 7.2 million, which has one of
Europe's highest percentages of foreigners.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This explosive mix has been percolating for several years, as in
other European countries, including neighboring Austria, and it led
last fall to soaring support for the nationalist Swiss People's
Party, which campaigned on the slogan ``Stop Asylum Abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Emmen vote, several villages elsewhere in Switzerland
have rejected applicants for citizenship, most of them also from
the Balkans. These decisions _ part of the enshrined Swiss idea
that the people decide _ have rarely been contested in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, a court struck down the refusal by the town of
Pratteln in northwestern Switzerland to give citizenship to five
Turks, while accepting Italians and Spaniards, on grounds that it
violated the constitution's ban on discrimination. The town is
considering an appeal to Switzerland's top tribunal, which would
set the stage for a landmark ruling defining once and for all what
is required to be a Swiss citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss human rights groups, meanwhile, have banded together to
push for laws giving asylum seekers full social and economic
rights, and to get the employment ban on them repealed.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, officials even offered citizenship to the 48 people
rejected by Emmen, an impractical offer since they live in a
different city and speak German rather than French.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we require everyone to be assimilated, we are creating a
country where everyone has the same ideas about our problems,''
said Jean-Marc Froidevaux, one of the Geneva politicians who made
the offer. ``This is not going to help Switzerland get ahead.''

COMMENTARY: WORKERS VS. WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1920s, South Africa's Communist Party campaigned under
the slogan ``Workers of the world unite for a white South Africa!''
This wasn't quite as incongruous as it sounds: the political
movement that eventually imposed apartheid had strong populist,
even socialist roots. It was sincerely concerned with improving the
economic status of the Afrikaner worker, and protecting him from
the depredations of international capital. Unfortunately, the
movement improved the lot of white labor mainly by preventing
capitalists from offering industrial jobs to nonwhites, whose
intense poverty made them willing to work for less.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. labor movement is not as brutally direct in its
slogans. Probably its leaders don't even admit to themselves that
their increasingly vociferous opposition to imports is, in effect,
an effort to improve the condition of American workers by denying
opportunity to workers in the rest of the world. But when the
Teamsters' president, James P. Hoffa, declares, as he did in a New
York Times op-ed article not long ago, that ``American workers
should not be asked to compete with foreigners who are not paid a
living wage,'' the implications are clear. Given the low
productivity of workers in Third World countries, their nations'
lack of infrastructure and general lag in development, to insist
that such workers be paid what Americans would regard as a living
wage is to insist that they price themselves out of their jobs. And
that is no accident: any policy that didn't price those workers out
of the market would offer no relief to workers here.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sort of tragic inevitability about the way labor has
reached this moral impasse. The U.S. labor movement has every right
to feel that American workers have gotten a raw deal. By standard
measures, the real take-home pay of blue-collar workers is lower
now than it was a quarter-century ago. You can quibble with the
statistics, but without question blue-collar workers have been
largely left behind by the nation's economic growth. And far from
fighting this inequality in rewards, policy has in general
reinforced it: taxes have become less rather than more progressive,
public schools for those who can't afford to live in the right
places have gotten worse, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   A well-meaning economist can give you a list of things that
might help America's working class: some form of national health
insurance, bigger and better wage supplements along the lines of
the earned-income tax credit, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were a labor leader, I would sneer at my professorial
naivete. You know and I know that such proposals are pipe dreams,
that in America today the left, such as it is, has its hands full
holding back efforts to tilt the tax-and-benefit system even more
toward the interests of the affluent. And the labor movement _
whose influence is far less today than it was even 20 years ago _
is in no position to reverse the political tide.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a labor leader to do? Choose a fight that he might be
able to win: a fight to limit imports that compete with the workers
he represents. Voters might not see protection as a direct threat
to their pocketbooks (though it is). The payoff may be limited _
the arithmetic suggests that even a total ban on manufactured
imports from Third World countries would raise blue-collar wages no
more than 3 or 4 percent _ but who's counting? And if the target is
unattractive enough _ if it is, say, a nasty regime in China _
labor's limited but not negligible lobbying power just might pull
off a victory.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's understandable that labor has decided that
it must try to help American workers by denying opportunity to even
needier workers abroad _ while, of course, denying that it is doing
any such thing. If I were a labor leader I would probably be a
protectionist too. But to understand this political strategy, even
to accept its inevitability, is not to approve.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would like easy moral certainties _ which means all of
us _ wish that it were simpler, that corporate greed were the only
enemy, that people like Hoffa were standing up for the rights of
workers everywhere. It's hard for liberals to admit that the U.S.
labor movement, with its noble tradition, is now working against
the interests of most of the world's poor. But it is.

COMMENTARY: NO GRAND ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Each day brings an exciting new chapter, as
unexpected relationships develop and personal dramas unfold before
our cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   That quote is not from a reporter covering the roiling New York
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   That quote is from Mark Burnett, the producer of ``Survivor,''
CBS's new summer ``reality-adventure series,'' which maroons eight
men and eight women on the tiny island of Pulau Tiga, off the coast
of Borneo, for a video version of ``Lord of the Flies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each show, a tribal council votes to expel one of
the ``courageous thrill-seekers,'' as CBS calls them, from the
island _ presumably a guy who lets his alpha side run amok or a
girl who doesn't look fetching in a coconut-shell bra. The last one
left wins $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In CBS's ``Big Brother,'' 10 strangers are isolated in a house
full of cameras. Viewers decide which one to kick out each week.
The last one gets half a mil.
</P>
<P>
   The two shows spring from America's obsessions with reality,
personality and money. We are a nation of voyeurs, addicted to
lurid real-life dramas. On TV, producers heighten the reality,
adding physical obstacles or psychological pressures. In politics,
the reality's been sizzling on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable aspect of the remarkable Giuliani saga was
that he dropped out of the race to concentrate on his health, not
because of his brazen personal behavior. The polls reflected no
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The commentators who huffed last week that the mayor had lost
the moral authority to run for the Senate missed the point. People
can live with public officials who are not moral exemplars. They
now rate pols the same way they'll rate ``Survivor'' contestants:
Who maneuvers skillfully in a tough situation? Who gets stuff done?
Who entertains us?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, people did not want reality. They wanted
perfection, and they preferred having the flaws and blemishes of
their leaders concealed.
</P>
<P>
   They preferred the ideal Franklin Roosevelt to the real Franklin
Roosevelt, confined in his wheelchair. They preferred the ideal
Jack and Jackie to the real Jack and Jackie, who did not exactly
inhabit Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy Sr. was the master at bringing Hollywood illusion to
the White House, air-brushing out Jack's sexcapades and health
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years later, Bill Clinton reversed the Kennedy formula,
exchanging glamorous illusion for mesmerizing reality. He revealed
the decidedly mottled nature of the people who work and play in the
White House, providing the American public with another adventure
in voyeurism.
</P>
<P>
   We tuned in for a daily fix of ``White House Survivor.'' Would
Hillary brain Bill? Would Monica betray Bill? Would Bill outrun
Ken? Would the nasty Republicans do themselves in?
</P>
<P>
   No one could foresee that the public would enjoy watching Bill
run his obstacle course so much that it would overlook the moral
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbfounded politicos declared Bill Clinton an anomaly _ but lo
and behold, here is another anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani has just staged a breathtaking reality drama of
his own. He, too, has laid himself bare, humbly observing, ``You
realize you are not a superman and you are just a human being.''
Again the public preferred enjoying the show to judging it.
</P>
<P>
   We all tune in for our daily fix of ``City Hall Survivor.'' Will
Rudy beat cancer? Will Donna avenge herself on Rudy? Will Rudy
marry Judi? How long before we sour on the mayor's new sweetness?
Can Rudy pass donors on to little Ricky?
</P>
<P>
   It's not that we don't want moral character in our leaders. We'd
love it. But the great maw of entertainment has worn us down. We'll
settle for the good policies of flawed people. Anyway, we now know
about Sally Hemings, etc. The profession of politics does not
attract saints.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, we have become a biographical culture. We are
riveted by the soap operas of public lives. We admire the famous
most for what makes them infamous: it reassures us that they are no
better and no happier than all the people with their noses pressed
hard against the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Misery loves celebrated company.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge that now confronts America is the dispiriting
prospect of a presidential campaign between two candidates who seem
to have no heartrending secrets to hide and reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Reality without reality drama. How can we stand it?

MBEKI VISIT PUTS AIDS ACTIVIST IN QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa said last year that
AZT was too dangerous to give to HIV-infected pregnant women, AIDS
researchers and activists were taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is commonly used to prevent transmission of the disease
to newborns, and many in the AIDS community said thousands of lives
would be lost in a country where the epidemic is burning at white
heat.
</P>
<P>
   That reaction turned to shock when Mbeki appointed an AIDS
advisory panel that included researchers who have postulated that
HIV does not cause the disease, a position long rejected by the
majority of doctors and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mbeki is embarking on his first state visit to the United
States since succeeding Nelson Mandela as president last year, and
activists and those who treat AIDS are wondering how to greet him.
Most seem to have decided that the best offense is to give no
offense, an approach that they say is being counseled by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suggestion has been not to press him hard,'' said Martin
Delaney, founding director of San Francisco-based Project Inform, a
treatment information and advocacy group. ``The fear here is that
he'll dig in worse if he gets pressured.''
</P>
<P>
   Some activists are preparing a statement to be signed by
prominent scientists reaffirming their view that HIV, or human
immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS. Others are planning to try to
speak to Mbeki when he appears in San Francisco on Wednesday, two
days after meeting President Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all struggling with how best to make a difference,''
said Jane Silver, vice president for public policy at the American
Foundation for AIDS Research in Washington. ``Finally the world is
focusing on AIDS in Africa. Part of the challenge is making sure it
is not sidetracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no simple answers to what to do about the president
coming here, how to respond to the challenges he's created,''
Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are hoping the U.S. government will arrange a
meeting with prominent American researchers to put Mbeki on what
they consider the right path, although administration officials say
they have no such plans.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks ago, several scientists wrote to Sandra L.
Thurman, the White House director of national AIDS policy, to
express concern about South African government contacts with the
dissident scientists, who are led by Peter Duesberg and David
Rasnick, both professors in California.
</P>
<P>
   For advocates and scientists, the stakes are excruciatingly high
in a country where nearly one out of 10 people are infected with
HIV. They say that by reopening the debate on HIV and AIDS, Mbeki
is hampering efforts to control the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The effects could go further, Delaney and others argue. If the
message seeps in that AIDS does not spread by a transmittable
virus, people may ignore admonitions to make sex safe.
</P>
<P>
   And given Mbeki's stature in Africa and among blacks elsewhere,
any comfort that he gives to the HIV ``denialists'' will feed the
fires of those who claim AIDS is a conspiracy by the West aimed at
Third World people, Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's 33-member AIDS panel met on May 6. According to an
activist who attended the meeting, David Scondras of Boston, the
dissidents voiced their view that HIV does not cause AIDS. They
said screening blood supplies was a waste of money and accused the
moderator of bias. Scondras said South African officials who were
present were taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki addressed the scientists, and appeared to distance himself
from the dissidents. He said he knew that HIV caused AIDS, but
wanted to explore why a certain subgroup of the virus is more
prevalent in Africa than in the West, and whether poverty and
malnutrition are likely causes. Those factors, along with drug use,
anti-AIDS drugs themselves and parasites, are often cited by the
dissidents as causes.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki adopted a different tone in a letter to Clinton and other
world leaders last month, accusing those condemning his approach of
waging a ``campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many activists praise Mbeki for striving to understand AIDS in
an African context, where female-to-male transmission is much more
common than in the West. And few question his commitment to
fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done here is akin to if President Clinton decided
that he's going to determine the orbital trajectory of the next
space mission,'' Delaney said. ``It's an intrusion of a leader into
an area that's not his expertise.''

   WARSAW, Poland _ In Poland, long a trophy of East-West
competition and now one of NATO's newest members, the installation
of Vladimir Putin as Russia's president has raised new questions
about Moscow's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has signaled a desire to improve relations between the
former Warsaw Pact allies, making telephone calls to the Polish
president and showing new openness about the killing of Polish
officers during World War II by the Soviets at Katyn, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures mark a welcome symbolic change from recent public
feuds over Russian spying in Poland and Polish popular support for
the Chechens, which caused Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to
cancel a visit here in February.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the signals from Putin, senior Polish officials say a
serious exchange of official visits is unlikely before autumn, and
other influential officials, like Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's
chief foreign policy adviser, Jerzy Marek Nowakowski, see more
difficult times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   They say that Putin is likely to increase diplomatic and
economic pressure on Ukraine to draw closer to Moscow, putting
Poland, which favors a sovereign Ukraine's orientation toward the
West, in a more awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   They say they also expect Putin, who is trying to show a
stronger Russian face abroad and extend Russian influence, to try
to block any further expansion of NATO membership, especially to
any Baltic nation, something Warsaw also supports. Poland is
especially eager to have its neighbors Lithuania and Slovakia in
NATO, Geremek said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Polish analysts say that a new government is likely to
take a softer line toward Moscow in any case, meaning that Putin
has little incentive to put real substance behind his effort at
better ties.
</P>
<P>
   Marek Matraszek, Warsaw director of CEC Government Relations, a
political consulting firm, noted that the leftist party's leaders,
including President Aleksander Kwasniewski, have spoken about a
reconciliation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Matraszek said that a new government would be less likely to
push a new round of NATO expansion that would include any Baltic
states _ still a red line for Moscow, which in Soviet times ruled
the three Baltic nations for 50 years, and still feels proprietary
about the many ethnic Russians living there.
</P>
<P>
   Geremek emphasized that the first year of Poland's membership in
NATO had proved ``a force for stability in Europe,'' answering
those who thought NATO expansion would destroy the West's relations
with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is trying to press the idea that NATO expansion is
creating problems, not solving them,'' Geremek said. ``But it's not
true. NATO expansion has stabilized the region. And our support for
postcommunist integration should not destroy the policy of good
neighborly relations.'' Given trade, markets and energy interests,
he said, both countries ``have the basis for a more normal
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to a senior aide to point out that NATO's bombing of
Yugoslavia over Kosovo _ which started less than a month after the
Poles, Czechs and Hungarians joined NATO last spring _ did more to
upset Moscow than NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow-Warsaw disputes earlier this year had more to do with
Russian domestic politics than any Polish policy, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin maneuvered for the presidency, Moscow found it useful
to ``play the Polish card'' in response to NATO and prospective
European Union enlargement, officials said, touching the ever-ready
anti-Russian nerve here.
</P>
<P>
   Poland was the one new NATO member that wanted to celebrate its
first anniversary of membership and remains fundamentally
pro-American and pro-NATO. In the Czech Republic and Hungary, by
contrast, the war in Kosovo _ coming so soon after their entry into
the alliance _ underscored deep doubts about NATO among significant
minorities of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Grzegorz Kostrzewa-Zorbas, a former government official and a
scholar of international relations at the Polish Academy of
Sciences, sees Russian policy toward Poland driven almost entirely
by the domestic Russian debate over the loss of national pride and
status. Kosovo was a pretext, not a central factor, he says. ``The
Russians regard us as Slavic traitors and puppets of the West,'' he
said. ``That still resonates.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The relationship, given the swings of history, has been
traumatic for both sides. Poland occupied the Kremlin in the 17th
century and defeated the Red Army in 1920, while doing much to
destroy Moscow's sway over Eastern Europe. Poles, who like to think
of their country as the European cultural center that brought forth
Chopin and a strong Catholic Church, remember the occupation by
Russia and then the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Poland expelled nine Russian diplomats accused of
spying, many of them caught on videotape, officials say, picking up
or leaving material at hidden drops. The Russians responded by
expelling nine Polish diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Then in February a demonstration in Poznan against Russian
actions in Chechnya turned ugly when protesters broke into the
Russian Consulate and tore up the Russian flag. The police watched,
but did nothing. The Polish government apologized and dismissed
some policemen, but Ivanov canceled his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Polish officials say that Putin now seems to understand that
public disputes with Poland can be counterproductive, especially
given that Poland remains Moscow's seventh-largest trading partner.
At least 100,000 Russians, Belarussians and Ukrainians live and
work here. At the same time, officials say, some senior
representatives of Russian organized crime have traveled to Poland
on diplomatic passports.
</P>
<P>
   Nowakowski, a Russian expert, says that timing is important.
Putin became president after Poland entered NATO, so he can start
afresh to create ``a more realistic partnership.'' Putin is also
considering attending a ceremony in July when Poland opens a
military cemetery for the dead of Katyn, officials say, which would
be a gesture highly prized here.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Nowakowski said, Russia is trying to play
Polish politics now, paying more attention to President Kwasniewski
and the former communists than to the government, and trying to win
support for a second natural-gas pipeline through Poland to Western
Europe that would bypass Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   For Nowakowski, ``the future of the states between Russia and
Poland'' _ Ukraine, Belarus and the Baltic nations _ ``is the most
important question for Russian-Polish relations.'' And he sees
potential trouble ahead, especially over Ukraine, where Russia
could use economic levers and even military pressure to keep Kiev
in line.

ARMED GANGS SABOTAGING UNEASY PEACE IN INDONESIA  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JANTHOE BARU, Indonesia _ If an era of peace is dawning in
restive Aceh Province, no one seems to have told the villagers of
Janthoe Baru.
</P>
<P>
   Since armed men descended from the nearby mountains on the night
of May 7 and looted and razed 21 houses, around 1,500 terrified
people have been sleeping every night at the village mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The destitute villagers, as well as officials in the nearby
provincial capital, Banda Aceh, are either unsure about the
identity of the armed men, who are blamed for a series of killings,
looting and arson, or are afraid or unwilling to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has conceded that rogue soldiers
from the Indonesian Defense Forces might be involved in the
attacks. But local police and military officials in Aceh say an
unidentified ``third force'' of hired thugs, bandits, or even
disgruntled independence fighters from the Free Aceh Movement is to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists in Aceh, a staunchly Muslim region on the northern
tip of Sumatra, have been fighting for independence since 1976 and
pose a major problem for Wahid as he tries to stabilize his nation
of 210 million people. Many people say that it is of far greater
urgency for Indonesia to stop Aceh from slipping away than it was
in the case of East Timor, which voted for independence last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Aceh, they say, the nation's sovereignty, stability and
economic future are at stake. Aceh accounts for 13 percent of
Indonesia's oil production and the shipping lanes through the
Strait of Malacca between Aceh and Malaysia, are among the busiest
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Army generals in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, have made it
clear that they will not allow Aceh to gain independence, a move
that experts have warned could set off a violent ``Balkans-style''
breakup of Indonesia and threaten regional security in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen the breakup of Europe,'' said Abdullah Ali, a
leading political analyst and university professor in Banda Aceh.
``Who knows? We should keep our fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   People across this province of 4 million are leaving nothing to
chance. Mosques in Banda Aceh and other provincial centers have
been packed daily with worshipers praying for the success of an
agreement between the Indonesian government and the separatist
guerrillas that was signed on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, signed in Geneva, is seen as a first step to
ending fighting that has killed as many as 5,000 people since 1989.
The pact calls for a ``humanitarian pause'' in hostilities
beginning in June and the establishment of two independent
commissions to monitor the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But major issues have yet to be worked out, including autonomy
for the province, disarming the rebels, and removing non-Acehenese
military units. For their part, the rebels have refused to drop
their 24-year-old demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman here, Col. Safri Deangmapuji, said
provocateurs had stepped up attacks to undermine trust between the
Indonesian military and rebels. He blamed them for a grenade attack
on a police traffic post last Sunday, two days after the peace
agreement was signed. The authorities also suspect that the
unidentified armed group lobbed a grenade at a police truck the
next day, wounding three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for the police,'' Deangmapuji said. ``We're
trying to respect this agreement, but on the other hand you have
this group running around trying to disrupt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims and witnesses said the attackers wore civilian clothes
and sandals during some raids and military uniforms during others.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid initially said the provocateurs were rebels dressed in
military uniforms, but at a recent news conference he said he had
been told that ``some are rogue elements belonging to'' the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The military has logging and other business interests in Aceh,
and does not want the province to break away as East Timor did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the central government tries to negotiate with the Free
Aceh Movement, the military does not seem to agree that the
government should sign an agreement,'' said Saifuddin Bantasyam,
executive director of the Care Human Rights Forum in Banda Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if there's something happening in Aceh, then the military
can say there is no reason to sit down with the Free Aceh
Movement,'' he said, adding that his organization had no evidence
to implicate either the military or the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bantasyam conceded that very few people had blamed
rebels for attacks on civilians, while the military has an
extensive record of human rights abuses against the Acehenese,
including killings, kidnappings and torture.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island came roaring into the
race for senator from New York on Saturday, attacking Hillary
Rodham Clinton as a ``far-left, extremist'' candidate who has ``no
real rationale for serving here other than as a steppingstone to
some other position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her ambition is the issue,'' Lazio declared in an
interview, as he formally announced his candidacy in a race that
has been upended by the decision of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to step
aside for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's remarks came as Republican leaders in New York and
Washington lined up behind the candidacy of the Suffolk County
Republican, who had himself suspended his campaign last year in
deference to party leaders who wanted Giuliani as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio announced a two-day trip around the state, an aggressive
come-out-of-the-box approach intended to discourage any other
Republicans who might be thinking about challenging him, as well as
to push the Conservative Party into falling behind his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of Lazio's comments _ he repeatedly criticized
Clinton's credentials and ideology _ suggested that the campaign,
with the change in candidate, was going to be harsh and fast-paced.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers have already begun to attack Lazio as extreme
and conservative, noting that he had supported many of the
initiatives of the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they
tried to discredit his candidacy before he had a chance to find his
groundings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, responded to Lazio's
comments Saturday morning by saying: ``It sounds like the same old
negative attack politics. He hasn't even formally announced, and
already he's on the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he considered himself ``a centrist, a mainstream
Republican.'' ``We're conservative, right-of-center on budget and
tax issues, national security issues,'' he said. ``And I think
we're realistic on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his Democratic opponent as ``far left,'' adding:
``She's part of the discredited philosophy that helped lead New
York to ruin during the Cuomo years. I think we've turned the
corner and we don't want to go back to those failed days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lazio jumped at almost every opportunity to
criticize Clinton. He responded vigorously when asked if he would
make an issue out of the fact that Clinton did not live in New York
before this year, a subject that Giuliani frequently raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real thing,'' he said. ``I don't have to try to be
someone else. I was born here. I went to school here. I fished in
these waters. I clammed in its bays. I graduated from our schools.
My children were born in New York state. I've lived here my whole
life. There will be no question of my commitment to this state.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, Clinton was hurt both by the fact that she
had never lived in the state where she wants to serve, and because
of the cloistered life she lived as a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know New York if you have bodyguards around you all
the time,'' he said. ``You've got to know what it's like to ride
the subways, to drive your own car, to buy your own gas, to buy
groceries here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people can see through who Hillary Clinton is, and
they will have a chance to know Rick Lazio as the real deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio's announcement on Long Island came as his campaign sprang
almost overnight into full life. Workers at his headquarters in
Suffolk County answered the phone ``Lazio 2000,'' early Saturday,
and Lazio's Web site urged voters to contribute money, addressing
what his aides acknowledged on Saturday was one of the more vexing
problems he faced in his contest against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Newly hired staff members flew up from Washington, with a
notable representation from the presidential campaign of Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee. That is because
Lazio's media adviser, Michael Murphy, performed the same role for
Alexander in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lazio campaign staff struggled through a chaotic
morning, as they grappled with such questions as which town Lazio's
headquarters was located in (Bay Shore) and the area code (631),
from an onslaught of news media that abandoned Giuliani at City
Hall for Lazio's headquarters on Long Island with startling speed.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers and state Republican leaders, concerned that
Giuliani's prolonged exit had dealt Clinton a strong early
advantage, moved to tap down even the most remote prospect that
Lazio would face any competition for the party's nomination.
``There is no question Lazio will be the candidate,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Across New York state, Republican leaders fell in line with Gov.
George Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers,
and proclaimed not only their support for Lazio but also their
belief that he would prove to be a formidable opponent to Clinton,
despite the obvious obstacles he faces now. (Some Republicans went
so far as to privately suggest that he was a better candidate than
Giuliani would have been.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The race at the end of the day is going to be about who best
can serve New York, and based on his record in Congress, it's
clearly going to be him,'' said Zenia Mucha, the chief political
aide to Pataki. She said that Lazio ``understands what it means to
be a New Yorker. She's in the process of learning. His basic
philosophy is a smaller role of government for the people. Her
basic philosophy is that government has all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of Long Island, bowing to this reality, withdrew
from seeking the Republican nomination. He said Saturday morning
that he did not want to cause any division within the Republican
party, and mentioned Pataki's enthusiastic endorsement of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's circles on Saturday, the debate was not over
whether the candidate should attack Lazio, but when. Unlike
Giuliani, Lazio is barely known to most New Yorkers, so the
immediate struggle is a race to see which side succeeds in defining
Lazio first _ both in remarks on the campaign trail and in
television advertisements _ over the next few weeks. All of this
suggests that this campaign will, in fact, be harsher and more
pointed than the Clinton-Giuliani race ever had a chance to become.
</P>
<P>
   There was definite worry in Republican circles that Lazio would
have been a stronger candidate had he had an earlier start, which
would have allowed him more time to raise money, get the experience
he needs to run a race, and become better known to New Yorkers.
Republicans, though, emphasized repeatedly that Lazio would be a
strong candidate, because he appeared to have a hunger for the job
that Giuliani never evinced, and also because Lazio was more in
tune with Republican positions on issues.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The low-pressure system that has brought repeated rains to the
Middle Atlantic states over the past few days will remain nearly
stationary Sunday, bringing yet another bout of showers and
thunderstorms. In the Carolinas, some strong thunderstorms will
develop with large hail and damaging winds a possibility. Farther
to the north, continued onshore breezes will yield another cloudy,
damp and cool day along the Northeast coast.
</P>
<P>
   Showers will develop in the lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday,
as a pocket of cool air above 5,000 feet passes over warm, moist
air. Some of the showers will produce very heavy rainfall in brief
periods of time. Meanwhile, showers will also develop in the
western Great Lakes as warm air is forced to rise up and over
cooler air.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing onshore winds in the Pacific Northwest will produce
showers, clouds and patches of fog. The deserts of the Southwest
will remain very hot.  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A deluge struck Grand Rapids and Lansing, Mich., on Thursday as
nearly 3 1/3 inches of rain fell on both cities. This is now the
second wettest May on record in Grand Rapids with more than 7
inches of rain so far. The extraordinary wetness resulted from a
line of intense thunderstorms moving across the same area. Like a
log in a stream aligned with the current, these rainmakers followed
a course over the same region for several hours, producing record
rainfall.

WASHINGTON MAYOR GETS THINGS DONE QUIETLY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If all continues to go well, the nation's capital
will be allowed out of the intensive care ward fashioned by
Congress sometime next year. The District of Columbia will not only
regain home-rule prerogatives lost in its profligate past; it will
also confirm the stewardship of Mayor Anthony Williams, an unlikely
politician as bland in his style as the paint on the municipal
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sea change from four years ago,'' the mayor said,
his zest characteristically masked as he pursued a budget fight
with the district council and tackled a school crisis. He hailed
these problems as a healthy sign of the revival of local
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are debating not whether we're going to spend the city
into the ground or not,'' Williams said. ``The new question is how
much we're going to invest in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   This city-state by the Potomac, the perennial ward that Congress
seems delighted to scold and micromanage, is clearly moving to a
higher ground of civic morale. Constituents' confidence about the
city's direction has more than doubled in the less than two years
of the Williams administration, with seven in 10 residents feeling
positive about the city's course, according to polls of the
district's often demoralized public.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, some of the watchdogs of Capitol Hill are
snapping less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Williams is making real progress in turning around
Washington,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who heads
the District of Columbia subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Williams arrived here in 1995 as a grim technocrat and emergency
budget cutter when Congress created a board of financial overseers
to halt the capital's spiral of deficits and mismanagement and
hired him as chief financial officer. From that narrow opportunity,
he molted into a competitive politician and became the people's
choice in a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 16 months as mayor, Williams, 48, has labored to replace
the city's wastrel image of the flamboyant Marion Barry era with
his own devotion to quiet executive techniques. In a way, the best
measure of Williams' initial success may be the fact that he is
sometimes criticized for lacking the populist flash of Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suffers from terminal caution,'' complained Mark Plotkin, a
relentless civic goad and the political commentator for the local
public radio station WAMU. Plotkin made the mayor sound like Calvin
Coolidge, complimenting him for installing ``rectitude and calm''
but faulting him for failing to fully tap the energy of his
electoral mandate and ``take us to another plane'' by fighting with
passion for needs like full self-rule and voting rights for the
city's congressional delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've had flair before,'' the district council
chairwoman, Linda W. Cropp, said of the Barry era. She expressed no
regret for the businesslike Williams style, even as she confronts
him in the budget fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given the district a sense of hope that things can
happen,'' Cropp said. ``He has many wonderful ideas, although when
it comes to implementing them he's still on a learning curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Major problems like the tattered school system and persistent
youth violence are far from solved. But the mayor and the council
seem resolved to innovate: They are presenting the voters a
referendum next month to give the mayor a role in school management
through the power to appoint some members of the school board. They
are also on the way to delivering four balanced budgets in a row,
the required formula for regaining home-rule powers after years of
chimerical bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In this endeavor, Williams has assiduously avoided what in the
Barry era came to be known as ``the race card'' _ harvesting the
vote of the divided district's black working-class majority by
playing off the affluent white minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never personally use race as an excuse for anything,''
said Williams, a Yale graduate. He emphasized his obligation to
unify and not to deal with the criticism, by now a cliche, that he
might not be ``black enough'' for a city that is 60 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's not appropriate for others,'' he said of
racial complaints. ``But I've been given a lot of opportunities and
advantages where I'm sure I can personally say race plays a role.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor stressed that Washington ``is still very fractured and
divided.'' But he insisted that unheralded programs of mutual good
will crisscross the Anacostia River, the city's main racial
dividing line. He maintained that a recent increase in auto
registrations indicated the viability of his goal of gaining
100,000 residents in this decade, including returning suburbanites
attracted by the district's walkable neighborhoods and burnished
housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Anacostia in one of the low-income southeast wards
that are part of the black political power base, the new mayor,
despite his ruling-class aura, occasioned no great complaint at
Brace's Unisex salon on Minnesota Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Barry was a great people person,'' Alice Taylor said.
``This new mayor is working at a different angle. But he's doing
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Clara Sherrod agreed. ``Barry was a street politician
who knew our problems,'' she said. ``But I'd say the streets are
really looking better with Williams. He's having grass planted
around here and cleaning up things.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in Georgetown, part of the district's white power base in
the northwest quarter, there is palpable pleasure at the way the
Williams bow tie is replacing the Barry dashiki as a D.C.
signature. ``He's made the city a lot more presentable,'' said Pat
Scanlon, a volunteer at the Christ Child Opportunity Shop, a
consignment store on Wisconsin Avenue that finances local
charities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a white customer who would not give his name grumbled:
``He still thinks this is a black city and packs the payroll with
his own. What about us?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is a black city,'' Scanlon responded. ``So what's
wrong with hiring your people who are qualified so they work and
pay taxes and have nice houses?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Barry years, the payroll for the district, which must
provide a mix of state and city services, was criticized as a
strategic patronage trough when it ballooned to 50,000 employees
for a city of 550,000. It has been cut since the fiscal crisis was
declared five years ago; this year it reached a congressionally
authorized level of 32,719, a reduction of 1,450 from last year,
although Williams wants it lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running this city is like Roebling trying to build the
Brooklyn Bridge and digging and digging for the bedrock,'' he said
in frustration. He said he kept uncovering the ``muck'' of old
corruption as he tried to reform such scandal-ridden agencies as
the mental retardation treatment program, whose lethal failures
were laid bare by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer is what I call agency bypass surgery,'' he said of a
radical plan to create an entire new treatment agency alongside the
existing failed system to supersede it.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of these past failures has prompted Eleanor Holmes
Norton, the district's congressional delegate, to caution that any
criticism of Williams ``should be tempered by the disaster
disguised as a city'' that he inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making this city work,'' Norton said. ``He's what we
needed _ a mayor who came to office who had done something other
than run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is portrayed as an un-politician who is making the city
forget the slick Barry era, Williams actually apprenticed seriously
in practical politics as an elected member of the New Haven, Conn.,
board of aldermen when he was studying at Yale for his
undergraduate degree in economics. Twenty years later, he is not
above artfully stroking his Capitol Hill watchdogs; he even
attended a fund-raiser for an influential conservative Republican,
Rep. Ernest Istook of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to look out for my people, you know,'' the mayor
explained, unapologetic about becoming the complete practitioner in
the nation's ultimate political city.

CASH FOR HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THE POOR GOES UNUSED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Hawaii, La., Neb., Tenn., Texas, Conn., N.J., N.Y.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of millions of dollars set aside by the
federal government to help provide health insurance to poor people
leaving welfare remains unused because states have not claimed the
money, a new accounting by the Department of Health and Human
Services shows.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many people who were pushed off welfare and are
eligible for comprehensive health benefits under Medicaid are not
getting coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Congress foresaw the problem in 1996, when it rewrote the
nation's welfare laws. It set aside $500 million to ensure that
children and their parents would not lose Medicaid coverage when
they lost cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But figures from the Department of Health and Human Services
show that more than three-fourths of the money _ $383 million _
remains unspent.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the department, said:
``It's free money. We would really like to see states use it.''
</P>
<P>
   After repeated requests last week, the Department of Health and
Human Services provided a tabulation of state spending through Dec.
31, the latest data available. The figures showed that 21 states
had spent less than 10 percent of the money they were allocated to
help preserve Medicaid for people leaving welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nebraska,
Tennessee and Texas had not spent any of their money. Connecticut
spent less than 1 percent of its $5.8 million allocation, and New
Jersey spent all of its $11 million allocation.
</P>
<P>
   New York spent 10.6 percent of its money and still had $33
million available, the federal government reported. Robert C.
Kenny, a spokesman for the New York Health Department, said the
state intended to spend the rest of its money, but he could not say
when.
</P>
<P>
   States can use the money for a wide range of activities: to let
people know that health insurance is available through Medicaid, to
find those who might be eligible and to help them apply; to print
brochures and simplify application forms; to fix computer systems
used to evaluate eligibility; to hire or train state and local
government employees who work on Medicaid and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, states can give money, as Michigan has done, to
local hospitals, health departments and community groups to find
eligible low-income families and to help them enroll.
</P>
<P>
   The money can also be used to hire interpreters or to translate
application forms into Spanish and other languages for people who
do not read English.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Medicaid is important to people leaving welfare
because they often take low-wage jobs with no health benefits. Even
if an employer offers health insurance, low-wage workers may be
unable to afford the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said she and other lawmakers,
especially Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., ``worked very hard in 1996 to
make sure that no child would lose Medicaid coverage as a result of
welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Johnson said, ``The collapse in the provision of
Medicaid benefits to eligible children has been a significant
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt D. Salo, a health policy expert at the National Governors'
Association, said the federal government had made it difficult for
states to spend the $500 million because it initially defined
``very narrow acceptable uses'' for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Salo insisted that states were taking ``aggressive actions'' to
ensure that eligible families receive Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 21 states by the Kaiser Commission on
Medicaid and the Uninsured found that Medicaid enrollment increased
slightly from June 1998 to June 1999, but was still below the level
of June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said some of the decline had
occurred because of ``benign neglect'' by officials in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on this point, Laurie Rubiner, a former aide to
Chafee who worked on the 1996 law, said: ``State officials have
their eye on the bottom line. The desire to reduce Medicaid
coverage and control costs appears to be a factor contributing to
the decline in Medicaid rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn Guyer, a health care expert at the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group, said that ``in
most states, more than half of parents and more than one out of
three children in families leaving welfare lose Medicaid,'' even
though virtually all the children and most of the parents remain
eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Joan C. Alker, a lobbyist at Families USA, a consumer group,
said: ``There's clearly a problem here, and states have the money
to fix it. In many cases, computer systems kicked families off
Medicaid by mistake. Or the rules were so complex that caseworkers
did not understand the family's right to receive health care
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 welfare law, people who received cash assistance
were automatically enrolled in Medicaid. Congress severed the link
between the two programs in 1996. States were free to change their
welfare eligibility rules, but had to provide Medicaid to any
low-income family that would have qualified under the standards in
effect in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Congress set aside the $500 million because it anticipated that
states would incur new costs, running separate systems to assess
eligibility for Medicaid and welfare.

NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION UNLEASHES ATTACK ON GORE  
 AS CONVENTION OPENS, NRA SOUNDS DEFIANT NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The top leadership of the National Rifle
Association declared political war on Vice President Al Gore
Saturday, using speech after speech before more than 2,000 cheering
members here to accuse Gore of trying to ``disarm the country'' and
to exhort gun owners to organize against his election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is back,'' said Charlton Heston, the organization's
president, who was elected to an unprecedented third consecutive
term. ``All of this spells very serious trouble for a man named
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two hours, five of the organization's top officials
devoted their speeches before the group's annual convention not
just to attacking Gore, but also to ridiculing the Million Mom
March for gun control, held last Sunday, which they called a
campaign rally for Gore and congressional Democrats who support
stricter gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a grass-roots rally but a Gore campaign rally,
scripted and coached by the White House,'' Wayne LaPierre, the
organization's executive vice president, said of the march. ``It
wasn't about safety. It was about Gore for president. But, Mr.
Gore, you're going to find out it's not smart to lie to mom.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the speakers mentioned the name of Gore's Republican
rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But NRA officials said
privately that it was likely the group would endorse Bush later
this summer and throw its substantial resources behind him in the
fall, provided he does not try to distance himself too much from
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they avoided invoking Bush's name, the speakers
repeatedly inched closer to urging NRA members to vote for him, if
only to defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a political campaign raging in America,'' said Kayne
Robinson, the group's first vice president. ``If one of the
candidates is elected, the Constitution, including the Second
Amendment, will be safe. If the other candidate is elected, the
Second Amendment will not be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the chairman of the Iowa State Republican Party, was
captured on videotape in February telling an NRA gathering that if
Bush was elected, the group would have ``a president where we work
out of their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has denied that the NRA would have undue influence over
him, but gun-control advocates and Gore seized on the remark to
accuse the Texas governor of being beholden to the powerful
gun-owners group.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush and the NRA are working hip holster to hip
holster to promote an irresponsible platform,'' Chris Lehane,
Gore's spokesman, said in response to Saturday's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Saturday's speeches attacking Gore, there is ample
evidence that the NRA has been strengthening its ties to the
Republican Party. Campaign finance records show that the group has
contributed more than $1 million to the Republican National
Committee and Republican congressional candidates this year, but
only $111,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The two members of Congress on the NRA's board of directors,
Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia and Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, are both
Republicans. Saturday, the organization announced that Grover
Norquist, the president of the antitax group Americans for Tax
Reform and an influential figure in the Republican Party's
conservative wing, had been elected to its board.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the
fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, was
scheduled to give the keynote speech at a convention banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Al Gore is the type of politician where nothing
is sacred, that will say and do anything to preserve their own
political future, even if that means using fear and deceptive
means,'' Watts was to say, according to an advance text of his
speech. ``His party used to say, `There's nothing to fear but fear
itself.' Now the vice president has nothing to offer but fear
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they claimed responsibility for repeatedly knocking down
gun-control legislation in Washington, NRA officials told their
members that the Clinton-Gore administration had spent the last
seven years assaulting their right to bear arms. And the officials
warned, often with an urgency that even some NRA members found
hyperbolic, that Gore would take steps toward confiscating their
weapons once elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been for the vigilance of millions of NRA
members these past seven years, we would have seen the total
destruction of our rights,'' said James Baker, the group's chief
lobbyist in Washington. ``If Al Gore is elected, it won't even take
seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``For the next six months, Al Gore is going to smear
you as the enemy. He will slander you as gun-toting,
knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a
safer America. Will you remain silent? I will not remain silent. If
we are going to stop this, then it is vital to every law-abiding
gun owner in American to register to vote and show up at the polls
on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing out the speeches, Heston dramatically lifted a replica
of a Revolutionary War-era musket and then paraphrased a popular
NRA bumper sticker that reads, ``I'll give up my gun when you take
it from my cold, dead hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that
would take freedom away,'' Heston said, ``I want to say those words
again for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to
heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore: `From my cold, dead
hands!'''

SPORTS COLUMN: HOUSTON IGNITES KNICKS WITH HIS PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan Houston appears to be one of nature's noblemen.
He is the kind of guy who would never think of reaching across
someone's plate and snaring a chicken leg on the dinner table. With
his gentle, even demeanor, he strikes you as someone you could tell
your troubles to, like a shrink, or a barber. He is not about to
interrupt you to make his point. Allan Houston raising his voice
seems as implausible as hockey fans at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   And his eyes _ his wide, brown, doe-like eyes _ are filled with
compassion, understanding, serenity. So on those occasions when he
mutates into a monster, it is bewildering, and, if you are a Knicks
fan, wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime,'' Chris Childs said _ referring to Friday night's
games when the Knicks trailed the Heat in Game 6 at Madison Square
Garden, and had been booed with a profound and insightful passion
by their adoring fans _ ``Allan came into the locker room all
emotional. He was just saying things. He was upset. And you could
tell it in his eyes. His eyes were speaking loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime,'' Houston said after the game, in which the
Knicks mounted an astonishing comeback to win by 72-70, and send
the series to Game 7 this afternoon in Miami, ``I felt that we had
to stay together as a team. Just keep doing all the good,
fundamental things we knew we could do. And I had to attack the
basket more.''
</P>
<P>
   Attack he did. Not wild, like a wildebeest. More like Hannibal,
coolly charting out the best positions for his elephants, and
decisively heading tusks-first into the breach.
</P>
<P>
   It was truly a team effort, as they posit in the text books, but
in this case, and in more and more cases over the past few years,
Houston has assumed a leadership role, both on the court and in the
locker room. In typical understated fashion, he seems to have
emerged, like the top patriarch in the Eastern Orthodox Church,
first among equals.
</P>
<P>
   And when Houston at times on the court becomes as passive as a
rag doll, or, in another instance, hostage to a gooey defender like
Dan Majerle, the team must hurdle that barrier, of a lost or
nugatory leader. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case in Game 5, when he attempted but two shots in
the second half, as the team lost in the closing minute. Houston is
the team's high scorer, at about 20 a game. He scored 12 in that
game. In the first half of the game Friday, which the Knicks had to
win to dodge elimination, he shot 3-for-9 _ hitting one 3-point
shot _ and had taken no free throws. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard all that stuff about how good Majerle was guarding
me,'' Houston said, ``and I heard guys telling me, `Majerle can't
guard you.' I heard lots of things. But I knew I just couldn't keep
settling for jump shots. I'm always better when I become more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   With just 46 seconds gone in the third quarter, Houston sank a
3-point shot. But he was looking to drive. Shortly after that
3-pointer, he swept to the hoop and hit a twisting layup through
and over a host of arms. Within a half-minute of that, he drove
again, but found Charlie Ward under the hoop with a dish that
Emeril Lagasse would have loved. There was another assist by
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And after a timeout, it was Houston who went to each of the
other players on the court and whispered a reminder of a play to
come. The Knicks, with others like Latrell Sprewell, Larry Johnson,
Patrick Ewing and Ward picking up the pace with shots, steals and
rebounds, chopped the deficit, amazingly, to four, back up to seven
on an Anthony Carter 3-pointer, but Houston had the last word in
the period, hitting a spinning, fadeaway jump shot seconds before
quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans were on their feet. Their screams could be heard in
Bergen County. Suddenly, no greater love had they.
</P>
<P>
   And, as history now records, the Knicks came back in the fourth
quarter to tie the game at 70-70, and, with 17.6 seconds left,
Houston, taking it upon himself to do something special, drove to
the hoop again, was fouled, and, with that delicious combination of
frost and fire _ ice cream and hot fudge _ Houston sank the two
final points of the game, for a team-leading 21 points _ 5-for-6
from the field, including a pair of 3's and three free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Knicks go back to Miami, a team that they view (and are
viewed in return) with the ardor reserved for a neighbor would
keeps running over your lawn with his truck. And has a dog that
barks all night, to boot. But it was in the deciding game of last
year's playoffs, which also went the full length, when Houston
again emerged the hero with a last-second shot that bounced up and
then in, a moment in Knick lore that ranks with Willis Reed's limp.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, in fact, twisted his ankle on a drive in the last half.
But you would not have known it by watching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still sore,'' he said after the game, ``but it'll be
ready in Miami. And the team that can execute under pressure, that
can make the big plays, the plays you dream about and pray about,
that team will win.'' He said Friday night's game demonstrated how
the Knicks stick together, do not get rattled, make the big plays
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a saying in sports that you must let the game come to
you. But not if you are the star. Not if you are the leader. You
must take the game by the lapels, and demand satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who was a virtual bystander in Game 5, did what a star
has to do in Game 6. He did what a leader has to do. That is, he
did it.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7 awaits.

AS STATE LAWS DIFFER, POLICE FIND VARIOUS WAYS TO SIDESTEP THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Laws differ from state to state, but police
still sidestep them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, little or no drug money appears to get into
educational funds even though that's where at least eight state
constitutions require forfeited money and property to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police in North Carolina get around their constitution by simply
handing their seizures to federal agencies, which then return up to
80 percent to the police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, law enforcement there has reaped more than $14
million in the last three years. (That figure may include money
from actual joint investigations, however, and all of that money
might not have been able to be forfeited under state laws.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, as in many of the other states, it's
difficult to determine how much money actually went to education
because there is no statewide accounting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Wake County _ the location of Raleigh, the state capital _
the sheriff refused to disclose the amount in his county, and a
number of other officials didn't know. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Crowell, an attorney who works for the state board of
education, said he didn't know about the education drain until
recently, but now he plans to begin reviewing legal remedies to get
forfeiture proceeds to schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He criticized the police hand-offs, saying that ``mentality is
just puzzling and troubling. It's atrocious.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin officials also didn't know police were handing off
seizures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where they think, without a constitutional
amendment, they can get away with unilaterally making that type of
decision,'' said Calvin Potter, an assistant superintendent for the
Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and a state legislator
for 23 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wisconsin law enforcement officials freely admit they hand
off seizures to federal agencies so they can get the money back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, voters changed the constitution in the 1980s to let
police have half the forfeiture money, which previously had all
gone to education. Legislators say the change came at the request
of law enforcement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But now police in Nebraska say they need all the money. And for
several years, they have been turning the majority of seizures over
to a federal agency rather than filing under state law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police in Missouri also use the federal hand-off to keep money
instead of sending it to schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Situations differ in other states: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In West Virginia, the constitution requires any property
seized to go to the school fund. But in 1988, state Sen. Lloyd
Jackson, then the Judiciary Committee chairman, co-sponsored a bill
that said forfeitures under the state forfeiture act aren't the
same as those in the state constitution. Other laws were passed
directing forfeiture proceeds to a special law enforcement fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jackson is the Education Committee chairman. An aide said
Jackson was too busy to be interviewed and cannot remember why he
sponsored the law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Some police still hand off seizures.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Indiana, too, the legislature has passed a law helping
police to bypass schools with their seizures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Washington state's constitution sends forfeited money to the
state to be used for education. But state law conflicts with the
constitution, sending the money instead to the law enforcement
agency that makes the seizure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Wyoming, police may not purposely be avoiding the
constitutional education provision. It's just that no one knows
about it, according to the attorney general's office. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the education drain, courts in two states have ruled that
money can't be forfeited _ at all _ when the owner is convicted of
a crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State supreme courts in New Mexico and Nebraska say it's double
jeopardy to both convict a person and take his property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But police are getting around those decisions by using federal
agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the Albuquerque police special
investigations unit, said police officials are working with
prosecutors to find a way to overturn the New Mexico ruling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davalos said the court is forgetting the whole point of
forfeitures, which is to financially hurt drug traffickers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, a gentlemen's agreement has been
worked out with the U.S. attorney's office and federal agencies to
handle the seizures that meet federal guidelines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case-by-case basis,'' Davalos said. ``If we find a
friendly federal agency that is willing to do it for us, we more
than press them into service, be it the DEA, ATF, IRS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really care.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Nebraska Supreme Court also ruled that some
forfeitures are double jeopardy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gale T. Griess of the Highway Patrol said troopers are
continuing to hand off seizures to the federal government to try to
keep crime under control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If the seizures go by the wayside, basically what is going to
happen is the criminal element out there in society is going to
have the upper hand,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legislature failed this spring to fix the double jeopardy
problem or force police to follow state law, which gives half of
state forfeitures to education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several other states have even more unusual laws: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Arkansas puts a cap on seizures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police can keep up to $250,000 of a seizure. Anything more than
that must go into a statewide fund that benefits all local and
state law enforcement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But police have ignored the cap _ as state officials learned
after a $3.16 million seizure by the Arkansas Highway Police in
March 1998. A county prosecutor went looking for the money,
discovered the Highway Police had passed it to the Drug Enforcement
Administration and won a court ruling to get it back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After losing before the state Supreme Court, Highway Police
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the
case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Highway Police lost their hold on the money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, legislators discovered that the fund set up for all
forfeitures over $250,000 was empty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In Georgia, local police can keep almost all the money they
seize _ and state police can't keep any. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But state police make sure they get at least a share. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, state police have a policy of turning over any cash
seizures of more than $1,000 to the federal government, which will
send most of that back to them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when state and local police team up on a drug case, local
police take all the proceeds and spend half to buy law enforcement
equipment that they then give to the State Patrol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Ohio laws are among the most restrictive in the nation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A felony charge generally must be filed before property can be
forfeited in state court. And if no charges are filed and there is
no convincing evidence of a crime, property must be returned to the
owner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not an obstacle for police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati police specialist Dave Kelly said his department
routinely asks a federal agency to take the property when the
prosecutor declines to file a forfeiture proceeding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we do it in Cincinnati,'' Kelly said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several defense attorneys and others say, however, that Ohio
statutes are difficult to understand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very poorly written statutes, and they are confusing
to most attorneys,'' said James Schaefer, the assistant prosecuting
attorney who has handled forfeiture cases in Cincinnati and
Hamilton County. &QL;

POLICE ACROSS COUNTRY EVADE LAWS TO KEEP CONFISCATED PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police and highway patrols across the country
are evading state laws to improperly keep millions of dollars in
cash and property seized in drug busts and traffic stops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most states don't want law enforcement agencies to profit so
easily from such confiscations _ they see it as a dangerous
conflict of interest. For that reason, they have passed laws
blocking seized property from going directly back to police, and
many states designate seizures to be used for other purposes, such
as education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a yearlong examination by The Kansas City Star reveals that
police agencies in every one of more than two dozen states checked
by the newspaper have used federal law enforcement to circumvent
their own laws and keep more of that money for themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: When police seize money, they call a federal
agency instead of going to state court to confiscate it. An agency
such as the Drug Enforcement Administration accepts the seizure,
making it a federal case. The DEA keeps a cut of the money and
returns the rest to police. State courts are bypassed altogether. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement says that's not illegal and that without the
money, police would be handcuffed in fighting crime. But millions
of dollars that lawmakers in some states have designated for
education, drug treatment programs and other purposes instead end
up back in the hands of police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- A North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper stopped a
driver last year on Interstate 95 for tailgating. A police dog
signaled drugs were in the Toyota, where troopers found $105,700
and two grams of marijuana. The driver denied owning either the
drugs or the money. The highway patrol gave it to the DEA, which
returned more than $80,000 to the state patrol, even though North
Carolina law generally requires sending seized money to education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In June a Georgia trooper stopped a 1996 Monte Carlo for
speeding on I-95. After the driver and passengers gave conflicting
stories, the trooper searched the car and found a hidden
compartment containing $7,000, which the driver said was from
savings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patrol turned over the money to the DEA, which in January
returned $5,440 to the patrol. Under Georgia law forfeited money
should go to the state's general fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1996, the Missouri Highway Patrol stopped a Volkswagen
Golf for speeding, searched it because the occupants seemed
suspicious and found $24,000. No drugs were found and no one
claimed the money. The patrol gave it to the DEA to be forfeited,
the legal term for confiscation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Volkswagen case took a bizarre turn last year when a family
that bought the car at auction discovered an additional $82,000 in
the gas tank. The DEA took that money, too.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law sends forfeited money to a public education fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the money diverted from public funds, critics are just as
troubled by the weakening of a basic American civil liberty _ the
Bill of Rights protection against improper search and seizure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owners who want to recover seized property usually face a much
tougher road in federal court than they would under their own state
laws. That continues despite a federal law passed last month that
will place some limits on forfeiture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that many state laws have stronger civil
protections than federal law, legislators say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to make sure that people who are subject to
forfeitures have some basic rights,'' said Georgia Rep. Jim Martin,
a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal hand-offs, critics say, also create an opportunity
for police to profit from their own actions. Indeed, they trace an
increasing outcry over aggressive or illegal searches by police
nationwide back to the profit motive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that by conducting an illegal search and seizing
people on the highway you can increase the number of times where
you can take assets, it is going to become a big motivating
force,'' said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This may be one of those rare issues that elicits protests
across the political spectrum _ from the ACLU to the National Rifle
Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't realize that forfeitures often occur to
``ordinary people who happen to find themselves in a situation in
which they are simply suspected of having been somehow involved in
criminal activity, whether those suspicions ever prove out or
not,'' said Roger Pilon, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a
Libertarian think tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between a free society and a police state is usually
broached in small steps.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not every police department turns seizure money over to federal
agencies, but many that do complain that state laws are too
restrictive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, police explain, they believe money they seize is
linked to drugs, but they can't prove it under state standards, and
they don't want to give the money back to a suspected drug dealer.
Federal law lets them take the money out of the owner's hands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody uses the federal system,'' said Lt. Harry Kearley of
the Alabama Bureau of Investigations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials agree police have the proper motives for using
federal law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think police agencies are in the business of
profiting,'' said Jerry McDowell, director of the Justice
Department's asset forfeiture and money laundering division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it's legal for police to send seizures to
federal agencies because most state laws do not specifically
prohibit that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to subvert state law, and we don't
want states to subvert our law,'' McDowell said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, most states do prohibit simply handing off
seizures _ their laws give jurisdiction over seizures to state
courts, The Star has found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What that means, say legal experts who have examined the
little-known state provisions, is that police cannot simply hand
off seizures to federal agents to avoid state requirements. They
need a court order first. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This statute is not difficult at all,'' said David Harris, a
University of Toledo law professor and constitutional expert. ``The
state court has jurisdiction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen state and federal court decisions have backed that
interpretation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A local police department may not take seized property and
just pass it on as it pleases to the FBI in flagrant disregard of
state laws,'' according to a federal circuit court opinion in an
Illinois case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such handoffs began after Congress passed a 1984 law that
allowed law enforcement to share forfeitures as a way to foster
greater cooperation and shut down drug operations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent was to permit the feds to share with state and
local law enforcement when there were truly federal cases,'' former
U.S. Rep. William J. Hughes, the chief sponsor of the bill and a
New Jersey Democrat, said in a recent interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department wrote guidelines that have twisted
the intent of the law, critics say. In addition to addressing joint
investigations led by federal agencies, the guidelines created a
process called ``adoption.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under adoption, state and local police could give their seizures
to the federal government _ even if a federal agency had not been
involved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ``turned around and permitted the
forfeiture laws to be used basically to circumvent state law,''
Hughes said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forfeitures have come to mean a lot of money for police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that from October 1996 through March
1999 it accepted $208,454,000 in seizures from state and local
police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that figure is still being audited because the Justice
Department has not published an annual forfeiture report since
1996, although the law requires the report to be produced each
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the $208 million figure is almost certainly low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over one period, the Justice Department reported that Missouri
police gave federal agencies only half as much as the state auditor
found in just a sampling of adoptive cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nationwide total, forfeitures can quickly add up
for individual departments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a single case in Indiana, a state trooper stopped a truck for
speeding on Interstate 70. Troopers found $811,470 and turned it
over to the DEA, which this year returned almost $500,000 to the
state police and $121,000 to a sheriff's department that helped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police say they need the money if they are to continue the war
on drugs. If they lose forfeiture money, they say, local
governments are unlikely to replace it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the special
investigations unit for Albuquerque, N.M., police, pointed out that
his unit costs about $1 million a year, of which the city only
funds about $250,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics say police who use forfeits to fund themselves end
up on a treadmill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The real narcotic here is the money,'' said Glasser of the
ACLU. ``It becomes a stream of income that they learn not to do
without and then they have to generate more of it.'' &QL;

   (in seizures)
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, no forfeited money has gone into a substance abuse
fund for at least four years, even though some should under state
law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, /{The Star/} found that police circumvented their laws
even in states that would have given them back much of their
seizures had they gone through state court. &QL; 
Maj. Gale T. Griess of the Nebraska State Patrol said the patrol
hands off most seizures to federal agencies so it doesn't have to
split the money with education, as state law requires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, police are allowed most of the money back under state
law. Nonetheless, the Kansas Highway Patrol admits handing off
money to federal agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And surprisingly, even in states such as Alabama that let law
enforcement keep all the forfeiture money after costs, police still
can be found giving their seizures to federal agencies. The reason:
Forfeitures are easier under federal law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say police are justified when they
make that choice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are out enforcing the law and they are seizing
property from criminals, and they are doing it in conjunction with
the federal government, they are not getting around (state) law,
they are helping enforce federal law,'' said McDowell of the
Justice Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( End optional trims )}
</P>
<P>
   But /{The Star/} found that more than two-thirds of all states
appear to prohibit handing off money to federal agencies without
permission of a state court. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those states have requirements that courts have called
``turnover orders.'' Many of the provisions read like the one in
Illinois: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Property taken or detained under this section ... is deemed to
be in the custody of the law enforcement department or agency
employing the seizing officer subject only to the orders and
judgments of the circuit court having jurisdiction over the
forfeiture proceedings.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That means only a state judge can transfer a seizure to a
federal agency, legal experts say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This statute is not difficult at all,'' said David Harris, a
University of Toledo law professor and constitutional expert. ``The
state court has jurisdiction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen state and federal court decisions have backed that
interpretation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A local police department may not take seized property and
just pass it on as it pleases to the FBI in flagrant disregard of
state laws,'' according to a federal circuit court opinion in an
Illinois case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gene Zoegtlin, legislative counsel for the International
Association of Chiefs of Police, said he was aware of the turnover
provisions but was unfamiliar with how they worked. He referred
questions to the Justice Department, which did not respond. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even some prosecutors concede police can't just hand off
forfeitures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Alabama law, a court must decide when to transfer seizures
to a federal agency, not police, said Yvonne Saxon, Alabama
assistant attorney general. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read the statute literally, there is no choice,'' Saxon
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When questioned, police offer a number of reasons for not
following turnover orders: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- They did not know the law existed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- They did not really seize the money _ they were only holding
it until a federal agency could officially seize it for
forfeiture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Money seized on an interstate highway may be involved in
interstate drug trafficking, and therefore is a federal matter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Police officers sometimes are not really acting as local
police _ they've been deputized to be federal agents, even though
they are still paid by local or state governments. And cash becomes
federal property when a deputized officer picks it up, they say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the DEA says a state case becomes federal if
police investigating the case ask a DEA agent to come to the scene
of the crime. ``That agent can seize the asset on behalf of the DEA
and initiate a federal forfeiture proceeding,'' the DEA wrote in
response to questions from /{The Star/}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such reasoning is legally dubious and seems an
attempt to obscure the real issue _ police want the money, and that
generally requires evading their state laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, police say they need the money if they are to continue
the war on drugs. If they lose forfeiture money, they say, local
governments are unlikely to replace it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   For example, Capt. Ruben Davalos, head of the special
investigations unit for Albuquerque, N.M., police, pointed out that
his unit costs about $1 million a year, of which the city only
funds about $250,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McNamara, former San Jose and Kansas City police chief,
said city officials can take some of the blame for the federal
hand-offs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He recalls one year in San Jose his department's tentative
budget had no money for equipment, so McNamara asked the city
manager why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of waved his hand dismissively and said, `Well, you
guys seized $4 million last year, I expect you to do better this
year,'' McNamara said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State law doesn't account for the cost of doing drug
investigations, so police are justified in bypassing it, said
Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Tim Rousset, who heads a task force in
southwest Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was once a state law that said black people and white
people would go to different schools,'' Rousset said. ``Just
because there is a state law doesn't necessarily mean that that
state law is correct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( End optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   But the end never justifies the means, especially in law
enforcement, said Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice
Policy Foundation, a Washington think tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When a police officer on patrol understands the chief is
saying it's OK for us to keep property that is not ours, the chief
is sending a very bright, neonlike message,'' Sterling said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules don't matter.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, others say, police who use forfeits to fund themselves
end up on a treadmill. &QL;

   (Hughes said.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, private citizens are now more vulnerable to
forfeiture because circumvented state laws often provide more
protections than federal forfeiture laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, some state laws protect people from having property
forfeited by police unless they're charged with a felony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But under federal law, authorities don't even need a criminal
charge to forfeit property. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts estimate that the great majority of forfeitures
occur without a criminal charge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most state laws require that forfeitures be ordered by a judge.
Federal law enforcement has the power to order forfeitures without
a judge _ and does in most cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it's costly to contest a federal forfeiture. Defense
attorneys estimate it costs at least $10,000, so many won't even
accept a case unless the value of the seizure is large. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   Although many people whose property is seized are no doubt
guilty of a crime, that doesn't mean all are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Carroll, a disabled, 64-year-old Maryland woman, could
lose her house because police found a third of an ounce of cocaine
and other drugs that some of her children left there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Maryland law, a house usually can't be forfeited without a
criminal conviction. Police tapped the federal government to
forfeit the three-acre property, which has been in Carroll's family
for a century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I got sick, so sick in my stomach and started crying,''
Carroll said. ``I'm just praying.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who has osteoarthritis and receives $500 a month from
Social Security disability, has never been convicted of a crime,
her attorney said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The state can't take her house, so they run to the feds,''
said the attorney, Stephen F. Allen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carroll continues to live in the home while Allen fights the
forfeiture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Salem, Assistant U.S. Attorney, described the forfeiture
as a ``hybrid adoption'' because federal agents were aware of the
police investigation but were not involved in the searches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salem also said the forfeiture would be justified because
Carroll didn't take enough steps to protect her property, even
though she says she evicted her children and changed a lock before
proceedings began. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She claims she changed a lock on a door though I'm unclear
which door it is,'' Salem said. ``She claims she took steps that
even if I would credit them as true, the government believes them
to be insufficient to justify innocent ownership. There was no
effect. That didn't keep the children out of the house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that many state laws have tougher forfeiture
standards than federal law, legislators say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to make sure that people who are subject to
forfeitures have some basic rights,'' said Georgia Rep. Jim Martin,
a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And some of those protections are erased when police give the
money to federal law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   {( End optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   Not all police departments send forfeitures to federal agencies,
but many that do candidly acknowledge it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody uses the federal system,'' said Lt. Harry Kearley of
the Alabama Bureau of Investigations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, police explain, they believe money they seize is
linked to drugs, but they can't prove it under state standards, and
they don't want to give the money back to a suspected drug dealer.
Federal law lets them take the money out of the owner's hands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   For example, police in Azusa, Calif., used easier federal
requirements to take at least one forfeiture worth more than
$450,000 to them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, an officer stopped a driver for improper use of his
turn signal and searched the vehicle when the driver said it didn't
belong to him. The officer found $611,500 in a hidden compartment.
A dog signaled the presence of drug residue on the cash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To forfeit the money under state law, police usually need a
felony conviction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But police found no drugs and sent the driver on his way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, the department gave the money to a federal agent. &QL;

<P>
   ``The reality is there are situations under which California law
will not permit forfeiture, and federal law will,'' said Andy
Cuellar, a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little California can do about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Alaska case shows just how strong federal powers are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fairbanks police had seized $44,850 in cash from Perry Johnson
after finding cocaine in his home. But charges were dismissed
because of an illegal search. Police knew they couldn't keep the
money under state law, so they gave it to the DEA for adoption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that police had no right
under state law to give the money to the DEA. Under federal law,
though, police could keep the money, so the city wrote a cashier's
check to Johnson for $58,654, which included interest, according to
court records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the DEA seized that money, too, saying it could be traced to
drug transactions. The federal government returned 40 percent to 60
percent to Fairbanks police, a police official said. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Forfeitures can mean a lot of money for police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department says that from October 1996 through March
1999 it accepted $208,454,000 in seizures from state and local
police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that figure is still being audited because the Justice
Department has not published an annual forfeiture report since
1996, although the law requires the report to be produced each
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the $208 million figure is almost certainly low. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over one period, the Justice Department reported that Missouri
police gave federal agencies only half as much as the state auditor
found in just a sampling of cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the nationwide total, forfeitures can quickly add up
for individual departments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department
received back more than $2.5 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took back
$1.7 million. &QL; 
(Both those figures include proceeds from joint investigations.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in a single case in Indiana, a state trooper stopped a truck
for speeding on Interstate 70. Troopers found $811,470 and turned
it over to the DEA, which this year returned almost $500,000 to the
state police and $121,000 to a sheriff's department that helped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, enough is at stake that police work with federal
agencies no matter what their state law may be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, police in some states that award forfeiture money
to special funds purposefully divert the money so it can end up in
their coffers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin law mandates that forfeiture money goes to public
schools, but only $16,906 went into Wisconsin's education fund
during the year ending in June 1999, according to the state
treasury department. During just six months of the same period,
local law enforcement gave the federal government $1.5 million in
seizures. &QL;

POLICE ACROSS COUNTRY EVADE LAWS TO KEEP CONFISCATED PROPERTY 
</HEADLINE>
 3 TAKES -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police and highway patrols across the country
are evading state laws to improperly keep millions of dollars in
cash and property seized in drug busts and traffic stops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most states don't want law enforcement agencies to profit so
easily from such confiscations _ they see it as a dangerous
conflict of interest. For that reason, they have passed laws
blocking seized property from going directly back to police, and
many states designate seizures to be used for other purposes, such
as education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a yearlong examination by The Kansas City Star reveals that
police agencies in every one of more than two dozen states checked
by the newspaper have used federal law enforcement to circumvent
their own laws and keep most of that money for themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: When police seize money, they call a federal
agency instead of going to state court to confiscate it. An agency
such as the Drug Enforcement Administration accepts the seizure,
making it a federal case. The DEA keeps a cut of the money and
returns the rest to police. State courts _ and their generally
more-restrictive forfeiture laws _ are bypassed altogether. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement says that's not illegal and that without the
money, police would be handcuffed in fighting crime. But millions
of dollars that lawmakers in some states have designated for
education, drug treatment programs and other purposes instead end
up back in the hands of police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --A North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper stopped a driver
last year on Interstate 95 for tailgating. A police dog signaled
drugs were in the Toyota, where troopers found $105,700 and two
grams of marijuana. The driver denied owning either the drugs or
the money. The highway patrol gave the money to the DEA, which
returned more than $80,000 to the state patrol, even though North
Carolina law generally requires sending seized money to education. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- In June a Georgia trooper stopped a 1996 Monte Carlo for
speeding on I-95. After the driver and passengers gave conflicting
stories, the trooper searched the car and found a hidden
compartment containing $7,000, which the driver said was from
savings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The patrol turned over the money to the DEA, which in January
returned $5,440 to the patrol. Under Georgia law forfeited money
should go to the state's general fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --In 1996, the Missouri Highway Patrol stopped a Volkswagen Golf
for speeding, searched it because the occupants seemed suspicious
and found $24,000. No drugs were found and no one claimed the
money. The patrol gave it to the DEA to be forfeited, the legal
term for confiscation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The case took a bizarre turn last year when a family that
bought the car at auction discovered an additional $82,000 in the
gas tank. The DEA took that money, too.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law sends forfeiture money to a public school fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the money diverted from public funds, critics are just as
troubled by the weakening of a basic American civil liberty _ the
Bill of Rights protection against improper search and seizure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owners who want to recover seized property usually face a much
tougher road in federal court than they would under their own state
laws. That continues despite a new federal law passed last month
that will place some limits on forfeiture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal hand-offs, critics say, also create an opportunity
for police to profit from their own actions. Indeed, they trace an
increasing outcry over aggressive or illegal searches by police
nationwide back to the profit motive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think that by conducting an illegal search and seizing
people on the highway you can increase the number of times where
you can take assets, it is going to become a big motivating
force,'' said Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This may be one of those rare issues that elicits protests
across the political spectrum _ from the ACLU to the National Rifle
Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans don't realize that forfeitures often occur to
``ordinary people who happen to find themselves in a situation in
which they are simply suspected of having been somehow involved in
criminal activity, whether those suspicions ever prove out or
not,'' said Roger Pilon, a vice president at the Cato Institute, a
Libertarian think tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between a free society and a police state is usually
broached in small steps.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many police complain that state laws are too restrictive,
sometimes preventing them from taking the money that fuels drug
operations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others readily admit they avoid state laws because they need to
use seized money to fight the war on drugs _ their own cities and
states may not provide the funding otherwise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of state agencies, like the GBI, prefer to work federal
cases because we know it will go directly into our asset forfeiture
bank,'' said Mark Jackson, director of legal services for the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some federal officials contend the cases collected by the
newspaper prove nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country this big, you can find cases all over the lot,''
said Jerry McDowell, director of the Justice Department's asset
forfeiture and money laundering division. ``I don't think police
agencies are in the business of profiting.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it's legal for police to send seizures to
federal agencies because most state laws do not specifically
prohibit that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to subvert state law, and we don't
want states to subvert our law,'' McDowell said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But most states do prohibit simply handing off seizures _ their
laws give jurisdiction over seizures to state courts, The Star has
found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What that means, say legal experts and judges who have examined
the little-known state provisions, is that police cannot simply
hand off seizures to federal agents to avoid state requirements.
They need a court order first. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One federal court in a Louisiana case even derisively likened
the evasion maneuver to a trick football play. The court wrote: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL sportscasters might call the handoff from the Sheriff's
Office to the DEA, followed by the lateral back from the DEA to the
Sheriff's Office, a `flea-flicker.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( Begin optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiture itself is not new _ many colonists fled England in
part because the king's law allowed forfeiture, but it followed
them to America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of
Independence, was defended by John Adams when the Crown seized his
ship for failure to pay a despised tax on its cargo of Madeira
wine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers
determined forfeiture would be used only on a limited basis _ to
seize foreign ships for failure to pay customs duties, for
example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bill of Rights protects Americans from illegal
searches and seizures: No person shall ``be deprived of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years later, much has changed with the advent of the
war on drugs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   {( End optional trim )}
</P>
<P>
   In passing a 1984 law, Congress thought that if federal and
local law enforcement agencies cooperated more closely, they could
shut down drug operations by confiscating dealers' money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies would share assets they seized in drug busts
with local police who helped them. That would reimburse police for
the cost of helping to fight the war on drugs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent was to permit the feds to share with state and
local law enforcement when there were truly federal cases,'' former
U.S. Rep. William J. Hughes, the chief sponsor of the bill and a
New Jersey Democrat, said in a recent interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it was up to the Justice Department to write the guidelines
to implement the law _ and that's where critics say the intent of
the law was twisted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to addressing joint investigations led by federal
agencies, the Justice guidelines created a process called
``adoption.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under adoption, state and local police could give their seizures
to the federal government _ even if a federal agency had not been
involved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department ``turned around and permitted the
forfeiture laws to be used basically to circumvent state law,''
Hughes said. &QL;

STUDY WILL DEVELOP WAY TO MONITOR CANCER CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Texas, Calif.)   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Responding to a call to improve the quality of
cancer care in the United States, a leading cancer organization
said here Saturday that it was working with other groups to develop
a national system to monitor how well each cancer patient is
treated.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will begin this summer when researchers from Harvard
University and Rand Corp. begin examining the medical records of
600 patients to determine their outcomes from two types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase will be conducted in Cleveland, Houston and Los
Angeles and will involve 300 people with breast cancer and an
additional 300 with cancer of the colon and rectum, the study's
leaders said at the opening of a meeting here of the American
Society of Clinical Oncologists, the leading group of cancer
specialists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal is to develop specific measures of quality
spanning the entire course of care, from diagnosis to cure or
death. Such measures could then be used to hold health-care
providers accountable for the quality of cancer care. An estimated
1.2 million Americans will develop cancer this year. Cancer is
second to heart disease as a cause of death among Americans and is
one of the most expensive diseases to treat.
</P>
<P>
   Breast and colorectal cancers were chosen because consensus for
their care is greater than for other major cancers, said Dr.
Deborah Kamin, the oncologist group's director of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation is the study's major
sponsor, paying about half of the $2 million cost. Other
contributors are groups representing surgeons, radiation
therapists, nurses and the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   The three cities were chosen to provide a representative look at
how different minority populations are treated. The study may be
expanded to other cities to include 2,000 patients and possibly
lung cancer if an additional $1 million is obtained, Kamin said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Cases will be chosen at random among those whose cancer was
discovered two years ago, thus allowing enough time to complete a
first round of therapy. Some patients may be in relapse and others
may be dead.
</P>
<P>
   Because a patient may have received care at more than one
medical center, the study could involve as many as 10 hospitals in
each city. As is standard, the researchers will obtain permission
from an ethics committee at each hospital before examining records
and interviewing patients.
</P>
<P>
   After determining whether therapy was intended for cure or
palliation, the researchers will seek information about the
therapies offered and given at each critical decision-making step
in the patients' care.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions: Did surgeons recommend consultations with
an oncologist? If treatment involved chemotherapy, were the correct
drugs chosen and given in the proper amount? Was pain relief
achieved? Was hospice care offered? And how well managed were other
end-of-life care options?
</P>
<P>
   Also the researchers will interview the same patients to
correlate what they say they were told with what doctors, nurses,
nutritionists and other health professionals wrote in the records.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and their families will be asked: Were all appropriate
medical options explained and choices given? For example, were the
patients offered radiation therapy after breast-conserving therapy?
Were doctors available when needed to answer questions and offer
care? Did doctors recommend entering a clinical trial to evaluate
newer therapies? Did the patients join a support group?
</P>
<P>
   The oncology group's president, Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, who
practices in Houston, said the effort was a response to a report
released in April 1999 by the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences. In addressing issues in the prevention,
control, diagnosis, treatment and palliation of cancer, the
institute said that there was ``a growing lack of public
confidence'' in the nation's system of fragmented cancer care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is no national cancer-care program or system of care in
the United States,'' the report said. It also said that the
government had numerous cancer programs and research, ``but in no
one place are these disparate efforts coordinated or even
described.''
</P>
<P>
   A substantial, but unmeasured, number of cancer patients do not
receive care known to be effective for their condition, the medical
institute said, and the reasons for failure to deliver high quality
care could come from overuse, underuse or misuse of proper therapy,
but they have not been studied adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting clinical trials to determine the safety and
effectiveness of therapies is a first step in assessing quality.
But too few patients participate in such trials, even though
studies show that routine care costs in cancer clinical trials are
no more than in standard care, cancer experts have said.

ON WEB, VOTERS REINVENT GRASS-ROOTS ACTIVISM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ore., Texas)  By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By day, Pamela Sybrandy works as a nurse in San
Diego. But in her free time, she is a cyberwarrior for Vice
President Al Gore. Part of a growing band of grass-roots activists,
Sybrandy has set up a Web page _ with no ties to the Democratic
Party or the Gore campaign _ to promote Gore's views on family and
children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Sybrandy's only political involvement was to gather
bumper stickers and buttons at the local Democratic headquarters.
But this year, she said, she looked at her political participation
and decided to ``kick it up a notch'' and create a site
(www.all4gore.com) to promote Gore in a way that gave her more
clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 election, such independent and home-grown Web pages,
created by individual voters with some Web-design skills and a
little spare time, are multiplying exponentially and now number
about 6,700.
</P>
<P>
   Often rivaling the sophistication of the official Web sites of
political parties and candidates, these grass-roots sites are a new
way for ordinary voters to engage in the political process _ a
high-tech version, many say, of putting a sign in a voter's front
yard or a bumper sticker on a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of democracy at work,'' said Eddie Mahe, a
Washington consultant and former deputy chairman of the Republican
National Committee. ``Historically, those same things have been
said in every campaign. The difference is that they used to be said
in a bar or at the corner coffee shop. But now, on the Internet,
everyone has a megaphone.''
</P>
<P>
   In their unorganized way and by their sheer numbers, grass-roots
Web sites are challenging the traditional role of the two political
parties and individual candidates of controlling their own
messages, to direct activism and to orchestrate the rhythm and pace
of a political campaign. If the 2000 election is the one in which
the Internet meets traditional campaigning, it is also one in which
politicians are sorting out whether this grass-roots cyberactivism
is a friend or foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians don't know if this will be a benefit or if it is
where they start losing control of their campaigns,'' said Ari
Schwartz, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a nonprofit organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-May, 3,775 home-grown Web sites had the Bush name in
them and 3,066 had Gore's name, compared with virtually none
containing candidates' names in the last presidential campaign. Not
all, of course, support one of the two candidates. Some praise,
some mock, some parody and others simply repeat much of what the
two candidates have said or post news articles about them from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bush campaign seems to have suffered the greatest
sting from parody sites, particularly over questions about whether
he used drugs. The Bush campaign, in fact, tried to restrict one
scathing Web site, www.gwbush.com, arguing that the site should be
regulated as a political committee, but the campaign's complaint
was dismissed last month by the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like someone walks down the street at lunch time and
yells at the top of their lungs that a presidential candidate is
wrong or unattractive,'' said Robert F. Bauer, a lawyer for the
Democratic Party. ``The candidates cannot demand a retraction or
make a citizen's arrest. This is not different.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, these sites are earnest efforts at political
activism and, because of that, they raise several tricky issues. On
one hand, grass-roots Web sites represent a wellspring of new
activists for candidates and parties to tap, especially when so
many political observers have lamented a decline in voter
participation.
</P>
<P>
   But this new medium also creates a series of what-if's for the
parties: What if a well-meaning Web site contains information the
candidate or party believes misrepresents it? What if confusion
arises between official party and candidate Web sites and
grass-roots ones? What if some of these Web sites contain links to
groups on the far right or far left that a candidate would rather
not be associated with?
</P>
<P>
   And, even more basic, what if these Web sites begin to shift
political power away from candidates and parties and to individuals
with a large electronic presence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, guilt by association was a very effective political
weapon,'' said one Republican Party official. ``On the Web, heaven
and hell are only two clicks away. To criticize a candidate for
something on a link that is three or four sites removed from his
own Web page will be problematic for every political player on the
Web. They are all going to face it.''
</P>
<P>
   Makers of these Web sites do not see their activities as a
series of what-if's, but rather as a chance to participate in
politics _ in their own way, on their own schedule.

   ``If my site was run by the Republican National Committee,
they'd be saying, `Do this' or, `Don't say that,''' said Travis
Main, a computer technician in Eugene, Ore., who set up
www.voterepublican.net. ``I wanted to be involved promoting
Republican conservatives. But I didn't have the time to get
involved with the parties or be an activist in that sense. The
Internet gave me the opportunity to be active and work at it on my
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in August, Main, who works in a bank, started putting
in six to seven hours a day on weekends and at nights building his
Web site. Now, he has about 1,500 visits a month and he has cut his
work on the site to an hour or two a day.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a cartoon logo of a smiling elephant cradling a
baby elephant swaddled in a U.S. flag. It contains a directory and
links to conservative Republican Web sites and to a wide array of
conservative publications and groups. It also posts letters from
viewers and holds some discussions on conservative issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust of our site is to provide information,'' Main said.
``There is all this information out there and voters can have a
choice about what they want to gather and how they want to act on
that. Before, they just had to rely on the local party or reading
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum is Robin Orlowski, a
junior at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas. She runs the
PioneerGrrrl Web site, which contains essays by Orlowski supporting
Democratic and female candidates and attacking the Republicans. It
also has links to pro-Democratic sites and anti-Bush ones.
</P>
<P>
   Orlowski plans to participate in more traditional campaigning
this fall, but she sees her site as a way of expressing her liberal
views cheaply and in the spirit of free and open debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites will increase democracy in the long run,''
Orlowski said. ``You don't have tightly scripted campaigns as the
sole voice. You will have independent citizens voicing their
opinions in a way they couldn't before. It's because the Internet
is dirt cheap and it costs money to print campaign materials. The
Internet is a great free opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And as Bush and Gore know well, the Internet also provides an
opportunity for critics to exploit their foibles. For instance,
www.allgore.com, recently featured a parody of Gore saying, ``Elian
can live with me.'' And anti-Bush Web sites like www.georgybush.com
feature parody songs in Spanish and English that can be put on CDs
for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has tried to take a low-key view of the sites
that make fun of Gore. ``We try to keep a good sense of humor about
them,'' said Todd Webster, a campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Democratic Party has taken a page from the parody
book and brought forth several sites mocking Republicans, among
them www.MillionairesForBush.com, and has picked up some material
from a Comedy Central Web site that makes fun of Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and linked it to the party's own site (www.democrats.org).
</P>
<P>
   Even if much of the material is in jest, however, the creators
of these parody sites say their intent is serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will play a small role in the campaign because there are
many people coming to our site and who have heard what I have to
say,'' said Zack Exley, creator of the gwbush.com site, which he
says gets 300,000 to 500,000 visits a month. ``I am trying to make
some points that have not been made in the mainstream media.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a join-them-rather-than-fight-them effort, the Republican
National Committee has decided to improve its own Web site _ it has
10 percent of the 150 staff members at its headquarters devoted to
Internet campaigning _ so that voters might be more inclined to
visit the official committee site (www.rnc.org) rather than to
drift into unofficial sites.
</P>
<P>
   And the party is making banners, logos and other material
available on its site for supporters to download onto their sites.
In addition, the national party is sponsoring a workshop _
``Winning in a Web World'' _ in June to help party organizers and
grass-roots supporters with Web campaigning and design. The party
is also putting large disclaimers on material on its Web site, so
that if it is lifted by groups the party does not approve of, a
message comes up saying the Republican Party does not endorse the
content of any other Web site.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the party is asking the Commerce
Department to see whether official Web sites for federal candidates
should have a separate domain suffix _ .elect or .pol _ to
differentiate themselves from unofficial sites. This request was
made after a grass-roots site said that it was an official
Democratic site and began to collect campaign money. (The site
later disappeared.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the Web as the best campaign tool since the phone and
the television,'' said Larry Purpuro, the deputy chief of staff for
the Republican National Committee and head of its eGOP project.
``We don't see it as a foe or a threat, but as a great opportunity.
We've said, `It's digital or die.' If we don't embrace, exploit and
learn from it, we could be displaced in lots of our activities.''

NEW CHARGES IN 19-YEAR-OLD HOLLYWOOD DRUG KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Federal prosecutors have reached back to history
to revive a sensational murder case, unveiling an indictment that
alleges that a former nightclub owner, his bodyguard and a
pornography actor arranged the killings of four people in the
Hollywood Hills nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The case sounds like something out of ``L.A. Confidential,'' but
it is really more ``Boogie Nights.'' The ``Wonderland murders,''
named after the site, 4763 Wonderland Ave., where the killings took
place on July 1, 1981, proved a potent mix of seamy celebrity,
drugs and violence. The killings occurred in an era of notorious
Los Angeles criminals, including the Skid Row Slasher, the Hillside
Strangler and the Night Stalker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was dope, porn, sex and drugs and organized crime, and
John Holmes and all of these types of things that made it kind of a
draw back then,'' said Tom Lange, a retired Los Angeles police
detective who investigated the case, and who was later assigned to
the charges against O.J. Simpson. ``Perhaps things are now provable
that weren't provable years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The wide-ranging racketeering indictment unsealed on Friday
accuses Eddie Nash, a former owner of Hollywood nightclubs like the
Starwood and the Kit Kat Club whose real name is Adel Gharib
Nasrallah, of running a cocaine and heroin distribution syndicate
since the 1970s, as well as laundering money, tampering with a
juror, and witnesses and tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say that the case grew out of a separate
investigation into an Armenian crime syndicate and that it led to
renewed accusations that Nash, with his bodyguard, Gregory DeWitt
Diles, and a pornographic film star, John Curtis Holmes, carried
out the Wonderland murders.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's lawyer, Fred Rucker, did not return telephone calls. But
when Nash, appearing on a television news program two weeks ago,
was asked if he had ordered the killings, he said: ``No, I did not.
All I can say is what I've said for the last 20 years. I really did
not kill anyone or have anything to do'' with Wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes died in 1988 of an illness related to AIDS, and Diles
died in 1995. Nash, 71, was arrested at noon on Friday at his
condominium in Tarzana, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The three were tried on slaying charges and ultimately acquitted
in state court trials, the last of which was in 1991. The
prosecutors say the killings were committed in retaliation for a
break-in and drug robbery at Nash's home two nights earlier, in
which he was made to kneel and beg for his life, and Diles was
grazed by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the suspected robbers, Ronald Launius and William
Deverell, lived at the Wonderland residence and were killed there
with two women, Barbara Richardson and the owner of the home, Joy
Miller. The victims were beaten to death with lengths of pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was accused of playing a role in both crimes and being
the link between the two camps. Lange said Holmes was a drug client
and associate of Nash, and left a sliding door unlocked for the
robbers at Nash's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was believed to have figured out Holmes' role and forced
him to reveal the robbers' identities and help in the killings.
Holmes, who was staying at the Wonderland residence, was accused of
opening the door to let the killers in, and participating in the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in Nash's first trial, in 1990, deadlocked 11-1 in favor
of conviction; and the federal authorities now say that the
hold-out juror, a woman who at the time was 18 years old, was paid
a bribe on May 15, 1990, by an associate of Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Lange and another investigator, Nils Grevilius, have written a
book about the case, ``Four on the Floor,'' but it has not been
published.

 &HT;    Lottery pick helping Hawks focus on future
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About halftime of today's Eastern Conference game, a
man will start flipping the placards to tell the Hawks whether they
get their best draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   First to third probably would change the course of the
franchise. Five would be nice, and the Hawks can't slip lower than
eight.
</P>
<P>
   The team picked better than ninth only once _ and then messed
that one up with Jon Koncak in 1985. The Hawks can at least assuage
the agony of being 28-54, their worst season since they pulled out
of Milwaukee in the early '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about it is we're only looking at the top of
the draft, and it allows us to focus a lot better,'' general
manager Pete Babcock said before heading off to the studios of NBA
Entertainment in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing has 1,000 Ping-Pong balls, 250 of them marked for
the Los Angeles Clippers, who had the worst record in the league.
Next is Chicago with 200, then Orlando, from Golden State, 157;
Vancouver, 120; Atlanta, 89; Chicago, via Washington and Golden
State, 64; New Jersey, 44; Houston, 18; Orlando, from Denver, and
Boston, 9 each; Dallas, 6; and Orlando, 5.
</P>
<P>
   The draw is for the top three picks. Then, teams pick in order
of number of games lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks can't be fourth. If they draw one of the first three
positions or hold fifth, Babcock says: ``We will be pretty sure
we'll be getting someone who has a real chance to become an impact
player in this league. If it's a real young guy, it will take a
little longer, but we'll know the potential to become a big-time
player (is there), and you have to feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock isn't going to narrow his list with the draft 39 days
away. But the consensus is that Kenyon Martin, the Cincinnati
senior power forward, is the top pick, if his fractured leg is
healing without complication. Martin is an athletic player who has
developed a perimeter game.
</P>
<P>
   After Martin, Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer, LSU forward
Stromile Swift, Texas center Chris Mihm, Cincinnati swingman
DerMarr Johnson and East St. Louis prep star Darius Miles are the
top of the lottery. Remove Mihm as a candidate for the Hawks, who
don't need a center, and their options are pretty well-defined.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer isn't Martin, but he can score from the wing or take it
inside. Swift, Johnson and Miles are 6-9, all long and lanky and
all young, but they all have marvelous futures. While Johnson and
Miles will play out on the floor, Swift is a shot-blocker and an
explosive leaper who has medium range on his jumper. With his two
years of college, he should develop a little faster. Johnson is
intriguing for his ability to shoot the 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hawks slip as low as seventh or eighth, they could be
looking at UNLV's 6-5 Courtney Alexander. The best shooting guard
in the draft, Alexander often is compared _ for better and worse _
to Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Florida sophomore Michael Miller, 6-8, and Michigan State's
Morris Peterson, 6-6, would be possibilities, Miller for his
potential, Peterson for the maturity and all-around game that
helped lead Michigan State to the championship that the Gators lost
in the NCAA final. DePaul sophomore Quentin Richardson has a
lottery chance, but he is behind Miller and Peterson and is not a
good ball-handler.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE DERBY WINNERS GO NEXT By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Compared with the international glamour of the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness comes off as a family reunion, held
every year on the third Saturday in May.
</P>
<P>
   For all its quaintness, the Preakness usually has one thing the
Kentucky Derby never will have, by definition:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Derby doesn't have a Derby winner,'' said Joe Orseno, the
trainer of Red Bullet, who not only did not win the Derby but did
not even compete in it.
</P>
<P>
   This is good reasoning on Orseno's part. The Preakness is where
Derby winners generally go when facing the prospect of what to do
with the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Just such a challenge was confronting Fusaichi Pegasus on
Saturday. The Kentucky Derby winner would try to win the Preakness,
the second leg of the Triple Crown, against a small field of seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to win a second one to win a third one,'' Orseno
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The race would go a long way to prove whether Fusaichi Pegasus
was the super horse that racing needs so badly. The Derby has much
of the glitter, but the Preakness has the gritty feel of a survival
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned about bringing a horse back in two
weeks,'' said Neil Drysdale, the taciturn Englishman who trains
Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   The year's racing calendar did not begin on the morning of May
6. These eight horses have been brought along this season,
essentially getting through a demolition derby of flying hooves and
looming bodies, complicated by their own tiny and fragile bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been my theory that the Preakness is so tough
because it's the third tough race in a row, not two,'' said D.
Wayne Lukas, who has tried it every which way.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus lost his first race, then has won five
straight, including the Wood Memorial in New York on April 15. The
Preakness has its own eccentric condition of dropping back from the
Derby's distance of a mile and a quarter to a mile and
three-sixteenths _ with slightly less room to erase mistakes, to
allow true ability to assert itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to win when you're way ahead, but what if something
is off your shoulder?'' asked Bob Baffert, the trainer of Captain
Steve, with a dollop of wishful thinking. ``There's always
something you didn't expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has been down this road before. Having won both the
Derby and Preakness in 1997 with Silver Charm and in 1998 with Real
Quiet _ only to lose in the Belmont _ Baffert has felt the swell of
expectation as he arrived in Baltimore with a Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't watch a lot of sports, but I get interested during the
playoffs,'' Baffert said. ``To me, the Derby is like the start of
the playoffs. You suddenly get interested in it. After the Derby,
you start asking, `Who's this Fusaichi Pegasus? Who's this Captain
Steve?'''
</P>
<P>
   That is where they all were early Saturday, in rather soggy
Baltimore, whose mood of earnest diligence may have been enhanced
by Drysdale. The native of Surrey, England, has tossed a bit of
figurative cold water on the party here by choosing to conduct
business in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven other Preakness horses were quartered in Barn
40, only a few steps from the endless supply of coffee and
doughnuts at the hospitality tent, Drysdale opted for the drab
security of a grassless cement compound at Barn 7, behind metal
gates.
</P>
<P>
   Blandly, Drysdale insisted he knew nothing of the security
measures that had guards locking the gates early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Being so close to the nation's capital, the home office of
duplicity, the mystery of the extra security could easily be
labeled Gategate.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the odd raised eyebrow _ hard to document on the
printed page _ there was little criticism of Drysdale's antisocial
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to do what's right for the horse,'' Baffert said.
``He's got obligations to that horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert glanced around at the assembled riffraff with cameras
and notepads and said: ``We're very trusting here. I'm glad he's
not here. You'd have 100 people watching him. You look around and
you say, `Where did all these kooks come from?'''
</P>
<P>
   The kooks did not take it personally. Oh, no. Besides, anybody
who follows racing knows how precarious life can be for these
thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Lukas had Charismatic, a handsome heir of Secretariat,
barreling through the Derby and the Preakness, one of only 26
horses to win both, and coming to the Belmont to try to be the 12th
Triple Crown winner. But Charismatic broke down in the stretch, and
only an acrobatic dismounting by the gallant jockey Chris Antley
stabilized the colt and saved him for a life in the pastures. It
can happen fast.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers appreciate what they are demanding of their horses,
and sometimes they step back from the call of the Derby. Orseno
kept Red Bullet out of the Derby after a fruitless chase of
Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to ask of the horse,'' Orseno said. ``We had a
terrible ride in the Wood, which was why I held him out of the
Derby. I gave him a full week off, and he needed that week. We'd
like to have him for the rest of the year. I would have loved to
win the Derby _ but not at the horse's expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno added: ``I'm surprised there have been as many
Derby-Preakness winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 26 in the first 124 runnings of the Preakness. And on
Saturday, Fusaichi Pegasus tried to be the 27th. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You want to give him a dignified ending, offer him a
cigarette and tell him how courageously he and his men fought. Pat
Riley stares at you in disdain.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what this is about and wants no sympathy. Before it is
over, he will envision triumph and tragedy. He will even use those
words. As long as two weeks ago, when the struggle began, he knew
this day would dawn: Game 7 against the Knicks, he and his
swordsmen against the empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Gladiator, dressed in Armani armor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great, great group of guys, hard-working, good
men,'' he said of his Miami Heat. ``Are they good enough to win?
That's going to be the ultimate tragedy, if they're not. Because
they'll know they're not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolute madness,'' Riley called Game 6, minutes after Madison
Square Garden stopped shaking. The Heat having squandered a
15-point lead in the second half, he referred to the rivalry as
``one big death grip that both teams have on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before, he had taken that long, hard walk from the
court, through the tunnel, down a corridor and into the locker room
of his crestfallen team.
</P>
<P>
   His head slightly bowed after a 72-70 loss that tied the series
at three games apiece, the cameras caught something revealing: a
wry smile. He did not have a hollow, end-of-the-world look about
him. Nor did he have a deathly pallor that suggested he had had it
with this maddening game and this opponent he can't quite slay to
free himself from emotional torment.
</P>
<P>
   He is not devastated as much as he is reveling in the moment,
basking in...the pain. Riley, the masochistic loser, loving every
minute of a grueling loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was this way in New York, when Reggie Miller of the Pacers
shot the Knicks down in Game 1 of their 1995 epic, Riley's last
series on the Knicks sideline. It was this way in Game 5 last year
and in 1998, that sinking feeling that his best shot was not good
enough, that he had to start all over again and use the pain as
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Because if it hurts this bad to lose, it must feel even more
euphoric to win. Who else would use ``preordained'' and ``destiny''
for basketball? Who else would appear more haggard and battered
after a tough victory in Game 5 than an absolutely surreal collapse
in Game 6?
</P>
<P>
   Riley, with the battle of Carthage on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He will walk into his own building on Sunday, in front of 20,000
people who in their hearts cannot fathom the Heat beating the
Knicks in a deciding game on their home floor. For two seasons
running, Riley has endured his former employers putting him on
vacation early.
</P>
<P>
   All around him, Knick fans will engulf the American Airlines
Arena, the enemy invading his home. It will be loud and intense. He
knows they're coming, just as he knows this series could again come
down to one bounce, one shot, one second of desire that either
validates his stature as the greatest coach in team sports or
punctures the myth for the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the reality is probably somewhere in between. He has
turned men who should be playing pickup basketball at a community
center into solid, NBA veterans, capable of incredible things with
the game on the line. He has done so much with so little since he
left Magic and Kareem and the Showtime Lakers, that to assail his
coaching ability for not winning a title since then is almost
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   But he also stays with the same group of veterans too long,
stubbornly believing their hearts can compensate for any amount of
talent thrown at them. A part of you actually admires that about
him, the idea that he believes he can beat you with people who
simply try harder and work more, regardless of the weapons at their
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, you also wonder if anybody but him and Jeff Van
Gundy could go through this without losing their senses.
Battle-hardened by their shared history, oblivious to the madness
around them, they keep hoping beyond hope that their soldiers do
what they ask of them.
</P>
<P>
   Riley rented a theater in Boca Raton, Fla., while the Heat were
preparing for the Knicks. Together, they watched the World War II
submarine movie ``U-571.'' Riley made parallels about the movie and
his team, but there is a better one playing now.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Gladiator,'' the character played by Russell Crowe
gallantly commands the Roman Empire army until the new Caesar tries
to have him assassinated. He winds up in a faraway land and
essentially needs to kill other men for the crowd's pleasure to win
his own freedom. He fights his way back to Rome, to the original
Coliseum, and faces off against his mortal enemies, who just happen
to be his former employers. We won't ruin the end for you.
</P>
<P>
   It's on NBC at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday. Russell Crowe's wardrobe has
been upgraded. &QL;

NETS LOOKING FOR A STAR IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The odds, and their sorry luck, would tell you that
the New Jersey Nets cannot expect the Ping-Pong balls to flow their
way in Sunday's National Basketball Association draft lottery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in a season in which there are no clear-cut choices in the
draft, the Nets may find that wherever they roam through the
lottery, they may find a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the player who would probably be regarded as one of
the best is Kenyon Martin,'' general manager John Nash said of the
Cincinnati power forward. ``After that, it is a toss-up. We could
draft seventh and get a player who could be the rookie of the
year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nets could draft seventh, the spot they now hold because
they had the seventh-worst record in the league, or they could get
a lucky bounce from the Ping-Pong balls and draw one of the top
three positions. Or, if one or more of the teams behind the Nets in
the seeding moves up, the Nets could drop to eight, nine or 10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ping-Pong balls numbered 1 through 14 are placed in a drum
and then drawn in four-ball combinations with 1,001 possible
combinations. Before the draft, 1,000 combinations are assigned to
the 13 spots in the lottery with the NBA's worst team, the Los
Angeles Clippers getting 250 chances, the Chicago Bulls getting 200
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have 44 combinations. Perhaps the team that could have
the biggest day is the Orlando Magic, which has five picks with the
last spot in the lottery and two more because of trades. The Magic
inherited the third-highest slot from the Golden State Warriors,
with 157 chances, as well as the 10th slot from the Denver Nuggets,
with nine chances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will select 22nd in the first round and do not have a
second-round pick, having surrendered it to Utah. The Nets will
select No. 36 overall in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Martin are center Chris Mihm of Texas, a first-team
all-American, and 6-foot-8-inch forward Marcus Fizer of Iowa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other prospects are forward Stromile Swift of Louisiana State,
who excelled last season as a sophomore after playing only one
semester as a freshman; sophomores Mike Miller of Florida and Joel
Pryzbilla of Minnesota; Darius Miles, who spurned St. John's for a
chance at the NBA; the nation's leading scorer, shooting guard
Courtney Alexander of Fresno State; and Iakovos Tsakalidis, a
center from Greece. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island came roaring into the
race for senator from New York on Saturday, attacking Hillary
Rodham Clinton as a ``far-left, extremist'' candidate who has ``no
real rationale for serving here other than as a steppingstone to
some other position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her ambition is the issue,'' Lazio declared in an
interview, as he formally announced his candidacy in a race that
has been upended by the decision of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to step
aside for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's remarks came as Republican leaders in New York and
Washington lined up behind the candidacy of the Suffolk County
Republican, who had himself suspended his campaign last year in
deference to party leaders who wanted Giuliani as their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio announced a two-day trip around the state, an aggressive
come-out-of-the-box approach intended to discourage any other
Republicans who might be thinking about challenging him, as well as
to push the Conservative Party into falling behind his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of Lazio's comments _ he repeatedly criticized
Clinton's credentials and ideology _ suggested that the campaign,
with the change in candidate, was going to be harsh and fast-paced.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers have already begun to attack Lazio as extreme
and conservative, noting that he had supported many of the
initiatives of the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, as they
tried to discredit his candidacy before he had a chance to find his
groundings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson, responded to Lazio's
comments Saturday morning by saying: ``It sounds like the same old
negative attack politics. He hasn't even formally announced, and
already he's on the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he considered himself ``a centrist, a mainstream
Republican.'' ``We're conservative, right-of-center on budget and
tax issues, national security issues,'' he said. ``And I think
we're realistic on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his Democratic opponent as ``far left,'' adding:
``She's part of the discredited philosophy that helped lead New
York to ruin during the Cuomo years. I think we've turned the
corner and we don't want to go back to those failed days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lazio jumped at almost every opportunity to
criticize Clinton. He responded vigorously when asked if he would
make an issue out of the fact that Clinton did not live in New York
before this year, a subject that Giuliani frequently raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the real thing,'' he said. ``I don't have to try to be
someone else. I was born here. I went to school here. I fished in
these waters. I clammed in its bays. I graduated from our schools.
My children were born in New York state. I've lived here my whole
life. There will be no question of my commitment to this state.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, Clinton was hurt both by the fact that she
had never lived in the state where she wants to serve, and because
of the cloistered life she lived as a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know New York if you have bodyguards around you all
the time,'' he said. ``You've got to know what it's like to ride
the subways, to drive your own car, to buy your own gas, to buy
groceries here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people can see through who Hillary Clinton is, and
they will have a chance to know Rick Lazio as the real deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio's announcement on Long Island came as his campaign sprang
almost overnight into full life. Workers at his headquarters in
Suffolk County answered the phone ``Lazio 2000,'' early Saturday,
and Lazio's Web site urged voters to contribute money, addressing
what his aides acknowledged on Saturday was one of the more vexing
problems he faced in his contest against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Newly hired staff members flew up from Washington, with a
notable representation from the presidential campaign of Lamar
Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee. That is because
Lazio's media adviser, Michael Murphy, performed the same role for
Alexander in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lazio campaign staff struggled through a chaotic
morning, as they grappled with such questions as which town Lazio's
headquarters was located in (Bay Shore) and the area code (631),
from an onslaught of news media that abandoned Giuliani at City
Hall for Lazio's headquarters on Long Island with startling speed.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers and state Republican leaders, concerned that
Giuliani's prolonged exit had dealt Clinton a strong early
advantage, moved to tap down even the most remote prospect that
Lazio would face any competition for the party's nomination.
``There is no question Lazio will be the candidate,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Across New York state, Republican leaders fell in line with Gov.
George Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers,
and proclaimed not only their support for Lazio but also their
belief that he would prove to be a formidable opponent to Clinton,
despite the obvious obstacles he faces now. (Some Republicans went
so far as to privately suggest that he was a better candidate than
Giuliani would have been.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The race at the end of the day is going to be about who best
can serve New York, and based on his record in Congress, it's
clearly going to be him,'' said Zenia Mucha, the chief political
aide to Pataki. She said that Lazio ``understands what it means to
be a New Yorker. She's in the process of learning. His basic
philosophy is a smaller role of government for the people. Her
basic philosophy is that government has all the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King of Long Island, bowing to this reality, withdrew
from seeking the Republican nomination. He said Saturday morning
that he did not want to cause any division within the Republican
party, and mentioned Pataki's enthusiastic endorsement of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's circles on Saturday, the debate was not over
whether the candidate should attack Lazio, but when. Unlike
Giuliani, Lazio is barely known to most New Yorkers, so the
immediate struggle is a race to see which side succeeds in defining
Lazio first _ both in remarks on the campaign trail and in
television advertisements _ over the next few weeks. All of this
suggests that this campaign will, in fact, be harsher and more
pointed than the Clinton-Giuliani race ever had a chance to become.
</P>
<P>
   There was definite worry in Republican circles that Lazio would
have been a stronger candidate had he had an earlier start, which
would have allowed him more time to raise money, get the experience
he needs to run a race, and become better known to New Yorkers.
Republicans, though, emphasized repeatedly that Lazio would be a
strong candidate, because he appeared to have a hunger for the job
that Giuliani never evinced, and also because Lazio was more in
tune with Republican positions on issues.

RALLYING AROUND THE MOMENTUM: KNICKS' COMEBACK HAS HEAT REELING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since April 9, some odd force seemed to be working to accomplish
payback for the Miami Heat. After being eliminated from the
playoffs the last two seasons by the Knicks, including last year's
heart-wrenching first-round loss on Allan Houston's short jumper
with 0.8 seconds left in the final game, the Heat seemed destined
for retribution.
</P>
<P>
   There was Tim Hardaway's wild and desperate 3-point heave that
beat the buzzer and gave Miami a 95-94 overtime victory over the
Knicks, in that April 9 game, in the teams' final regular-season
meeting. There was Anthony Carter's game-winning runner that the
Knicks thought flew over the top of the backboard; it bounced high
off the rim and sank into the net to end Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   There was Dan Majerle's resurrection from the offensively dead
in Miami's Game 5 victory, when he somehow managed to outplay
Houston and squeeze 16 points out of his battle-worn, 34-year-old
body.
</P>
<P>
   And, Friday night, there was the seemingly insurmountable
18-point second-quarter lead the Heat built over the Knicks in
what, until the final seconds, looked like a sure series-clinching,
demon-exorcising victory at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as the teams prepare for a decisive Game 7 Sunday at
American Airlines Arena in Miami, the force seems to have switched
sides and handed the momentum to the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the Knicks' comeback from a 45-30 halftime
deficit in Game 6? How else to explain the fact that they never
took a second-half lead until Houston scored the game's final
points, on free throws, with 17.6 seconds left, in the Knicks'
72-70 victory?
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the Knicks, a small team with poor
rebounding figures all season, outrebounding the rugged Heat on
Friday after being destroyed on the backboards in each of the first
five games?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolute madness,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, man, just amazing,'' Heat center Alonzo Mourning
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat is surely kicking itself for allowing the Knicks to
rally and win and, even though Game 7 is on Miami's home court, its
psyche has to be battered, just as the Knicks' mind-set must be
cocksure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of life in us,'' said Knicks center Patrick
Ewing, who played tremendously in recording 15 points and 18
rebounds in Game 6. ``We feel good. To come this far and lose on
Sunday, that's not what it's all about. We could be on vacation
right now, but there is still life in us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the victory seemed to add another marvelous chapter to the
Knicks' postseason domination of the Heat, a coach, Jeff Van Gundy,
warned against putting the comeback in the history books next to
Larry Johnson's 4-point play last year and Willis Reed's limping
entrance on the Garden court in 1970 just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great, great comeback,'' Van Gundy said. ``But we
need to win the series. The only thing that makes it really
memorable is if it leads to a series win.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Knicks have the edge in Game 7 in that they are
coming off a remarkable come-from-behind victory, but they also
have history on their side. They have defeated the Heat the past
two seasons by winning decisive games on Miami's home floor. In
fact, the Knicks have won five of their last nine playoff games in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There are obstacles, however. The Knicks, who lost the teams'
only Game 7 meeting in 1997, will have to break a streak that dates
to 1998. Over the clubs' last 11 playoff contests, neither team has
won back-to-back games. But if they can overcome an 18-point
deficit while facing elimination, can't the Knicks overcome
anything the Heat has on its side?
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks believe so, and it was that type of positive thinking
that led them to rally after the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them that we picked the most inopportune time to
play the worst half we played all year,'' Van Gundy said, recalling
his halftime speech. ``I told them that they were going to be part
of the best comeback in their playoff lives, and that if they
didn't believe that to stay in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, perhaps, by Van Gundy's words, the Knicks charged on
the Garden floor with renewed vigor, outscoring the Heat by 13-3
over the first four minutes of the third quarter to quickly put
themselves back in contention. Then, big fourth-quarter
performances by Houston (7 points), Ewing (4 points, two rebounds)
and Chris Childs (4 points, two assists) enabled the Knicks to pull
it off.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who scored 14 of his team-high 21 points in the second
half, said the Knicks will carry the same positive thinking into
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no room, there's no time to have negative thoughts in
your head,'' he said. ``There's no time to look down or look behind
you, and I mean, that's what this team is made of. It's made up of
a lot of character. The bottom line is we have it in us. And I
think it will give us momentum going into Sunday, because we know
what we have to do.''

   DYING-HEARTLAND _ LEBANON, Kansas _ As the clock strikes 3, the

through Friday, a dozen of them gather around two kitchen tables by
the window to discuss the world's problems, and their own. Their
small town is withering away. And these genteel women, many of them
farm widows, are a living testament to this unhappy trend. Across
Smith County, Kansas, and indeed throughout rural America, a

   GEORGIA-GOP _ As GOP activists hold their last statewide meeting

Republicans put forth for governor when Democrat Roy Barnes runs
for re-election? Some of the possible Republican candidates - Linda
Schrenko, John Oxendine - will be working the delegates this

<P>
   BARNES-BLINDTRUST _ Another look at Barnes' blind trust and his
efforts to avoid filing a complete financial disclosure. Barnes'
lawyer has stepped up the lobbying of Attorney General Thurbert
Baker, strongly criticizing an analysis of the financial disclosure
law by Teddy Lee of the state Ethics Commission. Baker is expected
to issue an opinion on the issue by late this week. Many observers
expect Baker to rule that Barnes has to file a full disclosure; the
law does not take into account blind trusts. Former Gov. Joe Frank
Harris had a blind trust until the current disclosure law took
effect. He then dissolved the trust and complied with the law.

life from life everlasting,'' she says in a scene that defines the

SPORTS COLUMN: JULIE KRONE'S RACE AGAINST DEPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Down the black hole of Julie Krone's depression four
years ago slipped her career, marriage, friends, even the
thoroughbred racers she once drove with flicks of her powerful
little hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses felt my anxiety, they got weird, they reared up,'' she
said last week in a torrent of memory. ``I had been given a magical
talent to positive-image a loser right into the winner's circle. I
had been possessed; I could pick a horse up with my will and put it
right down in front. And then suddenly it was all gone, and I was
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The magic eventually returned; three weeks ago, Krone became the
first woman rider elected to racing's Hall of Fame. She ``takes the
pioneer responsibility with pride,'' which is a reason, she said,
for also becoming the first major athlete in any sport to speak so
publicly and openly about mental illness, psychotherapy and
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little boy once came up to me at the track and asked to hold
my goggles,'' she said, ``and then he looked up at me and said, `I
want to be like you when I grow up.' A boy said that. A boy! What a
feeling of touching people. And then, after I first talked publicly
about being suicidal and how the medicine made me feel like me
again, I got calls and e-mails from people who said I'd given them
hope to keep living.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that's why I'm doing this.'' Her blue eyes suddenly
widened, the sharp features scrunched and she unleashed the
munchkin cackle. ``And the drug company's paying me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the American Psychiatric Association's annual
meeting here, Krone was the star of a provocative symposium on
psychiatric drugs and athletes sponsored by the International
Society for Sport Psychiatry, which will be covered in a future
column, along with your own responses to this subject posted to
thelipsite(at)aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, happy in the limelight again, vividly described the
painful dilemma of elite athletes whose socialization makes them
hesitant to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she resisted therapy even after anxiety attacks,
migraines, sleep and eating disorders had turned her into a recluse
and a loser. She resisted medicine even longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a jock,'' she said. ``I can do anything on my own. I
thought it was humiliating to get help. Meanwhile, the only real
relief I felt was planning my suicide. I saved sleeping pills, but
I was going to drink alcohol, slit my wrists and maybe hang myself,
too. I wanted to do one thing right.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone, 36, had done a lot of things right from the age of 15,
when she first began a 19-year professional riding career that took
her to the winner's circle 3,545 times until she retired last year.
She won $81 million, 16th on the career earnings list. She was the
only female jockey to win a Triple Crown race, the Belmont Stakes
in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, at Saratoga, she sustained the most horrendous and
spectacular of a number of spills. A collision threw her under the
hooves of the pack. Her heart was bruised when a horse kicked her
chest and her right ankle needed to be rebuilt with two plates and
14 screws.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that's when the depression started, but, no, I
was like, `Wow, look at those X-rays, when can I get back?''' she
said, posting in the restaurant banquette as if she were parading
the paddock. ``And it was a nightmarish hospital stay; the screw
was sticking out of the ankle, right here,'' she said, pulling off
her shoe as she raised her leg above her salad, ``and that's how
strong I was, back at Belmont in the fall, overcompensating for the
tentativeness that usually comes after a bad spill.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lurking darkness was moving in. As she would learn three
years later when post-traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed, the
real trauma was not about blood and broken bones but about
``childhood issues, traumatic in themselves, that I'm just not
comfortable talking about right now because it would hurt other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 13, 1996, she was tied for leading rider at Gulfstream
Park when her horse broke down in the middle of a race and pitched
her off. Rolling on the turf, she covered her head with her hands,
which were broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fried me,'' she said. ``I couldn't talk. The straw didn't
break the camel's back; it gutted the sucker, left the camel for
dead. I was numb, couldn't think. I was afraid of horses, hated
riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband said: `Get back in there, you're tough. That's what
I love in you,' which is about the worst thing the closest person
can say to someone who is depressed. And typical.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, she was back in there, but her mending hands
were on fire and her brain was feverish with flashbacks and fears.
Walking to the barns she imagined her execution. When she vomited
before she rode, it was anxiety, not weight control (at 4 feet 10
inches and 100 pounds, she has never had typical jockey's weight
problems.) She heard voices telling her she was going to fall off,
die, mess up, which she often did, her nerve and authority gone.
She was afraid to ride the rail, to be in the middle of the pack,
to take bold risks.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers pulled her off longtime mounts. To keep working, she
rode 30-1 shots in bush-league tracks against jockeys she once
could beat in her sleep, and lost because she held back. Other
jockeys called her ``chicken'' and told her to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It was an almost casual encounter with an old friend that
summer, a racing fan with a psychiatric practice in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., that began her healing process. She was shambling
across the backstretch after another loss, her signature bopping
bounce long gone, when Dr. Tom Qualtere invited her to come talk to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Krone describes that night's two-hour session as ``an emotional
purge.'' She said, ``I felt full and empty at the same time, joyful
and like I was peeling off my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   She began seeing Qualtere four times a week, eventually driving
from Belmont to Saratoga. But she rejected his suggestion that she
try a psychiatric drug. Talking to a shrink, she felt then, was
enough of an admission of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Krone's description of her early therapy is a high-spirited
chattering that includes comic riffs on the joys and frustrations
of erotic transference along with a remarkably bold willingness to
use the term ``mental illness,'' which is extremely rare among
athletes. When she moved to central New Jersey two years ago and
could no longer make the frequent trip to Saratoga, she picked a
Red Bank, N.J., psychiatrist, Dr. Furey A. Lerro, off the Internet,
because his first name was the same as a horse she liked. It was
Lerro who put her on antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked Zoloft,'' he said, ``because some of the others take
longer to clear from the body, not good if she had a reaction while
racing, and the tendency to sedation, which is also not good for a
jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Pfizer, the makers of Zoloft , were on hand
last week, and confirmed that Krone, while not a consultant, did
receive money from the company to discuss her experiences.
</P>
<P>
   According to Krone, she felt manic the first three days on the
drug, then suddenly felt ``anchored, back to Julie Krone again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sorry I didn't start the medicine sooner _ I needed to
first get to a place in talk therapy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``You don't fully realize how weird it was until you
have yourself back. I'd been spending the minutes before a race
using all my energy to defeat an anxiety attack, and now, well,
listen to this. At the end of last year, in a 60-day period, my
mother died, I got divorced and I moved to California. And I'm
here, I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Krone, a racing analyst for TVG in Los Angeles, is
taking psychology courses with a view of becoming a therapist. She
expects to continue her paid campaign to demystify therapy and
drugs for athlete and nonathlete. But on Aug. 7, when she is
formally inducted into the Hall of Fame, she will not discuss
depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really cares,'' she said. ``It's horse racing.''

 &HT;    Attorney for Davidians well connected with Washington leadership
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Mike Caddell's commute to work takes all of a
couple of minutes, if the signal light is working.
</P>
<P>
   He lives at the Four Seasons, one of Houston's premier hotels.
His law firm across the street occupies a corner of the 10th floor
at Park Shops Mall, with a luxury-suite view of Enron Field, the
Astros' new ballpark, and sports a gallery for the art collection
of Caddell and his wife, Cynthia Chapman, a partner in Caddell &AMP;
Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
hugs a wall outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell has been invited to the White House almost a dozen times
in the '90s because of his status as a major donor to the
Democratic Party. In 1996, for example, Caddell gave $111,000 to
the Clinton-Gore ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up on a counter underneath the portrait are stacks of
bound documents, part of the discovery for next month's
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians.
Evidence in the case is stored wherever space can be found. It's
even on exhibit on the floor of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, a rich insider, is the lead plaintiffs' attorney in the
lawsuit against the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason we've been successful so far is because we are
different from most people pressing this issue,'' said Caddell, 45.
``We are the establishment in many respects. We have credibility.
We have resources. We're not on the fringe. We're not willing to
pursue outrageous allegations. People have been willing to give
this case a second look because we're involved. We're not cause
lawyers running from one cause to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees no conflict in suing the administration of a president
he helped elect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the popular belief of some people, I've never seen
a shred of evidence that Bill Clinton had any significant
involvement in what happened at Mount Carmel,'' Caddell said.
``Everything we've seen clearly shows the decision-making centered
in the FBI leadership and, ultimately, with Janet Reno. I don't
have a problem going after Reno. I think history will show that
she's one of the worst attorney generals the United States ever
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, lean and with a frat boy's disarming confidence,
strolled through an office of gleaming cherrywood paneling and
granite countertops. He wore faded jeans, a longsleeve blue-striped
shirt and black boots.
</P>
<P>
   A month before trial, he sat behind his desk. He was relaxed and
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take this case to make a political statement,''
Caddell said. ``Our goal is to win the lawsuit. If we win, that
will be a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he rejected the notion that the $675 million lawsuit is
about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never been a case about money,'' Caddell said. ``It's
a case about justice. Everyone will tell you that if you were in it
for the money, the last thing you would do is take this case. That
either makes me incredibly stupid, which I'm not, or principled
about why we took the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many attorneys wanted much to do with the Davidians'
lawsuit, said Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who represented David
Koresh during the 1993 siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the tar baby,'' DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin and Jack Zimmerman, the Houston attorney who
represented Koresh's top lieutenant, Steve Schneider, urged Caddell
to take the case after 76 bodies were pulled from the ashes of
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was up and coming,'' DeGuerin said. ``His vigor impressed
me. Suing for damages is unpopular. You can't just be looking for
money. You've got to be willing to fight and to stay with it
despite setbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said his impression of what happened at Mount Carmel
hasn't changed since he watched on TV as government tanks poked
holes in Mount Carmel, supposedly to create escape routes for
Davidians, then a deadly fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, 'This didn't have to happen this way,'''
Caddell said. ``I've done close to 200 depositions, looked at
hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, hired a ton of experts
and spent millions of dollars in time and money. I'm still at the
same place. People died who didn't have to die, and the government
has some responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Houston attorney said Caddell is a natural to try
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a Republican power broker you can say is trying to
embarrass the president,'' said the attorney, who asked not to be
named. ``Had he not filed this lawsuit, he may have been in line
for some sort of political appointment. His political donations
have been generous. The point is he's independent. He took this
case because he thought the government screwed up. And, frankly, I
can't think of many other lawyers who could afford to take on the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   His out-of-pocket expenses in the case are now more than $1
million, Caddell said. He laughs at the notion he's kept pace with
the government's spending, noting it brought nine attorneys to Waco
in April for a hearing on his request that the government be
sanctioned for allegedly tampering with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Microsoft versus the Justice Department,'' Caddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina attorney Kirk Lyons nonetheless credits Caddell
for ``putting his pocket book where his principles are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there when the government dumped 100,000 documents on
them,'' Lyons said. ``By now, I'm sure his firm has got everything
catalogued and stored where they can retrieve it. In my office,
there would be eight inches of dust on it. He's been able to keep
up with the government on what so far has been a pleadings war.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons works for the Southern Legal Resource Center, a right-wing
civil liberties group criticized in the past for defending Klan
members. He also represents several Davidians, such as Misty
Ferguson, who was badly burned in the Mount Carmel fire. Caddell
will argue on behalf of Lyons' clients at the June 19 trial in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be uncomfortable with some of the things said about us,
but he's never been anything but professional,'' Lyons said. ``He
makes the call but we're not left out of the consultation. It's a
smart thing to do. We all have to share responsibility for the
decisions made.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said he's had to defend Caddell to many of his friends,
who are uncomfortable with Caddell's slick image.
</P>
<P>
   One is Davidian Clive Doyle. Doyle, earnest in a ready-made
suit, confronted Caddell, cool in a bomber jacket and shades, after
the Mount Carmel re-creation in March. Doyle accused Caddell of
selling out the Davidians by agreeing to the re-creation and by
stating the Davidians must share part of the blame for what
happened at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his interests are with Clinton, the government,''
Doyle said last week. ``I hear all these things about how much he's
given Clinton and the Democratic Party. I feel he is
compromised.... I feel his interest is not in the survivors or the
families who lost loved ones. He is interested in serving his own
ends, more or less.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons believes people misunderstand Caddell's approach to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people disagree with Mike,'' Lyons said. ``They say
there is no bottom line. We've got to find out what happened. But
if the government scoots out of this without paying a dime, they've
won. That's what Mike means. People can pick on my background, too.
Mike might be an unlikely choice to lead this team, but thank God
he is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Caddell's critics _ at least his southern-fried ones _
have more in common with him than they realize. Caddell, born in
Del Rio, Texas, grew up primarily in Alabama and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get tired or have had too much to drink, like a lot of
people I slip into old habits,'' Caddell said. ``That's when you
can hear my Alabama accent.''
</P>
<P>
   His Southern Baptist roots initially pulled him toward a career
in preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mom (Joyce) said he was the smoothest talker she ever
met,'' said his wife, Chapman, co-counsel on the Davidian case.
``She said he had a silver tongue and could pretty much talk them
into anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Virginia, however, Caddell decided his
calling was the law. And Houston was the altar where he wanted to
practice it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning attorneys in New York and Los Angeles carried
briefcases for someone else,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston in 1979 was a mecca for trial attorneys. Leon Jaworski
(a Baylor Law School graduate) was only a few years removed from
being the Watergate prosecutor. Percy Foreman had retired but was
still around. Racehorse Haynes was dominating national headlines,
first with the John Hill murder trial, then the Cullen Davis murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston was and is a great place for trial lawyers,'' Caddell
said. ``It's a place where trying cases is considered an art.
People have great respect for trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell tried or settled 30 cases in his first five years in
Houston. His conviction was for civil law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to represent the good guys,'' Caddell said. ``I can't
represent a client I don't believe in. I can't convince a judge or
jury of something I'm not convinced of.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened his own firm in 1985 and subsequently won a series of
high-profile, big-money cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Caddell led a group of attorneys who won the largest
property damage class-action settlement in U.S. history. They sued
Shell Oil Co. and two other corporations for producing polybutylene
pipes that sprang leaks when exposed to tap water chemicals such as
chlorine. The settlement was for $1 billion.Last year, a month
after Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco refused to grant the
government a summary judgment and set a trial date for the Branch
Davidian's wrongful-death lawsuit, Caddell's firm won a $30 million
settlement against a New York apparel maker. A van driven by a
company employee crashed in Mexico and killed 14 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make any apologies at being good at what I do,''
Caddell said. ``We work extremely hard here. We're honest. Ethical.
Smart. We take on cases we believe in. By and large, we're
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few months, Caddell estimates he's averaged working
12 hours a day. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, I got on a flight from Houston at 7 a.m.,'' Caddell
said. ``I got back to Houston at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman stuck her head in the door to tell Caddell a mutual
friend was leaving a Houston law office to start his own firm.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell suggested his wife call and invite him to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Thursday?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in San Antonio,'' Chapman said. ``How about Friday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in Mexico,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   They finally picked a day the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only day we'll be in town,'' Chapman said, leaving.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason he and his family live in a hotel,
Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably out of town 50 percent of the time,'' he said.
``This way, it's easy to come and go. I like living downtown. It's
a short commute to work. Cynthia and I love to go to the opera, the
ballet, the theater, the symphony. Plus, it's great for our little
boy (John Chapman). He comes and visits us every afternoon. I've
walked over to the new stadium with him on my shoulders a couple of
times. That was great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of his son, 2, take top billing over photos of
people like former governor Ann Richards in Caddell's office. Like
many people, Caddell finds the kids at Mount Carmel the most
sympathetic victims in the wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't call a 2-year-old a Davidian,'' Caddell said. ``No
2-year-old carried a weapon on Feb. 28. No 2-year-old converted a
semi-automatic to a fully automatic weapon. And no 2-year-old
helped start a fire on April 19. I don't see how the government can
say it's not partly responsible for the death of those children.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked while skimming legal documents, scribbling notes on
Post-its and giving directions to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to be able to dual-process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said her husband is unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's the best briefer or the best researcher,
but there's no one like him in the courtroom,'' she said. ``No one
is as good on their feet. He loves that. He loves being tossed
things that he's not expecting. I've never seen anyone as
accurately impeach a witness _ in a nice way, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   His love of challenges has been tested. Judge Smith recently
denied Caddell's request for sanctions against the government, and
a company retained by the court stated it believes the flashes in
the infrared tape taken at Mount Carmel are not gunfire. Plaintiffs
argue that government gunfire kept many Davidians from fleeing
their burning building.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell shrugged off the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like where we are,'' Caddell said. ``The two issues I felt
most strongly about that day I watched the fire, the failure to
have firefighting equipment available and knocking the building
down, we have better evidence on than I could have hoped for. We
have a smoking-gun document where (Jeffrey) Jamar and (Dick) Rogers
said there would be no plan to fight a fire. That's inconceivable.
We've also got the medal commendations (for tank drivers) submitted
by Jamar and Rogers. It says in mid-morning the tank drivers were
instructed to begin the systematic demolition of the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell paused to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as good as it gets,'' he said.

 &HT;    Millions of dollars spent preparing for Davidian wrongful death
trial
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A lot of money has already been put on the line
before next month's trial in Waco on the $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians against
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, the lead plaintiffs attorney,
estimates that his involvement in the case has cost him $4 million
in time and more than $1 million out of his pocket. Although Jim
Brannon, also a Houston attorney, and former U.S. attorney general
Ramsey Clark represent clients in the case, it's fallen on Caddell
to do the brunt of the plaintiffs' investigation in order to
prepare for the June 19 trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not gotten a penny from anyone,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said there's no
estimate yet on what it's cost the government to defend itself
against the Davidian lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not come across anyone who indicates they've compiled a
dollar amount on the cost at this point,'' Marlin said. ``It is not
something we normally do during a civil case.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt, however, the government is sparing little
expense to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mount Carmel re-creation in March at Fort Hood, for
example, an FBI jet was dispatched to Florida to pick up lawyers
and public relations staff. The government had 21 people in
Killeen. Caddell had three. And at the April 24 hearing on
Caddell's motion that the government be sanctioned for allegedly
tampering with evidence, there were nine government attorneys in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has given Special Counsel John Danforth
$10.7 million to investigate the FBI, prompted by the revelation
the agency used pyrotechnic tear gas at Mount Carmel. Danforth's
budget includes $2.2 million for travel and almost $1 million to
lease office space.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he knew the Davidian case would be costly to bring
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in put up or shut up,'' Caddell said. ``We were
the only ones willing to finance an investigation to get at the
truth. When I got into this case, it became apparent that the
government is accustomed to bulldozing lawyers pursuing claims
against it. They're not accustomed to dealing with people who have
the resources we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The $675 million amount asked for by the plaintiffs was figured
using ``an abundance of caution,'' according to Caddell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get to the end of the day and you haven't asked for
enough, you're stuck,'' Caddell said. ``So what happens is you ask
for very large sums that you never expect to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether such an amount represents justice or justice run amok
depends on your perspective, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country, we say if you play basketball and you're
Michael Jordan, you're worth $35 million a year,'' Caddell said.
``We routinely pay baseball players $10 million a year. What's the
life of a child worth? What should you pay for the pain and
suffering of letting a child burn to death?''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell declined to reveal his fee in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is going to begrudge us our fee,''
Caddell said. ``We will have earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plaintiffs should win damages at the upcoming trial, the
money will not come specifically from the agencies being sued: the
FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin said the government has a fund set aside for judgments
against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the unlikely event that the government was found liable,
any funds would be paid out of the government judgment fund,''
Marlin said. ``It's used to pay judgments against the government
for negligence and wrongdoing.''

 &HT;    MOCK BIOLOGICAL WARFARE ATTACK BEGINS IN DENVER
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. _ ``Virtual patients'' began reporting to
Denver-area hospitals Saturday as a multi-agency mock biological
warfare drill got underway to test the ability of public health and
law enforcement agencies to respond to a real world attack.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, announced in advance, is to last 10 days and
involve not only local hospitals, mayors and police but top federal
officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno and other members
of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered by Congress, the bio-terrorism ``attack'' in Denver
coincided with a mock chemical warfare attack in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) and other agencies sent participants to
both the exercise here and the chemical weapons walk-through in
Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drill _ being called ``TOPOFF,'' for Top Officials
_ was known in advance, participants were not aware of its scope
and were not told the details. As of Saturday afternoon, for
example, public health officials still had not determined what
``disease'' had caused patients to appear in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the surprise factor, organizers of the drill hoped it
would identify weak points in the government's ability to respond
to an attack, said spokesmen for agencies involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the exercise is to assess the nation's crisis and
consequence management capacity under extraordinarily stressful
conditions,'' said Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver FBI official told reporters covering the $3.5 million
simulated bio-terrorism attack here that because of ``simulated
intelligence,'' the bureau already had information of terrorist
activity in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FBI said, it had identified and taped off a
``crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides several dozen reporters who came to cover the exercise,
officials were having to accommodate inquiries from ``virtual''
news media and a Federal Emergency Management Agency press officer
had to first determine whether a reporter's questions Saturday were
authentic or were part of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you real world media, or are you from VNN?'' the press
officer asked. VNN, he said, stood for ``Virtual News Network.''
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, exercise organizers used a concoction made of
garlic and Gatorade to spread a foul-smelling, ``chemical warfare''
cloud over the start of a make-believe charity foot race.
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said that because public health
agencies in various parts of the country vary greatly in their
ability to respond to a biological terrorism attack, the outcome of
the Denver exercise _ ``good or bad'' _ will not reflect the
overall level of preparedness of the U.S. public health system.
</P>
<P>
   State and local public health officials have complained that
many areas are poorly equipped and trained for dealing with a germ
warfare attack, even though they will be the first line of defense,
along with hospitals and local physicians.
</P>
<P>
   CDC has a five-year program aimed at getting the nation's public
health system in shape to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The drill has not been without its critics. Some said it was
unrealistic to stage simultaneous chemical and biological terrorism
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Following the August, 1998, bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, U.S. officials including President Clinton have said
terrorist organizations such as that headed by as Saudi exile Osama
bin Laden were trying to acquire biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent cruise missiles to attack a plant in
Sudan, where Clinton said bin Laden was trying to develop germ
warfare weapons.
</P>
<P>
   . In congressional testimony in March, CIA Director George Tenet
said terrorist organizations pose major threats to U.S. security.

 &HT;    Genial Rocker works crowd
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Instead of the St. Bernard-called-to-dinner dash with
which he usually bolts for the pitcher's mound, he slipped through
a pair of blue curtains and waved almost shyly.
</P>
<P>
   There were no 98-mph fastballs unleashed, no nervous facial
twitches. Just countless autographs obligingly signed and one very
broad grin for a little boy who asked about his silver Corvette
parked outside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the insults were different for John Rocker Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's tall and handsome,'' podiatrist Gabe Borchardt
sighed, midway through the controversial Braves reliever's hourlong
appearance at the B.P. Sports Collectible show. ``Why can't he be
short and ugly like the rest of us?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rocker has been a special case ever since he insulted
foreigners, gays and New Yorkers in an interview with Sports
Illustrated last December. Since a season-starting two-week
suspension ended, he's collected 10 saves and a lot of fan support
at Turner Field, but he's also had at least one minor run-in with
media in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   So who could blame hundreds for showing up for his first public
appearance this season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of get a kick out of him,'' admitted Bill Wolfe, 50, a
noise pollution consultant who got autographs for himself, his
father and father-in-law. ``He's half my age and I wouldn't want to
be held accountable for everything I said half a life ago. Plus,
he's a hell of a ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   While largely non-minority in nature, the crowd was a diverse
blend of Braves fans, baseball lovers who'd come to get Rafael
Furcal's or Tony Perez's autographs and figured ``Oh, what the
heck,'' and curiosity seekers. Some who were there to see other
players had no interest in seeing Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people like to be in the middle of
controversy,'' said Erin Hynek, 28, who clearly had other
motivations Saturday. Hynek and friend Jennifer Kinard arrived 2
1/2 hours early (``We're autograph amateurs,'' Kinard laughed),
carrying their hard-to-find Rocker game jerseys to be autographed
at $35-a-pop, and an obvious thing for the big guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the girls who scream `We love you' from the top of the
bullpen,'' Kinard told Rocker later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that,'' Rocker grinned. ``Will you be there
tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   He even handled the tougher stuff, which _ while hardly rising
(or sinking) to the level of Shea Stadium insults _ including
agreeing to autograph the infamous Sports Illustrated issue and
politely refusing to inscribe ``Kiss my butt'' on a mini-Braves
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he might have a good sense of humor and say `yes',''
the requester, Russell Nicometi, 23, said afterward. ``But at least
he smiled at me.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least he didn't bite the head off a reporter who ventured
one question _ how long can you sign and still pitch effectively?
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hours, 18 minutes,'' Rocker joked with a small smile.
``Three hours, 19 minutes and it totally affects my pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Give that guy another save.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Rudolph Giuliani quit the mayoralty tomorrow, he
would leave behind a city that is safer and more prosperous than it
was when he took over City Hall in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A solid legacy, but a narrow one, especially since New York
City's prosperity is linked closely to the thriving national
economy and crime is down all over the Giuliani-less country. And
the mayor's image is marred by a reputation for insensitivity,
especially racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   So it makes perfect sense that Giuliani wants to devote the next
year and a half to being ``a better mayor,'' as he said on Friday
when he withdrew from the Senate race _ to build on his successes
and knock down the barriers he concedes he may have erected between
his administration and many minority New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   If revising his legacy is indeed the objective of the newly
introspective-sounding mayor, the issues are out there waiting for
him. He faces the skepticism of people who have heard similar
commitments from him before, only to see them go nowhere. He may
also find that he gets less attention than he used to. Nothing
collapses as quickly as the prominence of a politician about to
lose his platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares what he says?'' asked H. Carl McCall, the state
comptroller and likely candidate for governor. ``He's a lame duck.
He's on his way out. People are going to focus on the Senate race
and who is going to be the next mayor. If he'd done this two or
three years ago, fine, but he has already put his mark on
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller recalled the mayor's pledge to reach out to
minorities when he was running for re-election in 1997. He did not
do so for a year, until Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African
immigrant, was killed by police officers. Then he met with McCall
and others. ``Then I never heard from him again,'' McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani still has 19 months in office. His health allowing,
he can do a lot even if hampered by skepticism and the dimming of
the spotlight. There is everything from the symbolic _ removing all
those barricades around City Hall before the next mayor does _ to
matters as complex as expanding health insurance coverage, a new
Giuliani goal.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues have been pending a long time. One of the most
problematic for this mayor has been improving relations between the
Police Department and minority groups in the city, especially in
the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Diallo and Patrick M.
Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote to him last week, said this is the time to drop his
opposition to the independent police board,'' said Peter F.
Vallone, the Council speaker. ``That would be great not only for
the future of the city, but would have a strong impact on the city
right now.'' Creating an oversight board might also be a way of
responding to a recent report by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,
which accuses the police of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   But the police commissioner, Howard Safir, rebuffed Vallone last
week, and the speaker has yet to hear from the mayor, who is still
fighting his idea in court.
</P>
<P>
   Many other matters are before the mayor now, especially one that
always tops the list of issues people care about in public opinion
polls: education.
</P>
<P>
   The city's contract with the United Federation of Teachers is in
negotiation, as are all municipal union contracts. The mayor has
focused on a merit pay plan for teachers _ rewarding individual
teachers with bonuses tied to higher student test scores. That is
anathema to the teachers' union, which considers merit pay divisive
and subjective. Nobody familiar with the powerful teachers' union
gives the idea a realistic chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say, `I'd like individual merit pay, but I know it's a
nonstarter, so let's come together on a group plan,''' suggested
Mark Green, the public advocate, referring to merit pay for the
faculties of entire schools rather than for individual teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor could also call for reduced class sizes and find the
financial resources to make that possible _ dropping his proposal
to cut the income tax surcharge and dedicating the income to
schools, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   He has often said he wants to eliminate the Board of Education;
so does Vallone. Both want the school system to be under direct
city control. The two could lobby for change in Albany, on schools
and on another central issue _ getting the state Legislature to
raise New York City's debt limit so the city can borrow more. If it
cannot, projects like construction of schools are in trouble. ``Now
that he no longer has to worry what they think of him in Syracuse
and Buffalo, he could do more; he's never been up there with me,''
Vallone said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said on Friday that he had become more sensitive to the
importance of extending health insurance to more people. That is
not exclusively a city issue. But the mayor could channel more city
money to the municipal hospitals, the health refuge of many poor
uninsured New Yorkers. The hospitals have lost a great deal of city
financing in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   He could mobilize city agencies to encourage more people to
enroll in a newly expanded state program for low-income New Yorkers
_ Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus. Health care experts
estimate that a half-million city residents are eligible but
unenrolled.
</P>
<P>
   As he reconsiders his mayoralty, Giuliani might look again at
his policy requiring single homeless adults to work in exchange for
shelter. That was shot down by a Supreme Court judge but the
decision is now on appeal by the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also still planning to deny shelter to parents who
do not comply with city requirements _ participating in workfare,
for instance; their children would go into foster care if shelter
were denied. That plan is on hold, pending court action, but is
still official city policy.
</P>
<P>
   These approaches have led to broad criticism, and to
Leno-Letterman caricatures of a heartless mayor. Giuliani strongly
defended his homeless policies as recently as three nights ago,
during a nationally televised town hall meeting. He told his
questioner, Andrea Mitchell, that encouraging dependency was cruel,
while encouraging independence was humane _ long his approach to
welfare and homeless issues.
</P>
<P>
   Other elected officials say they doubt that the mayor's plan to
govern differently means that he is prepared to change his
ideology, but just his public temperament. That alone can make a
difference. Green, the public advocate, who has been the target of
Giuliani's disdain, noted, with amazement in his voice, that when
he called the mayor after Giuliani dropped his Senate candidacy,
the mayor took his call. ``We said more than `hello' for the first
time in three years,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But can a change not in content but tone _ in itself a difficult
thing to pull off for so entrenched a personality _ accomplish the
mayor's goal of ``reaching everyone in this city''?
</P>
<P>
   After six and a half years of seeing one kind of mayor, some who
work with Giuliani are openly dubious. ``If he is sincere and truly
wants to reach out, I think the black community has always been
open to wanting to work with the mayor,'' said C. Virginia Fields,
the Manhattan borough president. But there are many skeptics, she
added, because the mayor has made similar promises before, and
failed to convincingly follow up. He can still keep his own
commitment to change, she said. ``But not easily.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: HERE, THERE, EVERYWHERE A RODRIGUEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of American League batting leaders is like Old
MacDonald's Farm _ here a Rodriguez, there a Rodriguez, everywhere
a Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   It is the A-Rod and I-Rod show, and it promises to run all
season, maybe even into the postseason voting for most valuable
player. Last year the league MVP race produced a close finish
between Ivan Rodriguez, the winner, and Pedro Martinez. This year
the race could be just as close but three-way, among Ivan
Rodriguez, Martinez and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both tops,'' Gene Michael, the Yankees' vice president
for major league scouting, said of the Rodriguezes. ``They have to
be the best two players, certainly among the top four or five
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, the Texas manager, called the Rodriguezes ``two
special people.'' He has managed Ivan for six years and has known
Alex for seven years. He marvels not only at how they play
baseball, but also at the kind of people they are. Michael marvels
at the kind of offense they produce while playing positions where
players are not supposed to hit the way they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing defensive positions,'' said Michael, once a
shortstop who hit the way shortstops are supposed to, batting .229
with 15 career home runs. ``You're supposed to have defensive
players at those positions. These guys are doing remarkable
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop, of course, has undergone a transformation. First, Cal
Ripken showed that a shortstop could be an offensive player, too,
and now Rodriguez is joined by Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter in
generating the kind of production once reserved for outfielders and
first basemen.
</P>
<P>
   As the Texas Rangers' catcher, I-Rod last season batted .332,
the highest average for an AL catcher since Bill Dickey's .362 in
1936, and he hit 35 home runs, a league record for catchers. A-Rod,
the Seattle star, last year hit 42 home runs for the second
successive season, tying his own AL record for shortstops and
becoming the only shortstop besides Ernie Banks to hit 40 or more
home runs more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But their 1999 performances were apparently only a prelude to
what I-Rod and A-Rod would produce this season.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, Ivan led the league in slugging
percentage (.772), Alex was second (.725); Ivan led in total bases
(125), Alex was fourth (103); Ivan was tied for the home run lead
(16), Alex was third (13); Alex led in runs scored (45), Ivan was
tied for second (37); Alex led in road batting average (.420), Ivan
was second (.400); Ivan was second in batting average (.377), Alex
was third (.366); Alex was third in runs batted in (43), Ivan was
fifth (41).
</P>
<P>
   Ivan also led the league in extra-base hits (30) and was second
in hits (61) and multiple-hit games (19); Alex was first in on-base
percentage (.483) and tied for second in walks (34).
</P>
<P>
   Ivan, who began playing in the major leagues at the age of 19,
had progressed steadily as a hitter but leaped to a different level
last season after acceding to the Rangers' request and not playing
winter ball in Puerto Rico. The Rangers had asked him not to play
the previous winter, but he played nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Puerto Rico, he was playing winter ball even
though we had asked him not to,'' Oates said. ``He asked me to come
watch him. I said I can't do that; that would be condoning what
you're doing. I said to him, `Why are you playing?' He looked me in
the eye and said, `Oatesy, I just love to play baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such a love for the game,'' Oates added, ``he plays it
like kids play Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also plays it however the manager wants him to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just adapts to whatever role I ask him to do,'' Oates said.
``I hit him sixth, shared some feelings with him about it, told him
he may not get good pitches to hit, but he did what we needed
there. I moved him up to second, said I need you to score 100 runs
and steal bases. He did that. This spring I said you're going to
hit third. That means you can't be running; you have to give Raffy
a chance to swing the bat. But you still have to score 100, hit a
few home runs and drive in 100. Sure enough, the guy goes out, hits
the ball in the seats, drives in runs and he's still scoring
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he believed Rodriguez could bat anywhere in the
lineup and play anywhere in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about moving him to second base in three or four
years,'' the manager said. ``I think he plans to talk to Joe Torre
about how it was moving to third. He may go to Bucky Dent's
baseball school and work out in the infield. You probably don't
want him catching his whole life, but he's so valuable back there
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' Rodriguez has become even more valuable in Seattle
with the departure of Ken Griffey Jr. The early returns indicate he
is handling his responsibility well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dynamite,'' Michael said. ``When he came out of high
school, he was already fully developed. He's very strong and keeps
getting stronger. He's a better hitter than he was. He struggled
for a year or two, then it was gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, who met Alex Rodriguez when he was a senior in high
school, saw him recently when the Mariners played in Texas this
month. ``I told him I appreciate watching him play,'' the manager
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that three-game series, Alex rapped seven hits, including two
home runs, in 13 at-bats and drove in five runs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No-Hit Kids to Closers
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez might not realize it, but he is following the path
of Dave Righetti's pitching career. Righetti pitched a no-hitter
for the Yankees in 1983 at the age of 24, then became a relief
pitcher and the team's closer the next season. Righetti is the
Yankees' career leader in saves with 224. Jimenez pitched a
no-hitter for the St. Louis Cardinals last season at the age of 25,
and this season he has become the closer for the Colorado Rockies.
He has five saves.
</P>
<P>
   Consistency on the Mound
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won all eight of Al Leiter's starts this season,
the best such perfect record in the majors through Friday's games.
James Baldwin, who had won his first seven starts, was scheduled to
start Saturday for the Chicago White Sox. The Arizona Diamondbacks
have won all seven of Brian Anderson's starts and have a 22-3
record in games started by Anderson, Randy Johnson and Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Bell vs. Belle
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning development last season, Jay Bell produced greater
power numbers than Albert Belle, hitting one more home run, 38 to
37, and generating a higher slugging percentage, .557 to .541.
Showing that the outcome was no fluke, the Arizona second baseman
again leads the Baltimore right fielder. Going into Saturday's
games, Bell had hit seven home runs and had a .520 slugging
percentage, while Belle was at five homers and .467.
</P>
<P>
   Flexible and Flying
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton seems as if he singlehandedly plans to replace the
offense the Rockies relinquished when they traded Vinny Castilla
and Dante Bichette. James Baldwin seems as if he singlehandedly
plans to pitch the White Sox into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, Baldwin had a 6-0 record and Helton
was the best hitter in the National League. Helton led the league
with a .418 batting average; had the best average with runners in
scoring position (.472); had the second-most total bases (111); was
second in slugging percentage (.828), runs scored (39) and on-base
percentage (.503); was third in runs batted in (41); and was tied
for fourth in home runs (13).
</P>
<P>
   The strong performances of Helton and Baldwin stem from a
similar source, the discovery of a flaw in their off-season
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I changed my off-season workout so I wouldn't be tight and
inflexible,'' Helton said. ``I felt that was holding me back. My
upper body was inflexible and keeping me from hitting as well as I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the first baseman had been a poor hitter. Last season
he batted .320, slugged 35 home runs and drove in 113 runs. But
Helton hired a personal trainer and changed his winter routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to more of an Olympic lifting program, gaining strength
and flexibility all in one,'' he said. ``It's hard to do. There's a
lot of technique to it, which I still really can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Helton began the season with greater flexibility, and his
performance serves as an eloquent spokesman for the program he
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin could join Helton in a joint commercial. He, too, worked
with a trainer and changed his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting too big for a pitcher,'' the 28-year-old
right-hander said. ``I love to work out with weights. That's
nothing that you want because I was losing a lot of flexibility. I
thought being a bigger pitcher made a better pitcher, but I found
out that it's not necessarily true.''
</P>
<P>
   As last season progressed, Baldwin, unable to work out as much,
found that his body was becoming more flexible. ``They told me I
was too big during the first part of the season,'' he said. ``I
worked out like a maniac during the off-season, then went to spring
training and worked out like a maniac. The next thing you know,
yes, I'm strong, yes, I look good, but as far as my performance on
the field, it wasn't that good. This makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Baldwin did not gain his sixth victory until Aug.
13; by then he also had 11 losses. He has won 11, 12 or 13 games in
each of his previous four seasons. Less than two months into this
season, he's halfway toward surpassing those totals.

PRO FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK: LEWIS CASE A TRIAL FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If over the next month or so, Court TV finds that its ratings
suddenly spike, reaching the sort of numbers once enjoyed by
``Seinfeld,'' the network can thank players, coaches and executives
in the National Football League. They will be watching for news
about one of their own, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, who
has been accused of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a three-time Pro Bowl player, and two co-defendants,
Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeney, are accused of stabbing Jacinth
Baker and Richard Lollar on Jan. 31 during a brawl after a
post-Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial begins, most likely this week, people across the
NFL _ from commissioner Paul Tagliabue, to those in the Ravens
organization, to players on vacation or working out preparing for
July training camps _ will be monitoring what happens. They will be
reading newspapers, listening to coverage on the radio and watching
Court TV. Tuning in to the cable channel is apparently the
preferred choice among NFL types to get the latest information on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis trial is probably one of the most discussed topics in
the NFL right now.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to make light of a serious situation. Two people
were killed, and Lewis, if found guilty, could spend the rest of
his life in prison. If that did happen, the NFL would receive the
kind of tarnish that could stain its image for years. And there is
still a murder case pending with another NFL player, the former
Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth, who is accused of masterminding
a plot to kill his former girlfriend, who was pregnant at the time.
She died in December after being shot in November. The baby
survived.
</P>
<P>
   But right now the league is focused on the Lewis trial because
it is at the forefront. And with so much at stake _ a man's
freedom, closure for the families of the victims and the image of a
billion-dollar sports league _ it is no wonder that many people in
the NFL seem to be following the case so closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what he is accused of is true, then I don't feel sorry for
him at all,'' one National Football Conference general manager
said. ``But on the other hand, this is my league, a league I care
about very much, so for his sake and the league's sake, you just
hope he was not involved. Either way, this is something I am going
to spend every free minute of my time following.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always talked about,'' one American Football Conference
head coach said. ``When we have staff meetings, one of the
questions someone always asks is, `Anything going on with the Lewis
case?' When I talk to other coaches, Lewis' name always comes up.
My players are also always talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away from the Atlanta courthouse where the
legal proceedings are taking place, the Lewis trial is a frequent
topic among officials at the NFL Players Association headquarters
in Washington. When general managers speak to each other,
complaining about the lack of salary-cap room or bragging about
their draft picks, a comment or two about Lewis always slips into
the conversation. When players get together for off-season
workouts, Lewis is brought up often.
</P>
<P>
   No group within the NFL _ except for perhaps the Ravens _ is
watching the case more closely than the league office in New York.
It is safe to say that as the trial begins, they are at Defcon 1.
NFL security officials are staying in constant contact with the
Atlanta police and other authorities. When the flood of negative
publicity again begins as the trial heats up, league officials will
constantly remind the news media and fans that the vast majority of
its players are good citizens, which is indeed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Baltimore team officials, while believing in Lewis,
are beginning to think that even if he were cleared of the murder
charges, but found guilty of one of the lesser counts, such as
obstruction of justice, the league may still suspend him for at
least several games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens officials believe that the NFL will want to make an
example of Lewis: If you do not choose your friends more carefully,
you can end up being tried for murder. And even if you are found
not guilty, you will still have to deal with the NFL
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lewis' defense will most likely be that he was simply in
the wrong place at the wrong time and that he had nothing to do
with the stabbings. As his case unfolds, no matter what happens,
there will be lots of people watching, many of them a part of the
game Lewis plays.
</P>
<P>
   Young Is Taking His Time
</P>
<P>
   The agent for Steve Young said the San Francisco quarterback
would most likely take ``every last second'' before deciding
whether to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Steinberg said his 38-year-old client had been medically
cleared to play despite sustaining a series of concussions during
his 15-year career. The latest occurred last season when Young was
hit in the head by a blitzing defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg disagreed with some members of the news media who have
portrayed Young as a person in denial about the possible health
risks of playing again. Steinberg has had seminars for his clients
regarding the risks of concussions, and Young has attended all of
those meetings. Steinberg also said Young had passed every test
administered to him.
</P>
<P>
   It's Never Too Early
</P>
<P>
   Some head coaches believe that championships are won months
before the season begins, and the teams that put the most work into
passing and training camps reap the rewards during the season. If
that is the case, the Tennessee Titans and the Baltimore Ravens are
on their way to good seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, Steve McNair is throwing the ball crisply and, for
the first time in years, is playing on healthy feet. McNair has
worked well in passing camps in the new offense, which while still
run-oriented, allows him more freedom. ``We're going to spread
people out a little more than we have been and we're going to give
the quarterback more options,'' coach Jeff Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, the Ravens were happy with their passing camp,
because players, even the rookies, have almost completely digested
the imaginative offense of coach Brian Billick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, rookies have a little more of a base,'' Billick said.
``We're not having a lot of mistakes _ a few. They won't be quite
as lost the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   One of the good guys in football, the personnel man Bobby Grier,
who was fired by New England, was hired as a scout in Houston last
week. . . . Giants linebacker Corey Widmer remains a possible
salary-cap casualty on or after June 1. . . . Indianapolis coaches
say quarterback Peyton Manning has spent this off-season working as
hard as ever. That is a scary thought, because Manning has little
to work on. Manning is setting an example for the rest of the team,
and making a statement that, despite its success last season, the
franchise still has a long way to go before reaching the Super
Bowl. . . . Green Bay tight end Mark Chmura, after being charged
with felony third-degree sexual assault of the family's babysitter,
will most likely be released by the Packers next month.

RED BULLET MAKES IT CLEAR: NO CROWN FOR FUSAICHI PEGASUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Two weeks after he won the Kentucky Derby for his
fifth straight score, Fusaichi Pegasus suffered a great upset
Saturday when he was outrun by 3} lengths in the homestretch of the
Preakness by Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   The colt who carries the name of the flying horse of Greek
mythology was the overwhelming 1-5 favorite, apparently poised to
give one more legendary performance on a heavy track at Pimlico
Race Course. But one he got hooked up with Red Bullet in the
homestretch, he could not compete. And at the finish, Red Bullet
won by daylight, while Pegasus held second place by the length of
his head ove Impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the 22nd consecutive year, since Affirmed in 1978,
racing was denied its ultimate prize: the Triple Crown. For the
first time in recent memory, no colt seemed more capable of
achieving it than Fusaichi Pegasus. But for the first time in
decades, a horse who did not race anywhere at 2 came back to win
one of racing's classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled to the outside,'' said Jerry Bailey, who rode Red
Bullet, ``and hoped it would force Pegasus to go wide around me.
And it happened exactly that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, the jockey on Fusaichi Pegasus, made no excuses
for his beaten favorite, but said: ``The track was a little
ggreasy. He did some slipping around. He got squeezed coming out of
the gate. But in the final run for home, he was outrun.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a day that dawned with clouds, rain and cold and
threatened to disrupt racing form, particularly the commanding form
exhibited by Fusaichi Pegasus in his first six races.
</P>
<P>
   The large bay colt with the royal breeding and royal price tag _
the son of Prospector cost $4 million as a yearling _ came into the
Preakness as the heavy favorite, two weeks after he dominated the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, though, prompted D. Wayne Lukas to observe, only
partly in jest, ``Everyone now has a perfect excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fusaichi Pegasus went to the post with the same jockey, Kent
Desormeaux, who won the Derby, the Pimlico Special and the
Black-Eyed Susan Stakes within those two weeks. And he raced with
the same credentials: one loss, by a neck, in his debut last
December, then five straight impressive scores this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus even won the Wood Memorial in New York last
month in his final prep race for the Triple Crown classics, and won
it on a heavy track that officially was described as ``wet-fast''
but that looked and felt muddy. He flew past Red Bullet that day
and won by four lengths, giving fans in the East a large clue to
the legend that he had created in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track at the Wood was off,'' said Neil Drysdale, his
trainer. ``He's trained on an off-track, and he's bred to handle an
off-track.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly ran the Preakness on an off-track, although his
rivals questioned in advance how he would handle it. Bob Baffert,
remembering that his Captain Steve had won the Kentucky Futurity
last year on a sloppy track at Keeneland in Kentucky, said Saturday
morning:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of how much they like mud, or don't. Most horses
don't like mud kicking into their faces. My horse won in the
slop.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert reflected on the dangers of challenging Fusaichi
Pegasus, and added, ``But we need all the help we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the eight horses in the Preakness also ran in the
Kentucky Derby: Fusaichi Pegasus (first), Impeachment (third),
Captain Steve (eighth), High Yield (15th) and Hal's Hope (16th).
They might have derived some slight comfort from the recent history
of the Preakness. No horse had won the Preakness after skipping the
Kentucky Derby since Deputed Testamony in 1983, and 71 had tried.
And no Derby winner who went on to become the Preakness favorite
had actually come through in the Preakness since Spectacular Bid in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd did not include the owner of the favorite, Fusao
Sekiguchi, the venture capitalist from Tokyo who paid the $4
million to buy the yearling two years ago. He attended the Derby
but remained at home for the Preakness, citing the length of the
trip from Japan, but he reaffirmed his faith in Fusaichi Pegasus
and said again that he would have paid even more money to buy the
colt.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Pimlico Saturday apparently was not deterred by the
weather or the memory of bizarre happenings at the Preakness in the
past. Two years ago, a fire in an electrical generator outside the
track caused Pimlico to lose power on a hot afternoon, including
air-conditioning units and the tote boards. Last year, a spectator
leaped onto the track, stood in the middle of the horses thundering
through the homestretch and threw a punch at Artax.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the crowd may have been drawn, in part, by the unusual
pattern of the last three years of the Preakness when three horses
won the Derby and the Preakness but then, on the brink of sweeping
the Triple Crown, failed to win the Belmont Stakes in the final
strides. In 1997 Silver Charm was foiled; in 1998, Real Quiet
missed his moment of history, and in 1999 Charismatic finished
third after fracturing a leg in the homestretch of the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   So, even greater suspense was shouldered by Fusaichi Pegasus,
especially with the added threat from Red Bullet, who had not raced
in the five weeks since Pegasus outran him in the Wood. He carried
the colors of a strong stable, owned by Frank Stronach, the
Canadian business executive and owner of the Magna worldwide
enterprises, and he had the services of the country's premier
jockey, Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to see him sit off the speed and make one big
run,'' said his trainer, Joe Orseno. ``But that will all be in
Jerry's hands when they leave the gate. He knows what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the decision to pass the Derby, the trainer added: ``
Stronach said, `My heart says Derby, but I want what's best for the
horse.' And we agreed that the right thing to do was wait the five
weeks for the Preakness, and take our best shot to beat Fusaichi
Pegasus.''

REPUBLICAN INVADES DEMOCRATIC TERRITORY; LOOPHOLE INSPIRES
LEGISLATIVE END RUN; INTERNET ADDRESSES AS POLITICAL TOOL; A
MESSAGE TO BUSH; ON THE ROAD IN NORTH DAKOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, a conservative freshman Republican from
Pennsylvania, barely won election in 1994, and he has been on the
Democratic hit list ever since. Polls indicate that his Democratic
opponent, Rep. Ron Klink, a moderate, is within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   But Santorum appears to have more going for him now than he did
when the Democrats first took aim at him. He has toned down his
hard-edged conservatism somewhat and come out in support of a
number of popular government aid projects.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger was battered in a hard-fought, divisive
Democratic primary, whereas Santorum had no primary opposition. And
he has raised over $6 million for his campaign, while Klink had to
mortgage his home just to get through the primary.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Santorum is not only working his Republican base
hard but, anticipating a contest that could be decided by a few
points either way, has also begun to go after the Democrats' base.
Last week, Santorum held a rally in the heavily black heart of
North Philadelphia, serving notice that while about 95 percent of
the city's blacks usually vote Democratic, he did not intend to
surrender a single black vote.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by 18 black church, community and business leaders,
he declared: ``We are going to actively campaign in the
African-American community. We're going to fight for every vote.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the business leaders, Cody Anderson, praised the senator
for showing up in North Philadelphia and said he was ``worthy of
support'' because he had looked after the community's interests.
``I had accepted a definition from other people of the senator,''
Anderson went on. ``But everywhere I go recently, I've run into
people who have told me of the projects he's supported _ computer
labs, contracts, grants.''
</P>
<P>
   Klink's office called Santorum's visit ``puzzling'' in light of
his ``lifetime rating of 25 percent from the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOPHOLE INSPIRES LEGISLATIVE END RUN
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming vetoed a bill that
proposed a constitutional amendment to curtail veto power by
governors. This year the Legislature tried again.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second go-round, legislators sent the bill directly
to the secretary of state for action after passage, saying they had
found a loophole in state law that permitted constitutional
amendment measures to bypass the governor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Geringer says he is going to court to get a ruling on the
legality of the end run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lesson in civics,'' he said last week. ``I have an
obligation as governor to be sure that process is followed. It was
not.''
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET ADDRESSES AS A POLITICAL TOOL
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the Internet, it is known as cybersquatting _
the practice of putting down $75 to lay claim to an especially
appealing or recognizable Internet address before another person or
organization can, and then offering to sell that address to the
latecomer for a nice profit.
</P>
<P>
   So campaign aides to Rep. Bob Wise, a moderate-to-liberal West
Virginia Democrat who is running this year for governor
(www.BobWise2000.com and www.BobWise2000.org), were not especially
surprised the other day when an e-mail message came stating that
one Scott Loughery of Baltimore had laid claim to the addresses
www.Wise2000.com and www.Wise2000.org.
</P>
<P>
   Wise's aides replied that Loughery, who they say identified
himself as ``a Wise supporter,'' might want to consider
``donating'' the addresses to the Wise campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Loughery, as the Wise aides tell it, countered with an offer to
sell both addresses for $1,500 and added: ``Should you take a pass,
I will likely be approaching some well-heeled members of the
business community who may wish to use it to hamper such a
pro-labor governor taking office. They could conceivably set up an
opposition site that effectively shuts down your fund raising.
Sorry for the shakedown. I got cynical about politics when Clinton
took over. I'm a proud member of the Green Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise's aides clicked on the Wise2000 sites. Up came the site of
Wise's Republican opponent, Gov. Cecil Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   They accused the governor of resorting to ``trickery'' and
``chicanery.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood denied any involvement. Yes, his aides reported,
Loughery had approached the governor about buying the Wise2000
sites for $1,500 to ``damage'' Wise in a race considered a toss-up.
But, they said, the governor ignored the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Loughery says he has no comment, ``none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Wise2000 sites? At the beginning of the weekend,
clicking onto the sites brought up the Ralph Nader campaign site.
Nader, the consumer advocate, is seeking the Green Party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   A MESSAGE TO BUSH: LISTEN TO YOUR MAMA
</P>
<P>
   In December, Barbara Bush, the former first lady and the mother
of Gov. George W. Bush, declared in an interview with ABC News that
the Republican Party should not take a stand on abortion in its
national platform. ``I believe in states' rights,'' she said, ``and
I don't think it should be in the national platform. There's
nothing a president can do about it anyway, in all honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words are about to come back to haunt her son, who has said
he will fight to keep the Republican Party's anti-abortion plank at
this summer's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Choice, an organization that has threatened
noisy, divisive demonstrations at the convention if the plank is
not removed or modified, is preparing to run 30-second radio
advertisements that call on Bush to ``listen to your mama'' rather
than to the hard-right conservatives who tend to dominate the
party's platform deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heed her, not Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed,'' says the
advertisements' narrator, Adrian Cronauer of ``Good Morning,
Vietnam'' fame. ``Listen to your mama. That's a family value we can
all agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD AGAIN IN NORTH DAKOTA
</P>
<P>
   Another update on Duane Sand, the retired Navy man who
campaigned across the frozen breadth of North Dakota in January _
on foot _ to call attention to his novice run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he make it and end up with the Republican
nomination (to even his own surprise), but he is off on another
marathon, of sorts, as he chases after the entrenched Democratic
incumbent, Kent Conrad.
</P>
<P>
   What now?
</P>
<P>
   Sand plans to hit every city and town in the state that has a
post office _ all 300 or so of them.
</P>
<P>
   No mention of the crossroads that have post offices. Not yet.

minister's wife with her white shoes, white gloves and preordained
hostessing duties, many pastor's wives are speaking their minds and
loving life. Esther Ilnisky, the wife of Pastor Bill Ilnisky, found
her own place in life and founded her own ministry, The Esther

U.S. Congress prepares to vote on permanently normalizing trade
relations with China, which President Bill Clinton says is
necessary to allow the U.S. to benefit from a far-reaching trade
accord securing China's entry into the WTO, all that laborers in
China see is a rapidly-changing economy that is leaving them
behind. Liu Jiuwang, in front of the Beijing Textile Machine

   (NYT13) BEIJING -- May 20, 2000 -- CHINA-TRADE-COX-1 -- The way
Chinese factory workers see it, lay-offs loom inevitably in their
future, regardless of any vote by the U.S. Congress or whether
China joins any world trade bodies. The state-run factories they
work at are dinosaurs left-over from the era of the planned economy
and will most likely not make it in the era of global economic
competition. A worker at the Beijing Textile Machine Factory, where
equipment is outdated and layoffs are looming. (Julie Chao/Cox News

   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- May 20, 2000 -- NY-GIULIANI-ASSESS -- If
revising his legacy is indeed the objective of the newly
introspective-sounding mayor of New York City, the issues are out
there waiting for Rudoplh Giuliani. His health allowing, he can do
a lot even if hampered by skepticism and the dimming of the
spotlight. Giuliani's withdrawal from the Senate race on Friday was

Council member's video camera. (Ruby Washington/The New York Times)

Congress seems delighted to scold and micromanage, is clearly
moving to a higher ground of civic morale. In his 16 months of
incumbency, Anthony A. Williams, the 48-year-old mayor of The

PALESTINIANS-JERUSALEM -- Jerusalem is well known to be an intense
symbolic focal point for both Israelis and Palestinians, as well as
for Jews, Christians and Muslims worldwide. Abu Dis, a dusty
neighboring town, given over to Palestinian control, is closer to
the heart of the contested city than is the Israeli Parliament or
the Israeli prime minister's headquarters. From Abu Dis, the Dome
of the Rock in the heart of the Old City is visible. (Rina

   (NYT14) BEIJING -- May 20, 2000 -- CHINA-TRADE-COX-2 -- As the
U.S. Congress prepares to vote on permanently normalizing trade
relations with China, which President Bill Clinton says is
necessary to allow the U.S. to benefit from a far-reaching trade
accord securing China's entry into the WTO, all that laborers in
China see is a rapidly-changing economy that is leaving them
behind. Liu Jiuwang, in front of the Beijing Textile Machine

Chinese factory workers see it, lay-offs loom inevitably in their
future, regardless of any vote by the U.S. Congress or whether
China joins any world trade bodies. The state-run factories they
work at are dinosaurs left-over from the era of the planned economy
and will most likely not make it in the era of global economic
competition. A worker at the Beijing Textile Machine Factory, where

IT MAY LOOK LIKE A MISMATCH, BUT LAZIO HAS RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
 YORK-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So, with Rudolph Giuliani on the sidelines, this is
what the nation's hottest Senate race comes down to? Hillary Rodham
Clinton and who? Rick Lazio? Perhaps the most famous woman in the
world against a back-bench congressman from the outer shores of
Long Island?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the clash of titans has dwindled to a what seems to be
a mismatch, such as Alf Landon against FDR, the Padres versus the
Yankees, Wily Coyote and the Roadrunner.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's an alternative history of mismatches _ David
and Goliath, the Broncos versus the Packers, the tortoise and the
hare.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Clinton appears to be crushing the 4th-term
congressman _ 50 to 31 percent in the most recent polls, $6.6
million to $3.5 million stockpiled in their campaign war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not even the happiest Democrats foresee a cakewalk to the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the race could hinge on whether Lazio _ a boyish-looking
42-year-old who has never campaigned outside New York's Suffolk
County _ comes across over the next several days as a lightweight
neophyte or a seasoned legislator of energy and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain.
</P>
<P>
   First, this will be a rough-and-tumble contest.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Clinton's advisers are publicly denouncing Lazio as a
puppet of Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, and what one aide called ``the
rest of the radical Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lazio has hired as his campaign manager Mike
Murphy, Arizona Senator John McCain's media chief, who once
described his approach as: ``Make the charge, and let the other guy
spend $1 million to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign announcement Saturday, at a high school in West
Islip, Lazio said, ``Here in New York, we love an underdog,'' and
attacked Clinton as an out-of-state ultraliberal who flies around
on Air Force One. (His campaign T-shirt reads, ``Lazio _ Made in
New York.'')
</P>
<P>
   Second, this is not the race that anybody had in mind, or would
have wanted, a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Democratic leaders begged Clinton to run for the open
Senate seat last summer only after the party's A-list _ US Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, state Comptroller Carl McCall, and
environmentalist Robert Kennedy Jr. _ declined to challenge
Giuliani, who was at his peak of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The one Democrat who had entered the race, Representative Nita
Lowey from Westchester County, agreed to drop out if Clinton came
in.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican leaders embraced Giuliani, despite their
longstanding problems with the New York mayor's personality and
positions, because they saw him as the only candidate who could
beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican camp, too, had a Lowey-like legislator who was
even more ambitious to run, but he agreed to step aside for the
sake of Giuliani. That was Lazio, who reenters the race with the
full backing of the party machine after Giuliani withdrew Friday,
citing concerns over treatment for his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Democrats thought Lazio would end up their opponent, the
local big names might have joined the fray to begin with. Even
Lowey would have been a formidable match for Lazio, and the race
would have been a more traditional bout.
</P>
<P>
   Now the race pits a conventional New York Republican against the
proverbial 400-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   A 400-pound gorilla has certain advantages, but also some
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problem is that many people deeply dislike her. In a
poll taken two weeks ago by John Zogby, running her against each of
six New York Republicans (including Lazio), Clinton never attracted
more than 50 percent of the voters surveyed. Over 40 percent of
those polled would not vote for her under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani had been the opponent, he would have had his own set
of negatives to offset Clinton's. What made that race so exciting
was that both candidates sparked passion among the voters _ some
adoring, some hateful. One of the bigger assets for each was the
negative image of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton still has her negatives _ but her new foe, Lazio,
has none, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton and Giuliani had been tied in the polls _
with Clinton way ahead in New York City, the mayor way ahead in the
suburbs, and the two running even in the rest of the state. It is
too soon to say how Lazio alters this equation.
</P>
<P>
   In the city and suburbs, many white liberals who favored
Giuliani, because they liked what he had done as mayor, may swing
back to the Democrat rather than vote for a suburban Republican.
</P>
<P>
   However, many blacks, who tend to vote in smaller numbers but
were yearning to cast their ballots against Giuliani, might not
bother turning out with the mayor out of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, though, is Catholic _ like 42 percent of the state's
voters, and a higher share still upstate _ who, despite his
alliances with Gingrich, has a fairly moderate voting record. He is
for gun control, the environment, and breast-cancer research. He is
also in favor of abortion rights, though he has voted to ban
``partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   His stance against that abortion procedure means Lazio will
proably get the nomination of the New York Conservative Party.
Giuliani, who opposes any restriction on abortion rights, would not
have won that party's ballot-line, which could have drained away at
least 5 percent of the vote. Lazio is expected to get that 5
percent back.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton will now capture the state's other
major independent faction, the Liberal Party. Its leader, Raymond
Harding, is a friend and adviser to Giuliani, and probably would
have put the mayor on his ticket had he stayed in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Both shifts are important: No Republican here has won a
statewide race without the Conservative line since 1974; no
Democrat has won a statewide race without the Liberal line since
1944.

GUN GROUP CASTS GORE AS AN ENEMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Move over, Bill Clinton. The National Rifle
Association, which has made the president a personal target in its
campaign for gun rights, has selected a new enemy, and it is Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate was slammed again and
again Saturday as a ``liar'' and a ``dangerous'' force who, NRA top
brass warned members, would take away their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculing last weekend's ``Million Mom March'' in Washington as
a ``Misled Moms March,'' NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre accused Gore of orchestrating the march and manipulating
its participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore, you're going to find out it's not smart to lie to
Mom,'' LaPierre told thousands of cheering members gathered for the
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has been arguing that mandatory licensing and
registration for gun owners would save lives, ``it's all a big,
stinking, dangerous, Al Gore lie,'' LaPierre said. ``We're going to
beat Al Gore because he can't lie to America's moms and get away
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, welcomed the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can judge your character by the enemies you make, Al
Gore has a very strong character,'' Lehane said. ``The NRA is
opposed to common-sense gun reform, and they have George Bush in
their hip holster, and they're planning on having an office in
Bush's West Wing,'' Lehane added, referring to the Texas governor
and presumed Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Al Gore will continue to fight for America's families, and
to fight against the NRA,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   While NRA officials painted Gore as their number one enemy,
rank-and-file members, in a festive mood, wandered among booths at
a massive gun fair downstairs at the Charlotte Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors displayed everything from pistols to hunting rifles,
along with such items as the ``Tree Lounge,'' which allows a hunter
to sit comfortably in a hammock-like chair while shooting animals.
The product was hawked with a video, showing a pleased hunter
killing various forms of wildlife from his treetop perch.
</P>
<P>
   Everything represented at the show, NRA officials said, would be
endangered under a Gore White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will determine whether or not the right to keep
and bear arms will survive into the next century. It's that simple.
We are at a crossroads,'' said James J. Baker, the NRA's chief
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to election day. The extremists will never
be satisfied, and they will use every dollar and every vote to
elect Al Gore,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I make you this promise: not on my watch,'' Baker said,
winning a standing ovation from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It was actor and NRA President Charlton Heston who captured the
biggest applause from the members, holding up a rifle and
delivering an ominous warning to Gore and other NRA opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is b-a-a-ack. All of this spells very serious trouble
for a man named Gore,'' said Heston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say those fighting words, to hear and to heed, and
especially to you, Mr. Gore,'' Heston said, waving the rifle
slightly. ``From my cold, dead hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments refer to a legendary NRA slogan: ``I'll give up my
gun when they pry it from my cold, dead hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The defiance at the convention comes at a time when the NRA has
been on the defensive, as state, city, and Clinton administration
officials seek to control gun ownership and press for mandatory
safety latches on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield-based Smith &AMP; Wesson recently agreed, among other
things, to install mandatory trigger locks, and to develop ``smart
gun'' technology to make sure only authorized users could fire a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was made with the Department of Housing and Urban
Devlopment, amid threats of potentially costly lawsuits by a group
of cities.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the NRA has derided Smith &AMP; Wesson as a traitor, and
opposes any mandatory rules on safe-keeping of gun and trigger
locks.
</P>
<P>
   But at the conference's gun and weapons exhibition, safety locks
and firearms safes were prominent items. And sales of the items,
the manufacturers said, are exploding _ partly because of recent
gun tragedies, and partly because of a suspicion that the locks may
eventually become mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the media attention on the safety issue, and the need for
keeping guns away from children, they're a necessity,'' said Cindy
Boswell, who was running a booth for ``The Gunlocker,'' a small,
code-operated safe made by California-based Phoenix USA. ``Also,
the laws are changing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people who own guns are safety-minded,'' said
Alan Newcomb, vice president of sales for iGun Technology Corp., a
Florida-based company that makes a computerized trigger-locking
system.
</P>
<P>
   The device uses a special ring with a computer chip in it. When
the user wears the ring and holds the gun, it unlocks the trigger
electronically, Newcomb said, displaying the system.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre denounced mandatory safety rules, including background
checks and licensing requirements. The Clinton administration
contends that the Brady Law, which requires background checks on
potential buyers, has stopped 500,000 purchases of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   But a determined criminal will get the guns anyway, LaPierre
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bonnie sends Clyde to the gun shop, if he gets turned
down, does he come back and say, `Well, Bonnie, I guess that means
no guns for us?' '' LaPierre said sarcastically. ``Stop fooling
moms about licensing, Mr. Gore.''

HAITIAN VOTE TODAY COULD BE KEY TEST FOR DEMOCRACY'S CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ In a fateful vote in the poorest country
of the Western Hemisphere, Haitians carrying photo IDs Sunday will
cast ballots that are likely to determine the future of democracy
here and the commitment of foreign aid for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   UN election workers, who have helped organize votes worldwide,
called Sunday's ballot one of the most complex undertakings they
have ever seen. Yet, they also say the mind-boggling pre-election
logistics have generally gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown, though, is whether violence will erupt or
whether corruption will throw the process into chaos, and then
accelerate the collapse of a deeply stagnated political and
economic system. In the last six weeks, there have been about 15
election-related killings, enough to throw a scare into many voters
but still less violence than in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps foreshadowing trouble for Sunday's vote, about 200 angry
poll workers attempted Saturday to enter one administration office
of the Provisional Electoral Council demanding back wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't pay me, I won't work on election day,'' said one
man, who identified himself only as Jean Robert, 21.
</P>
<P>
   The election _ Haiti's first to strictly follow its
Constitution, which was written in 1987 _ would establish a
decentralized government, with five separate ballots for local,
regional, and parliament seats. A presidential election is set for
November. Now, Haiti has only eight elected officials in the entire
country; its parliament was disbanded 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's vote, some 29,000 candidates are running for 7,530
local and regional positions. Voters will cast ballots in 11,000
stations, each limited to 400 voters, one of the checks against
possible ballot stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Picture IDs have been made for the nearly 4 million registered
voters, a process that has had the added benefit of officially
registering hundreds of thousands of people as Haitian residents
for the first time. An estimated 45 percent of the population has
never been recorded in birth or marriage records.
</P>
<P>
   At a downtown Port-au-Prince park Saturday, Representative
William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of three
members of a congressional delegation observing the elections,
asked a young man if he planned to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The man pulled out a thick wallet, which was empty save his ID
card. He said he did plan to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have been especially anxious
about Haiti's vote as US involvement in the impoverished island
could become an issue in this year's US presidential contest. In
1994, 20,000 US troops help restore democracy to Haiti, but
Republican critics say the $2 billion cost has yielded few results.
</P>
<P>
   US officials had pushed the Haitian government to hold the vote
as soon as possible this year to negate any coattail effect from
the presidential campaign of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide in the fall. Aristide, the only candidate so far, is
expected to win in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   His Lavalas Family party also is expected to do well Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of this fall's presidential race has arisen
frequently among diplomats at the US Embassy here. The orderliness
of Sunday's vote, diplomats say, will help determine whether the
United States pays for the November election preparations and will
affect other aid projects. About $24 million in US funds has been
set aside for Sunday's election.
</P>
<P>
   At an embassy meeting Friday, one US diplomat told a group of
international observers that it remained an open question whether
the United States would fund a presidential election that would
produce Aristide as the sure winner. The diplomat, according to two
participants at the meeting, called Aristide a ``dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Just moments later, the participants said, an airplane passed
over the embassy compound and dropped leaflets urging support for
the Lavalas Family. Later, they picked up a leaflet, which showed a
picture of Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a scene from a movie,'' one participant said.

 &HT;    Governor's giant shadow has GOP leaders gloomy
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ To Linda Schrenko, it's almost as if she has no
choice but to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   And for that, she blames the Democratic incumbent, Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has fixed things so that if I want to remain state school
superintendent, I have to run for governor because he's doing
everything to control education,'' the Republican education chief
said. ``Everything that's not under his direct control, he creates
a bureaucracy that is under his direct control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schrenko said she has no intention of entering the
governor's race in 2002. Instead, she said, she will seek a third
term as superintendent _ and hope that some other Republican takes
on, and defeats, Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko's dilemma was on abundant display this weekend in
Savannah as Georgia Republicans held their state convention.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP activists who gathered here desperately want to unseat
Barnes in two years _ to take an office that only one Republican
has ever occupied by election. (Republican Rufus Brown Bullock was
elected and served from 1868 to 1871, when he resigned. Republican
Benjamin F. Conley took over for Bullock for two months and 12 days
before a Democratic successor took office.)
</P>
<P>
   But no one is yet ready to commit to a race that, many
Republicans acknowledge, is all but unwinnable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who are interested in running,'' said
Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. But ``no good
politician wants to commit political suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it seems a campaign against Barnes would be a mission
destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the governor is extremely popular with Georgians. His
campaign organization, which never disbanded after the 1998
election, reported raising $2.2 million last year. The campaign
recently took the unusual step of running television ads in which
Barnes touted his education reform plan _ a full 2 1/2 years before
the 2002 election.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all that, history is firmly on Barnes' side. In the
quarter-century that Georgia governors have been allowed to serve
consecutive terms, no incumbent has lost a bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia governorship has essentially become an eight-year
term,'' said Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans' best hope for getting a qualified candidate
would be if something blows up in Barnes' face,'' Bullock said.
``There are a lot of things that could happen. But so far he has
led a charmed life.''
</P>
<P>
   That point, he said, is not lost on potential Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans may field a credible challenger to Barnes,
Bullock said, ``it may not be someone from the first tier.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clay said a number of prominent Republicans are
considering the campaign. They include some of Georgia's eight
Republican congressmen, Schrenko, Insurance Commissioner John
Oxendine and former Attorney General Mike Bowers, who lost in the
1998 Republican gubernatorial primary.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the potential candidates spoke during the convention,
and some _ like Schrenko _ flirted with the idea of running. But
none gave a firm indication of leaning toward challenging Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Republicans have only one announced candidate for
statewide office in 2002: state Sen. Bill Stephens (R-Canton), who
says he will run for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting statewide candidates would be easier, Clay said, if
the party wins the White House this year and gains seats in the
General Assembly. Conversely, he said, Republican defeats this
November _ especially at the legislative level _ could be
disastrous for recruiting gubernatorial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to get shellacked,'' Clay said, ``you're not going
to find folks coming out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   The Savannah convention was devoted to electing delegates to
this year's GOP national convention. But talk about the party's
prospects in 2002 never slipped far beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention hall's podium, bravado reigned.
</P>
<P>
   Oxendine, for instance, predicted a ``surprise'' for Barnes in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a Republican president and a Republican
vice president fly down here on Air Force One to campaign against
him to put a freely elected Republican in the office of governor in
the state of Georgia,'' Oxendine declared.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor, though, delegates were less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People vote Democrat because their parents voted Democrat and
their grandparents voted Democrat,'' said Frank Hardeman, a
delegate from Savannah. ``It's a hard trend to break.''

WHAT KIND OF ODDS TO CLIPPERS HAVE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the Heat, 21-20, at halftime and while you crack open the
emergency Tums, NBC adjourns to the NBA Draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Limping in to draw straws at David Stern's faith-healing tent
will be the league's ranking have-nots. Thanks to math provided by
the NBA, the Clippers' Elgin Baylor has dibs on today's catbird
seat. The expected prize: wounded Cincinnati Bearcats power forward
Kenyon Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, whose team scored lottery victories in 1988 and 1998
(the years after David Robinson and Tim Duncan were available, he
points out) again plans to abstain from good-luck charms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People offer to give me all kinds of stuff,'' Baylor said.
``If I thought a good-luck charm would work, I'd send it there by
itself and they could put it in the chair instead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck's fine, but it's also a good idea to promote the
conspiracy-free zone. Just in case the watchdogs of talk radio are
right and any hanky-panky is scheduled to go down, a tiny stuffed
green bear will the ride the head of each of the representatives on
stage at Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   According to league sources, the NBA informed each participating
team that a back-stage witness to the Ping-Pong ball droppings
would not be necessary this year.
</P>
<P>
   OK.
</P>
<P>
   So, what kind of odds do the Clippers have?
</P>
<P>
   As the worst team for NBA 2000, they have a 25-percent chance to
land the top pick. This is measured by having 250 of a possible
1001 Ping- Pong-ball combinations. The Chicago Bulls, whose crummy
play folded down the stretch, have 200 of the 1,000 issued to the
13 lotto participants.
</P>
<P>
   But - due to rotten karma and expansion embargoes - the last
time the league's worst team claimed the top pick was 1990 (New
Jersey, Derrick Coleman).
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of karma, the team entering the lottery ranked No. 3
for Ping-Pong-ball stockpiling has scored the first pick the last
three years. If the streak continues, Orlando (via Golden State,
the last gasp from the Chris Webber-Penny Hardaway trade) is home
free. &QL; 
Points of view
</P>
<P>
   Phase 1 in the Clips' 2000 pre-draft screening process was a
two-day festival starring four relatively big-time point guards. As
you may recall, the Clippers are to point guards as Montana is to
zydeco music.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notorious name in this quartet belongs to Erick
Barkley, whose only fraternal tie with the Chuckster is his quick
history of controversy. Barkley, now abandoning St. John's after a
tumultuous sophomore season, is the heralded playmaker blessed by
white-glove treatment from the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been portrayed a certain way in the media,'' he said at
the end of a businesslike skirmish at USC's Lyon Center, ``but
people don't know that I'm a really humble dude.''
</P>
<P>
   The humble dude was temporarily suspended from play last season
following a suspicious swap of sport utility vehicles and for
allegedly allowing the loot needed to square his prep school
tuition to be coughed up by an AAU coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to finally not have to wake up every day and see my
face in the newspapers,'' said Barkley of his momentary escape from
NCAA scrutiny and the New York City microscope. ``All of that
stress is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new stress is no slouch.
</P>
<P>
   While under Clipper surveillance Barkley spent parts of Thursday
and Friday in hand-to-hand combat with relentlessly clever Scoonie
Penn (Ohio State), speedy Speedy Claxton (Hofstra) and gung-ho Matt
Santangelo (Gonzaga).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous the first day,'' said Barkley, who some
scouts project as the first point guard to disappear from the draft
board June 28. ``Today, I feel more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, Erick, but it might be time to suspend the relaxation and
work a bit more on that jumper. The only member of this foursome
who didn't complete four years of collegiate eligibility (which may
not be an issue here), the erratic Barkley appears to be a reach as
a top 10 pick.
</P>
<P>
   The real fun was had spying on Penn vs. Claxton, the equivalent
of slap-boxing between freelance cats. Penn also was the best
shooter on display, while Claxton is, unequivocally, the quickest
point guard in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who goes about 5-foot-9 if he switches to the thermal
socks, began the cool-down period of the two-day trial by flipping
the ball against the backboard, leaving the floor for a while, then
slamming the ball through the rim with both hands. Santangelo, who
checks in at 6-1 when bubble gum is stuck to the bottom of each
shoe, upped the ante with a two-handed reverse that included a
Harold Miner-style, waist-level pump. Sweet, but he's still a
second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   All the 5-10 Claxton had was a rock-the-cradle, jackhammer dunk
that blew away the others. The Speedy tour's next stop is Toronto,
where he'll match skills with Khalid El-Amin, the robust front man
from UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively scheduled for Tuesday's Clipper lab tests are small
forwards Jason Kapono, UCLA's freshman from Artesia High, and Chris
Carrawell, who just finished a terrific senior season at Duke. &QL; 
Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   Joe Jones, the official uncle of and unofficial spokesman for
6-9 LSU sophomore Stromile Swift, has been telling NBA personnel
heavyweights his nephew will stay in school if he's not going to be
a top-three pick. Well, it's been impossible to locate anyone who
thinks the vertically splendid Swift will go later than four.
Nobody can guarantee it won't be No. 4, but don't believe any
one-spot snub (a salary difference of about $300,000 a year for
three years) would really put Swift back in college. ... Miami
point guard Anthony Carter, the hero of the Heat's Game 3 victory
at New York, may not be a lock to stay put next season. The Heat
will have to pony up its coveted $2.25 million exception to retain
the ex-Saddleback College and CBA hotshot, who - a source says -
could receive a more lucrative offer from (drum roll) the Indiana
Pacers. ... If 7-0 Texas center Chris Mihm (a top-four favorite)
flees the draft and hustles back to Austin for his senior season,
he may be only the fourth big man selected in the 2001 draft. The
possible top three: Dominguez High's Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry of
Thornwood High in Chicago's south suburbs and Yao Ming from China.
An unofficial Team Ming source said the 7-5, 19-year-old - at press
time is as close to a lock for the 2001 draft as his country's red
tape will allow. ...
</P>
<P>
   Darius Miles, who's jumping from East St. Louis (Ill.) HS and
may land in the top seven of the draft, has done what we'd heard he
wouldn't do. He's put his future in the busy hands of agent David
Falk. ... According to league sources, DeShawn Stevenson from
Fresno's Washington Union HS is taking the predictable hop from the
adidas camp to agent Arn Tellem. ... Joel Przybilla, the 7-1
sophomore refugee from the University of Minnesota, was witnessed
having a near-monster workout for the New Jersey Nets. His next
stop is Chicago, where crafty GM Jerry Krause is telling people
he's wild about Mihm. ... The worst thing about Arvydas Sabonis
disappearing from Saturday's Game 1 is that his head is too big to
be cropped for a milk carton photo. ... A freakish blast of air
from the team jet demonstrated that Coach Jeff Van Gundy's Honda
Civic has better ``ups'' than his starting power forward. &QL;

FIGHT AT WRIGLEY MIGHT BECOME NORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disciplinary actions coming to the Los Angeles Dodgers from
Tuesday's rumble at Wrigley Field should come this week, but the
implications and fallout from it will last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than an isolated issue in which players went into
the stands, more than fines and suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of everything that happened, every ballpark in the
league is forced to evaluate its security, how the staff reacts to
such incidents and what course of action needs to be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the belief this is a one-time happenstance at
Wrigley, so little needs be done is ignorant thinking. Not when
yahoos like Andrew Tellers, the guy who mooned John Rocker at
Dodger Stadium earlier this month, is flying to Atlanta to meet
Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more idiotic? That's a sure way to have fans
stay off the field. Let them meet the person they went after.
</P>
<P>
   So while Frank Robinson, vice president of on-field operations,
watches videotape and conducts interviews before his expected
severe punishments, Kevin Hallinan, baseball's director of
security, is figuring out the best way to reduce the risk of
altercations between fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a park like Wrigley is representative of many of the
new ballparks, where there is a greater proximity of fans to
players,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of
baseball operations. ``We need to take steps that are preventative
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though Wrigley Field security reacted slowly, the
issue should have the same effect as an oil change: preventative
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter for going into the stands to
catch the guy who allegedly whacked him in the back of the head and
took his cap with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning. Blame
any Dodger who followed into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine. Robinson and judges from the sure-to-come civil
lawsuits will be the ones who ultimately decide how much the
involved players and coaches should be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   They also should find a way to keep the dopey fan from allegedly
hitting a player, or stealing a hat.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Cubs organization for not having security in place to
prevent such an incident. Not until the next day did Cubs director
of stadium operations Mark McGuire say it was necessary to have a
security guard at the backs of the bullpen players to watch the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities already recognized this isn't 1950. Instead, there
are people in the stands who do nothing but drink all night and, if
the opportunity exists, watch a pitch here and there.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, fans running onto the field during games earn
harsher penalties, such as being charged with a misdemeanor, being
fined up to $2,500 and receiving a one-year jail sentence.
Previously, a citation was the only punishment.
</P>
<P>
   This also isn't the first time anything happened at Wrigley
Field. Giants manager Dusty Baker remembers former Dodgers teammate
Reggie Smith being involved in incidents at Wrigley Field and
Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer is not always right,'' Baker said. ``And the more
intimate the ballparks, the more of a chance of something
happening. Reggie's mom was really ill, and somebody in the stands
at Wrigley was talking about his mama. Somebody says something
personal to you, and you kind of react.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were playing at Candlestick, someone yelled to Reggie,
`I feel like hitting you with this beer can.' Reggie told him, `If
you do, I'll come up and kick your butt.' The guy threw the can,
and Reggie was like Bruce Lee - one move and he was in the stands.
The guy had his hands on a rail, and wouldn't let go. The security
people clubbed him and broke his hand. He sued the Dodgers, and I
think he got $150,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident is ugly enough to spread blame aplenty
around. That's the issue Robinson must deal with.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger issue is how to stop it from occurring again.
That responsibility falls upon everyone involved in baseball.

EDITORIAL: LABOR AND THE CHINA VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, May 21:
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, is doing his country
and the labor movement a disservice by fighting so hard against
permanently establishing normal trade relations with China. Of all
the groups lobbying on this issue, none has made a greater historic
blunder than organized labor. By bludgeoning Richard Gephardt and
the Democrats into sticking with labor on the issue, which the
House is set to vote on this week, Sweeney is squandering much of
the good will he has built up in recent years and damaging the
interests of American workers. House Democrats should back the
bill, which deserves bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has had trouble finding a sure footing in his
approach on China. He began in 1993 by making tough demands on
human rights and now too often looks the other way on these issues.
But the administration has reached a formula that is basically
sound. Human rights are served, not hindered, by opening China to
more foreign goods, particularly in telecommunications and
technology, which are bound to bring more information from abroad
to the Chinese people. China's membership in the World Trade
Organization will allow more scrutiny of its treatment of workers,
its record of piracy and even its treatment of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 19th century, the Democratic Party has stood for
workers' interests, and it interpreted their interests as being
served by free trade. It used to be that big American corporations
favored high tariff barriers to protect themselves against cheaper
foreign goods, but Democrats saw that workers are served not by
insulating their employers from competition, but by food, clothing
and other necessities sold here at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before Congress does not open the United States to more
Chinese products. Rather, it opens China to more American goods and
investment, and imposes a mechanism that can be used to challenge
unfair Chinese practices. Labor fears that more investment abroad
will lead to less investment at home, and fewer jobs. But if
American technology and manufacturing companies are not allowed to
compete in China with other foreign investors, they will be less
able to serve as healthy employers in the United States. Some
American workers will doubtless be hurt by foreign competition. But
the solution is to help these workers, not to try to block the
forces of economic globalization that are benefiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's reasons for taking on this issue may have more to do
with his own political interests than those of workers at large. He
won his election with the support of the Teamsters union and is now
listening to the Teamsters on this issue. Other unions within the
labor coalition are less enthusiastic about the AFL-CIO's
wrongheaded stance. Many Democrats in Congress are angry that
organized labor has also opposed lowering trade barriers for Africa
and the Caribbean, where some of the most miserably paid workers in
the world would benefit. Organized labor claims it is now standing
up for Chinese workers by opposing the trade bill. But workers in
the developing world know that trade is one of their only avenues
of hope.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill could be Clinton's last tough legislative battle
as president. His commendable willingness to stand up to labor and
most members of his own party on trade belies his reputation as
subservient to his party's core constituencies. On the other side
of the aisle, Gov. George W. Bush has shown leadership in
repudiating the isolationists in his own party. Organized labor's
decision to turn this into a make-or-break test of loyalty for its
supporters has been shortsighted and destructive.

KAPLER'S LEARNING CURVE EXTENDS FROM DETROIT TO TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Be patient.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Gabe Kapler has told himself for years, even before
he was a 57th-round draft pick. The refrain is just as common from
his manager these days.
</P>
<P>
   After a standout career in which he was named minor-league
baseball's player of the year, Kapler is batting just .200 early in
his third season.
</P>
<P>
   Being a key component in a nine-player trade that sent him from
Detroit to Texas for former American League MVP Juan Gonzalez
during the offseason hasn't made the situation any easier, but he
and his coaches continue to express confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the first three years in the big leagues, I think
is still a learning experience,'' Kapler said. ``Right now, I'm
just trying to learn everything I possibly can from the veteran
players on the team. I think I can add some things - play hard all
the time, play how I know - but I'm still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are willing to let 24-year-old Kapler take his time.
He is currently on the disabled list with torn quadriceps - he is
scheduled to return this week - but the comparisons to Gonzalez
persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not Juan Gonzalez and we didn't expect him to do what
Juan did right away,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He's
not the only player we traded for and that trade was made for the
long term. (Kapler) is still young and he's adjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gonzalez, Kapler is a muscular outfielder known for hitting
home runs. Kapler doesn't strike out much, but has a tendency to
pull the ball. The biggest adjustment he is trying to make, though,
is adapting to the life of a major-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing like I dreamed it would be,'' Kapler said. ``I
like it, but it's much more of a job than I thought it would be.
It's hard to describe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, how to handle the ups and downs of this game, that's
a challenge everybody goes through. The fact that this is a
business, it's a means of putting food on the table, it's not so
much the game we all grew up playing. It's a lot different now.
It's something I have to learn to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   A realization of what he needs to learn, and the confidence he
will be able to do so, has fueled Kapler's persistence since he was
an amateur. He admits he was ``not that great'' during his career
at Taft High of Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   At Moorpark College in 1995, he earned all-conference honors and
led the Raiders in almost every offensive category. But being
picked so late in the draft that year was an indication he was not
considered a legitimate prospect.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the offensive leaders at every level in the minors.
After setting Southern League records and earning MVP honors in
1998, Kapler was called up to the Tigers in September. No other
Tiger drafted as late as the 57th round has played in the majors
since the MLB draft began in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing in spring training earned him a spot on
Detroit's 1999 opening-day roster. Kapler batted just .245, but hit
18 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the trade to Texas as a fresh start, saying he never
felt comfortable in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He started the season by reaching base in eight of his first
nine plate appearances and getting six hits within the first two
games, including two home runs on opening day. But he has had
multiple hits in only one game since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to adjust,'' Kapler said. ``Like I said, I'm
taking it as a learning experience. This game is very humbling.
That's part of what I'm learning right now, how to deal with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt in my mind I'll overcome those things. I have
no doubt in my mind I'll have a very good career.''

INDIANS BEAT YANKEES, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ His other personality disappeared by the time
the Yankees lost in the bottom of the ninth inning, leaving the
gregarious side of David Cone to wander the clubhouse and apologize
for nasty words uttered when he was pitching against the Indians
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, he snapped at Charlie Wonsowicz, the Yankees' batting
practice pitcher and video coordinator. ``Don't worry about it,
man,'' Wonsowicz said, reassuring Cone. ``Hey, I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates will forever forgive Cone's game-day temper as a sign
of how much he cares. His teammates desperately want him to win,
having watched the way he evolves, adjusts, compensates for the zip
his fastball is losing gradually.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw well Saturday, relying more on his curveball, but the
Yankees could not pad an early two-run lead and Cone could not hold
that advantage, betrayed by his defense in the end. The Indians
broke a ninth-inning tie when reliever Jeff Nelson walked four
batters and forced home a run with two outs in the ninth as the
Indians won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 24-15, one game behind Boston in the American
League East, and they are 4-1 against the Indians here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time we beat those guys,'' said Omar Vizquel, the
Indians' shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The season was 26 days old when Cone won a decision for the
first time this season, and 22 more days have passed without
another victory. At this stage in his career, it is as if Cone is
given a completely different set of physical tools every season,
and every season he must figure out how to implement them in the
best way possible.
</P>
<P>
   His slider was his best pitch for years, and he finds his slider
now is not consistently sharp. His fastball has diminished just
slightly, and opponents who have faced him say he does not have the
same arm extension as he did a couple of years ago. Rather, he is
throwing with his right arm closer to his body, bent at the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   So Cone makes changes. A different place on the pitching rubber.
Far fewer sliders. Many more curveballs, at 70 to 73 miles an hour,
mixed with fastballs of 86 to 88 mph. Because there is a great
difference in the speeds of his breaking ball and fastball, he has
kept hitters off-balance. He also had a good split-fingered
fastball Saturday, using it with effectiveness against the likes of
Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have good velocity,'' Indians Manager Charlie Manuel
said. ``But he's a pro. He's not afraid to throw what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone shut out the Indians for the first six innings, holding
Cleveland hitless on six at-bats with runners in scoring position.
``I had a much better mix today through six innings,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against the Indians' Chuck Finley, Cone had a 2-0 lead
into the seventh, but it could have been much larger. Bernie
Williams seemed to break belated off first base in the first inning
and had to stop at third base on Jorge Posada's two-out double. The
Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez, often a defensive liability,
made three terrific catches Saturday and saved at least four runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Ramirez hustled back toward the right-field
fence on a drive by Alfonso Soriano and reached up, appearing to
turn his head and lose sight of the ball. But he caught the ball
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Cone carried the 2-0 edge into the bottom of the seventh and
hung a curveball that Richie Sexson whacked into the left-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Wilson hit a liner to left, a position Lance Johnson was
manning for the first time since Sept. 10, 1990 _ and the ball
glanced off Johnson's glove. Johnson said later he lost the ball in
the lights. Cone was relieved after Einar Diaz's sacrifice bunt,
and he watched anxiously from the bench as Mike Stanton pitched to
Kenny Lofton with a one-run lead. Lofton slapped a short fly to
left-center, where Johnson _ who has a poor throwing arm _ made the
catch on the run and threw home, too late to get Wilson. Tie game.
Cone got up and left the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no complaints,'' Cone said. ``I'm not going to complain
about run support or tough luck. I had a lead and let it get
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson entered in the eighth, the score still tied, and escaped
a jam when Travis Fryman lined into a double play with the
potential lead run at third. But with two outs and a runner at
first in the ninth, Nelson walked Lofton, then Vizquel, loading the
bases. The crowd roared as Nelson struggled to find the proper arm
slot in his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee reliever got ahead of Roberto Alomar one ball and two
strikes, then threw a ball high, and another.
</P>
<P>
   Full count. Nelson fired a fastball so high that Alomar had to
fall back to get out of the way, and the game was over. ``It was
just one of those days,'' Nelson said. ``I don't ever try go out
there and walks guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson can find some solace in the fact that his record is 6-1.
Cone is 1-3 for the season, stuck on 181 career victories, trying,
searching.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore stores more in the bank than Bush
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although likely Republican presidential candidate Gov. George W.
Bush raised three times more money than Democrat Al Gore last
month, the vice president made up the difference with taxpayer
funds and continued to have more money in the bank than his
Republican opponent, campaign finance reports released Saturday
show. Bush reported raising $3.8 million last month, bringing his
record-setting total to more than $84 million, while Gore took in
$1.1 million and received $2.5 million in federal funds. Through
April 30, Gore had $5.7 million in the bank, plus an expected $4.5
million in federal funds, for a total of $10.2 million. Bush had $6
million cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore is accepting federal funds, he is limited to
spending $40.5 million on his campaign. The campaign reported that
$27.1 million of its spending through April 30 fell under the cap,
leaving Gore $13.4 million to spend through the Democratic National
Convention in August. Bush, who is not taking federal money, can
spend as much as he can raise.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AD CAMPAIGN KICKING INTO HIGHER GEAR
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by sagging poll ratings of Democrats who say Gore is not
connecting with voters, Gore's campaign staff is planning a $10
million television ad campaign with the Democratic National
Committee. The ads, which would highlight party issues and Gore's
biography, are expected to air this summer. ``He needs to ratchet
the campaign up a little,'' said Jim Ruvolo, a top Democratic
activist in Toledo, Ohio. ``He's not connecting on a personal
level. He's got to get in situations where people see him as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Gore competitive with Bush in Missouri and other
closely watched swing states like Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey
and New Mexico. Bush is ahead in 17 states that account for more
than two-thirds of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White
House, public polls show. Gore leads in eight states with fewer
than half the needed voters.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MANY HOURS IN A DAY?
</P>
<P>
   Some television network executives are snickering at recent
statements by CNN executives that the Cable News Network plans to
broadcast 264 hours a day of the upcoming Republican National
Convention. Yes, that is 264 hours a day. However, CNN executives
say the programming totals include coverage from all of the cable
network's growing array of 24-hour news outlets _ such as CNN
International, CNN En Espanol and CNNfn _ all of which will carry
simultaneous coverage of the four-day convention, which starts July
31 in Philadelphia. ``Over here, there are still only 24 hours in
the day,'' said a publicity agent for a competing outlet. ``Even if
the number of hours are fewer, our reporting and analysis are every
bit as strong as they've ever been,'' said Marc Burstein, executive
producer of special events for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gail Evans, a CNN executive vice president: ``How could it
be overkill when we're talking about the fate of this country and
who we're electing?''
</P>
<P>
   GET READY TO BE ASKED AMERICA
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming months, the public will be inundated with
political polls, some of which might make the presidential campaign
even harder to understand, said veteran pollster Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press. Kohut
blames a shorter news cycle and the public's fascination with
political scandals for perpetuating the trend. ``Polls are being
ordered up more quickly, being done more quickly and they're being
reported more quickly,'' Kohut said this weekend in Portland, Ore.,
during the annual meeting of the American Association for Public
Opinion Research. ``These polls conducted at breakneck speed on the
heels of big events where public opinion is distorted by the
emotion of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH GETS A SURPRISE KISS
</P>
<P>
   Lots of candidates kiss babies, but Texas Gov. George W. Bush
had the tables turned on him Friday by a 77-year-old man who laid a
surprise peck on Bush's cheek as they shook hands. Howard Koen of
Paducah, Ky., said he did it just for fun. Asked later if any other
men had kissed him during his campaign, Bush replied: ``None as
cute as that.''

METS BEAT DIAMONDBACKS, 8-7 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Hampton waited three and a half hours to take
the mound Saturday, and he did not stick around until the game
ended. But the Mets left-hander made his appearance count.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton worked six shutout innings before leaving with tightness
in his upper back, as the Mets held on to beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks, 8-7, before an announced crowd of 37,121. The actual
crowd was much smaller, as most fans chose not to wait out a rain
delay at the start of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of Hampton's injury was not immediately known, but
he did not show any effects of it during the game. In fact, Hampton
(5-4) was performing as the Mets expected when they traded for him
last December, displaying not only strong pitching but also
superior athleticism for the third start in a row.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed four hits and one walk in his six innings, striking
out four. Hampton has won his last three outings, and lowered his
earned run average by more than two runs to 4.21 by giving up just
one earned run in his last 231/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks rallied from an 8-2 deficit in the ninth,
scoring five runs off Rich Rodriguez and John Franco. But Armando
Benitez struck out Erubiel Durazo with runners on first and second
to end the game for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   For the second game in a row, Hampton also had a single. In his
previous start, his bunt hit sparked a five-run rally that led to a
5-1 victory over Florida. Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter was
aware of Hampton's offense, saying before the series that he had
never spent as much time reviewing a pitcher's hitting ability. But
the analysis accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out in the fourth, Hampton lined a
single to left off Omar Daal, scoring two runs to give the Mets a
3-0 lead. He is now batting .261 after hitting .311 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a better hitting pitcher in the league than
Hampton?'' Showalter said. ``I don't think so. He's a slasher. He's
up there and he gets it done. He helps himself so much because he's
so athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   One batter later, when Joe McEwing's grounder scooted under the
glove of second baseman Jay Bell for the second of four Arizona
errors, Hampton raced from first to third. Derek Bell, who went 2
for 4, knocked in Hampton with a single _ chasing Daal from the
game _ and Edgardo Alfonzo brought home McEwing with a sacrifice
fly to give the Mets a five-run inning and a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's single extended his hitting streak to 10 games. Acquired
from Houston in the same trade that brought Hampton to the Mets,
Bell entered the game tied for the National League lead in hits,
with 59. Showalter reviewed Bell in his scouting meeting before the
series, but came up with no answers: Bell does not have any
tendencies, he said, and no matter where you pitch him, he is
capable of hurting you.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Bell, who bats second, came up near the end
of a rally, not at the start of one. The Mets have gotten very
little production from the bottom of their order this season,
partly because shortstop Rey Ordonez's average had not been above
.200 since the first game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton, who bats one place above Ordonez, in the seventh
spot, came into the game hitless in his last 22 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth, Benny Agbayani, Payton and Ordonez all
singled to load the bases for Hampton. Ordonez, who had reached on
an infield single and scored in the third, saw his average creep
above .200 with the hit. His average is now .198 after he finished
the day 2 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks never mounted much of a challenge against
Hampton. Their best chance came in the top of the fourth, when a
single and Hampton's only walk put runners on first and second. A
ground ball advanced the runners, but Hampton fanned Bernard Gilkey
on a changeup to end the inning.

   He worked a 1-2-3 fifth and stranded two runners in the sixth by
striking out Kelly Stinnett to end the inning.

   Dennis Cook, Pat Mahomes and Rodriguez each worked an inning

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE DERBY WINNERS GO NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for race result)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Neil Drysdale did not indulge himself in a
premonition of terror when the day stayed sodden and the dampness
lingered in a surface that would be officially labeled as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go race to race,'' said the taciturn Englishman.
``Otherwise, you'd go bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   This was, of course, not just any race. This was the Preakness,
where Triple Crown dreams often come to die. It happened Saturday
as Fusaichi Pegasus could not match Red Bullet in heavy going down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet's triumph was not a happy sign for the racing
marketers, who desperately need a superhorse to boost their sagging
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen them come out of the Derby and think they're
invincible,'' said Jerry Bailey, the winning jockey, ``and two
weeks later at 5:45 we find out they're not invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   All 40,000 seats have been sold for the Belmont in three weeks,
but now there is no allure of a Triple Crown, and very little
likelihood of another 40,000 standees swarming onto the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the Triple Crown hopes stayed alive
going into the Belmont. Saturday it happened coming out of the far
turn, when Red Bullet could maneuver on the muck, and Fusaichi
Pegasus was merely ``slipping and sliding,'' as Drysdale put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never been on this surface, so you didn't know how he'd
handle it,'' the trainer added.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness had done its deed. This was the 125th running of
the Preakness, and only 28 horses have won the Kentucky Derby and
the Preakness, with 26 going on to try the Belmont, and 11 of them
succeeding, but none since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised there have been as many Derby-Preakness
winners,'' said Joe Orseno, the trainer of Red Bullet, who kept his
horse out of the Derby because he did not think he was ready, a
novel concept.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the international glamour of the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness comes off as a family reunion. For all its quaintness,
the Preakness usually has one thing the Kentucky Derby never will
have, by definition:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Derby doesn't have a Derby winner,'' Orseno had said
during the week, adding, ``You have to win a second one to win a
third one.''
</P>
<P>
   This year there is no double winner to excite the general
population going into June. But racing people know the calendar for
3-year-olds did not begin in Kentucky on May 6. The eight horses in
the Preakness had survived a winter and spring demolition derby of
flying hooves and looming bodies, complicated by their own tiny and
fragile bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned about bringing a horse back in two
weeks,'' Drysdale had said during the week.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, who has tried it every which way, said, ``It's
always been my theory that the Preakness is so tough because it's
the third tough race in a row, not two.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus lost his first race, then had won five
straight, including the Wood Memorial in New York on April 15. He
won the Derby at a mile and a quarter and then came to the
Preakness, with its eccentric distance of a mile and
three-sixteenths _ with slightly less room to erase mistakes, to
allow true ability to assert itself.
</P>
<P>
   Distance was not the problem Saturday. Footing and balance and
poise made the difference. Fusaichi Pegasus, carrying 126 pounds
and the weight of his sport's expectations, seemed to be in good
position heading toward the homestretch, where he had fired so
impressively in the Derby. Instead, Red Bullet made his move.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he realized Fusaichi Pegasus was in trouble, Drysdale
said, ``When the horse accelerated, and he didn't come up.''
</P>
<P>
   The cold and the damp had hindered Fusaichi Pegasus, and maybe
that was only fair. All week long, Drysdale, from Surrey, England,
had tossed a bit of figurative cold water on the party by choosing
to conduct business in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven other Preakness horses were quartered in Barn
40, only a few steps from the endless supply of coffee and
doughnuts at the hospitality tent, Drysdale opted for the drab
security of a grassless cement compound at Barn 7, behind metal
gates.
</P>
<P>
   Blandly, Drysdale insisted he knew nothing of the security
measures that had guards locking the gates early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Being so close to the nation's capital, the home office of
duplicity, the mystery of the extra security could easily be
labeled Gategate.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the odd raised eyebrow _ hard to document on the
printed page _ there was little criticism of Drysdale's antisocial
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil is doing what the horse needs,'' Orseno had said. ``My
horse doesn't mind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Orseno knew his horse well enough to keep him out of the Derby
after a fruitless chase of Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to ask of the horse,'' Orseno had said. ``We had a
terrible ride in the Wood, which was why I held him out of the
Derby. I gave him a full week off, and he needed that week. We'd
like to have him for the rest of the year. I would have loved to
win the Derby _ but not at the horse's expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale and his Japanese ownership did nothing wrong by going
from the Derby to the Preakness. Nor did they create the longing
for a Triple Crown horse.
</P>
<P>
   They could control the workouts, and they could control the site
of the barn, but they could not control the surface at the
Preakness, where Derby winners are often taken down a peg, and this
year where dreams of a super horse are scattered like torn-up
mutuel tickets. &QL;

WANTED: CUBS ARMS IN BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs signed Eric Plunk and Tim Worrell to
minor-league contracts with the hope that after a few weeks, they
would be able to pitch in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find anyone to pitch in the bullpen,'' Cubs general
manager Ed Lynch said. ``If I have to keep shuffling guys in and
out, that's what I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   So far nothing has worked. The Cubs entered their weekend series
with Cincinnati having blown more saves (nine) than they converted
(seven). Their 7.45 ERA was the worst since STATS, Inc., began
keeping track of such numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Aguilera, once a trustworthy closer, lost the job to Todd
Van Poppel after allowing 10 runs in his last 5 innings. He's
allowed four homers and walked 12 in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything to improve the bullpen,'' Lynch said.
``Whether it's trades or signing guys that are struggling or
anything, We're trying to make it better. It's the main concern. We
had a four-run lead in the ninth inning last week and gave up
six.''
</P>
<P>
   Control is the main problem. The bullpen, which is 6-11, has
walked 101 in 129 innings, and manager Don Baylor said it's
affecting his decisions. Rather than go to his bullpen to protect a
one-run lead late Tuesday against the Dodgers, he left in Kevin
Tapani. Todd Hundley hit a three-run homer in the eighth to give
the Dodgers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't close the deal,'' Baylor said. ``If we could
close the deal, we'd be in the middle of the pack somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cubs are 16-27, and their .372 winning percentage
is second-worst in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Jones not Chipper: On the surface, Atlanta third baseman Chipper
Jones appears to be off to a nice start, but he's not thinking that
way. He's hitting .299 with 10 homers and 29 RBI, but the reigning
MVP thinks he should have much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hanging on right now,'' Jones said. ``My consistency,
average-wise and power-wise, has been terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the root of Jones' displeasure is his performance with
runners in scoring position. He's hitting .207 in that situation
after batting .308 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting myself out a lot, swinging at bad pitches,'' Jones
said. ``Sometimes, I feel so good that I feel I can hit any pitch
that they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Red hot: It wasn't too long ago Cincinnati was having all sorts
of problems in nearly every aspect and St. Louis was threatening to
blow open the NL Central. Now, the Reds and Cardinals are tied atop
the division after the Reds won eight of nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing like we have something to play for,'' shortstop
Barry Larkin said. ``I like the fight and the fact that everybody's
helping and playing hard. Different people are getting the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Mets lefty Al Leiter is 5-0 with a 3.24 ERA, much
different than the way he celebrated a four-year, $32 million
contract last season when he was 0-4 with a 6.12 ERA through eight
starts. ... Former Met and Dodger Bobby Bonilla is having a huge
laugh at the expense of the Mets, and manager Bobby Valentine in
particular. Bonilla is still being paid by the Mets, but he's
playing regularly for the Braves, who lead the NL East by five
games. ``I had to get out of New York because I wasn't playing.
This is like a gift. I'm ecstatic now. Hey, I'm doing the
Macarena,'' Bonilla said. ... Phillies lefty Randy Wolf, an El
Camino Real High graduate, struck out Mark McGwire three times
Wednesday then admitted afterward that he has had a poster of
McGwire on his bedroom wall since he was 12.

SLOW PACE OF MEDICAL INSURANCE PAYMENTS ANGERS DOCTORS, HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Anger among doctors and hospitals toward
slow-paying insurance companies is boiling over across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The anger has politicized doctors' groups, inspired medical
associations to press for tougher laws, spurred regulators to levy
fines and, in Missouri, sparked talk of a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, who have lobbied hard against more regulations, find
themselves on the defensive. Spokesmen say health insurers are
unfairly accused by medical activists. They insist the industry is
paying claims faster as it embraces computers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part consumers are asked _ perhaps unjustly _ to take
sides in the fracas, as they seek to vent their own frustration
with a complex system that can seem out of control. It can take
months and even years for bills to get paid. And the consumer
suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctor is angry at your insurer for making slow
payments ... the doctor may be less willing to see you and also may
ultimately drop your company,'' said Judy Waxman, deputy executive
director of Families USA, a consumer health-care advocacy group.
``And then you can't see that doctor at all.''
</P>
<P>
   State after state is confronting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say a lot of regulators are interested in
upgrading their laws on prompt pay,'' said Kansas Insurance
Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius. ``Regulatory activity has
increased.''  &LR; brkhed:Legislative fight
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action lately has focused on tougher legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves is expected to sign a ``prompt-pay law''
this week. Insurers would have to pay patient claims in 30 days or
face a 1 percent per month fine.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri a last-minute filibuster by two Republican
lawmakers, Sen. Larry Rohrbach of California and Sen. Walt Mueller
of St. Louis, effectively killed efforts to toughen prompt-pay
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holloway, director of the Missouri Medical Society, said
slow payment began drawing more attention last year when existing
laws proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing now is that a lot of anger just boiled
over,'' said Holloway. Doctors are discussing a class-action
lawsuit against the insurance industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical groups have been more successful in other states. More
than 30 states now have prompt-pay laws.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills were introduced this year in Illinois, Hawaii,
Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas the prompt-pay bill was sponsored by Sen. Karin
Brownlee, an Olathe Republican, and championed by Sebelius. It was
one of the few health insurance issues to get past a strong
insurance lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have figured out that they have to get involved, or
their practice of medicine won't be what it used to be,'' Brownlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Slaughter, executive director of the Kansas Medical
Society, said the new law gave Kansas its first ``clear law on
timeliness of payment of health insurance claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri more than 260 physicians, most of them Republicans,
called state GOP officials and begged them to refrain from opposing
or filibustering the prompt-pay bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed. While most state insurance plans agreed to a
compromise bill, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri, the
largest health insurer in the state, fought the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed the legislation because we thought it was
unnecessary,'' said Catherine Edwards, executive director of the
Missouri Association of Health Plans. She said the existing state
law addressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Missouri bill passed, it would have allowed physicians
to sue insurers for late payments and assess a $50-a-day fine to
cover administrative costs incurred by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McConnell, a spokesman for the Missouri Insurance
Department, said that Missouri laws now ``are not set up to provide
short-term relief for providers.''
Administrative chaos
</P>
<P>
   The present reality is abominable, said Steve Buie, a Kansas
City physician. He said the failure to strengthen Missouri's
prompt-pay bill ``underscores the chaos in the existing system.''
</P>
<P>
   Impatient doctors are, however, finding increasing support from
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Missouri Insurance Commissioner Keith Wenzel fined
Group Health Plan of St. Louis $100,000 for paying claims late. The
insurer had been warned three years earlier to pay more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the problems have expanded, we're just now seeing the
first wave of enforcement across the country,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest enforcement of this new wave has taken
place in Georgia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine ordered
insurers to start submitting detailed reports, complete with dates
when claims were received and paid.
</P>
<P>
   He levied fines against such HMOs as Aetna U.S. Healthcare of
Georgia, United Healthcare of Georgia, Humana Employers Health Care
of Georgia and HMO Georgia, the health maintenance organization for
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found they weren't paying on time even when they said they
had received a clean claim.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this past March hospitals and doctors in the state
recorded one of their best months for collections. ``The only way
to get their (insurers) attention is to hit them in the
pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Insurance Commissioner Steven Larsen recently entered
into consent agreements with four of that state's major health
plans amounting to more than $1.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three health plans _ Aetna U.S. Healthcare, FreeState and
UnitedHealthcare of the Mid-Atlantic _ were fined for failing to
properly oversee third-party service providers that paid medical
providers late. Kaiser Foundation health Plan was fined for use of
unapproved rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really surprised to find there was very little
oversight over these subcontractors,'' Larsen said. ``My sense was,
it was not so much part of an effort to purposely delay payment and
gain advantage of the flow of money. It was more a case of benign
neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   More actions are expected. More than 48 state and county medical
associations in the nation have surveyed members about insurance
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carson, a spokesman for the Alabama Medical Association,
said his state survey showed the time it took to pay claims ranged
widely from 14 days to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association reported that health plans in
some markets were more than 120 days late in paying clean claims.
</P>
<P>
   The association said some payments were a year late and some
practices were owed more than $1 million by a single insurance
company.  &LR; brkhed:Insurers respond
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry spokesmen rebut these findings.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Stewart, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, said providers shared the blame. ``One of the things
we have found...is that a lot of the time we're not getting all of
the information we need to process the claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America, said the AMA's information was simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming numbers of claims are processed within 14
days,'' he said. That would equal the average processing time for a
Medicare claim, the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   Coorsh says consumers are being misguided by doctors, who are
using the prompt-pay issue as ammunition to fight insurers in their
larger battle over managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospital officials are joining the fray, questioning
whether insurers are living up to their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies are giving us more and more excuses for
either paying more slowly or paying us not at all,'' said Dennis
McClatchey, a spokesman for Health Midwest, the area's largest
hospital and health system.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it takes insurers an average of 75 days to pay
health claims owed to Health Midwest, but that the hospital system
is expected to pay its vendors and employees within 30 days.
``Obviously, there's a problem there.''

AS TRENCHLESS METHOD OF LAYING CABLE INCREASES, SO DO ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON and ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The water-main break that temporarily cut off
service to thousands of Overland Park, Kan., and Leawood, Kan.,
residents last week was the latest accident attributed to
trenchless technology, an increasingly popular method of laying
underground lines.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly was not the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer an Independence man was seriously burned while
working in a manhole in downtown Kansas City. Electrical equipment
ignited gas that had migrated from a line pierced months earlier by
a contractor laying underground cable.
</P>
<P>
   Similar accidents have killed at least two Missouri residents in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And such accidents are on the rise around the country, at least
partly as a result of the competition among telecommunications
companies to set up fiberoptic networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a tremendous horse race going on _ who can get fiber
to the house first?'' said Rich Maxwell, an industry expert who
works for a Lenexa contracting company that uses trenchless
technology. ``They are racing to put it in as fast as they can. You
have very rapid deployment, and you have 10 times the underground
construction you had even three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to be first to offer new communications services,
trenchless technology _ also known as directional drilling _ is
often used for the delicate work of stitching together the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the amount of work being done, the industry is safe,
said Aubrey Holt, manager of marketing for Honeywell
International's sensor and guidance products unit in Austin, Texas.
But accidents occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately when they do happen, many people are affected,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trenchless technology is being cited in a growing number of
accidents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   John Fry was working in a Kansas City manhole last summer when
he turned on his drill and was blasted by a flash of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went off like a bomb in the hole,'' said Fry, 26, of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The cause: gas from a line pierced months earlier by a
contractor's drill.
</P>
<P>
   Fry spent nine days in the University of Kansas Medical Center's
burn unit and almost three months out of work, but he survived.
</P>
<P>
   In February a gas worker was killed by an explosion that
occurred when a contractor laying telephone cable hit a gas line
near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996 a southeast Missouri woman died when a house
exploded. Laclede Gas Co. did not realize that it had installed its
gas line right through a clay-tile sewer line three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Directional drilling equipment bores a hole through the ground
for hundreds of feet, and then the line or the pipe is pulled back
through the hole. The method allows contractors to lay pipe without
digging a trench. Streets remain undisturbed, saving time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Hazards, however, await as operators navigate through a maze of
underground pipelines, electrical cables, fiber optics, sewers and
water lines that crisscross one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real congestion may be underground, not at street level,''
said Leonard Krumm, director of field services for the city of
Minneapolis. ``There lies the danger of directional boring. You can
steer, but you can't see. You don't know what's ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, there is no central location that shows
where all the utilities are situated. Each utility keeps track of
its own network.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to underground utilities is common.
</P>
<P>
   A need for more oversight of the public right of way is a hot
topic among cities and counties, thanks to passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The act opened the markets to competing phone companies,
spurring the rush to put fiberoptic networks into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Before the act, most cities had to deal with six utilities _
gas, electric, telephone, cable, sewer and water, said Krumm of
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of just one phone company, there are multiple
companies asking _ in some instances demanding _ to lay cable in
the public right of way.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, for example, 14 telecommunications companies
have placed cables in the public right of way. In Overland Park
eight companies have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis, which was among the first cities to feel the
effects of the telecommunications boom, has 22, and three more have
asked to enter the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes for a very congested underground,'' said Krumm,
considered a leading expert on right of way management.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates a need for city ordinances to address the
growing use of public right of way, said John MacMullen,
professional development manager for the American Public Works
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the right of way does not mean driving the companies
away, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a municipality and city, this is something you want to have
happen,'' said Robert Albee, director of telecommunications
engineering at Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, in Watertown, Mass., and
former chief engineer for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to have them come in and do it in a managed way
and a responsible way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for example, had so many companies asking for access to
the right of way to lay fiberoptic cable, the city forced them to
work together and place their cables at the same time in the same
trench.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Boston's streets already are full of existing
utilities, the new telecommunications companies were forced to use
trenchless technology and bore holes up to 35 feet below the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   While some in government and the utility industry view more
regulation as the antidote, the trenchless technology industry is
working on its own cures.
</P>
<P>
   As an industry expert and manager of new project development at
A&AMP;L Underground in Lenexa, Maxwell works nationally to set training
standards for operators. The industry has a good track record,
given the amount of digging going on, he said, but operators need
to be better-trained.
</P>
<P>
   His company has developed a curriculum to train its employees
and sponsored a training program at Missouri Western State College
in St. Joseph in 1998 and earlier this year. Maxwell also supports
requiring operator certification to ensure proper training.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Society for Trenchless Technology is working
on a training curriculum for operators.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit educational group is also developing a ``best
practices'' manual to make digs safer, said John Hemphill,
assistant to the chairman of the society.
</P>
<P>
   And equipment manufacturers are responding to accidents.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago equipment manuals had little warning against
hitting power lines, said Ron Rosencrans, editor of the trade
publication Underground Focus. More recently, equipment
manufacturer Ditch Witch produced a CD-ROM that took operators
through a crowd of utility lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerned about digging accidents want better government
oversight of companies that use the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government last year issued a report detailing the
best practices in the industry that prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Missouri lawmakers were urged this year to strengthen
regulations, but neither legislature did. Kansas lawmakers did set
up a task force to study underground digging and make
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy wants cities to adopt ordinances to require
contractors to call gas companies before they dig using trenchless
technology, said Rob Hack, vice president of pricing and regulatory
affairs for Missouri Gas Energy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none has.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies have a stake in better oversight,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telecommunications people are very interested in cities
doing a good job of managing public right of way also, because (the
companies) are the ones who are putting cable in ground,'' said
MacMullen. ``The better job the cities do, the better they are at
protecting what is there. It keeps their cable from being cut in
the future.''

LAKERS BEAT TRAILBLAZERS, 109-94 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shouts of ``MVP! MVP!'' cascaded around Shaquille
O'Neal Saturday afternoon, only the fans were not cheering a
spectacular dunk or a blocked shot by the Lakers' center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal stood at the free-throw line with Game 1 of the National
Basketball Association's Western Conference finals still undecided,
certainly a situation that normally fills the Staples Center with
tension.
</P>
<P>
   Not Saturday, not during the final five minutes of the Lakers'
109-94 victory. O'Neal survived a brutal contest of Hack-a-Shaq and
made 8 of 12 free throws down the stretch to finish off the
Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, O'Neal made seven consecutive free throws,
thwarting the Trail Blazers' effort to rally from a 26-point
first-half deficit.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal led the Lakers with 41 points and 11 rebounds. Glen Rice
added 15 points and Kobe Bryant had 13. O'Neal made 13 of 27 free
throws to counter Portland's strategy of intentionally fouling him
to put him on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player,'' Coach Mike Dunleavy of the Trail
Blazers said. ``I like Shaq a lot. He just can't make all his free
throws. From my point of view, if we had scored a few more times in
that stretch, we'd have been right back in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had closed to 97-88 with 4 minutes 50 seconds
to play. Scottie Pippen scored 19 points and Bonzi Wells had 17,
all in the second half, to lead Portland, which lost Rasheed
Wallace midway through the third quarter when he was ejected after
a second technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going pretty good until they started to
hack Shaq,'' Coach Phil Jackson of the Lakers said. ``That got the
crowd into it and got him focused to hit seven in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the Lakers' weapons fired with expert precision en route
to a 63-42 first-half lead. O'Neal scored 12 points and Bryant had
12, but Robert Horry led the decisive rally, a 26-4 run that
covered almost eight minutes of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Horry came off the bench and scored all 12 of his points in that
span. He and Rice capped the run with consecutive 3-point baskets,
then stood chest-to-chest during a Portland timeout, ignoring the
towel-waving and back-slapping along the Lakers' bench. Four and a
half minutes remained in the second quarter, but already the Lakers
led by 52-30.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpshooting Horry and Rice calmly bumped fists, quietly
acknowledging their work with a firm nod. Meanwhile, the Trail
Blazers cast puzzled looks at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Portland did not shoot poorly (52.8 percent) or rebound badly
(12 rebounds to the Lakers' 17) in the first half. But the Trail
Blazers failed to extend their defense far enough to bother the
Lakers' 3-point shooters, who drilled 8 of 12 attempts. Portland
made only 4 of 10 from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers went to the free-throw line 24 times, compared
to the Lakers' 43 times. Dunleavy had complained all week about a
variety of officiating subjects, including his team's shortage of
free-throw attempts against the Lakers this season.
</P>
<P>
   His frustration continued Saturday as the Lakers were called for
only eight fouls _ none were committed during the act of shooting _
while they made 7 of 9 free throws in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell down in some defensive areas, but they hit shots, and
we couldn't get to the line,'' Dunleavy said. ``That was a big
factor.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Terminal cancer patient reunites with her sons
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pain of terminal liver cancer turned to
10 minutes of wailing when Marie Mercius saw her four sons together
for the first time in seven years Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   Mercius yelled those words in Creole so many times that a
hospital employee opened the door to check what was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The employee saw the boys and left politely. By now, most of the
nurses and patients and even the patients' families at Bethesda
Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach knew something of Mercius'
terrible and wonderful and yet terrible story.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told her she's dying. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service bent its rules and the community chipped in
so three of her sons could fly in from Haiti Friday night and apply
to become permanent residents. Her fourth son came to West Palm
Beach to live with her four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, thank God . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   Mercius was standing when she saw them, but collapsed face-first
onto the bed at the sight of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Her two 6-foot boys _ Jacques Sully, 19, and Yvelor Sully, 15 _
lifted her. They were quiet, but sobbing as hard as she was.
Pierre, 11 and developmentally disabled, clung to Jacques, unable
to comprehend the gravity of the journey he had just made. He
yelled, ``Mama,'' as he had been doing all morning and licked his
brother's ear. Rock, the 13-year-old who's been living with his
mother, sat silently in the corner of the hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   Mercius spent the week willing herself to live, yet worrying
that when she soon dies the teenage sons _ who lost their father
seven years ago _ won't have parents anymore. The sons weren't told
of their mother's condition directly. Yet they knew she was sick
and they accepted their first plane ride and the beginning of their
American life with a kind of nervous wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   If she hadn't been near death, INS officials would not have
bumped her up on their list of applicants to grant her residency
Monday. And the agency would not have offered Mercius' sons parole
status _ a step that lets them stay in this country legally while
they apply for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Mercius, 46 and aware of all of those bitterly ironic factors as
she clutched her sons Saturday, begged God to let her live.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was the apex of an anxious 30 hours that saw her
three sons emigrate from the hemisphere's poorest country to its
richest.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques, Yvelor and Pierre awoke at 5 a.m. Friday in a Haitian
town called Arcahaie, where they had been living with their
grandparents since their mother left. Marie Mercius said she was
forced to leave because, as a cook to the children of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, her life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In Arcahaie, Jacques and Yvelor had lots of friends and played
lots of basketball. They watched television and rooted for Los
Angeles Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre, the youngest, received special attention from his
brothers, his aunt, his uncle and, especially, his grandmother.
When he's not being watched and held, he often falls down or hits
himself. His right wrist has deep scars because he couldn't resist
touching fire one time. He can't talk in complete sentences, but
he's able to let others know when he's thirsty, said Kledanor
Mercius, the boys' uncle.
</P>
<P>
   When they were ready to leave the house for the last time
Friday, Uncle Kledanor loaded his rusted white Isuzu pickup with a
floral suitcase and a wicker love seat. Kledanor usually uses the
truck to haul Coca-Cola and beer 35 minutes from Port-au-Prince,
earning the equivalent of about one U.S. dollar for each case he
resells. Thirty to fifty cases a week affords him a decent living
by Haitian standards.
</P>
<P>
   Including their grandfather, their aunt and Kledanor's
girlfriend, there were seven of them in the truck. By 7 a.m., they
reached the INS office in Port-au-Prince, hoping their immigration
papers had arrived in time for them leave on the afternoon flight
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Nebraska had sent their paperwork by overnight
mail on Monday. But because service to Haiti is slow, the
definition of ``overnight'' can be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the documents had arrived, removing one
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the children met the woman who championed their
cause _ a Haitian-American activist. Daniella Henry, executive
director of the Haitian-American Community Center, learned the
depth of Marie Mercius' illness two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Henry spent much of the past two weeks calling in favors from
INS agents who have appeared on her local Creole radio show. Not
only did INS officials expedite the families' applications to a
dramatic extent, they also agreed to waive more than $600 in fees
due when the children apply for permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   Henry persuaded Air Haiti to donate plane tickets for the
children. She raised money in the community so the boys' aunts in
West Palm Beach could buy them new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry arrived at the INS office in Haiti, she handed them
bags of new clothes and helped them finish filling out forms. The
family spent the rest of the morning at a clinic, collecting their
medical documents.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques and Yvelor were remarkably subdued, almost dejected.
Although their uncle said he kept their mother's terminal condition
a secret from them, they have had hints. At one point, Yvelor
started looking at a Palm Beach Post story and photo from last week
that showed his very ill mother in her hospital room. Though he
cannot read English, he saw the picture, and his uncle immediately
grabbed it from him.
</P>
<P>
   The boys changed from their American-style baggy pants and
name-brand T-shirts into slacks, button-down shirts and ties. They
were about to see Port-au-Prince for the last time from the back of
a flat-bed truck.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques hummed under his breath and Yvelor gazed, occasionally
wiping his eyes of dust and _ perhaps _ tears. They were riding
behind a Haitian taptap bus that was so crowded, seven people were
hanging out the back.
</P>
<P>
   Between the vast potholes, people and cars fought for space,
carefully dodging older cars that had been run-down and abandoned
in the median. The smells of exhaust, trash and smoke competed for
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Port-au-Prince resembles a huge outdoor flea market. One person
sells chickens next to another who sells mangos or mattresses. On
another block, they're selling motor oil and tires. Down from
there, it's leather bags and furniture. The buildings behind the
make-shift stores are either crumbling or under construction,
except for the glistening new yellow Shell gas stations or the
black and red Texacos.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the city stands the mountains, reminding a visitor that
this is, at heart, a homeland worthy of the kind of nostalgia
Jacques and Yvelor must have been experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane took off, Yvelor continued to stare out the window,
down at the Island of Hispaniola and the Caribbean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying goodbye to Haiti, I guess,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, he and his brothers would be clear of customs and
in Henry's silver Toyota 4-Runner, headed from Miami to Palm Beach
County. They wondered why Interstate 95 was so smooth and free of
traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   Henry called their mother with her cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been in the hospital with you. That's where I
need to be,'' Jacques said to his mother, according to Henry's
translation.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation lifted their mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is good,'' Jacques said in English.
</P>
<P>
   The three sons spent Friday night with two aunts, who will
likely look out for them if their mother dies, as doctors say she
will.
</P>
<P>
   They were asking to see their mother, but it was nearly 10 p.m.
The next morning, there would be time for a visit with Dr. Serge
Thys, a local Haitian psychiatrist who specializes in children and
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Thys counseled them for free and handed Henry money so they
could buy their mother a plant, a get-well balloon and a vase with
two pink roses.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, meanwhile, was reading the Bible, Psalm 46. ``God
is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
</P>
<P>
   trouble . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The boys spent the afternoon with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she'll undergo a biopsy so doctors can determine how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that she will eventually die of this disease _
timetable uncertain,'' said Dr. Eyal Meiri, one of her oncologists.
``The great thing here is that her family was able to see her.''

STANFORD TO FACE GEORGIA IN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Georgia's 'Dawgs will find out whether or not
they are barking up the wrong Trees in today's NCAA women's tennis
championship match.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford and Georgia advanced to the final with relatively easy
semifinal victories Saturday at Pepperdine. The Cardinal, which has
been ranked No.1 in the nation all season, beat Pacific-10 rival
Cal 5-0, and the No.2 Bulldogs beat SEC rival Florida 5-2. Stanford
and Georgia meet at 1 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of the team, because we came out with a lot
of intensity,'' said Stanford's second singles player, Laura
Granville, who earned a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Amy Jensen. ``We know
we are the top seed and everybody is gunning for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top-ranked singles player, Stanford's Marissa Irvin
(a Harvard-Westlake High graduate) struggled with her serve in the
first set but then blistered Anita Kurimay for a 6-7 (7-3), 6-1,
6-1 victory. Irvin double-faulted three times in the first-set
tiebreaker and had her serve broken to begin the second set, but
broke right back and took control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marissa has grown up a lot in the past couple years, and she
has a lot of poise and confidence,'' Stanford coach Frank Brennan
said.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Lauren Kalvaria and No. 6 Keiko Tokuda earned two-set
victories, and No. 5 Jennifer Heiser won in three, but Brennan was
most impressed with Granville, who has lost just nine games in her
three matches this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably one of the best college tennis matches I've
seen,'' Brennan said. ``Granville probably hits the best passing
shots in college tennis, and Jensen is great with the serve and
volley. Granville, she's an assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had a little more difficult time than Stanford, as the
Bulldogs had to play doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia quickly fell behind when Whitney Laiho, ranked No. 8 in
the country, upset No. 5 Aarthi Venkatesan 6-0, 7-5. Georgia's
Esther Knox, Marissa Catlin, Lori Grey and Kelly Baskin each earned
singles victories.
</P>
<P>
   Florida forced the doubles play with a 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 victory by
Anne Nguyen over Julie Scaringe at No. 6 singles. Nguyen had
dropped the first two games of the third set.
</P>
<P>
   ``That win was important to us for two reasons,'' Florida coach
Andy Brandi said. ``First, because it kept us in the match
obviously, but also because I thought it would give us some
momentum going into the doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no such luck for the Gators. Georgia's top doubles
team of Catlin and Grey, ranked second in the nation, used four
service breaks to win 8-3. Georgia also led in the other two
doubles matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the doubles have been strong all year, so we were
pretty confident,'' Georgia coach Jeff Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The draw for the singles tournament, which begins Monday, was
announced, with Irvin receiving the top seed, as expected. Texas'
Janet Walker was seeded second, followed by Adria Engel of Wake
Forest and Zuzana Lesenarova of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Sara Walker and Annica Cooper, USC's Veronika Safarova
and Jewel Peterson, and Ipek Senoglu of Pepperdine will compete in
the 64-player tournament.

BUICK CLASSIC NEXT MONTH LURES A TOP FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new date for this year's Buick Classic has helped the
tournament attract a solid field.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament will be held from June 8-11 at
Westchester Country Club in Harrison, N.Y., the week before the
United States Open at Pebble Beach. Although some players choose to
take a week off before a major, many players use the Buick Classic
as a tune-up. Five of the top 15 players in the current world
ranking have already committed to play the Buick Classic _ Davis
Love III, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson, Tom Lehman and Sergio Garcia.
And Jim Furyk, ranked No. 12 in the world, said Tuesday that he
intends to play as well.
</P>
<P>
   A few international players will also stop in New York to play
the Buick on their way to Pebble Beach. Paul Lawrie, the reigning
British Open champion, is in the field, along with Jean Van de
Velde.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is unlikely Tiger Woods will play, even though
Buick is one of his sponsors. The world's No. 1 player has a policy
of taking the week off before a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Tiger does something totally different from what he has
done in the past, we're not expecting him,'' said Peter Mele, the
Buick Classic tournament director. ``But we've been speaking with
many other players and we're hoping they'll commit soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of top players who played last year have yet to commit
themselves: David Duval, Vijay Singh, Fred Couples, Lee Janzen and
Justin Leonard. But all of them could still opt to play because the
commitment deadline is not until the Friday before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Buick Classic, which was won by Duffy Waldorf, was
played the week after the United States Open and some players
elected to rest. But Furyk said that Westchester is an excellent
place to prepare for the year's second major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westchester is one of the best layouts we see and it's one of
my favorite places to play,'' Furyk said. ``The biggest decision
about whether to play this year was having to travel across the
country for the Open the next week. But I think I'm going to go
ahead and play Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Westchester, you know the rough is going to be high and you
have to keep the ball in the fairway. That's similar to the Open.
It's not as demanding as the Open, where par is a good score, but
it's a challenging tournament that prepares you for what we'll see
the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   LOPEZ HAS GALLBLADDER SURGERY
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez underwent successful surgery last Tuesday to remove
her gallbladder. She is expected to be released from a Georgia
hospital later this week, and because the surgery requires a short
recovery period, Lopez is not expected to miss significant time
from this year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old Ladies Professional Golf Association Hall of Fame
player, Lopez has 48 career victories, but she has not won since
1997. She is 78th on this year's money list, with $31,769 in five
starts. Last Sunday, she tied for 32nd at the Electrolux USA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The next women's major is the McDonald's LPGA Championship, June
22-25 in Wilmington, Del., and Lopez hopes to be at full strength
by then.
</P>
<P>
   PARNEVIK TO FACE WOODS AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   After holding off a late charge by Tiger Woods to win the GTE
Byron Nelson Classic last Sunday, Jesper Parnevik will compete
against Woods again beginning Thursday in Germany at the Deutsche
Bank _ SAP Open. Woods is the defending champion, headlining a
field that includes Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood, Michael
Campbell and Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik is playing the bulk of his schedule this year on the
PGA Tour. However, he will play four events on the European Tour,
hoping to finish in the top 12 on the European money list through
mid-August. That would earn him a spot in the NEC Invitational
(Aug. 24-27), a World Golf Championships event that has a $1
million first-place prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I rejoined the European Tour this year, because
that was my last resort to get into the NEC,'' Parnevik said. ``You
have to get into the World Golf Championships events, or else you
get too far behind on the U.S. money list.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik is third on the PGA Tour money list with more than
$2.13 million, trailing only Woods ($3.59 million) and Hal Sutton
($2.34 million). &QL;

PACERS ADVANCE, BUT CELEBRATION CAN WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Knicks and the Miami Heat prepared for Game 7
Saturday, the Indiana Pacers eagerly awaited the winner.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, the Pacers have reached the
Eastern Conference finals. They have confidence, they have
experience, and they will have home-court advantage against either
of their potential opponents. But the Pacers have a lot to prove to
themselves, and to whichever team they face.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have never reached the National Basketball
Association finals, and last year's conclusion was particularly
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by two games to one in the Eastern conference finals
against the Knicks last year, the Pacers fell apart as the Knicks
won three consecutive games to reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a galling loss for the Pacers, who had allowed a
shorthanded Knicks team to take over the series without Patrick
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the atmosphere in the Pacers' locker room Friday
night was subdued as the players left quietly like businessmen
leaving a board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers advanced Friday at Philadelphia by ousting the 76ers,
106-90, to win their playoff series, 4-2. But the 76ers quickly
became past history for the Pacers, because if the Pacers do not go
any further, they will consider this season a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to celebrate?'' said Reggie Miller, the Pacers'
shooting guard and a longtime Knicks nemesis, who led the Pacers
with 25 points. ``We've been here what, four, five times before? We
still have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Miller to speak his mind. Asked Friday night which
team he would rather face next, he said: ``Personally, I'd rather
play the Knicks, because we could exorcise some demons there. But
we could also start a great new rivalry with the Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Heat won Friday, an Indiana-Miami series would have
started Sunday. Now, the Pacers must wait until Tuesday to play,
and their players seemed unsure whether that would be to their
advantage or disadvantage. The Pacers will get a few days to rest,
but they could also lose their competitive rhythm. Coach Larry Bird
said he could usually sense how the Pacers will respond before a
game starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to play well tonight, because we had two
good days of practice going into the game,'' Bird said after
Friday's victory. ``I keep telling these guys that when we practice
well, it carries right over into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remained to be seen if the Pacers can finally make it to
the finals. The franchise is at a crossroad. Bird has said he will
not coach beyond this year. Miller is 34 years old. Rik Smits, the
starting center, is 33 and has a history of foot problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers believe their time is now. And if their core group
does not get it done this time, expect key changes in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers are already a different team than last season.
Antonio Davis, a longtime forward, was traded to the Toronto
Raptors before the season, and Austin Croshere has assumed much of
Davis' playing time. But while Croshere is a better shooter than
Davis, the Pacers could miss Davis' rebounding and defense in the
next series, which is sure to be rugged, no matter which team they
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, not having Antonio is the major difference for us,
but a lot of guys have stepped up and played well without him this
year,'' said Jalen Rose, the Pacers' second-leading scorer, who had
21 points Friday. ``Antonio's not here, so we can't focus on that.
Hopefully, we can be a better team and go farther than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Rose has stepped forward this season to become a
second reliable scoring option, the Pacers will be led by Miller,
who never gets tired of playoff pressure and who loves to drive
opposing fans crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought Friday when 76ers fans directed a
derogatory chant toward him, Miller smiled and said, ``I thought
they were saying, `Reggie rocks.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a hostile environment, with 20,000 people who
have been all day drinking, making signs, cursing your name forward
and backward, and they're coming to taunt you? To me, that's the
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs are when I'm at my best, when I can focus on one
opponent, rest my body between games, watch plenty of film on my
opponent, and come out ready,'' Miller said. ``I love being a part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Pacers want something more. ``I've done this before,''
Rose said of his reaction to reaching the conference finals. ``But
I want to win a championship.''

SLOW PACE OF MEDICAL INSURANCE PAYMENTS ANGERS DOCTORS, HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anger among doctors and hospitals toward slow-paying insurance
companies is boiling over across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The anger has politicized doctors' groups, inspired medical
associations to press for tougher laws, spurred regulators to levy
fines and, in Missouri, sparked talk of a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, who have lobbied hard against more regulations, find
themselves on the defensive. Spokesmen say health insurers are
unfairly accused by medical activists. They insist the industry is
paying claims faster as it embraces computers.
</P>
<P>
   For their part consumers are asked _ perhaps unjustly _ to take
sides in the fracas, as they seek to vent their own frustration
with a complex system that can seem out of control. It can take
months and even years for bills to get paid. And the consumer
suffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctor is angry at your insurer for making slow
payments ... the doctor may be less willing to see you and also may
ultimately drop your company,'' said Judy Waxman, deputy executive
director of Families USA, a consumer health-care advocacy group.
``And then you can't see that doctor at all.''
</P>
<P>
   State after state is confronting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say a lot of regulators are interested in
upgrading their laws on prompt pay,'' said Kansas Insurance
Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius. ``Regulatory activity has
increased.''  &LR; brkhed:Legislative fight
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action lately has focused on tougher legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves is expected to sign a ``prompt-pay law''
this week. Insurers would have to pay patient claims in 30 days or
face a 1 percent per month fine.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri a last-minute filibuster by two Republican
lawmakers, Sen. Larry Rohrbach of California and Sen. Walt Mueller
of St. Louis, effectively killed efforts to toughen prompt-pay
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holloway, director of the Missouri Medical Society, said
slow payment began drawing more attention last year when existing
laws proved ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing now is that a lot of anger just boiled
over,'' said Holloway. Doctors are discussing a class-action
lawsuit against the insurance industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical groups have been more successful in other states. More
than 30 states now have prompt-pay laws.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills were introduced this year in Illinois, Hawaii,
Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas the prompt-pay bill was sponsored by Sen. Karin
Brownlee, an Olathe Republican, and championed by Sebelius. It was
one of the few health insurance issues to get past a strong
insurance lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have figured out that they have to get involved, or
their practice of medicine won't be what it used to be,'' Brownlee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Slaughter, executive director of the Kansas Medical
Society, said the new law gave Kansas its first ``clear law on
timeliness of payment of health insurance claims.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri more than 260 physicians, most of them Republicans,
called state GOP officials and begged them to refrain from opposing
or filibustering the prompt-pay bill.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed. While most state insurance plans agreed to a
compromise bill, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri, the
largest health insurer in the state, fought the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed the legislation because we thought it was
unnecessary,'' said Catherine Edwards, executive director of the
Missouri Association of Health Plans. She said the existing state
law addressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Missouri bill passed, it would have allowed physicians
to sue insurers for late payments and assess a $50-a-day fine to
cover administrative costs incurred by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McConnell, a spokesman for the Missouri Insurance
Department, said that Missouri laws now ``are not set up to provide
short-term relief for providers.''  &LR; brkhed:Administrative chaos
</P>
<P>
   The present reality is abominable, said Steve Buie, a Kansas
City physician. He said the failure to strengthen Missouri's
prompt-pay bill ``underscores the chaos in the existing system.''
</P>
<P>
   Impatient doctors are, however, finding increasing support from
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Missouri Insurance Commissioner Keith Wenzel fined
Group Health Plan of St. Louis $100,000 for paying claims late. The
insurer had been warned three years earlier to pay more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the problems have expanded, we're just now seeing the
first wave of enforcement across the country,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughest enforcement of this new wave has taken
place in Georgia and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine ordered
insurers to start submitting detailed reports, complete with dates
when claims were received and paid.
</P>
<P>
   He levied fines against such HMOs as Aetna U.S. Healthcare of
Georgia, United Healthcare of Georgia, Humana Employers Health Care
of Georgia and HMO Georgia, the health maintenance organization for
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found they weren't paying on time even when they said they
had received a clean claim.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this past March hospitals and doctors in the state
recorded one of their best months for collections. ``The only way
to get their (insurers) attention is to hit them in the
pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Insurance Commissioner Steven Larsen recently entered
into consent agreements with four of that state's major health
plans amounting to more than $1.26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three health plans _ Aetna U.S. Healthcare, FreeState and
UnitedHealthcare of the Mid-Atlantic _ were fined for failing to
properly oversee third-party service providers that paid medical
providers late. Kaiser Foundation health Plan was fined for use of
unapproved rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really surprised to find there was very little
oversight over these subcontractors,'' Larsen said. ``My sense was,
it was not so much part of an effort to purposely delay payment and
gain advantage of the flow of money. It was more a case of benign
neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   More actions are expected. More than 48 state and county medical
associations in the nation have surveyed members about insurance
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carson, a spokesman for the Alabama Medical Association,
said his state survey showed the time it took to pay claims ranged
widely from 14 days to 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association reported that health plans in
some markets were more than 120 days late in paying clean claims.
</P>
<P>
   The association said some payments were a year late and some
practices were owed more than $1 million by a single insurance
company.  &LR; brkhed:Insurers respond
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry spokesmen rebut these findings.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Stewart, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, said providers shared the blame. ``One of the things
we have found...is that a lot of the time we're not getting all of
the information we need to process the claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America, said the AMA's information was simply wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming numbers of claims are processed within 14
days,'' he said. That would equal the average processing time for a
Medicare claim, the industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   Coorsh says consumers are being misguided by doctors, who are
using the prompt-pay issue as ammunition to fight insurers in their
larger battle over managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospital officials are joining the fray, questioning
whether insurers are living up to their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies are giving us more and more excuses for
either paying more slowly or paying us not at all,'' said Dennis
McClatchey, a spokesman for Health Midwest, the area's largest
hospital and health system.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it takes insurers an average of 75 days to pay
health claims owed to Health Midwest, but that the hospital system
is expected to pay its vendors and employees within 30 days.
``Obviously, there's a problem there.''

AS TRENCHLESS METHOD OF LAYING CABLE INCREASES, SO DO ACCIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON and ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The water-main break that temporarily cut off service to
thousands of Overland Park, Kan., and Leawood, Kan., residents last
week was the latest accident attributed to trenchless technology,
an increasingly popular method of laying underground lines.
</P>
<P>
   But it certainly was not the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer an Independence man was seriously burned while
working in a manhole in downtown Kansas City. Electrical equipment
ignited gas that had migrated from a line pierced months earlier by
a contractor laying underground cable.
</P>
<P>
   Similar accidents have killed at least two Missouri residents in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And such accidents are on the rise around the country, at least
partly as a result of the competition among telecommunications
companies to set up fiberoptic networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a tremendous horse race going on _ who can get fiber
to the house first?'' said Rich Maxwell, an industry expert who
works for a Lenexa contracting company that uses trenchless
technology. ``They are racing to put it in as fast as they can. You
have very rapid deployment, and you have 10 times the underground
construction you had even three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to be first to offer new communications services,
trenchless technology _ also known as directional drilling _ is
often used for the delicate work of stitching together the
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the amount of work being done, the industry is safe,
said Aubrey Holt, manager of marketing for Honeywell
International's sensor and guidance products unit in Austin, Texas.
But accidents occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately when they do happen, many people are affected,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trenchless technology is being cited in a growing number of
accidents, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   John Fry was working in a Kansas City manhole last summer when
he turned on his drill and was blasted by a flash of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went off like a bomb in the hole,'' said Fry, 26, of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The cause: gas from a line pierced months earlier by a
contractor's drill.
</P>
<P>
   Fry spent nine days in the University of Kansas Medical Center's
burn unit and almost three months out of work, but he survived.
</P>
<P>
   In February a gas worker was killed by an explosion that
occurred when a contractor laying telephone cable hit a gas line
near St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996 a southeast Missouri woman died when a house
exploded. Laclede Gas Co. did not realize that it had installed its
gas line right through a clay-tile sewer line three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Directional drilling equipment bores a hole through the ground
for hundreds of feet, and then the line or the pipe is pulled back
through the hole. The method allows contractors to lay pipe without
digging a trench. Streets remain undisturbed, saving time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Hazards, however, await as operators navigate through a maze of
underground pipelines, electrical cables, fiber optics, sewers and
water lines that crisscross one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real congestion may be underground, not at street level,''
said Leonard Krumm, director of field services for the city of
Minneapolis. ``There lies the danger of directional boring. You can
steer, but you can't see. You don't know what's ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, there is no central location that shows
where all the utilities are situated. Each utility keeps track of
its own network.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to underground utilities is common.
</P>
<P>
   A need for more oversight of the public right of way is a hot
topic among cities and counties, thanks to passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The act opened the markets to competing phone companies,
spurring the rush to put fiberoptic networks into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Before the act, most cities had to deal with six utilities _
gas, electric, telephone, cable, sewer and water, said Krumm of
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of just one phone company, there are multiple
companies asking _ in some instances demanding _ to lay cable in
the public right of way.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, for example, 14 telecommunications companies
have placed cables in the public right of way. In Overland Park
eight companies have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis, which was among the first cities to feel the
effects of the telecommunications boom, has 22, and three more have
asked to enter the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes for a very congested underground,'' said Krumm,
considered a leading expert on right of way management.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates a need for city ordinances to address the
growing use of public right of way, said John MacMullen,
professional development manager for the American Public Works
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the right of way does not mean driving the companies
away, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a municipality and city, this is something you want to have
happen,'' said Robert Albee, director of telecommunications
engineering at Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, in Watertown, Mass., and
former chief engineer for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to have them come in and do it in a managed way
and a responsible way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for example, had so many companies asking for access to
the right of way to lay fiberoptic cable, the city forced them to
work together and place their cables at the same time in the same
trench.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Boston's streets already are full of existing
utilities, the new telecommunications companies were forced to use
trenchless technology and bore holes up to 35 feet below the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   While some in government and the utility industry view more
regulation as the antidote, the trenchless technology industry is
working on its own cures.
</P>
<P>
   As an industry expert and manager of new project development at
A&AMP;L Underground in Lenexa, Maxwell works nationally to set training
standards for operators. The industry has a good track record,
given the amount of digging going on, he said, but operators need
to be better-trained.
</P>
<P>
   His company has developed a curriculum to train its employees
and sponsored a training program at Missouri Western State College
in St. Joseph in 1998 and earlier this year. Maxwell also supports
requiring operator certification to ensure proper training.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Society for Trenchless Technology is working
on a training curriculum for operators.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit educational group is also developing a ``best
practices'' manual to make digs safer, said John Hemphill,
assistant to the chairman of the society.
</P>
<P>
   And equipment manufacturers are responding to accidents.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago equipment manuals had little warning against
hitting power lines, said Ron Rosencrans, editor of the trade
publication Underground Focus. More recently, equipment
manufacturer Ditch Witch produced a CD-ROM that took operators
through a crowd of utility lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerned about digging accidents want better government
oversight of companies that use the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government last year issued a report detailing the
best practices in the industry that prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas and Missouri lawmakers were urged this year to strengthen
regulations, but neither legislature did. Kansas lawmakers did set
up a task force to study underground digging and make
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gas Energy wants cities to adopt ordinances to require
contractors to call gas companies before they dig using trenchless
technology, said Rob Hack, vice president of pricing and regulatory
affairs for Missouri Gas Energy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none has.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies have a stake in better oversight,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telecommunications people are very interested in cities
doing a good job of managing public right of way also, because (the
companies) are the ones who are putting cable in ground,'' said
MacMullen. ``The better job the cities do, the better they are at
protecting what is there. It keeps their cable from being cut in
the future.''

MARCHING ORDERS CONFUSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the real Rheal please stand up?
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said he raised his left arm as a
signal to the bullpen to summon lefty reliever Rheal Cormier
moments after Tim Wakefield was struck in the calf by a shot off
the bat of Detroit's Jose Macias.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, the man who had been throwing, righthander John
Wasdin, decided to go the extra mile _ or in this case the extra
300 or so feet, from the pen to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen coach John Cumberland had sent Wasdin out on his
seventh-inning rescue mission, but Williams motioned him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cumberland) said, `They're calling for you,' '' said Wasdin,
one of six Boston pitchers who helped lower the staff ERA Saturday
but didn't quite slam the door on the Tigers. ``So I said, `I'm
going.' All of a sudden I'm running in there, and oops . . . wrong
guy. I just ran out there before (Williams) actually made the call
which pitcher he wanted to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier retired Gregg Jefferies to end the inning, then Wasdin
faced two batters to start the eighth in the 2-1 Red Sox loss.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin said that while he's never been in a similar situation,
it wasn't the first time he's seen the wrong man enter and then
exit stage right.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I didn't get all the way to the mound like Flash (Tom
Gordon) did last year,'' Wasdin said, referring to a Gordon
appearance last season in which he was yanked off the mound before
throwing a pitch because he hadn't been activated. ``Well, at least
I got an extra sprint in today.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Brian Rose finished a five-batter stint in relief of
Tim Young _ who had replaced Wasdin _ the only pitchers left in the
Boston bullpen were Derek Lowe and Rich Garces, each of whom helped
shut down the Tigers Friday night, and Lowe was throwing in case
the offense put him in a save situation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time this one was over, Williams and Detroit manager Phil
Garner had used 11 pitchers, something that seemed improbable the
way starters Pete Schourek and Dave Mlicki battled to a 1-1 draw
through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But after Schourek had reached 97 pitches on the cold afternoon,
it was time for Wakefield. The lights went on at Fenway just before
he took the mound to start the sixth, and then Juan Gonzalez lit up
Wakefield with a shot over the Green Monster that proved to be the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   But Wakefield settled down, only to get plunked on the left calf
by Macias's infield hit. He took one warmup toss and said he could
have stayed in the game, but Williams decided to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   That set in motion Williams's debut as a Boston traffic cop,
stopping Wasdin in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised my left hand because with an injury you can bring in
any guy you want,'' said Williams. ``And because in a lot of cases,
nobody's warming up. I told the umpire, `Cormier,' so I guess it
tells me that Wasdin just wants to pitch. Nothing wrong with that.
He was just one hitter ahead of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier took about 20 warmup pitches after passing Wasdin on the
now two-lane highway to the pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously someone made a mistake,'' Cormier said with a
chuckle. ``So I just grabbed my glove and went out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, meanwhile, said even though he could have continued,
his calf ``cramped up on me pretty good. It's unfortunate. I got a
knuckler up to Gonzalez. I was hoping it was going foul, but it
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is feeling good, nevertheless, about his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers did their jobs,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Including one man, Wasdin, who couldn't wait to get to his.

TIGERS CHANGED STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the type of game that the Detroit Tigers have to win _
low-scoring, with good defense, and strong pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who brought a three-game losing streak to Fenway
Park Saturday, don't exactly rip the ball, especially on the road.
As a team they have a .253 average.
</P>
<P>
   But they had just enough offense to muster a 2-1 victory over
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get hits when we've got guys on base, that's our
biggest problem,'' said Tigers manager Phil Garner, whose team had
nine hits. ``We've had a hard time getting anything to fall in for
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go, and you can't get ahead of
yourself, thinking you can pick up 15 games in one game. You can't
do that. It's tonight's game, tomorrow's game, or you get bogged
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A home run by Juan Gonzalez to lead off the sixth inning against
Red Sox reliever Tim Wakefield was the difference. It came on a
knuckleball, of course _ one that was high and right over the
middle of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Wakefield would challenge Juan with a
fastball,'' said Garner, trying not to chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who had three homers in the Tigers' previous series,
in Cleveland, hit a blast right down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit a knuckleball, the ball jumps,'' he said, with a
trace of a smile. ``I'm feeling more comfortable swinging the bat
lately. It's just that we need more guys on base. I'm trying the
best that I can to win games. We're trying very hard. Getting
runners on base is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tigers' pitching was quite good, as well. Dave Mlicki
got his second win against five losses, going 5 1/3 innings and
allowing three hits. Four relievers followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mlicki did a good job, although he got a little nervous after
the fifth inning,'' Garner said. ``Our other pitchers did a fine
job. Mlicki's offspeed pitch is what helped him, getting ahead of
hitters and coming back when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki didn't exactly care for his changeup, usually one of his
strongest pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have real good stuff,'' he said, ``but I got by. I
threw to spots and changed speeds. I threw inside, but not to the
righties, however. I wanted to take the left-field wall out of it.
I'm used to pitching in small parks.''

BAHRE TRYING TO KEEP OPEN MIND ABOUT IRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Tony George sat in his posh suite in the new
Pagoda Tower at Indianapolis Motor Speedway Friday afternoon and
spoke about his stewardship of the Indy Racing League. He described
the all-oval, open-wheel series he founded in 1994 as a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the work that went unfinished at New Hampshire
International Speedway? Two years ago, track owner Bob Bahre opted
not to renew his three-year contract with the IRL after dwindling
attendance and infinitesimal television ratings led to estimated
losses of $700,000 per race.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike NASCAR, which found a perfect home at Loudon, N.H., for
two of its ever-popular Winston Cup races, the IRL didn't seem to
be a fit with NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to say and address all the things that
could've been done better from our standpoint and from the track's
standpoint,'' George said. ``It's so voluminous that I don't want
to get into it, specifically. But I think the fact that we were a
young series and it was very fluid for the first couple of years,
we didn't have a lot of knowledge of running a series, how to
structure ourselves, how to staff ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we probably depended too much on the promoters to sell
our product in their market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to provide better support and resources to the
promoters, to develop a better working relationship with the
promoters and probably a lack of those things caused New Hampshire
and others not to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   With the title sponsorship of Northern Light, an Internet
company based in Cambridge, Mass., George is hoping to expand the
IRL series to 12-13 races by reaching out to new markets, including
Chicagoland Speedway and Kansas Speedway. The new venues would help
offset the losses of dates in Atlanta, Charlotte, Dover, and Loudon
_ tracks with multiple NASCAR dates that no longer stage IRL races.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's just not us,'' Bahre said from his home in Maine. ``I
think we did as well with it as anyone else. Now, we lost money,
but I think those others lost a little more than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   When NHIS staged its inaugural IRL event in 1996, said Bahre, it
drew an estimated crowd of 40,000. By the end of the track's
three-year deal, attendance paled in comparision to that of the
NASCAR races, dropping to almost 12,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they both hurt each other,'' Bahre said, referring to
the split between the IRL and Championship Auto Racing Teams, which
also held races at NHIS, with varying degrees of success. ``When
they split, they harmed open-wheel racing. I like open-wheel
racing, but right now my No. 1 priority is stock car racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the IRL would ever return to Loudon, George said, ``I
don't think that, as sour a note as we parted company on, the door
was ever shut on a return at some point in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bahre, ``There's no hard feelings with us and the IRL. I
like Tony and think he's a gentleman and I respect the guy for what
he's done with his series.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the series proved to be viable enough, would he be
amenable to holding another IRL event?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, certainly _ if it's going to make money,'' Bahre said.
``We have a lot of fans who really love open-wheel racing, but we
just don't have enough to fill the stands. You can't continue to
lose money on this. It's no fault of Tony's, but it just didn't
make what we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andretti speaks out
</P>
<P>
   Mario Andretti, a vocal opponent of the IRL, returned to the
Speedway last week as one of the four ``Legends of Indy'' honorees
along with Emerson Fittipaldi, Rick Mears, and Andy Granatelli.
Given his opposition to the IRL, Andretti was asked if it was
difficult for him to return to the Brickyard, where he won the Indy
500 in 1969. ``No, not at all,'' he said. ``I will always support
the Speedway. I don't want to see this race diminished in stature
at all. I mean, there's no interest whatsoever in that. My dispute
is with the IRL. I will not support the IRL because I think that's
what has disrupted open-wheel racing in America for us. I mean, we
are pulling in different directions and that doesn't make sense. We
should all be pulling in the same direction, so that's where my
problem is. But I will always support the Speedway.'' Like CART
owner Chip Ganassi, who is at Indy with his FedEx CART Championship
drivers Jimmy Vasser and Juan Montoya, Andretti tried to put
together a deal that would bring his son, Michael, 38, back to the
Speedway for the first time since 1995, but it fell through. ``I'd
love to be able to see Michael here, of course I do,'' Andretti
said. ``I mean, this is one of the things that to me are very
disappointing, that guys like him . . . Let's face it, he's not
getting any younger, but he does have the talent and the ability to
win this race, but he needs to be here and have the chance to try.
To be missing here since 1995 is a total travesty, not only for him
but for all the other talents that are in CART that would bring a
lot of excitement here . . . That's the travesty of it all, that
it's not happening. These poor guys are caught out because of
politics, things that they have no control over and, for whatever
reason, they're not here.'' Asked if he thought a reconciliation
between IRL and CART was possible, Andretti said, ``I don't know.
If I could sacrifice myself and be hung upside down somewhere and
be beaten to put this thing together, I would even do that. That's
how I feel about it. I don't know what else to do. Maybe we could
get a general consensus, get people writing in, and expressing
their wishes, and maybe that could change things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Petty remains idle
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty, still grieving over the death of
his 19-year-old son, Adam, will sit out the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's
Speedway in Charlotte, N.C. Adam died May 12 during a practice run
for a Busch Series race at NHIS. Bahre said he had yet to speak
with Kyle or Richard Petty to express his condolences, but planned
to do so once things settled down. ``You don't want it to happen
anywhere _ and I don't want this to be taken the wrong way _ but
why did it have to happen here?'' said Bahre, who has been close
friends with Richard Petty since 1965. ``He was such a nice kid,
the nicest kid in the world. I met him a year ago at the Holiday
Inn in Concord where he was staying. I introduced myself and he
said, `Nice to meet you, Mr. Bahre,' and I was like, `Let's get one
thing straight, you can drop this `Mister' business. Just call me
Bob.' He just smiled that big Petty smile of his. He was such a
nice kid. It knocked everyone for a loop here and it makes you feel
bad for Richard, Kyle, and their wives and family.'' . . . Roberto
Guerrero was named driver of the No. 41 A.J Foyt/Kenny Brack
Motorsports entries. Because of his vast Speedway experience,
Guerrero was not required to undergo a refresher test, according to
Brian Barnhart, IRL director of racing operations . . . After
suffering serious spinal and neck injuries in a crash at Walt
Disney World Speedway in January 1997, Davy Jones will return to
IRL competition behind the wheel of the No. 40 Team Coulson Racing
car. Jones, however, was required to undergo a 10-lap refresher
course at 210 miles per hour before making a qualifying attempt . .
. Anthony Edwards, star of the hit NBC drama ``ER,'' will be the
celebrity pace car driver for the 84th Indianapolis 500 next
Sunday.

OILER SPILLOVER WILL HAVE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rather than wait until June 28, when he would have been free to
shop for another job, the distinguished boss of the Edmonton Oilers
parted company with the franchise late Friday night, and is now
officially an executive designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Sather, 56, who broke into the NHL as a spare forward with
the Bruins at the start of the Bobby Orr era, soon will surface
either as the new boss of the New York Rangers or in the same
capacity _ and possibly part-owner _ with the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Adding further disruption to the Oilers, both head coach Kevin
Lowe and his top assistant, ex-Bruin Craig MacTavish, have escape
clauses in their contracts allowing them to bolt with Sather. Lowe,
if he elects to stay, possibly would be elevated to GM, with
MacTavish bumped up to head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sather, a multimillionaire who was under contract with the
Oilers for two more years at $1.9 million per, has no real need to
work, other than to keep his competitive juices and cash flowing.
It became clear last week that he and Oiler ownership, only too
happy to move his salary off the books, no longer would be able to
coexist. Sather wanted the player payroll closer to the league
average. The owners were content to keep it, much like Boston, a
budget operation.
</P>
<P>
   But what does a vote of nonspending really say in Edmonton?
Isn't it tantamount to waving the white flag over northern Alberta?
Are they going to find someone else who will make more of that team
with less? The short, and only, answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is a sharp, capable guy, but every new GM needs a few years
of on-the-job training just to get comfortable in what can be, and
often is, a cutthroat game. Witness here in Boston, where Harry
Sinden has been bringing along Mike O'Connell for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   While payroll dwindled and, in turn, championships became a
forgotten fantasy in Edmonton, Sather became the club's second-most
valuable asset. Just as here in Boston, the fans' loyalty and
constant willingness to pay the ever-increasing freight is the
club's No. 1 asset.
</P>
<P>
   Now with Sather gone, the No. 1 asset is guaranteed to drop,
perhaps plummet. His departure, like those of Wayne Gretzky and
Mark Messier, Andy Moog and Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey and Adam
Graves, is yet another raw reminder to the fan base that the days
ahead can best be described as numbered rather than better. Don't
be surprised if the Oilers are sold soon, perhaps in a matter of
months.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it have been in the Oiler board's best interest to
sell while Sather was still part of the package? He would have had
the call there, too, able to walk away if he didn't like the party
that was buying his once-dominant franchise. Remember, it was
Sather who wrote the escape into the deals for Lowe and MacTavish.
He had to have the same deal himself. His walkaway right ostensibly
granted him the privilege to name where the club could be sold.
That, folks, is power. It also might be part of the reason
ownership was willing to cut him free, no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   All of this presents a near-diabolical case of musical chairs in
the NHL, with Paul Allen as DJ.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours south of Edmonton, the Calgary Flames also are
readied for sale, although ownership last week presented a positive
spin to being some 4,000 season tickets short of staying. Imagine,
the Flames need to sell 40 percent more season tickets _ a total of
14,000, by June 30, less than six weeks away _ and they're charged
over the prospects. Huh? Their enthusiasm is admirable. But somehow
the numbers don't add up to the optimism. They'll put up the ``for
sale'' sign if the numbers aren't met by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the league's aid via intervention, the first
stage of the Coyotes sale was postponed last week. More investors
are needed. Current club owner Richard Burke said he'll wait for
his money. What's he going to say? Maybe there is no money. Gretzky
hasn't been able to decide whether he's a buyer, in part because he
didn't know whether Sather, his ex-boss from Oiler days, would be
in a position to join him in the desert deal. Sather now can go
wherever he wants, and the betting around Edmonton is that he would
prefer Phoenix to Manhattan because the former is closer to Palm
Springs, his home away from home when he's not stashed away in his
luxurious digs in Banff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Allen, who for years has wanted to buy an established
NHL franchise and move it to Portland, Ore., waits to see what
becomes of these financial machinations.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Oiler owners simply opt to sell the whole show to
Allen? If Sather's gone, their asking price is lower today than it
was yesterday, but it's higher now than it will be with two or
three more years of losing attached to the bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   If Sather ends up in New York, would the Coyotes and Flames both
offer themselves to Allen? The league would shed no tears over
seeing a small-market club like Calgary bolt for the States. For
that matter, losing Edmonton would be a matter of little angst in
Manhattan. But to see the Coyote franchise dissolve now, with fan
interest established and growing, would be the worst thing to
happen under the watch of commissioner Gary Bettman.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. Sather's decision will serve as the first domino
tipped in the serpentine connections between Edmonton, Calgary,
Phoenix, and Manhattan. He will move quickly now because his pal
Gretzky needs answers. Just as Burke needs answers. Just as the
Rangers need answers. And most important, just as the league needs
answers.

   A `trip' down memory lane
</P>

   Noel Picard, the St. Louis defenseman who provided the pitchfork
flip that sent Orr flying when the Bruins' legendary defenseman
scored the Cup-winning goal in 1970, lives these days in his native
Montreal. At 61, he still plays hockey on Monday nights and works,
he says, as a secret agent. ``I can't say too much about this,''
said Picard, when asked to provide details about his day job. When
Orr cashed in Derek Sanderson's return pass, Picard saw no harm in
sending the Boston icon into orbit. The season was finished. ``I've
talked to Bobby a couple of times since,'' said Picard. ``He's
always a gentleman _ a gentleman all the way. In my book, he's the
greatest hockey player who's ever been seen or heard. We played as
hard as we could and got beat by a great, great team.'' Picard's
daughter, Annie, attended the New England Conservatory of Music and
now teaches in Chicago. His son, Danny, has been in the US Air
Force for 12 years and is stationed near St. Louis . . . The annual
entry draft, held this year in Calgary, is just a month away. The
Bruins still don't know their spot in the first round _ it will be
finalized in a lottery held between Games 1 and 2 of the Cup finals
_ but don't be surprised if 18-year-old Boston University goalie
Rick DiPietro ends up at the top of the Boston wish list. The
Central Scouting Bureau hasn't updated its rankings since the May 1
opt-in date, but CSB director Frank Bonello says DiPietro will be
the No. 1-rated North American netminder. ``That's a no-brainer,
really,'' said Bonello. ``Everyone would have the kid No. 1. We've
seen some very good goaltenders come out in recent years,
especially in the Quebec League, but I don't know of anyone who has
had as much energy for the position as this kid. The way he handles
the puck is amazing. He'll fire it right past the defenseman, up to
his own forward at the other blue line.'' By Bonello's count, some
300 ``underage'' players joined DiPietro in opting into this year's
draft. Even though the May 1 cutoff date has come and gone, there
could be additions. ``For one thing,'' Bonello explained, ``if a
player is in the Memorial Cup, he has until seven days after his
last game to file his papers. Or in Europe, say a Russian player
signs his papers and the letter gets here three weeks later _ as
long as the postmark is April 29, he's in the draft. It happens.''
. . . Buffalo superstar-in-waiting Maxim Afinogenov returned from
the World Championships in Russia just before last weekend and
hooked up with Rochester, the Sabres' top farm club, for the AHL
finals . . . Save of the postseason: Flyer rookie netminder Brian
Boucher, on his back, flipping out his glove hand to block Patrik
Elias's shorthanded attempt in Game 3. ``Top five (saves) I've
seen,'' said teammate Rick Tocchet . . . Rumors around Long Island
have it that Mike Milbury's job as GM may not be safe.

   Superficial wounds

   Gee, here's a sensitive lead for you: ``It does not help matters
that Craig Ramsay looks like a cadaver.'' It was penned last week
by Toronto Star columnist Rosie DiManno. Amazing how, as an
industry _ in fact, as a culture _ we are so preoccupied by how
people look, rather than assessing their words and deeds. Ramsay's
Flyers sure looked lively, with a 2-1 lead over the Devils headed
into the weekend . . . New York Post hockey columnist Larry Brooks
figures Herb Brooks (no relation), who was behind the Yanks bench
for the Lake Placid miracle in '80, would be the perfect coach for
Team USA at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002. Makes a lot of
sense. And how about Mike Eruzione alongside as an assistant? ``It
would be an honor for me, and I'd do it in a heartbeat,'' said
Eruzione. ``But I don't believe I'd be considered. They'd want
someone who's behind an NHL bench day in, day out. Herb, though,
would be a brilliant choice. Clearly the guy can coach _ and he
showed that with Pittsburgh this year, just as he did with Team USA
in '80 and with the French team at the last Olympics.'' . . .
Chicago GM Mike Smith received permission from the Maple Leafs to
discuss the vacant Hawks head coaching job with Leafs assistant
Alpo Suhonen _ a hiring that could be made official Sunday. The
Leafs could have prevented that discussion from taking place until
July 1, when Suhonen's deal expires, but to his credit, Leafs GM
Pat Quinn granted permission . . . Unsettling news in Montreal,
where Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau, 68, learned during a routine
checkup that he has a malignant tumor on his neck. That was
followed a couple of days later by word that Rocket Richard again
was ailing. Perhaps no one in North American sport ever has
performed with Beliveau's grace and dignity, both on and off the
ice. Some six years ago, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
asked Beliveau to be Canada's Governor General, but he turned down
the offer because a move to Ottawa would have taken him away from
his widowed daughter, Helene, and her two young daughters. In '89,
Helene's husband killed himself, and the Canadiens' great felt the
call to home was greater than the call to country. ``What I told
Mr. Chretien,'' Beliveau said at the time, ``was that to take my
wife and move to Ottawa would be deserting my family.'' Richard was
diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer more than two years
ago, and though he at first responded well to treatment, it
apparently is spreading. Of late, he also has been weakened by
drugs needed to combat a mild form of Parkinson's disease . . . The
Leafs are looking for a new head coach for their St. John's
(Newfoundland) farm club, and it could be Lou Crawford, whose only
cup of coffee (26 games) in the NHL came with the Bruins at the
start of the '90s. He is the brother of Marc Crawford, now behind
the Vancouver bench.

<P>
   Faceoff time for Yashin
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Yashin and the Senators sit down with arbitrator Larry
Holden in Toronto this week, with Yashin hoping to be declared a
Group 2 free agent. The Senators contend that he must still work
for them one more season, for the $3.6 million he thumbed his nose
at this past season. Holden must render his decision within 30
days, which could make for one heck of a lightning strike during
the amateur draft (June 23-24) . . . In South Philly, close to the
First Union Center, a sporting goods shop has cut the price of Eric
Lindros sweaters in half, to $59.99. And they're still not selling
. . . Wrentham's Garth Snow, who earned $1.4 million as a
sometimes-starter in Vancouver last season, likely will become an
unrestricted free agent July 1. He's expected back with the Canucks
only if he takes a deep discount in base pay . . . Roger Neilson,
back aiding the Flyers while recovering from cancer, has written
1,000 responses to those who sent him cards and letters during his
ordeal. Among those who have written: convicts serving time, and
even an atom squad from Lethbridge, Alberta. ``When you see the
letters from 10-year-old kids,'' Neilson told Toronto Sun columnist
Mike Ulmer, ``it's enough to make you bawl.'' Meanwhile, Neilson is
feeling better daily, his treatment and recovery guided by
well-known specialist Isadore Brodsky. Neilson: ``He said, `We
might as well tell you, you're in complete remission.' '' . . .
Former UMass defenseman Brad Norton, brother of San Jose blue liner
Jeff Norton, saw some time at forward late this season in the
Oilers' minor league system. He's got the size (6 feet 4 inches,
225 pounds) to be a power forward. The question is, does he have
the hands and speed? . . . Boston-based agent Neil Abbott said
Friday that he will be negotiating new deals for Bruins Group 2
free agents Sergei Samsonov and Kyle McLaren. Samsonov was
represented by Jay Grossman in the deal he signed as a rookie three
years ago. McLaren, who now has played five NHL seasons, had been
represented by Doug Messier . . . Ex-BU forward John Cullen won't
be back as an assistant in Tampa Bay this fall. He's opted to join
his uncle in the car business in Atlanta.

CUTDOWN DAY FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final score indicated the game had a true playoff feel, even
with Red Sox manager Jimy Williams and Detroit skipper Phil Garner
combining to use 11 pitchers, which suggested more of a football
score.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Boston on the short end of a 2-1 decision at Fenway
Park Saturday, and afterward all the managerial moves were
questioned, debated, and analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox missed chances, yes, but it was a baserunning blunder by
Brian Daubach in the fourth inning of a 1-1 game that grew more
important as the tight contest wore on. When it ended, and that one
run separated the teams, Daubach was distraught, and Trot Nixon,
the other player in the drama, grew a bit testy when questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the worst game I played in the big leagues,''
said Daubach. ``Obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had tied the score in the fourth and had the bases
loaded with one out when Carl Everett lifted a drive toward The
Wall, to the left of the scoreboard. Once the ball was hit, it
seemed certain that Nixon, on third, would score the go-ahead run
easily even if the ball were caught by Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Williams thought ``the ball was caught in the wind,'' suggesting
that Daubach, on second, also might have thought the ball would fly
over Higginson's head. Williams also said he thought Daubach also
might have slipped between second and third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was just a regular sacrifice fly,'' said
Higginson, also not expecting what was about to happen, ``and I was
just ready to throw the ball back into the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach said he thought the ball would be off The Wall, ``and I
was shuffling off the base,'' added the Red Sox first baseman, who
also was gunned down Friday night trying to go from first to third
on a single by Mike Stanley to left-center with two outs. And when
Higginson reached high against The Wall to catch Everett's drive,
Daubach thought he ``might have trapped the ball, and I kind of
hesitated for a second, and I was looking at the umpire to make the
call.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach was some 25-30 feet from second base when Higginson
caught the ball. And while it seemed Daubach slipped when he
attempted to return to second, ``I didn't stumble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson looked back to the infield and ``(Daubach) was
three-quarters of the way toward third. And when I looked over and
I saw him I thought I had a chance to get him if my throw was
accurate. It was bad baserunning more than a great play by me and
I'm sure he'll admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon saw nothing of what was happening behind him. Higginson's
throw doubled Daubach off second an instant before Nixon's foot
touched the plate, and umpire John Hirschbeck immediately waved off
the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what had happened,'' said Nixon. ``It was just a
situation where (Daubach) was trying to be a little bit aggressive,
and it was unfortunate, but that didn't cause us to lose the game.
We had our opportunities to score runs. More of the blame should be
put on ourselves for not getting hits when we needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Nixon trotted, ran, or dashed to the plate also
became an issue when that final ``2-1'' was posted on the
scoreboard. Daubach said there was no way for the usually
hard-charging Nixon to reach the plate in time if the throw from
left field was quick enough to register an out at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Trot was running hard,'' said Daubach. ``It's not his
fault. It's all my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I ran,'' said Nixon. ``I didn't lope home. I ran. It's
something to learn from, and I'm sure (Daubach) will learn a
lesson, but we're not going to hold it against him . . . I know I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Daubach conceded what players learn early in
their careers, that ``there was no reason for me to be that far off
second in that situation. And it cost us the game; we had just come
from behind and we had momentum and I took it away.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tim Wakefield replaced a struggling Pete Schourek (``I was
lucky, they hit a couple of long foul balls off me'') in the sixth,
the first batter he faced was Juan Gonzalez. Gonzalez promptly
launched a knuckler toward the ionosphere, the ball dropping onto
the roof of a building beyond Lansdowne Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit a knuckler flush,'' said Gonzalez, ``it jumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield (1-3) was another who took the loss personally, but
despite that knuckler to Gonzalez and Daubach's blunder, the Boston
batters all could accept blame. Five times the Sox had runners on
third and could not drive them in and the Sox were 1 for 8 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   And it ended with the Sox' eighth one-run loss of their 14
defeats this season.

KIKIC SERVES HER FAMILY WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN _ The setting is peaceful, almost serene. A warm,
late spring afternoon, with a light wind, bright sunshine and a
blue sky. On one section of the Torrence M. Hunt tennis complex at
Williams College, the men are practicing for their NCAA Division 3
tournament; on the other, the women are doing the same thing. On
the other side of a chain link fence, a lively intramural soccer
game is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this sits Selma Kikic, laughing and joking with
teammates. The 20-year-old sophomore seems at home, comfortable not
only with where she is, but with who she is.
</P>
<P>
   Her tennis career _ as part of the No. 1 doubles team and No. 3
singles _ is flourishing. She is among the favorites for the
national doubles title and won her singles and doubles match in
Williams's loss to Trinity (Texas) in the team competition on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Kikic about this sense of well-being, and she laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them my `American moments,' '' she said. ``I feel
happy. I feel safe. I feel content. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing it is when you consider how Kikic got to where she is.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, there were no American moments in Selma Kikic's
life, nor in those of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Kikic is Bosnian. She is also a Muslim, and in 1992, when
civil war tore apart the country formerly known as Yugoslavia, the
only moments Kikic and her family knew were filled with terror,
uncertainty, and upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swept away
</P>
<P>
   Little seemed unusual on May 3, 1992, in Doboj, a town of 35,000
in central Bosnia. At 12, Selma Kikic and her 10-year-old sister,
Sanida, were oblivious to the trouble brewing around them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kikics were simply living their lives. Selma's father,
Mensur, was an environmental engineer, and her mother, Almira, was
a pediatrician known for her willingness to help anyone, any time.
</P>
<P>
   While the parents were aware of the ethnic conflict in their
country, they felt secure in Doboj. Mensur had lived there his
entire life. Almira had grown up a few miles away in the hamlet of
Maglaj. The tension was growing, to be sure, but that was in
Sarajevo, a three-hour drive south _ a world away, in the mind of
Mensur.
</P>
<P>
   Almira, however, was worried. She heard things, saw some of the
wounded, and talked to colleagues. Her parents had told her what
war could do to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about the refugees in World War II,'' she said.
``I never understood it when my mother said how families were torn
apart and brother and sister had to sometimes separate.''
</P>
<P>
   Almira felt the danger that was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' she said from her apartment in Dallas,
``because I was in the position to see things that were really
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 3, 1992, everyone in Doboj saw what was
happening as Serbian troops and tanks rolled into the city. At
first, it seemed ceremonial _ troops firing guns into the air and
people going about their business.
</P>
<P>
   But a far more serious message was being sent to Bosnia's
Muslims, who make up 44 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Mensur was fired from his job; Almira was allowed to keep hers,
but people she had regarded as friends now avoided her in public;
bombs were going off in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Selma noticed that schoolmates started talking politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come up and say, `How did your parents vote in the
election?' '' said Selma. `` `They voted for the Muslim candidate,
didn't they?' I said I had no idea. But all of a sudden my
so-called friends wouldn't talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When a woman whose child Almira had helped save a few years
earlier ignored her at a bus stop, Almira said something. The women
motioned her into a building, out of public view. ``I can't be seen
talking to you,'' said the woman. ``Your family is on the `death
list' and anyone seen talking to you will also be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   With bombs now going off without warning, and the children
hiding in the basement more than they played outside, Almira came
up with a plan. She feigned an illness and said she had to have
tests in Belgrade. While she was away, Mensur would take the girls
to Almira's parents' house in Maglaj, 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Mensur used forged travel papers to leave Doboj, and the girls
were told to pack whatever they could stuff in their backpacks,
nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, the Kikics left Doboj _ leaving behind their
apartment and money in the bank. Mensur took nothing but the
clothes he had on and some money in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``What money we had, we stuffed into socks,'' said Selma. ``I
didn't understand what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The odyssey lasted more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it was an adventure,'' said Selma. ``We were at my
grandparents, then we went somewhere else. But in September, my
mother told us we weren't going home. I just cried and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kikics finally wound up on Korcula, an island in the
Adriatic. Almira worked as a doctor, Mensur as a fisherman. For
recreation, Selma played tennis with Mensur, who had built the
first tennis court in Doboj. Selma's reputation as a junior player
started to spread and she was invited to try out for the 1996
Bosnian Olympic team, which required training in the town of Umag,
a 12-hour boat ride from Korcula.
</P>
<P>
   Almira knew Selma's opportunity there would be only temporary.
She wanted more of a future for her girls. The United States was
compiling a list of Bosnian refugees who might emigrate, and Almira
wanted her family to be included.
</P>
<P>
   The Kikics were among 11 families selected. It was Aug. 10,
1993. The family had been living as refugees in their own country
for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   That was going to change.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrival in the States
</P>
<P>
   Dallas in August is unbearably hot. Thunderstorms are common,
but all they do is make you wet and hot. People cope either by
going on vacation to a cooler place or by going from
air-conditioned house, to air-conditioned car, to air-conditioned
office, to air-conditioned mall.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dallas is where the Immigration and Naturalization Service
decided to settle the Kikics that summer. Their trek had included a
ferry ride, a bus trip to Vienna, an eight-hour flight to New York,
then another four-hour flight to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Selma, the only member of the contingent with a
grasp of English, served as interpreter. The distance was tiring
enough, but the stress and uncertainty stayed with them until their
arrival around midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying, my sister was crying, and my parents were trying
to make some sense of where they were,'' said Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Their greeter, a Vietnamese refugee whose grasp of English was
limited, had been given instructions to deliver the Kikics to their
new home in Oak Cliff, one of Dallas's poorer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The furnishings in their two-bedroom apartment consisted of two
mattresses and a refrigerator, which was empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents talked the whole night, wondering how they could
get back home,'' said Selma.
</P>
<P>
   The priority for Mensur and Almira was the well-being of their
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did, we did for them,'' Almira said. ``My personal
life didn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Education was essential, and the first stop for Selma and Sanida
was the TJ Rusk Intermediate School, a cauldron of discontent with
a student body consisting of some of the nation's poorest children,
many of them immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited,'' said Selma. ``I wanted to make friends. I
wanted to go to school and learn things.''
</P>
<P>
   But her classmates had different ideas. Selma spoke little
English and no Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was different from the start,'' she said. ``It was so
obvious. I was one of four white kids. Nobody would listen. They
were always having fights with teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma would hear laughter and comments in a language she didn't
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would say things to me in Spanish; I would say things
back in Bosnian,'' said Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Almira, though a pediatrician, found work only as a nurse.
Mensur worked at various odd jobs _ at a factory, a grocery store,
a pizza restaurant, and a hotel. He found much-needed solace by
taking Selma and Sanida to play tennis on whatever public courts he
could find.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, tennis proved a salvation for the entire family.
Selma became known within the area's tennis community. Her story
spread, and when Dr. Amanullah Kahn, the oncologist Almira worked
for, heard of her prowess, he made some calls to the Hockaday
School, a prestigious preparatory school for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Another mentor, Craig Bell, who ran the junior program at the
University Club in Dallas, offered Selma a scholarship, which
opened more doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kahn called and mentioned Selma,'' said Liza Lee, the
headmistress at Hockaday. ``It was an intriguing story. We don't
give athletic scholarships but are open to a wide variety of
backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday, in trendy North Dallas, was a world apart from Oak
Cliff and TJ Rusk, with 100 acres of woods, open fields, and
creeks. And with an endowment that tops $33 million, it is better
funded than many colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Both Selma, about to enter her high school freshman year, and
Sanida, heading to seventh grade, were given consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both did fabulously on our entrance exam,'' said Lee.
``Even language was not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockaday officials were willing to accept Selma but not Sanida
in midyear, but Almira did not want to separate her daughters, even
for a few months; so Selma and Sanida waited out the school year,
and in September 1994, both enrolled at Hockaday.
</P>
<P>
   After Selma's first day of classes, she returned home in tears _
to a much nicer apartment in North Dallas, where the family had
relocated _ but this time they were tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is nice to me,'' Selma told her mother. ``They like
me. We have conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Both girls flourished, blossomed. By the time Selma was a
senior, college was a given. Almira and Mensur wanted her to stay
close to home, so Selma looked at Baylor, in Waco, 90 miles south,
and Louisiana State, a half-day car ride to the east in Baton
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   But Becky Mallory, the Hockaday women's tennis coach, was a
graduate of Williams College and a former doubles partner of Julie
Greenwood, now the women's coach at Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adored her from the get-go,'' said Mallory. ``I wanted her
for Williams from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma made a visit to Williamstown in April of her senior year,
and her decision wasn't difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took her about a minute to fit in,'' said Greenwood. ``I
picked her up at the airport, introduced her, and she fit in right
away. She came to our practice that afternoon, and I looked over
and she was wearing a pair of Williams shorts. That night she went
out dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking back
</P>
<P>
   Selma Kikic was finishing up her meal in the dining hall at
Williams. The chatter around her was about tennis, exams, and life
at school.
</P>
<P>
   She reflected on the past eight years with a sense of amazement,
and also regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents shielded me from so much,'' she said. ``I was so
confused. People were in denial over there. I think my father was
one of them. If my mother didn't shake him up, I don't know what
would have happened. My mother is one of the strongest women I have
ever been around. I admire her utterly and completely. I don't know
how she saw those things. But she came up with a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Almira's plan was to save her family. She has accepted her life
in America, but Mensur, who recently went back to Bosnia for a
five-week visit, wants to return.
</P>
<P>
   So do Selma and Sanida. But as visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a part of me,'' Selma said. ``Everything my country
stood for was gone right before my eyes. I will only go back to
visit, not to live. My friends have left. The country has changed
so much. I would love to go back and see my old home and see where
my (deceased) grandparents lived. I would like to walk into their
house the way I used to and tell them how much I love them. How
much I miss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her Americanization, Selma insisted her core has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a Bosnian. I still have my Bosnian values,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real optimist. I fail to see evil in people. What
happened doesn't make sense. Why would people do things like that?
A lot of people over there lost a sense of who they were. I was
fortunate enough to have strong parents who wanted the best for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma's foundation was rebuilt at Hockaday and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming there (Hockaday) was so good for my self-esteem,'' she
said. ``I had a lot of mentors. I learned a lot of things. I felt
like I had rebuilt a trust in people. I lost it in Bosnia. I didn't
know if people were good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister, who is finishing up her senior year at Hockaday and
probably will attend Bowdoin (she is on the waiting list at
Williams), feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure of your life is what you can do for your parents
when they need you,'' said Sanida. ``They gave up so much for us.
They have done so much. I would love to see them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Those true moments of happiness probably won't come for Almira
and Mensur in the United States. The talk is of returning to
Bosnia, but Almira said she still has some work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will choose to stay here,'' she said. ``I want to see my
daughters get married, have children, see them happy. People always
talk about the American dream. I never talked about that. I had a
wonderful life in my country. But the war changed that. Now I want
to see my daughters have a wonderful life.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma, who talks to her mother on the phone almost every night,
knows what Almira has done for her, for her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have in life,'' said Selma, ``is because of what
my family has done for me.''

WAYLAND JUNIOR A DIAMOND CUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYLAND _ There's a Citgo sign and a giant Coke bottle atop the
big green wall in left _ just like at the famous ballyard in
Boston. There's a parking problem on Opening Day, and to make it
even more Fenwayesque, there's a Big Dig nearby as the Carapezza
family adds a three-car garage to the end of their driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Pupque Park, a
Wiffle Ball replica of Fenway that Sunday will be the site of
dedication ceremonies featuring Bill Lee, Rich Gedman, national
anthem singer Scott Wahle, and author W.P. Kinsella, the man who
wrote, ``If you build it, he will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Carapezza built it, along with his brother Luke and pal
Ryan McCarthy. And people will come from all over. They will most
definitely come. For reasons they can't even fathom. Longing for
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsella has gone the distance from Vancouver, British Columbia,
to Wayland, Mass., Lee just got back from Cuba and will arrive from
Vermont. Hundreds of friends, neighbors, and fans are expected for
Pupque's Opening Day event. There'll be a band, food, a blessing by
Rev. Corbett Walsh, a speech by Kinsella, batting practice for all
the kids, a silent auction with proceeds going to the Jimmy Fund,
and an outdoor, big-screen viewing of ``Field of Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad event considering that it was conceived and organized
by a 17-year-old Wayland High School junior with the vision, nerve,
and smarts of a Fortune 500 CEO. Kirk Carapezza is not yet old
enough to vote, but he's already built a ballpark, organized a
magamega-event with considerable star power, and galvanized his
school and community for a function conceived in the spirit of
charity and hope.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't the Red Sox put a new park together this quickly?
</P>
<P>
   The ballyard is named after Kirk's french poodle, (pronounced
``Pup-key''), who died nine years ago. Kirk and Luke's first Wiffle
Ball field was in the family's backyard at 18 York Road and was
built with a lot of ski poles and trash bags. When backhoes arrived
for a new septic system, the park moved to the front lawn. Luke did
the initial layout, and with each passing month, new pieces were
added and the park got better.
</P>
<P>
   After reading ``Shoeless Joe'' and seeing ``Field of Dreams,''
Kirk wrote to Kinsella and invited the author to dedicate the field
in Wayland. It was not unlike farmer Ray Kinsella hunting down J.D.
Salinger. In the spirit of his own work, Kinsella wrote back and
explained that it was an expensive and time-consuming trip. He
suggested Kirk try to find a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me that a kid with this much enterprise deserves to
be rewarded, but I didn't think he'd come through,'' says the
author. ``He's a remarkable 17-year-old. When I was 17, I was
scared of adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Through McCarthy, a Boston College freshman, Kirk found a
sponsor in ChildrenFirst Inc. a Boston-based national child-care
company. ChildrenFirst is footing the bill for the author, and Kirk
has taken care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful part of this is that it goes back to a kid
reading a book,'' says Rosemary Jordano, CEO and founder of
ChildrenFirst. ``It just takes a moment and in that moment a
child's life can be transformed. Kirk was moved to build this park
that is now bringing people together. It's a wonderful story of
taking your hopes and dreams and making them a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The park is a nifty Fenway facsimile with an 8-foot Green
Monster, Pesky's pole in right, and a gravel mound courtesy of the
Wayland Parks and Recreation Department. It's 70 feet down the line
in left, 75 feet to center, and 80 to right. There's a flagpole,
bleachers, and a small bench. Two trees serve as light towers and a
perimeter of pines shields the park from York Road neighbors.
According to Kirk, Pupque's longest homer was a 140-foot shot, but
he says, ``That was during the taped-bat era, which has been
outlawed.'' Today, only official yellow Wiffle Ball bats are used.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayland High School student government contributed a sound
system, chairs, stage, and funding. Local businessman Robert Weiler
is another benefactor. A neighbor donated wood for the monster and
some of the sponsor money will be used to rent a 100-square-foot
screen for ``Field of Dreams.'' Green Olive Catering will feed the
hungry masses.
</P>
<P>
   As the event grew, Kirk decided it needed a worthy cause. Kirk
loves the Red Sox; McCarthy and Carapezza are the original
center-field, red-shirt K-Men (they have a Web site and appear in a
commercial) and Kirk plans to work at Fenway this summer as a tour
guide. The Jimmy Fund is the official charity of the Red Sox and
Kirk has a letter from the Jimmy Fund stating that ``assistance . .
. to help make this event a success is highly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect charity,'' says Kirk. ``The field is for kids
and it's a great idea to help kids fight cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My business is children,'' says ChildrenFirst CEO Jordano. ``I
see thousands of kids. Most of them have a sense that the world's
about them. These boys, with every single thing they do, it's about
somebody else. They understand what it means to build community and
unite the people around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Carapezza is a dentist, and his wife, Nancy, is
president of the Massachusetts chapter of the League of Women
Voters. Kirk is the youngest of their four children, and they've
done nothing to discourage his dream. None of the neighbors have
complained about the Fenway replica in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that a kid this age has a sense of social
responsibility,'' says Leonard. ``He loves baseball with such a
passion and he found this outlet. He's brought a whole community
together. He has involved everybody in this passion of baseball and
it's a wonderful thing to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day ceremonies start at 3 p.m. on 18 York Road, just off
Route 126 near the Lincoln-Wayland border.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk built it. They will come.

CLEANING UP THEIR ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, Peter Warrick, perhaps the most talented player
to be taken in this year's college draft, couldn't make it to the
Bengals' voluntary passing camp last week because he had some trash
to pick up in Florida _ but at least he was wearing the Bengals'
orange colors while he worked. He was working along a Florida
highway in a prison jumpsuit as part of a 30-day sentence for
theft.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Pro Bowl tight end Mark Chmura refused to go to
the White House with his Packer teammates after the Super Bowl
because he felt President Clinton was a lowlife and a liar in the
aftermath of his sexual liaison with a young White House intern.
Last week, Chmura was charged with sexually assaulting a
17-year-old babysitter after getting her drunk.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Atlanta, Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis will stand
trial on two murder charges stemming from a late-night party on
Super Bowl Sunday in which he and two unsavory friends allegedly
got in a fight that ended with two men stabbed to death and Lewis
allegedly telling his limo driver to forget he saw anything.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in North Carolina, ex-Panthers wide receiver Rae
Carruth awaits trial on the drive-by murder-for-hire slaying of his
pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the NFL, which soon may be known as the National
Felony League if something isn't done.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Patriots vice president for player programs Don
Lowery was in San Diego last week, along with other league and club
officials, to discuss the growing problem of violence and
antisocial behavior among players. Although the NFL keeps saying
publicly that such incidents occur at a rate below the national
average, for the first time in league history two active players
are standing trial on murder charges, a situation that is nothing
short of outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons for these problems, and one is the
heightened scrutiny the players are under,'' said Lowery. ``But we
can't deny that the star status of these athletes gives them a
delusional picture of what they can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question of the heightened violence involved in
some of these incidents. Just in the seven years I've been with the
Patriots, I've seen a change. Not in the number of incidents, but
the things they do are more flagrant, more egregious than before.
These guys live in a violent world, and too often they respond to
problems that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ideas discussed in San Diego was an effort to increase
background checks and assessments of players before they come into
the league to flag potential problem cases and offer them
counseling and other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an effort to lessen the potential of
susceptibility to violent acts with professional help,'' Lowery
said. ``We know we won't make progress on this without the support
of the players' union, and thus far we seem to have that. There are
privacy issues at stake, but we need some kind of programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To (Bill) Belichick's credit, he's already had me meet at
least a dozen times with the rookies and developmental players to
discuss security issues, issues of violence and anger and alcohol,
and what's expected of their behavior. That's about as much as you
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most proactive teams has been the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. Head coach Tony Dungy is on a committee studying how to
cope with player behavior problems better, and his team has
developed a test it calls the Bucs Filter. It is a series of
questions, background checks, and individual interviews. A
character grade from A to F is given to the player. Although Dungy
has given players who fail to meet his standards a second chance
from time to time, he has basically brought a zero tolerance
approach to behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual owners meetings in March, Dungy talked at length
about how teams and the league might be able to improve the
situation, but in the end he did what coaches seldom do these days.
He put the onus on the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players make the decisions in their lives,'' Dungy said.
``It comes down to individual accountability. There are things that
can be done to help them from an educational standpoint, but in the
end they are responsible for the decisions they make and the
actions they take.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said with the arrival of Belichick, his own access to the
players has increased, and he already sees the benefit in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that came out of the meeting in San Diego was the
need for player-programs guys to spend more time with the
players,'' Lowery said. ``That's how you learn if they have
problems or issues. We can't control what they do 24 hours a day,
but there is a correlation between organizations with strict codes
of conduct and the behavior of their players off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that (even though) some of these players
are celebrities and earn millions, they are still kids who are
often alone in places far from home with no family near them. They
can tend to hang out with people who don't have their best interest
at heart. The typical hanger-on is the only type person who has the
same amount of free time as the players do on their hands, and if
you're not careful, that free time can lead to mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   Before next season, a committee of owners, players, and league
officials will report back to commissioner Paul Tagliabue with
recommendations, although they are expected to be relatively minor.
What may not be minor is the upshot of the Lewis trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis is cleared of the double murder charge but found guilty
of acting in a peripheral role or obstructing justice, and he gets
no prison time, Tagliabue would have a rare opportunity. He could
slap Lewis with a stiff penalty _ banning him for the season or a
good portion of it and forfeiting his pay. If Lewis is convicted
and Tagliabue does anything less, it will be a signal from on high
that the games remain more important than reality.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flip side
</P>
<P>
   For all the bad things you hear about player behavior, there's
more than a little good going on as well. Far more. Over the
weekend, Drew Bledsoe and Chris Slade appeared at a charity event
on Cape Cod for Best Buddies, an organization devoted to aiding
people with special needs. Last week in Miami, Dolphins head coach
Dave Wannstedt and 41 of his players participated in the team's
fourth Habitat for Humanity home-building effort. They contributed
not only money but also their time and effort to help build seven
new homes for families who could not afford them otherwise . . .
Bill Parcells reportedly is ready to enter cyberspace. Parcells is
negotiating with an Internet company to put his voice and video
online for those of you who missed it the last few years . . . Ever
since draft day, people have asked why on earth the Oakland Raiders
would select troubled Florida State kicker Sebastian Janikowski on
the first round. Only three other placekickers have ever been taken
on the first round, and none of them lasted more than five seasons
with the teams that drafted them. Such a move had not been made in
21 years, so why did the Raiders take the chance? In large part
because a year ago, Oakland's kickers converted only 63.9 percent
of their field goals and missed seven from inside 45 yards. Michael
Husted or Joe Nedney missed kicks in seven of the team's eight
losses, all of which were decided by 7 points or fewer. Things were
even worse the two previous years: Greg Davis was 29th in field
goal percentage in 1998, and Cole Ford was the league's worst at
59.1 percent in 1997. Janikowski, while admittedly kicking off a
tee, didn't miss a kick under 45 yards last season and overall
connected at a 77 percent rate. Then again, 23 Division 1-A kickers
and 20 NFL kickers were more accurate than that. Janikowski also
could be deported to Poland if he is convicted of trying to bribe a
police officer Jan. 23 after his roommate was arrested for
trespassing. But that is not considered a problem in the Raiders'
organization, where trouble is not seen as all that troubling . . .
Expect the Ravens to hire a possible replacement for Lewis after
June 1, when several solid veteran linebackers _ such as the
Packers' George Koonce _ are expected to be released. The Ravens'
fear is not that Lewis will be convicted on the murder charge but
that the league will punish him severely if he's convicted on a
lesser charge . . . Tennessee Titans president Jeff Diamond said he
is working diligently on a contract extension for head coach Jeff
Fisher. Fisher has said he wants a new deal by the end of the
team's final minicamp (June 15), or he will coach out the last year
of his $900,000-per-season deal and go on the open market knowing
the expansion Houston franchise will be eager to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dogged about sled
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the Super Bowl leads to a lot of things, including
the sudden acceptance of a long-held idea no one wanted to hear
about before. Titans defensive line coach Jim Washburn has for four
years been trying to peddle a blocking sled in which the coach
riding it can move any of three blocking pads forward, forcing the
lineman to react. Washburn couldn't get anyone to put it into
production until the Titans went to the Super Bowl in January. Now
he has it in production for $1,495 a pop through World Sporting
Goods of Loxley, Ala., with orders coming in from high schools and
colleges . . . Randy Mueller was shocked at many things he found in
New Orleans when he arrived from Seattle to take over as general
manager. Not the least of them was that the team had no pro player
scouting reports on file. No wonder they did so well in free agency
. . . Here's one of the things that makes Detroit Lions wide
receiver Herman Moore special. Coming off an injury-plagued season
in which he caught only 16 passes, the many-time Pro Bowl receiver
heard head coach Bobby Ross say he was now competing with Johnnie
Morton and Germane Crowell for a starting job despite the fact that
Moore has averaged 103.8 catches the last four years while Crowell
had only 81 and Morton 80 in their most productive seasons. Asked
what he thought about that, Moore replied simply, ``I don't think.
He has taken all the thinking out of it. There's no speculation or
second-guessing.'' He then met with Ross and was told the other
receivers deserved a chance to start. To that, Moore simply
responded, ``Just what is it I've done to be undeserving to be the
one to start?'' Other than get hurt, nothing, so when September
rolls around, expect to see a familiar face coming out of the
huddle on the first play of the new season. His name will be Herman
Moore . . . In a surprise move, the Cardinals brought back one of
the most controversial front office figures in the club's history,
rehiring George Boone as West Coast scout. Boone worked 23 years in
the personnel department, and among his first-round picks as player
personnel director were busts such as quarterback Steve
Pisarkiewicz, kicker Steve Little, wide receiver Clyde Duncan,
quarterback Kelly Stouffer, and running back Tony Jeffery . . .
Troubled Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf said this week that after
spending two weeks rehabilitating his injured shoulder, he has
regained a good deal of mobility but remains unsure whether the
shoulder will hold up to the rigors of regular NFL use. He will
work with doctors at least three more weeks before he tries to
throw a football. Two weeks ago, Leaf was not optimistic about his
future because his shoulder wasn't responding to rehab.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changing his stripes
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Buffalo Bills defensive back Steve Freeman is trying to make
a comeback in the NFL _ as an official. Freeman has worked 10 years
as an official, the last five in the Southeastern Conference. He
began working NFL Europe games last week . . . Although he remains
unhappy about being named the Jaguars' franchise player, defensive
end Tony Brackens ended his ``holdout'' and agreed to attend the
team's offseason workout program while agent Michael George tries
to negotiate a long-term deal. Brackens has been given a one-year
tender offer worth $4.2 million, the average of the top five
defensive linemen's salaries last year. He is demanding a long-term
contract worth twice that in annual salary, plus a $13 million
signing bonus . . . How's this for a tight fix? Jacksonville
offensive lineman Ben Coleman doesn't want to accept the minimum
contract offer given him, but the guy owns five ice cream stores in
Jacksonville and its suburbs that make more than the $440,000 he's
being offered to take a beating playing football. Among his
franchises is one at Alltel Stadium, home of the Jaguars . . . The
exodus from the Pittsburgh front office continued when chief
contract negotiator Dan Ferens quit after 19 years in the
organization to take a job with International Management Group.
Ferens has negotiated all the team's major contracts for the past
six years. All the major officials in the Steelers' player
personnel department have departed in the last two years, many
because of conflicts with head coach Bill Cowher . . . Two years
ago, Priest Holmes rushed for more than 1,000 yards for the Ravens.
Last year he came back from a serious injury to rush for 412 yards
in his last four games. This year, the Ravens drafted a running
back, Jamal Lewis, in the first round. Yet unlike so many players
today, Holmes has chosen to work and fight rather than moan and
complain. He attended the recent passing camp despite not being
under contract, signing an injury waiver while trying to decide
whether he will accept the team's $500,000 tender offer. Holmes
accepts that he will be a short-yardage and goal line runner behind
Lewis, saying, ``I may not get all the carries I may want, but when
I get my carries, I will shine.'' With that attitude, he probably
will.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Receiver drops ball
</P>
<P>
   How's this for bad judgment? Bears wide receiver Bobby Engram
turned down a four-year, $10 million contract extension late last
season when he was on his way to both free agency and leading the
Bears with 88 receptions. But he got little interest during the
offseason and ended up re-signing with Chicago. What did he get? A
three-year, $5.85 million contract. Had he thought it out, Engram
would have seen that the draft was rich with receiving talent. He
also lugged those 88 catches only 947 yards, an average gain of
10.8 yards. In other words, he wasn't a game-breaker. Or a
bank-breaker, as he now understands . . . Sometimes it's best to
keep your mouth shut, as former Rams coach Dick Vermeil learned
last week. Speaking at a mailing industry convention in Atlantic
City, Vermeil told a story of how three of his players were busted
with prostitutes on nights before games and were threatened with
their wives being informed if they repeated the offense. Not
surprisingly, the story made headlines in St. Louis, and now
Vermeil is claiming he misquoted himself. ``It didn't happen with
this team,'' he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. In other words,
Vermeil claims the incidents occurred on the lousy Rams teams he
coached before this one . . . Vermeil turned down a chance to
return to his old college analyst job with ABC, and instead will be
named chairman of a $200 million venture capital fund run by
Safeguard Scientific Corp in Devon, Pa. The fund will help
minorities and women in high-tech industries. He will be working
with his son and former Eagle Reggie Wilkes . . . If you think your
budget is tight, try being the Panthers. They have been struggling
to get under the $62 million cap, but when it increases next season
by an estimated $5 million, they will really be suffering because
three of their players _ Sean Gilbert, Eric Davis, and Doug Evans _
will account for $21.442 million worth of cap space. Gilbert, who
hasn't been a bust but hasn't been worth the money he was paid to
come there, will carry a cap number of $9.75 million, one of the
largest in football. That's an increase of $6 million for him
alone. Carolina has twice restructured his deal and surely will try
again.

   BALTIMORE _ As it turns out, Fusaichi Pegasus is a bigger myth
than his namesake. The horse who was supposed to be the second
coming of Secretariat was nothing more than a runner-up Saturday as
Red Bullet blasted the field in the 125th running of the Preakness
at Pimlico.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet beat Fusaichi Pegasus badly, drawing away to tally by
3 3/4 lengths before 98,304 spectators. Fusaichi Pegasus held on
for the place, edging Impeachment by a head, but he struggled over
a wet track, officially labeled ``good,'' and did not resemble the
horse who dominated the Kentucky Derby May 6. His legend lasted two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse showed what he's made of, he really exploded,'' said
Red Bullet's jockey, Jerry Bailey. ``He was the better horse today.
We've seen other horses come off the Derby and look unbeatable,
then lose the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus is a good horse, but to win two or three
Triple Crown races is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3-10, Fusaichi Pegasus, who was ridden by Kent Desormeaux,
equalled Riva Ridge (1972) for the dubious distinction of being the
lowest-priced Preakness loser. Red Bullet was the second choice at
6-1 ($14.40 to win), but the way he covered the course, perhaps the
odds should have been reversed. The time of 1:56 for the mile and
three-16ths was pedestrian, but that could be attributed to the off
track.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet went along in seventh place early, ahead of only late
closer Impeachment, then rallied turning for home. Fusaichi Pegasus
had been running in front of Red Bullet but simply could not match
strides when the real running began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't handle the track,'' said Neil Drysdale, who trains
Fusaichi Pegasus. ``That's the way I saw it, that's the way Kent
saw it. It was a greasy kind of track, and he just couldn't go with
it. He was squeezed a bit (by Hal's Hope at the start), but I don't
think that hurt his chances at all. I'm disappointed for the horse.
I like to see him do well, giving everything he can. Remember, I've
been doing this all my life. This is not the first odds-on horse of
mine who has lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The track was a little greasy today,'' said Desormeaux. ``It
might have made a difference. Jerry and I pushed the button at the
same time, but Red Bullet had a bigger button. He just ran wild.
Today was their day.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet, a son of Unbridled, who won the 1990 Kentucky Derby
but lost the Preakness to Summer Squall, is owned by Frank Stronach
and trained by Joe Orseno. Last Saturday, Stronach, who owns seven
racetracks, including Bay Meadows, which he bought last week, and
Orseno combined to win the $750,000 Preakness Special with Golden
Missile, who was ridden by Desormeaux. It was the second Preakness
victory for Bailey (Hansel in 1991) and the first for Stronach and
Orseno, with Orseno winning on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus had beaten Red Bullet by better than 4 lengths
in the Wood Memorial April 15, but Red Bullet had been held out of
the Derby, thus avoiding the rigors of a 19-horse battle. He became
the first to win the Preakness without running in the Derby since
Deputed Testamony in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believed all week,'' said Orseno. ``I heard all that
about running for second place, but I never believed it. Fusaichi
Pegasus is a good horse, but I have a good horse, too. I just
wanted him to get a good trip and get the chance to show it. Jerry
did a great job on him, and the horse came through. This is truly a
gifted horse. It was up to me to make sure he was fit enough to get
to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in having the 3-year-old champion, not a
one-race wonder. We all had to run over the same track. I wanted it
to be a nice day and a fast track because I knew my horse was going
to run a big race and I didn't want everybody else to have
excuses.''

HEAT'S HOTTES HAND IS COACH'S 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm still sticking with my
prediction of Knicks in six.
</P>
<P>
   When the Miami-New York series started, I looked at the players,
the schedule, the history and figured the Knicks just had too much.
They still might do it in Miami. But if they don't, it will be yet
another notch in the many-holed belt of Miami coach Pat Riley. We
can just hear Britney Spears: ``Oops, he's done it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Doc Rivers won NBA Coach of the Year and Phil Jackson was the
runner-up. But year in and year out, no one is better than Miami's
el jefe, who may have submitted one of his greatest coaching
efforts in taking this broken-down, offensively-challenged team so
far. I mean, they look positively primitive. They were within a
suspect foul call and a Houstonesque bounce of eliminating the
Knicks Friday night. They may have lost the game, but they made it
close playing the only way they know how to play: with dental
efficiency. They are not fun to watch (except for coaches). They
are not entertaining. But they are surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Riles,'' said former Warriors and Trail Blazers coach
P.J. Carlesimo. ``I just think he's a brilliant, brilliant coach.
He's won with different teams. He has won with different styles. I
suppose he does get credit every now and then (as in Coach of the
Year awards with three different teams) but at times I think people
tend to take what he does for granted. They don't realize what a
great coach he is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost painful to watch Miami, and yet the Heat are still
around. No one can shoot; was that Jamal Mashburn out there Friday
or some impersonator? Their point guard can't walk. His backup is a
rookie, albeit one who sometimes doesn't play like one. Their
shooting guard is an over-the-hill bomber who has transformed
himself into a defensive demon under Riley. Who ever thought, after
watching Dan Majerle all those years, that he'd be valued for his
defense?
</P>
<P>
   Riley's resume, is, of course, significant. He's never coached a
team that didn't make the playoffs, a claim few can make. Critics
point to his overbearing coaching and cite the Heat's early playoff
exits as proof. Never mind that last year, Miami could have done
what New York did had Allan Houston's shot not bounced in.
</P>
<P>
   Or, had the referees given Miami, instead of the Knicks,
possession after a tough-to-call out-of-bounds play just before
Houston's shot . . . Or that the year before, if Alonzo Mourning
had kept his temper . . . Or if Michael Jordan had stayed retired .
. .
</P>
<P>
   If Riley's teams were, indeed, beaten up, how could they
continue to play the dominating defense they play? That takes
effort. They don't lose their poise. They don't lose their focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with him in Miami,'' said Celtics GM Chris Wallace,
``he was able to install a tremendous focus in everybody, from the
scouts, to the coaches, to the players. He's able to keep the whole
organization focused. You can say that that's easy now, because
it's the playoffs. But he does it the whole season no matter who
you play, and the result in that is all those division
championships and the home-court advantage. That's what you play
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he's gotten imperious over the years, to the point where
you wonder whether he even knows who Britney Spears is, or if he's
ever seen ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' or, for that matter,
``Malcolm in the Middle.'' (His kids might like it.) But he's shown
that, in his chosen craft, he is still the master. He doesn't have
enough now for another ring, but he is extracting every last ounce
of basketball from his team.
</P>
<P>
   It may not make for great watching. But it does make for great
coaching. He's got one more chance to put away the Knicks. If it
doesn't happen, it won't be so much that Riley, the coach, didn't
get it done. He hasn't had enough since the series started, but he
has squeezed his players almost dry. He can only hope they have
something left for Sunday's winner-take-all showdown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jazz not dead yet
</P>
<P>
   There will be no farewells here for the Utah Jazz. Not yet. As
long as they still have Karl Malone and John Stockton, both of whom
are under contract for next season, they will be a factor. They won
their division this year when no one thought they would. We've
spent the last few years planning the Jazz's funeral, yet everyone
is still very much alive and breathing. Having said that, it's
going to be hard to stay on top in the cutthroat Western Conference
. . . Speaking of the Jazz, Bryon Russell had connected on 23 of 26
free throws in Utah's first eight playoff games before going 8 of
15 in the last two. Of course, he boinged two big ones at the end
of Game 5 with Utah trailing by a point. Both were short. And what
gives with Greg Ostertag? Is he that bad? He never even got into
the last two games of the Portland series. If he didn't have such a
ridiculous contract, he'd be prime for Rick Pitino to pluck. Then
again . . . Seattle GM Wally Walker and Vin Baker met last week,
and you can be sure a lot of things were on the table. Baker has
had back-to-back nightmare seasons in Seattle and is likely
unmovable because of his huge deal. He needs to lose some serious
weight and get back into his Milwaukee playing shape. And there's
no reason why he can't, especially with this summer's Olympic
schedule . . . Just wondering, but after watching Suns-Lakers, it
seems to me that Luc Longley is the Western Conference equivalent
of Pervis Ellison. Unless, of course, he's the Western Conference
equivalent of Chris Dudley. I keep waiting for Garry Trudeau to
find a spot for fellow Yalie Dudley in ``Doonesbury.'' . . .
Interesting comment from Tim Hardaway on Pitino. Hardaway was asked
by the Washington Post's Michael Wilbon for his thoughts on college
coaches making it in the NBA. Hardaway said, ``You can holler and
yell and get up into a college player's face and challenge him. NBA
players take offense at that. You have to change your demeanor and
some college guys can't. The methods you have to use to get pros
ready are different. We all know Pitino can coach, but his demeanor
hasn't changed at all from what I see. When I'm on the court, I
hear him say things I would take offense at.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Challenge ahead
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may be disinclined to break the bank to hire Mike Jarvis,
but the deal seems destined to get done because both sides want it
to happen. It's like agreeing on the price of your house when it's
up for sale. Jarvis's big challenge, of course, is not extracting
the necessary number of Benjamins from the Wizards, but trying to
do something with their personnel once he gets the dough. ``That is
a very, very challenging situation,'' said Carlesimo. ``I think the
timing is good for Mike. But it's not an easy situation.'' Jarvis
will have to work with the oft-challenging Rod Strickland, who has
alternately infuriated and bewildered coaches from coast to coast.
You can count Carlesimo as one of them; the two had what can
diplomatically be described as a coexistence in Portland. ``Rod and
I had our moments,'' Carlesimo said. ``I'm certain I'm not his
favorite coach. But we won games and we got into the playoffs. Rod
is an incredibly gifted player and I think Mike knows how to get
the most out of people. In fact, I'd be surprised if Mike and Rod
did not get along.'' . . . Knicks assistant Brendan Malone on the
job taken by his former boss, Chuck Daly, as an adviser and
consultant to the new regime in Vancouver: ``He will be the voice
of reason and experience in that organization. He gives some
respectability to that franchise.'' . . . Some 55 individuals
declared early for the NBA draft, including lottery locks such as
Chris Mihm, Stromile Swift, and Marcus Fizer. Those three could go
in the top five, as could high schooler Darius Miles, who decided
the NBA was more up his alley than the Big East. The top foreigner
is likely to be 7-foot-2-inch center Iakovos Tsakalidis of AEK
Athens. Celtics GM Wallace made goo-goo eyes at Tsakalidis in a
recent swing through Europe, but he's also very interested in
Zeljko Rebraca, another big (and better) center in Europe whose
rights are owned by the Raptors. The only other high school player
to enter is DeShawn Stevenson, a 6-5 guard from California. The
biggest loser: UCLA. Three Bruins declared early, although center
Dan Gadzuric was not one of them. They were JaRon Rush, Jerome
Moiso, and Jason Kapono. Some other schools had two entrants, among
them Cincinnati and DePaul. Early entrants can withdraw their names
up to a week before the draft. Last year, 39 players declared early
and 12 withdrew. Players also can retain their eligibility by not
signing with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swap talk in Orlando
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Orlando Magic trade two of their three
picks in the lottery before the draft. The last thing they want on
their salary cap is three rookie salaries, which would come to
roughly $4.7 million. The Magic have much bigger decisions to make
on the players they already have. And a quick look at their
payroll, along with the burdensome NBA rules, tells you that both
Ron Mercer and Chauncey Billups should start looking around. Both
players are locks to be renounced unless Orlando strikes out on
every possible free agent _ an unlikely scenario given the money
they have to spend. Here's the rub. The Magic already are committed
to spending nearly $13.4 million next season, or about $22 million
under what is presumed to be the salary cap for the 2000-01 season.
Throw in the No. 3 pick in the draft at $2.36 million and you're at
$15.7 million. That's still about $20 million under the $35.5
million cap. But here's where the trouble lies. The Magic, like all
teams, will be assessed cap figures for all their free agents, even
though they may have no intention of keeping them. And, in the
cases of Mercer and Billups, those figures point to renouncement.
Billups will go on the Orlando cap for about $9 million and Mercer
will go on for $6.9 million. Bye-bye. The Magic will have enough
trouble convincing players like John Amaechi and Chucky Atkins to
settle for the veteran minimum (around $500,000 for both lads) and
then seeing whether they can re-sign Bo Outlaw for less than his
cap figure of $4 million and Ben Wallace for less than his cap
figure of $1.8 million. If they can do that, then they'll have the
players already under contract (Darrell Armstrong, Mike Doleac,
Derek Strong, Pat Garrity, Matt Harpring, Corey Maggette) along
with Amaechi, Atkins, Wallace, Outlaw and, perhaps, Monty Williams.
Assuming they get the guys signed reasonably (Outlaw for, say, $3
million and Wallace for, say, $1.5 million) then that would leave
them with . . . less than $14 million. And that would mean
convincing their own free agents to take (relatively) short money
now while also jettisoning Mercer and Billups and the other two
draft picks. Now, $14 million would be enough to get one big guy
and a second not-so-big guy. They could also use some of that, if
they desired, to re-sign Mercer. (You can renounce a free agent and
re-sign him with the money you have left under the cap.) But the
bottom line is there seems to be no way they can get $18 million
under unless they do all of the above and can also deal some of
their kids and get nothing in return. If he can do that, Magic GM
John Gabriel should retire the Executive of the Year trophy.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Game 7s. Remember them?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell's career was defined by them. He played in 10 of
these babies, and his team won them all, usually because Russell
was the best player on the floor. Throw in a victory in a
best-of-five fifth game and the greatest winner of all time was
11-0 in NBA elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   Game 7s are why you spend extra hours in the gym working on your
shot. Game 7s are why you spend the lonely hours in the weight
room. Game 7s are why you pore over that videotape, as Count Basie
would say, ``One more time,'' and then one more time after that.
Game 7s are what make an athlete's or coach's life a whole lot more
exciting than yours or mine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Game 7s affect more people than the competitors. If
you happen to be a Knick or Heat fan, you wish they were playing
now, not at 3:30. In all of American professional sport, there is
no greater fan rush than the anticipation of a Game 7. Football
doesn't have it. Football is always a one-shot deal. There is no
such thing as a football series, and this is football's loss.
Baseball, hockey, and basketball provide us with the thrill and
analysis of a series. These confrontations are little novels. There
are many story lines. Football, at best, is a short story. Sorry,
pigskin fanciers, but this happens to be the undeniable, and
unalterable, truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat, Sunday
afternoon's seventh game, while predictable, is almost unbearable,
particularly for Miami. There is a great deal of deja vu attached
to this game, given that the teams will be meeting in an
elimination game for the fourth consecutive season. Miami won a
Game 7 in 1997. New York won a Game 5 two years ago, and again last
year. (Recall Allan Houston's buzzer-beating kiss off the glass.)
And now they will meet in an elimination game once again. New York
made this happen by erasing an 18-point deficit to win by the
classic New York-Miami score of 72-70 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy have done the requisite
tape viewing, but even they concede it's strictly pro forma, and
not meant to be productive. After four years and 23 playoff games
(not to mention the regular-season contests), what new lessons
could possibly be learned? The Heat know what Patrick Ewing likes
to do. The Knicks likewise know Alonzo Mourning's every athletic
idiosyncracy. ``It's not about changes,'' confirms Riley, whose
reputation might take at least a little hit if his team loses a
third straight deciding game to the Knicks on Miami's own floor.
``It's about both teams after six games bringing their best
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Unschooled observers might assume that the Heat will be somehow
demoralized after squandering the big lead in the big game. Uh-uh.
It doesn't work that way. They're coming home, and it's not even
the same building in which they lost those deciding games in '98
and '99. It's a new building, and it has no bad Heat history. They
will look at Friday night's game in a technical manner and get
themselves ready to play in their new house, and no one knows this
better than Van Gundy, a certified pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no momentum from game to game,'' he maintains.
``There's momentum within a game. We are going to have to be ready
to play very well right from the start, and sustain it throughout
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't add that history favors the home team in Game 7s, and
not by just a little. Expect to hear one of the NBC gang say, ``You
play all season to have Game 7 at home,'' one or two times Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing you might hear Sunday is that when New York and
Miami play, every possession matters. Someone will add that the
difference in the game will be a possession here or there, and that
things like a stray offensive rebound, a bad turnover or a hustle
play might decide the game. Well, maybe, maybe not. It helps to
make a shot every once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a Game 7 is a masterpiece. Witness Boston-Atlanta
1988. Sometimes it's an artistic dud. But they are always
emotional, and you seldom hear a losing coach accuse his team of
being, you know, ``flat,'' in a Game 7. The key is to find the
proper emotional pitch, wherein you are juiced up, but still
rational. In other words, the trick is for enough players on each
side to emulate Bill Russell. If that happens, you get a great
game.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any Bill Russells in this game, but there are a
lot of pretty good players who have big hearts. The Knicks and Heat
are caught up in the tide of basketball history. No foes have ever
met four consecutive years in an elimination game. That's why they
should all feel privileged to be playing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this were the Clippers and Nuggets, it would be
special. It is, after all, a Game 7.

LOTS OF LUCK FOR ALSO-RANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the annual NBA Lottery or, as it's come to be known
around the league, ``My Lunch With Elgin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers once again enter Sunday's drawing with
the most chances to get the first-round pick, not that it matters.
They had the same chances last year and ended up with the fourth
pick. This is an annual rite of spring for the Clippers and their
general manager, Elgin Baylor; his team has missed only three of
the lotteries since the system was instituted in 1985, although it
hasn't always had its own pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are trying a new approach. For the first time, they
are sending a player to represent them. Maybe it will change their
fortunes. Kenny Anderson, a New York playground legend, will cross
the river to Secaucus, N.J., to be the Celtics' representative. The
team has virtually no chance of moving off its 11th spot, which may
explain why coach Rick Pitino and GM Chris Wallace plan to be
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no luck in my two trips there, so we thought it would be
good for a change,'' Wallace said. ``There's some numerology here,
which may help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Well Anderson does wear No. 7 and this will be the Celtics'
seventh visit to the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Each team is assigned a number of four-digit combinations, with
the Clippers getting the most combinations (250) and the Magic
getting the fewest (five). However, it's rare that the team with
the worst record actually gets the first pick. Only New Jersey
(1990) and the Clippers (1988) have done so since the lottery was
weighted to give the worst team the best chance. (Philadelphia
selected Allen Iverson in 1996; it had the second-worst record, but
Vancouver, which had the worst, was not eligible for the No. 1
pick.)
</P>
<P>
   The lottery determines only the first three positions; after
that, the drafting order is set up by record, worst to best.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics will have nine chances in 1,000 to get the first
pick. Their chances increase slightly for the second pick (1.07
percent) and third pick (1.30 percent). Last year, Charlotte went
into the lottery with the fewest Ping-Pong combinations and still
came away with the third overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   The big drama, however, will focus on the Bulls and the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Michael Jordan is not expected to represent his
new team, which would have meant sitting on the same stage with
nemesis Jerry Krause, the Bulls' general manager. Moreover, the
Wizards must surrender their pick to Chicago unless it falls in the
top three (an 8.26 percent chance).
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's own pick should be in the top three. Thus, the Bulls
could walk away with two of the top six picks in addition to having
serious cap room to pursue free agents this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that Michael doesn't get
lucky and land a top-three pick,'' Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf said
last week. ``I saw him and told him I would be very upset if he got
lucky and took that pick away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy buffs figure the NBA will rig it so Jordan does get a
top-three pick to help him in his rebuilding of the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Krause is planning on wearing the same clothes he wore last
year, when he came away with the No. 1 pick. He also will have the
same lucky pennies in his pockets.

   Cleveland Indians general manager John Hart was sitting in his
office last Thursday with assistant general manager Mark Shapiro
when the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a half-hour, we had three phone calls,'' Shapiro said.
``Boom. Boom. Boom. A bad day for the Tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Three calls, three pitchers on the disabled list. Charles Nagy,
who won 15 games or more in each of the last five seasons, needed
surgery for loose bodies in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright, who just two weeks earlier had pitched what
Shapiro called his best game ever against the Yankees, went on the
DL with a strained muscle in his right shoulder, the same injury
that landed him on the DL twice last season.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanded reliever Ricardo Rincon went on the DL with a bone
spur in his left elbow. Surgery is likely and he may not be back
for another couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   With Wright and Nagy out, the Indians were forced to call up a
kid pitcher, Paul Rigdon, to make his big-league debut against the
Yankees Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an average fastball and average life,'' Shapiro said,
``but we felt we needed a strike-thrower against those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of spring for the Indians, which is as good
a reason as any to explain why they didn't lock up the American
League Central by Mother's Day, as they customarily do. The Tribe,
considered by many (including yours truly) as the team most likely
to end the Yankees' grip on the World Series, have been beset by
health problems since camp opened in Florida, when new manager
Charlie Manuel was stricken with diverticulitis and missed 11 days
after 8 inches of his colon was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel missed another 15 days while having his colon reattached,
then returned to work Thursday, just in time to hear the bad
tidings about his pitching staff. The Indians already have had
eight players on the disabled list this season, including such key
performers as catcher Sandy Alomar and center fielder Kenny Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this continues a trend for the Tribe. Last season,
even as they ran away with their fifth straight division title,
they had their regular lineup together for only four games.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said the latest setbacks may not be as dire as they
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles wasn't pitching well, so it's good to see there was a
reason for it,'' Shapiro said. ``He's been a pretty consistent, key
guy for us. We think he'll be back around the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret should be back with no problem before the end of the
month. It's a minor muscle strain. Rincon is a little bit of an
enigma, but this will give some of our young kids a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star second baseman Robbie Alomar has been bothered with a
sore triceps, Shapiro said, but has been coming around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a 12-game hitting streak and has been playing pretty
well,'' Shapiro said, agreeing that when the Red Sox were in town
at the start of the month, Alomar clearly was not himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, winners of five of six on their homestand prior to
the arrival of the Yankees, overtook the White Sox for first place
in the division last week. And the recent efforts by pitcher
Bartolo Colon, who was on the DL last month, have added credence to
the argument that with the addition of free agent Chuck Finley,
plus Wright throwing the way he did as a rookie (righthanders were
hitting just .146 against him when he went on the DL), the Indians
have a rotation that can compete with any in the league. And with
veterans Nagy and Dave Burba on the back end, they're deeper than
most.
</P>
<P>
   Colon struck out a dozen Tigers in seven innings last Wednesday,
and after the game, Detroit coach Bill Madlock, the four-time
batting champion, was comparing his stuff to that of Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting on the bench saying he was playing around
until he gets into trouble, then he adds 4-5 miles per hour on his
fastball,'' Madlock said. ``And the way his fastball moves, if he's
throwing 99, it's like 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit manager Phil Garner said it was the best game thrown
against the Tigers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartolo keeps taking it to the next step,'' Shapiro said. ``I
thought he was even better in the start before, against Kansas
City. But Colon, Finley, and Wright, that gives us a formidable
three.''
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest question marks for the Tribe this season? One is
the bullpen, which no longer has Mike Jackson. Steve Karsay is the
closer and Paul Shuey the setup man. Most nights they've been fine.
But on a recent visit to Minnesota, the bullpen blew leads of 5-0
and 8-1 on back-to-back nights.
</P>
<P>
   The other question mark revolves around Manuel, who is a
baseball lifer but a rookie manager, one whose health has hindered
his efforts to put his stamp on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``His health should be a nonissue,'' Shapiro said. ``He looks
better now than he did before the first time he went down. And he
didn't rush back like he did the last time. I told him, `Charlie,
you need to come back as a leader, not as a presence.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the Red Sox adjust their pitching rotation to
the off-day scheduled after Pedro Martinez's scheduled start next
Sunday against the Yankees in The Stadium, the Indians may see
Martinez again in Boston June 8, the makeup date for one of the
rainouts last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' Shapiro said. ``We're professionals. They're
professionals. Hey, the guy has dominated us every time he's
pitched against us. You can't take anything away from the guy. But
what he did was still b.s.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, of course, was referring to the chain of events that
occurred last month, when Martinez came up and in on Einar Diaz,
Nagy responded by throwing at Jose Offerman, and Martinez hit
Alomar with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love guys who pitch inside,'' Shapiro said, ``but you don't
throw at his head. That's his lifeblood. It's like you can
intimidate somebody in business, but you don't try to destroy a
human being. That's not what you do.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mondy, Mondy
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, where the Blue Jays routinely drew 50,000 fans as
recently as seven years ago, SkyDome was less than half-full even
with a marquee attraction like Martinez providing the opposition.
GM Gord Ash took some major hits in the winter for trading former
Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen to St. Louis and outfielder Shawn
Green to Los Angeles for outfielder Raul Mondesi, a disgruntled
.253 hitter last season. But Mondesi has been anything but a
problem child for the Blue Jays. If he keeps playing the way he
has, he may wind up being credited for rejuvenating the franchise.
Mondesi began the weekend hitting .292 and was one of four Blue
Jays (with Carlos Delgado, Tony Batista, and Jose Cruz Jr.) with 10
or more home runs. He also was successful on 12 of his first 13
stolen-base attempts. Mondesi is just one of eight players to have
two 30-30 seasons. ``He's been tremendous in the outfield and he's
displayed everything you want to see in the clubhouse,'' said Dave
Stewart, the Blue Jays' assistant general manager. Stewart said he
was not scared by Mondesi's run-ins with Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson or an arrest for driving under the influence after a game.
``I knew him,'' Stewart said. ``For me, when a player gets in a
certain situation, in particular, a bad situation, sometimes the
rules aren't defined. I think that was the case last year in LA for
Mondy. I can't speak for going out after a game for drinks and
being caught. I'm sure everyone has done that, and those kinds of
things I can't make an excuse for, but it's human. But if you have
rules and guidelines that are defined and clear-cut, a player
usually stays within those guidelines. Maybe those guidelines were
not that clear for Mondy there, because he's been perfect here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, then and now
</P>
<P>
   Has Martinez changed in the two-plus seasons since he left
Montreal to become a megastar in Boston? ``No,'' said Red Sox first
base coach Tommy Harper, who served in the same capacity with the
Expos and was close to Martinez in Montreal. ``He's still the same.
He was probably the biggest draw they ever had in Montreal. When he
pitched, we had our biggest crowds. Maybe he didn't get the same
national recognition there that he does now in Boston, but he's
pitching the same. Better now, if you can say that. He's stronger
and he's bigger than he was then.'' In his first year in Boston,
Martinez said he missed the relationships he had in Montreal, where
there were numerous Latin players and his manager, Felipe Alou, was
a fellow Dominican. Now, the Sox clubhouse has more Dominican
players, too _ Wilton Veras, Offerman, and Martinez's brother,
Ramon _ but Harper said that Martinez also learned to adapt. ``I
think he's learned to branch out,'' Harper said. ``In Montreal,
where there were so many Latin players and coaches, it was easy to
connect. But once here, it took people a little time to find out
what kind of person Pedro is. Pedro is Pedro. He has a good time
when he's not pitching. And when he's pitching, he's a different
guy. He's very sensitive, especially about headlines over that
headhunter stuff.'' Harper is one of Martinez's most ardent
defenders. ``This guy is not going to try and hurt people,'' Harper
said. ``Believe me when I tell you that. He's not going to hit
anybody around the head. Those kind of people, Pedro and Randy
Johnson, they know how hard they throw, and they're not going to
throw deliberately at people's heads.'' Harper scoffs at the
suggestion that Martinez was throwing at Diaz. ``If you slow down
the tape,'' Harper said, ``you'll see the rotation of the ball, and
it was rotating toward Diaz, who was moving toward the ball. If he
wanted to hit Diaz, do you think he would have thrown the pitch so
it would be moving from the middle in, instead of just throwing
right at him? What do you think, man, that a guy who throws a 97
mile-an-hour fastball can control it like a ballistic missile? Just
dial it, and it goes right there?'' Harper said that because of his
past reputation, Martinez is singled out. ``Did you see Greg
Vaughn? Two pitches were thrown over his head, and you don't even
know who threw them,'' Harper said, chiding a reporter. ``But if it
had been Pedro, we'd be seeing it on TV over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into the cause
</P>
<P>
   Hear, hear for the Yankees cutting off beer sales in the
bleachers, which had come pretty close to being unfit for human
habitation. How long do you suppose it will be before Friendly
Fenway takes steps in the same direction? But the Dodgers players,
though understandably enraged when a fan grabbed the cap of catcher
Chad Kreuter, made a mistake when they went into the stands last
week at Wrigley Field, escalating a situation that probably could
have been defused relatively quickly by security. ``It's your worst
nightmare, players going into the stands,'' said Cubs manager Don
Baylor. ``They throw beer, they say things, but that's one of those
unwritten rules: Stay out of the stands. If a guy comes onto the
field, that's a different story. If you go into the stands, you're
asking for trouble.'' Dodgers GM Kevin Malone blamed the booze.
``Let's get to the real issue: it's public intoxication,'' Malone
said. ``If they weren't drunk, this wouldn't have happened. It's
not a Cubs problem, it's not a Wrigley Field problem, it's an
industrywide problem.'' . . . Rockies outfielder Larry Walker is on
the disabled list for the seventh time in his 12-year career. He's
expected to miss at least a month with what was described as the
beginning stages of a stress fracture in his elbow. The condition
has been bothering him since mid-April, one reason he has hit just
three home runs. ``Turns out it was a good thing I got a MRI
because from what I've been told, one more throw and maybe I could
have torn the ligament away from the bone,'' said Walker, who won't
pick up a ball for two weeks . . . When Wil Cordero left the
Pirates last week to go to Puerto Rico and wrest custody of his
kids from his estranged wife, Ana, who reportedly was arrested on
drug charges, he was in the midst of a 12-game hitting streak,
longest of his career. Cordero had been vilified earlier in
Pittsburgh for a lack of hustle.

THEY STRAYED FROM WHAT WAS WORKING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were such a thing as baseball professors, they would
have met Saturday for lunch and bragged about their favorite
students. They would have been bragging about the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   One professor would have gossiped, telling the others that he
believes the Sox have a brighter future than those dull Devil Ray
kids from Tampa. Another professor would have marveled at their
numbers: lowest ERA in the (American League) class, fewest home
runs allowed (33), fewest times grounded into double plays (23),
and most shutouts (6). Another would have talked over them both and
excitedly shared her May attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 18 games this month,'' she would say, ``the Sox have gone
13-5. They have lost four of those five by one run. This
consistency is remarkable, especially with today's
score-a-touchdown approach to baseball. Now you even see guys like
Jermaine Dye popping homers with ease. Who's next? Jermaine
Jackson?''
</P>
<P>
   They would have entertained themselves a little longer with
feel-good stories. Then there would have been an interruption from
a sour-looking professor with a Sox cap nearly pulled over his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you guys are talking about,'' he would have
barked. ``I was just at Fenway Park watching the Sox play the
Tigers. They lost, 2-1. It was ridiculous! Your textbook students
played as if they were boycotting the books. I've seen more
practicality from Marilyn Manson.''
</P>
<P>
   The angry professor would have been correct. Saturday, the
usually bookish Sox took a day off. They were sloppy with their
detail work. They did not accept the gifts the Tigers tried to give
them. They were as disciplined as 25 students on the last day of
school. They did about 15 things that prevented them from winning
and taking a two-game lead over the Yankees in the AL East. But the
mistake that got the most attention was Brian Daubach's baserunning
lapse in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cost us the game,'' the first baseman said. ``There is no
excuse for that. I took away all our momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach is one of the most intense and aggressive Sox during
games. His first-baseman-as-middle-linebacker image is enhanced by
the thick eye black he smears on his face. It was his
aggressiveness that cost the Sox a run in the fourth, and that's
too bad. Usually, a professional athlete is criticized for being
too passive (I can see you, Pervis Ellison). Daubach will be
criticized by some for being too energetic. Why? Because he ran
when he shouldn't have.
</P>
<P>
   There was one out in the fourth and the score was tied at 1.
Trot Nixon was on third, Daubach was on second, and Carl Everett
was at the plate. Everett hit a long drive to left, deep enough to
score Nixon. It appeared to be headed off the Wall, just out of
Bobby Higginson's reach. Daubach, who is not fast, left second so
he could get an extra step. But Higginson caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   This wouldn't have been a problem on a normal Sox day. Nixon
tagged and went home. He didn't run as hard as he could have _ some
press box comedians said he Trotted _ but it wouldn't have made a
difference on most days. Nixon didn't know that Daubach had
ventured too far from second. His back was turned to Higginson, who
threw a strike from The Wall to second. The throw arrived in second
baseman Jose Macias's mitt before Nixon arrived home. So, what
would have been an easy run was taken away.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the game, Daubach thought to himself that he
needed to do something to make up for his error. He couldn't do it.
He was sullen long after the play. He certainly didn't run well on
the bases, but there is no way he cost the Sox the game by himself.
It was a class project.
</P>
<P>
   There was Tim Wakefield's bad day. First, the pitcher allowed a
monstrous home run to Juan Gonzalez. I'm not kidding when I say
that I didn't see the ball land. If I had to guess, I'd say it's
somewhere in Cambridge right now. The solo homer gave Detroit its
second _ and winning _ run. Later, Wakefield had to leave the game
after being hit in the inner thigh by a Macias line drive.
</P>
<P>
   There was Everett's bad day. He was up three times with runners
in scoring position and couldn't produce an RBI. In the top of the
fourth, he played a Gonzalez Wall ball perfectly and would have
thrown the slugger out at second had he thrown the ball well. He
didn't. There was Pete Schourek's bad luck (four hits, one earned
run, no decision).
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to sit here and analyze the mistakes. Should Nixon
have been running harder? Should Daubach have known better? Should
Jimy Williams have sent Jason Varitek in to pinch hit for Donnie
Sadler?
</P>
<P>
   So many questions. But the truth is that the Sox are like most
good students. They have been so efficient that they have spoiled
their observers. Sometimes they get in their favorite chaise chair,
recline, and zone out when they shouldn't be zoning out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't robots out there,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. They're not robots. They are baseball intellectuals.
They'll resume their normal studies Sunday.
</P>

RAY WINS ONE FOR IRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In cold, overcast conditions, the reigning
champions of the rival Indy Racing League and Championship Auto
Racing Teams waged a heated battle Saturday for the pole position
for next Sunday's 84th running of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 1/2 hours after CART champion Juan Montoya gained
temporary control of the pole with a blistering four-lap average of
223.372 miles per hour, IRL champion Greg Ray wrested it away. Ray
helped the IRL hold serve _ and save face _ on its home track with
an average of 223.471, bolstered by a fast lap of 223.658 on his
first of four tours around the Brickyard's 2.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that, in a year in which CART owner Chip
Ganassi and his dominant Team Target Ganassi, winners of the last
four CART titles, were warmly received in their return to Indy, the
champions of both series duked it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep harping on this CART-IRL issue, but it's not a big
issue to me,'' said Ray, who waved off his first qualifying
attempt, then overcame a serious vibration in his
Oldsmobile-powered Dallara fielded by owner John Menard, who
captured his third Indy 500 pole in the last six years. ``It's just
nice to have a lot of good drivers here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray ruined Montoya's bid to become the third race rookie to win
the pole. Walt Faulkner won the pole in 1950 and finished seventh,
and Teo Fabi was the pole-sitter in 1983. Rookie Tony Stewart
started from the pole in 1996 after inheriting from teammate Scott
Brayton, who was killed in a crash during practice.
</P>
<P>
   In securing his first Indy pole, Ray, 32, of Plano, Texas, joins
Montoya, the precocious 24-year-old from Bogota, and A.J. Foyt
driver Eliseo Salazar, 45, of Santiago, Chile, who turned the
fastest lap of the month (223.964) during Saturday morning's
practice session, in the front row of the 33-car field.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 23 drivers qualified on the first day of time trials,
including 19-year-old rookie Sarah Fisher, the youngest woman ever
to make the race. Qualifying will conclude Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four laps of qualifying here are the ultimate speed
event,'' said Ray, who started second in his previous two Indy
500s. ``I wish it was as easy as just holding on. You've got to
drive it for all it's worth. It's an event all itself. You do
everything you can to go fast. Once tonight comes, you put it out
of your mind. Four laps is one thing, 200 laps is another. You've
got to be careful on qualifying day. You want to get up to speed as
quick as possible without going over the line, especially on a day
like this when tire temperatures are 50, 60, or even 90 degrees
below their optimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray aborted his first attempt, on cold tires and a colder track,
when he realized on the first turn his car wasn't capable of
challenging for the pole. ``It was pushing way too much, and if you
pull off the throttle there's no way to get a pole,'' he said.
``It's hard to get heat up in big staggered tires, and on the first
lap I was committed into Turn 1 at 223 miles per hour and the car
went straight. I had to back off to keep it off the wall, and so
there was no point in continuing the run at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lyn St. James waved off her first attempt, the brash
Montoya took the track and proceeded to blister it, ripping off a
warmup lap of 221.626. Montoya then came around with an even hotter
223.636 on his first go-round, the fastest of his four laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy,'' Montoya said. ``It was very consistent
with all the laps in 223. I like the car. It's a really friendly
car _ fast and friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ray presented his car for a second qualifying attempt later
in the afternoon, with track and weather conditions virtually
unchanged. The only difference was the vibration his car had
developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was in the car, laughing to myself, `What else?' '' Ray
said. ``I was running a car that had no downforce, it was 65
degrees and it's cold and slippery on the track. Now all of a
sudden I've got a vibration. What can you do? I just kept my foot
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for our team and it's great for our sponsors, and
that's my job. For me personally, (winning the pole) means a lot.
It would mean a hell of a lot more to drink milk, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ray knows that is a Memorial Day tradition reserved only for
the Indy 500 winner, not its pole-sitter.

AS CONVENTION OPENS, NRA SOUNDS DEFIANT NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change wording in 2nd graf concerning Heston's election)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The top leadership of the National Rifle
Association declared political war on Vice President Al Gore
Saturday, using speech after speech before more than 2,000 cheering
members here to accuse Gore of trying to ``disarm the country'' and
to exhort gun owners to organize against his election this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA is back,'' said Charlton Heston, the organization's
president, who was expected to be elected to an unprecedented third
consecutive term. ``All of this spells very serious trouble for a
man named Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two hours, five of the organization's top officials
devoted their speeches before the group's annual convention not
just to attacking Gore, but also to ridiculing the Million Mom
March for gun control, held last Sunday, which they called a
campaign rally for Gore and congressional Democrats who support
stricter gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a grass-roots rally but a Gore campaign rally,
scripted and coached by the White House,'' Wayne LaPierre, the
organization's executive vice president, said of the march. ``It
wasn't about safety. It was about Gore for president. But, Mr.
Gore, you're going to find out it's not smart to lie to mom.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the speakers mentioned the name of Gore's Republican
rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But NRA officials said
privately that it was likely the group would endorse Bush later
this summer and throw its substantial resources behind him in the
fall, provided he does not try to distance himself too much from
the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they avoided invoking Bush's name, the speakers
repeatedly inched closer to urging NRA members to vote for him, if
only to defeat Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a political campaign raging in America,'' said Kayne
Robinson, the group's first vice president. ``If one of the
candidates is elected, the Constitution, including the Second
Amendment, will be safe. If the other candidate is elected, the
Second Amendment will not be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the chairman of the Iowa State Republican Party, was
captured on videotape in February telling an NRA gathering that if
Bush was elected, the group would have ``a president where we work
out of their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has denied that the NRA would have undue influence over
him, but gun-control advocates and Gore seized on the remark to
accuse the Texas governor of being beholden to the powerful
gun-owners group.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush and the NRA are working hip holster to hip
holster to promote an irresponsible platform,'' Chris Lehane,
Gore's spokesman, said in response to Saturday's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Saturday's speeches attacking Gore, there is ample
evidence that the NRA has been strengthening its ties to the
Republican Party. Campaign finance records show that the group has
contributed more than $1 million to the Republican National
Committee and Republican congressional candidates this year, but
only $111,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The two members of Congress on the NRA's board of directors,
Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia and Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, are both
Republicans. Saturday, the organization announced that Grover
Norquist, the president of the antitax group Americans for Tax
Reform and an influential figure in the Republican Party's
conservative wing, had been elected to its board.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the
fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, was
scheduled to give the keynote speech at a convention banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Al Gore is the type of politician where nothing
is sacred, that will say and do anything to preserve their own
political future, even if that means using fear and deceptive
means,'' Watts was to say, according to an advance text of his
speech. ``His party used to say, `There's nothing to fear but fear
itself.' Now the vice president has nothing to offer but fear
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they claimed responsibility for repeatedly knocking down
gun-control legislation in Washington, NRA officials told their
members that the Clinton-Gore administration had spent the last
seven years assaulting their right to bear arms. And the officials
warned, often with an urgency that even some NRA members found
hyperbolic, that Gore would take steps toward confiscating their
weapons once elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been for the vigilance of millions of NRA
members these past seven years, we would have seen the total
destruction of our rights,'' said James Baker, the group's chief
lobbyist in Washington. ``If Al Gore is elected, it won't even take
seven months.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``For the next six months, Al Gore is going to smear
you as the enemy. He will slander you as gun-toting,
knuckle-dragging, bloodthirsty maniacs who stand in the way of a
safer America. Will you remain silent? I will not remain silent. If
we are going to stop this, then it is vital to every law-abiding
gun owner in American to register to vote and show up at the polls
on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing out the speeches, Heston dramatically lifted a replica
of a Revolutionary War-era musket and then paraphrased a popular
NRA bumper sticker that reads, ``I'll give up my gun when you take
it from my cold, dead hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that
would take freedom away,'' Heston said, ``I want to say those words
again for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to
heed, and especially for you, Mr. Gore: `From my cold, dead
hands!'''

ROBERT BURR, 78, ACTOR FAMED FOR SHAKESPEARE ROLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Burr, a stage actor who played many of
Shakespeare's most famous roles, died on May 13 in Los Angeles. He
was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, said his son, Robert Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With a chiseled jaw and a sturdy physique, Burr was a top-rated
amateur boxer _ he attended Colgate University on a boxing
scholarship _ before turning in the gloves for a more erudite
pursuit. Burr, a World War II veteran, began acting after the war
and made his Broadway debut in 1951 as a chorus member in the
musical ``The Cradle Will Rock.'' His career was sidetracked
briefly later that year when he left to fly helicopters as a Marine
pilot in the Korean War, where he survived three crash landings.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to civilian life, Burr plunged into acting,
appearing in supporting and understudy roles in productions of
``King Lear'' with Orson Welles, ``Romeo and Juliet'' with Olivia
de Havilland, and ``The Andersonville Trial'' with George C. Scott.
Between acting jobs, he supported himself and his family of five by
working in a frozen food factory in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But in June 1964, Burr's life suddenly changed from that of a
bit player to a leading man. The play was ``Hamlet,'' which was
having two productions that summer; one, on Broadway, directed by
Sir John Gielgud, with Richard Burton as Hamlet, and a second at
the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, Burr was Burton's understudy, an assignment that
looked to be an easy job, as Burton prided himself on never missing
a performance. On the morning of June 3, however, Burton woke up
suffering from an abscess on his tonsils and had to bow out of the
matinee, causing a panic at the box office as theatergoers rushed
to exchange their tickets. Those who stayed, however, watched as
Burr stepped into the role and made it his own.
</P>
<P>
   The audience gave Burr a standing ovation, and the producer,
Alexander H. Cohen, made a curtain speech lauding the actor's
bravery. After returning, Burton also addressed the audience at his
performance, saying Burr had performed ``one of most difficult
tasks in acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, later that same summer, Burr would again step into
the role of Hamlet, in Central Park, after Alfred Ryder came down
with laryngitis. On three hours of rehearsal, Burr took over the
role, and never let it go: the producer, Joseph Papp, decided to
keep Burr as Hamlet, starting a nasty feud between the producer and
Ryder.
</P>
<P>
   The performance made Burr's reputation, and the next year Papp
rewarded him with the title role in ``Coriolanus.'' ( Burr's son
Robert played Coriolanus' son.) Critics again applauded his
performance, with Howard Taubman of The New York Times calling Burr
``a performer of virile power and smashing intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr went on to appear in more Shakespeare in Central Park,
including the title role in ``Titus Andronicus,'' as well as major
roles in ``King John,'' ``King Lear'' and ``Henry IV, Part II.'' In
1975, he returned to ``Hamlet,'' this time playing Claudius,
alongside Sam Waterson, Ruby Dee and John Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   Burr also dabbled in television and film, appearing in several
soap operas and opposite Shirley MacLaine in 1972 in ``The
Possession of Joel Delaney.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Robert of Hewitt, N.J., Burr is survived
by his wife, the actress and director Jacqueline Britton; three
daughters, Juliet of Tarzana, Calif., Elizabeth of Los Angeles and
Laura of New York, and another son, Britt, also of New York.

FLYERS BEAT DEVILS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils were searching for someone to
regain the confidence that was seriously shaken after allowing
eight goals in two consecutive losses. Instead, their confidence
suffered another blow Saturday night when Martin Brodeur was again
below his usually high standards, allowing another soft goal.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, scored by Mark Recchi, helped the Flyers to a 3-1
triumph and a two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series. The
Flyers can eliminate the Devils from the Eastern Conference finals
on Monday night in Philadelphia, where the Devils won the opening
game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Many Devils were looking for redemption for losing Game 3 two
nights ago, but none more than Brodeur. But Brodeur never reached
the level to inspire his teammates. He made a couple of brilliant
saves, and 18 over all, but none timely enough in a game of
paramount importance.
</P>
<P>
   After Bobby Holik's second-period goal against Brian Boucher
matched Recchi's goal in the first, the Flyers broke the tie on
Craig Berube's deflection with 7 minutes 2 seconds left in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   They secured their third consecutive victory in the series on
Simon Gagne's goal with 3:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some nights you have it, some nights you don't have it,''
Brodeur said Friday after a team meeting to watch videotape of Game
3, in which he allowed 4 goals on 21 shots in a game he called ``my
worst in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur did not have it two nights ago, and he did not have it
in the opening period Saturday night, either. He was responsible
for Recchi's sixth goal in the playoffs, which put the Flyers in
the lead with 3:53 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to clear the puck from near his goal, which has been his
strength, Brodeur gave the puck to Gagne in the left corner to the
right of Brodeur. With Brodeur on his way back to the goal, Gagne
took a shot from a sharp angle that Recchi deflected under
Brodeur's right arm. Judging by Brodeur's reaction on the play, he
appeared to be in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Recchi's goal stood until 12:13 into the second period, when
Keith Primeau of the Flyers turned the puck over in Philadelphia's
zone. Primeau's errant pass went to Sergei Brylin alone in the
slot. Brylin gave it to Randy McKay, who gave it back to Brylin for
a pass to Holik, who beat Boucher with a wrist shot from the slot
for his second goal in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The game became the fans' delight and the coaches' nightmare for
several minutes after Holik's goal. There was wide-open, end-to-end
action for several minutes before the teams settled down and played
positional hockey for the rest of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur also took the first penalty of the game, tripping Berube
behind his goal, but the Devils and Brodeur escaped unscathed from
the disadvantage. It meant the Devils had allowed just one goal on
41 manpower advantages for the opposition in the playoffs.

CINK ATTACKS COLONIAL, LEAVES FOES IN DUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Stewart Cink arrived Saturday morning
to finish his second round at the MasterCard Colonial, he saw
green-light, full-throttle conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The course, made soft by Friday rains that had postponed play,
was gleaming in warm sunlight, and the wind that had buffeted the
course Thursday was lying low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was there to be attacked,'' he said of Colonial's 7,080
yards, where he had fought the wind and rain to stand at 1 under
par when play was suspended Friday. He still had 13 holes to play
to finish his second round and was six behind Davis Love III, who
was among the 53 of the 106-man field to beat the rain Friday to
finish his second round at 7 under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But no one took more advantage of Colonial's vulnerability
Saturday than Cink, who scored a ringer on the Horrible Horseshoe
when he birdied Nos. 3, 4 and 5 during a five-consecutive birdie
streak in the morning when he finished his second round with a 64.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after a 21/2-hour break, Cink continued his roll with a
5-under 65 in the afternoon to race away from an early rush-hour
traffic jam to take a three-shot lead over Davis Love III with a
54-hole, 11-under 199 total.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot ride in Sunday's final round of the $3.3 million
tournament could provide a $594,000 present for Cink, who turns 27
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-one holes ... that's a lot of golf in one day, and it's
hot,'' said Cink, the 1997 PGA Tour rookie of the year who won the
MCI Classic the second week of April.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the flip side, though, it was a good day to come out with
your good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cink had brandished his ``good stuff'' in the morning when he
started his drive to the top by rolling in the five consecutive
birdies, including the three at the horseshoe holes of 3, 4 and 5
that he says are the three hardest consecutive holes on the PGA
Tour. row like that. It's the anchor of the whole course,'' he
said. The key was hitting the fairways at the 476-yard par-4 third
and the 470-yard par-4 fifth to set up 20- and 8-foot birdie putts
and ``sinking a 50-footer'' on the 229-yard par-3 fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, he bogeyed No. 3, but other challengers,
including Love and Phil Mickelson, stumbled, too _ Love with a
bogey and Mickelson with a double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Among others giving chase before running into an assortment of
potholes included David Toms, who completed his second round
Saturday morning, carding a 66 to tie Love for the second-round
lead. Toms shot a 2-over 72 in the afternoon and is at 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples made a move, moving into a tie for the lead at 7
under when he birdied No. 6 but finished at 6 under. It wasn't long
before the rearview mirror included Mike Weir, Jeff Sluman, Rocco
Mediate and Scott Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap (67) finished one behind Love at 203, and Sluman (67),
Couples (68), Mediate (69) and Weir (69) are at 204.
</P>
<P>
   At one time on the front nine, Love, Toms, Mediate and Cink were
tied at 7 under, four others were within one shot of the lead,
three others were within two shots and five others were within
three shots.
</P>
<P>
   Those who veered out of sight included Mickelson, who was two
behind after five holes at 5 under, but who fell to 2 under before
rallying to finish with a 70 and finishing at 5 under.
</P>
<P>
   Cink, a 6-foot-4 Georgia Tech graduate, managed to avoid any big
bumps, mainly because he said his iron play has been exceptional.
He birdied Nos. 2, 7, 9, 10, 12 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of birdie opportunities,'' he said. ``But I'm
not going to think about when I tee off (in the final round). I'll
just keep attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   It will help his confidence, he said, that he can reflect on the
65 he shot in the final round to win the MCI Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 65 came at a better time because it was the last day. I
still have 18 holes to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It helps, too, that he's on a course he believes is one of the
best ``in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you pretty much have to fit your tee shots around the
trees ... and the slopes are all where they're supposed to be. I
think it separates the true players out here when you have to go
both ways off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he hopes he's one of them. nn

ROGER A. MORSE, EXPERT ON BEES, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger A. Morse, who turned a childhood interest in
beekeeping into an encyclopedic knowledge that made him one of the
best-known apiculturists in the world, died May 12 at his home in
Ithaca, N.Y. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Morse, an entomology professor at Cornell University for more
than 40 years, was a quiet man of fluid motion _ traits that served
him well in a field that often put him in intimate proximity with
thousands of bees.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that he did not get his share of stings. Four
days before his death, he visited his laboratory and returned home
with what proved to be a final trophy. ``He died with a little bee
sting on his eye,'' said his daughter Susan.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific author, Morse straddled the worlds of professional
beekeepers and amateur ones, whose numbers in the United States are
put around 200,000. Although much of his renown came from such
popular books as ``The Complete Guide to Beekeeping'' (E.P.
Dutton), which for many beekeepers is almost as much a necessity as
the hives themselves, Morse's knowledge was widely sought by
commercial beekeepers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   These beekeepers not only produce honey but play a vital role in
pollinating vast swaths of cultivated land: in the United States
alone, about $10 billion worth of crops each year are pollinated
entirely or partly by bees.
</P>
<P>
   Morse traveled the world, often for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, teaching local beekeepers from Africa to South America
how to improve their craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any subject that you could bring up in the area
of bees and beekeeping that he couldn't discuss with you,'' said
Philip A. Mason, a corporate lawyer in Boston who worked as Morse's
last graduate student while he was on a sabbatical from the
business world.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Alfred Morse was born July 5, 1927, in Saugerties, N.Y.
His father, Grant, a superintendent of schools, kept bees as a
hobby and instilled the interest in his son. Roger Morse began
tending his own hives when he was about 10, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army in Europe from 1944 to 1947, he
enrolled at Cornell, where he earned a bachelor's degree and, in
1955, his doctorate. He joined the faculty about two years later,
and from 1986 was chairman of the entomology department. Over the
years, he also taught in Helsinki, Brazil and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not thinking about how to improve the general
practice of beekeeping, he was looking at the intricate network of
bee societies. Scientists have long been fascinated by the
complexity of the hives and their elaborate division of labor, in
which roles are assigned ranging from queen to, in essence,
undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to understand sociology in this world, there is
nothing like the honeybees,'' Morse said in a 1991 interview.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much time studying the incursion of the Africanized
bee, a cross-breed known popularly, if fancifully, as the killer
bee, which escaped from a laboratory in Brazil in the 1950s. The
bees' reputation for aggressiveness made for many scare stories as
they made their way north, eventually arriving in this country in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Morse, though, was more sanguine than many. He suggested once
that after the bees began mating with local species, they might end
up strengthening the domestic bee population. ``I'm not saying
these bees are kittens, but they can be worked with,'' he said in
an interview in Popular Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He was more worried about two forms of mite _ tracheal and
varroa _ that in recent years have been ravaging wild bee
populations, forcing commercial beekeepers to monitor their hives
vigilantly. Morse estimated that in the mid-1990s, as many as 45
billion bees from 750,000 hives had been killed by the mites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his books on bees, Morse had recently published
``Richard Archbold and the Archbold Biological Station''
(University Press of Florida, 1999) about a Florida biologist who
died in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Susan, of Ithaca, Morse is survived
by his wife, the former Mary Louise Smith, whom he married in 1951;
another daughter, Mary Ann, of New York; a son, Joseph, an
entomologist at the University of California at Riverside; a
sister, Jean Kallop of Voorheesville, N.Y.; and a brother, Stanley,
of Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell, in addition to his other teaching duties, Morse
taught the introductory beekeeping course and, as recently as last
fall, a laboratory course on practical beekeeping. In the early
1960s, an article described how he had figured out a way to lure
swarms of bees to follow him wherever he walked. The trick was to
carry filter paper saturated with the ground-up queen bee mandible
glands.
</P>
<P>
   Morse also maintained his own hives at home, and he did so using
the same sort of utilitarian approach he urged on his readers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Year in the Beeyard'' (Charles Scribner's Sons), he
wrote: ``My apiaries are not picturesque; my combs are not
uniformly free of drone comb; and not all of my equipment is well
painted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I manage to harvest a reasonable amount of honey every
year. More importantly, in the occasional year when conditions are
perfect, I can make sure that my hives are filled with honey. At
these times beekeeping is the most fun.''
</P>
<P>
   He often gave the honey away to acquaintances, which endeared
him to them. But not so much, perhaps, as when he was a graduate
student at Cornell and writing his thesis on mead, the wine made
from honey. His fellow students often benefited from the fruits of
his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very popular at school,'' Mason recalled Morse saying.

RUBEN D. COLON, 76, FOUNDER OF A CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Ruben Dario Colon, who founded one of the first
Lutheran churches in New York City to conduct services in Spanish,
died May 5 in Orlando, Fla. He was 76 and lived in Sebring, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lymphatic cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon was chairman of the Puerto Rican Community Development
Project Inc., an antipoverty program for Hispanics in the 1960s,
and was appointed New York Police Department chaplain in 1988, the
first Hispanic to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rio Grande, P.R., he was ordained a Baptist minister in
1950. He worked for seven years as chaplain of the Mariner's Church
of the New York Port Society. He became a Lutheran in 1959 and
founded Resurrection Church, which held services throughout the
city before finding a permanent home in the South Bronx in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Ramonita Orabona de
Colon; a sister, Lydia Colon de Rodriguez of Bayamon, P.R.; two
brothers, Eliezer Colon of Bayamon, and Agustin Colon of Rio
Piedras, P.R.; a daughter, Damaris Colon de Corchado of San Juan,
P.R.; two sons, Ruben Dario Colon Jr. of Columbus, Ga., and Levi
Colon of Brooklyn; and seven grandchildren.

<P>
   &UR; REPORTING VIETNAM: American Journalism, 1959-1975 &LR;  Library of
America, $17.95. This collection, culled from two larger volumes of
writing about the Vietnam War, includes the work of correspondents
as diverse as Hunter S. Thompson, David Halberstam, Michael Herr
and Doris Kearns, and is mainly concerned with the campaign waged
in the field, not the one at home. The pages are filled with
``pain, anger, sadness, failure and the despair that accompanies
the recognition that suffering will never be redeemed,'' Thomas
Powers wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999 of the
two-volume edition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A DANGEROUS FRIEND &LR; , by Ward Just (Houghton Mifflin, $13), is a
novel set in Vietnam in 1965. Its protagonist is a well-meaning
American aid worker whose efforts to do ``more good than harm'' run
astray when he tries to foster his moral and political values in a
land vastly different from his own. ``Just has a veteran war
reporter's eye for the telling detail,'' James McManus wrote last
year. ``He succeeds in evoking the dense, tactile weave of life in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FIRST WORLD WAR &LR;  By John Keegan. Vintage, $16. The eminent
British military historian demystifies World War I by conveying the
feelings of the participants and explaining how it started, how it
was waged, why the Allies won and what its far-reaching
significance was for the century. His account, selected by the
editors of The New York Times Book Review as one of the best books
of 1999, ``is elegantly written, clear, detailed and omniscient,''
Tony Judt wrote. ``As a narrative it is outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PITY OF WAR &LR; , by Niall Ferguson (Basic Books, $17), takes a
contrarian view of the war's causes, maintaining that had Britain
kept out, the Germans would have won but the world would have been
spared much of the grief that followed 1918. Last year the reviewer
V.R. Berghahn, called this ``an illuminating synthesis of current
knowledge'' with ``plenty of fresh information and challenging
ideas on the conflict's most important aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE GREAT WAR AND MODERN MEMORY &LR; , by Paul Fussell (Oxford
University, $14.95), which won a National Book Award when it was
first published in 1975, the war is portrayed as a profound
cultural event that in its carnage spelled the end of innocence and
reshaped the modern imagination. Frank Kermode wrote that the
result is a ``skillful and compassionate'' study of the war and
``an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to
make it part of our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDUN &LR; , by Jules Romains (Prion, $17.95), is a fictional
re-creation of the battle in 1916 in which more than 500,000
Germans and French were killed or wounded. ``Through the minds of a
skillfully chosen group of soldiers, officers and fighting units,
we see both the general character and the momentary progress'' of
the clash, Gilbert Highet said in 1939. ``The composition of this
battle piece is one of the greatest technical achievements in the
history of the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HITLER. 1889-1936: Hubris &LR;  By Ian Kershaw. Norton, $21.95. In
chronicling Hitler's remarkable rise from obscurity, a history
professor tries to explain how Germany came to embrace the
leadership of a social outcast and beer-hall agitator. ``Kershaw
successfully illuminates the strange and at times ecstatic dance in
which Hitler and Germany engaged,'' Walter Reich wrote in 1999. He
``is able to clarify, perhaps better than any biographer who
preceded him, what made Hitler's dictatorial power possible.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CRUEL SEA &LR; , by Nicholas Monsarrat (Burford, $18.95), is a
1951 novel about combat in the North Atlantic between British
escort forces and Nazi U-boats. ``Its vivid action scenes, survival
episodes and smooth writing sustain the book at a high level of
excitement,'' W.J. Lederer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VILLAGE OF A MILLION SPIRITS: A Novel of the Treblinka
Uprising &LR; , by Ian MacMillan (Penguin, $12.95), is a harrowing
account of the daily operations of the infamous Treblinka
concentration camp in Poland, and the 1943 revolt by hundreds of
Jewish prisoners. The ``shifting tableaux of horror and
helplessness in the camp are devastating,'' Zofia Smardz wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BREAKOUT: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950 &LR;  By Martin
Russ. Penguin, $14.95. In November 1950, Chinese forces opened an
attack on U.S. troops in North Korea, ending Gen. Douglas
MacArthur's ``home by Christmas'' offensive and setting the stage
for a brilliantly executed withdrawal operation by three surrounded
Marine units. This ``engrossing account'' of the campaign relies on
the ``vivid, at times powerful'' recollections of ground-level
combatants, Ronald H. Spector wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOVEMBER 1916: The Red Wheel/Knot II &LR;  By Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $17. This huge, overstuffed
novel is set during the Great War in the months just before the
Bolshevik Revolution, when ordinary Russians were beginning to feel
that the old system had let them down. Solzhenitsyn ``achieves
something exceedingly rare among novelists dealing with history,''
John Bayley wrote last year. ``He makes the reader realize that
anything can happen at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued the opening volume in the
author's historical cycle,  &UR; AUGUST 1914: The Red Wheel/Knot I &LR; 
($25), a close study of the military fiascos of imperial Russia as
witnessed by several groups of characters. In 1989, Irving Howe
found this to be a flawed work but said there are ``some good
pages'' nonetheless.

HILL HAS MANY REASONS TO REMAIN WITH DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grant Hill has been visiting team employees at the Palace of
Auburn Hills, talking often with Joe Dumars, a Pistons executive
and former teammate, and basically enjoying life in Detroit while
he recovers from foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guarantees that Hill, an All-Star forward, will
remain a Piston in the off-season. But the notion that he is fed up
with the franchise and wants to relocate soon is hardly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Babby, Hill's agent, has said Hill plans to visit other
teams when he exercises a clause in his contract to become a free
agent in less than two months. Unless his feelings about leaving
change quickly, Hill will most likely sign a one-year deal with
Detroit for $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the 2000-1 season, he will have seven years of experience,
which could help him secure a deal worth more than $100 million
from the organization and about $95 million from another team. If
Hill does not sign for one season, he can now qualify for only an
$83 million deal from Detroit and about a $76 million deal
elsewhere, based on his six years of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who along with Shaquille O'Neal has taken over Michael
Jordan's endorsement throne, has often said money is one of the
smallest considerations in his decision. He desperately wants to
play on an elite team. He is also proud enough not to want to have
the lasting image of the Hill era in Detroit of an injured All-Star
kicking his foot in frustration during a first-round sweep by
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in Dumars' ability to find the right people. The
outside possibility that the Pistons can lure Jalen Rose home to
Michian and away from Indiana has also piqued Hill's interest.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, with the Pistons in turmoil after the firing
of Coach Doug Collins, Hill told a confidant he could see himself
playing in New York. Who knows if the Knicks, if unsatisfied with
their performance in the playoffs, would try to upgrade by trying
to move either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston for the right
player?
</P>
<P>
   Hill is one of the top four commodities in the National
Basketball Association, in the class of O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Tim
Duncan. Unless the Pistons' hand is forced, the idea that they
would accept anything less than one of the top 10 players in the
league for Hill is disrespecting the intelligence of their front
office.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if salivating executives from other teams have not
contributed mightily to the Hill-is-unhappy rumors spreading
throughout the league. If he stays, it is not as if his value will
go down or he is an aging veteran trying to find a championship
team before it is too late. The feeling is, Hill will give Detroit
one more season to build a bona fide contender. But not any
longer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   POSTSEASON FRENZY
</P>
<P>
   A Western Conference general manager recently heard an
intriguing rumor: that Sonics point guard Gary Payton, fed up with
playing for Seattle, was going to issue a trade demand Friday night
on TNT. ``And if Duncan bolts for Orlando, all of a sudden, we're
in good shape,'' the general manager said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Payton did not go on the air and ask to be traded, just as Tim
Duncan was not about to leave San Antonio and sign with the Orlando
Magic. But such is the climate this time of year, when every
eliminated team starts to wonder how it can make itself better.
</P>
<P>
   Some other scuttlebutt is making the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas is supposedly coveted by every team with a vacant
head-coaching position. That may be stretching the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Byron Scott now appears to be Atlanta's No. 1
candidate, and that is if he does not wind up in Indiana. Thomas
would like to coach the Pacers, but that will probably not happen
if Larry Bird remains with the team in some capacity. Bird prefers
Rick Carlisle, his longtime friend and Pacers assistant, to take
over.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle, by the way, has an in for the Vancouver job. He was on
Chuck Daly's staff in New Jersey. Daly was recently hired by the
Grizzlies as a consultant. (Read: Dick Versace needs help hiring a
coach.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' best bet may be with the Nets, who want a marquee name.
</P>
<P>
   That does not explain why Kenny Smith, studio analyst for TNT,
said the Nets were interested in talking to him. At any rate, as
Thomas or Doc Rivers could tell Smith, why get genuine coaching
experience on a bench when you can increase your profile taking
other coaches apart on television?
</P>
<P>
   Payton may move from Seattle, but not unless another team will
give up comparable value. The Knicks will not tear up their team to
acquire Payton, no matter how badly they appear to need an elite
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value him so highly, it's hard for me to envision we could
get back what he means to us,'' said Wally Walker, Seattle's
general manager. ``We'll always listen, but our respect for Gary's
talent level would prevent us from probably doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's John Gabriel was not selected executive of the year by
his peers last week because the Magic did not make the playoffs
this season. Beyond having enough salary cap room to sign two free
agents to the maximum contracts, the Magic has a good chance of
securing the Nos. 3, 10 and 13 picks in Sunday's draft lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Michael Jordan has got to be hoping for a good bounce
of the Ping-Pong balls in the lottery hopper. If the Washington
Wizards receive one of the top three picks, they get to keep it
while giving Chicago an unconditional first-round pick next season.
If they fall below No. 3, the pick automatically reverts to Chicago
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Chris Webber, eight years after he was drafted,
will be responsible for the maneuvering of at least two of the top
seven picks. The Magic's first pick is courtesy of Golden State,
which gave up the pick when it traded Webber for Anfernee Hardaway
on draft day 1992.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Washington's pick is tied into their acquiring
Webber in 1994. That is the same pick the Warriors held the Wizards
hostage over when Jordan tried to hire Rod Higgins at the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a time-release bomb. The Wizards and the Warriors are
still suffering from their Webber association.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where it drafts, the Magic is high on Iowa State's
Marcus Pfizer, whose scoring savvy dwarfs any other
offensive-minded player in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   A RILEY-RIDER COMBO
</P>
<P>
   No matter how far Pat Riley takes Miami this season, the Heat
need some sort of offensive upgrade next season. Having tried to
acquire players like Mitch Richmond and Latrell Sprewell, Riley and
Randy Pfund, the Heat general manager, understand the need for more
point production.
</P>
<P>
   That is where America's No. 1 trouble-making basketball player
comes in. Imagine, Isaiah Rider cloaked in Miami red and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would consider it, with certain conditions,'' Riley said
recently, regarding the possibility of acquiring the oft-troubled
but incredibly talented shooting guard. ``You just never know. I
believe people can change and somewhere they really do see the
light and they see their career passing right in front of them. I
don't know. We'll come to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said acquiring a player like Rider, whose penchant for
being tardy and whose play to the beat of his own drum are among
his litany of transgressions, would depend on how well a player
like Rider adapted to playing for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for giving players opportunities, but when they come
here they know there are no compromises there,'' Riley said. ``And
especially with somebody who has his track record.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said a bigger problem than Rider's fitting in might be
changing people's perception about him. ``A guy like that, he's on
call all the time,'' Riley said. ``He's on notice all the time.
That even creates even more pressure. He can't even then be an
innocent human being, so if he does something innocently wrong,
he's measured. That's what he's created for himself. Those players
have to be above and beyond reproach now. They have to at least
have to try to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley has a reputation for getting malcontents to buy into his
system, but you wonder if he might not be going too far with Rider,
who was released from the Atlanta Hawks earlier this season after a
series of team violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control the injury factor, but you can control the
personality factor,'' Riley said. ``You don't let anybody get into
the way of that. You're always going to have conflict. There's an
ongoing tension in this league between coaches and players. It's
always going to be there. Because my job _ and this is going to
sound cliche _ my job is to get those guys to do the things they
don't want to do in order to achieve what it is we all said we
want.''

MEXICO-BORDER (AGUA PRIETA, Sonora) _ The furor over the ``hunt for
illegals'' in southern Arizona is receiving enormous attention in
Mexico, where it has been front-page news all last week and has
been given dramatic coverage in national television reports. ``This
is pure racism at its worst,'' said Mario Hernandez Olivas, a
supervisor at the Mexican office of migration. ``All the Mexicans
do is walk on the land. They don't even take bread or tortillas
from those people, yet they are being treated like they are
criminals.'' Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REFORM-BUCHANAN _ Pat Buchanan, the presumptive presidential
candidate for the Reform Party, on Saturday said he supports in
theory a work-permit program that would give some kind of temporary
legal status to migrant workers who now cross the border illegally.
Buchanan was in town to address the Arizona convention of the
Reform Party, which elected eight members and eight alternates to
attend the national convention in Long Beach, Calif., in August. &QL; 
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHELTER-WOMEN _ Faith House, a domestic violence shelter that is
one of the Valley's oldest charities, is on the brink of insolvency
because of apparent financial mismanagement. The Glendale charity
opened an elaborate $2.8 million shelter for abused women in
January. But three months after it opened, the shelter ran out of
money and was shut down. An interim director brought in to sort out
Faith House finances found an organization so poorly managed that
some of its books may never be reconciled. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COL _ Dear Commissar Hull: I write now to be telling you
that I am pleased as borscht that in state of Arizona the law still
treats communists in a way to make late Sen. Joseph McCarthy most
proud. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and `K''
categories. &QL;

SHAQ FOILS BLAZERS' STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _The spotlight of the Western Conference finals was
flipped on Saturday afternoon, and the glare suddenly,
embarrassingly, illuminated every blemish in the Lakers'
complexion. Every abrasion, every scar, every hairy mole, exposed
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The weak bench. The powerless power forwards. And the go-to guy
who can't be gone to in the fourth quarter because he can't shoot
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, showcased and exploited by the Portland Trail
Blazers. But the Lakers found some beauty in their own presumed
shortcomings and forged a win out of their weaknesses, as they
survived hack-a-Shaq and other indignities for a 109-94 victory in
Game 1 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal was fouled intentionally 12 times in the final
5 minutes, 27 seconds as the Blazers tried to scrap their way back
from a double-digit deficit. But O'Neal made 12 of 25 free throws
in that span to secure a win that was satisfying for the Lakers, if
not altogether enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the arena, including both benches, were sitting
there watching a free-throw exhibition,'' groused Rick Fox.
``They'll go to any length to find a way to win. And is that wrong?
Maybe not, but it's absolutely boring to watch, or be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, time-consuming - the game lasted 2 hours, 48 minutes. And
the duel between Portland coach Mike Dunleavy and O'Neal also
detracted from other, more aesthetic impressions left by the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They showed they could win with bench play, as Robert Horry
scored 12 points to lead a 28-point effort from the reserves. They
withstood constant defensive pressure on O'Neal, but he pulled
through for 41 points (13 on foul shots), 11 rebounds, seven
assists and five blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   And they won despite a mere 13 points from Kobe Bryant, limited
by aggressive double teams and a bit of foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the lasting image was not of a 94-foot game of movement.
Just a 19-foot game between a coach and an opposing center with one
glaring flaw in his game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed six free throws in a row but settled down to make
seven straight, often accompanied by a glare at Dunleavy. With each
swish, O'Neal's confidence and the volume of the crowd increased.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, he had made 13 of 27 free throws in the
game and set NBA playoff records for attempts in a quarter (25) and
a half (27).
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew that they were going to do that,'' O'Neal said.
``I think it's the ultimate respect to my game when there's two
7-foot, 330 (pound) people playing back-to-back, but one had to
have two of his teammates come down and help him. I just think it's
a total respect for my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The other 7-footer was Arvydas Sabonis, who went scoreless in 33
minutes against O'Neal but supplied four of the fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he handled it quite well,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said. ``It's easy to get down, but he stayed relatively
positive, his teammates gave him support. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tactic you have to deal with. Mike is playing
percentages, and the odds are in (his) favor. ... But it stops the
ballgame, and it's tough to run sets every time you come down, and
if your defense gets set, you're pretty good sometimes. And I think
that helped us play some defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, down 24 in the first half, had pulled to within 12
points when the hacking began. Even with O'Neal missing, they never
got closer than nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq stepped up and made the foul shots, and that made
everything look kind of stupid,'' said Scottie Pippen, who led the
Blazers with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we get down in a game, I don't think it's a bad
strategy,'' Dunleavy said. ``From my standpoint, had we scored
better, we would have put ourselves in a chance to win the game. So
I can't not do what I think from a strategic standpoint is the
right thing to do because people are going to miss their cocktail
reservation or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But the game was rarely in doubt in the second half, despite a
Laker letdown in the third quarter that reduced a 21-point halftime
lead to a 13-point game by the start of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 53.5 percent for the game and made 9 of 19 shots
from 3-point range, including 8 of 12 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers adjusted to slow down the Lakers' perimeter game
in the second half, leaving O'Neal to score 27 of the Lakers' 46
points in the third and fourth. Bonzi Wells came off the bench to
score all 17 of his points in the second half to lead the Blazers
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned the game into more of an uptempo, they pressured a
little more full-court, got the ball out of the hands of the
guards, and we didn't settle into our offensive sets,'' Fox said.
``That's why Shaq obviously did most of the scoring for us. They
decided, `Enough of this unsung bench coming off and hurting us,
let's go guard them,' and then Shaquille was able to do his
thing.''
