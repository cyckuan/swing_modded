<HEADLINE> Rwandan PM To Visit Refugee Camps In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Prime Minister
Pierre-Celestin Rwigema is scheduled to visit camps of Rwandan
Hutu refugees in Tanzania beginning Tuesday, according to a news
dispatch from Kigali, capital of the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The three-day trip by the ever most senior Rwandan official to
Rwandan refugee camps is to try to woo the refugees home, the
report quoted Rwandan government officials as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is believed sign of new-found enthusiasm of the Rwandan
government to try to solve Africa's biggest refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
493,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees live in Tanzania, another one
million in Zaire and some 110,000 in Burundi. They fled in fear
of retribution after 1994's genocide of up to a million Tutsis
and allied Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Burundi by senior
officials would move into higher gear in coming weeks, the report
quoted Ephraim Kabaija, head of the Rwandan Presidential
Commission on Repatriation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
``We will go into the camps with loudspeakers and tell
refugees that we want them home. We have to seize the
opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the end of January, Rwandan Rehabilitation Minister
Patrick Mazimhaka went to Ntamba camp in Burundi to try to
persuade Rwandan refugees to come home.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,500 Rwandan Hutu refugees came home on last Thursday
and Friday from Ntamba camp.
</P>
<P>
Hutus and Tutsis are the two major ethnic groups in Rwanda and
neighboring Burundi. Rancors left in history have often touched
off conflicts between the two communities, resulting in refugee
exodus.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Nigeria, Cameroon to Withdraw Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today called on Nigeria
and Cameroon to withdraw troops from the boarder areas and create
conditions for a peaceful settlement of their dispute, according
to a spokesman for the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon today said that their troops clashed on a
series of small disputed islands known as the Bakassi Peninsula.
Both countries claimed the peninsula in the oil-rich Gulf of
Guinea and their dispute first led to clashes there in 1994. Since
the row erupted into fighting, Nigeria and Cameroon have stationed
troops in the area separated by only a narrow creek. Both parties
said the other side fired the first shot during clashes from last
Saturday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has learned with deep concern the news
of the border clash between Nigerian and Cameroonian troops last
Saturday, February 3, 1996, which resulted in several casualties,"
the spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general calls on the parties to the dispute over
the Bakassi Peninsula to show restraint and to withdraw their
troops from the border areas to create necessary conditions for
the peaceful settlement of their dispute," the satement said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the secretary-general calls on the parties
to the dispute to await the deliberation of the International
Court of Justice which is presently seized with the case," the
statement added.

AL ARISH, EGYPT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat left here today for Gaza upon the conclusion of a
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in al Arish, an Egyptian town in the northern

PLO Executive Committee after the Palestinian legislative
elections held on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was elected chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority, reviewed the situation within the PLO in view of the
fact that a number of the committee members refuse to enter the
self-rule Palestinian territories on account of their opposition
to the Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
The executive committee concluded its two-day meeting at noon
today. The committee members discussed outstanding problems facing
the PLO and adopted several decisions and recommendations in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Disappointed Over Put-off of Holbrooke Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua)-- Turkey today voiced its
disappointment over the put-off of U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke's visit to Ankara, which would have focused on
improving the tense relationship between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said Turkey had
been prepared for Holbrooke's visit scheduled for February 10, no
matter the visit's Athens leg took place or not.
</P>
<P>
The planned visit was canceled after Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis announced Monday that the Greek government's
program did not fit for Holbrooke's visit.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that the reason behind was that Simitis'
government had been under increasing pressure at home for
accepting a U.S.-brokered compromise in a row last week with
Turkey over an Aegean islet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Gwyn Davis
said "things have to settle out in Ankara in terms of the
formation of the government," which also made Ankara uneasy.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish side meets the cancellation with sorrow," said
Nurettin Nurkan, adding that Ankara wanted to have "direct talks
with Greece in a constructive manner."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece last week staged a military confrontation
over the disputed rocky Aegean islet. U.S. President Bill
Clinton interfered and prevented a conflict between the two NATO
members.

JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today invited Swedish King Carl Gustav to pay South Africa a
state visit next year, saying Pretoria owed the Swedish people a
debt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Pretoria residence after
meeting Gustav, Mandela thanked Scandinavian countries for
their support during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
"They gave us material resources" which enabled us to build
schools and to afford teachers to enroll more pupils, said
Mandela, adding South Africa owed that debt to the Swedish
people.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish King, who is on a week-long private visit, arrived
in South Africa on Saturday. He was accompanied by about 30
Swedish businessmen and academics from the Royal Swedish Academy
of Engineering Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Gustav said his visit to generate new contacts had been very
impressive so far. The Swedish guests had visited a gold mine and
factories and met business leaders and academics.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Two rival Moslem sects clashed
in eastern Ghana over the appointment of a new Imam or preacher,
killing six people and injuring another five, a report from the
Ghanaian capital of Accra said.
</P>
<P>
Police were quoted as saying today that four people died on
the spot and two in hospital of injuries from Friday's violence
at Akyem Oda, about 130 kilometers east of Accra.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out between Dagomba and Kotokoli Moslems who
have been wrangling over a successor to the late Imam Haruna.
</P>
<P>
Violence started after Dagomba Moslems installed an Imam and
angry kotokolis refused the appointment and decided to move their
friday prayers to an uncompleted mosque to be outside the domain
of the new Imam.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 20 people after a number of houses were
reportedly burned down.
</P>
<P>
However, the presence of police reinforcements in the Moslem
part of the town has brought calm back after several families
fled the place.

<HEADLINE> PLO Executive Committee Meets at Crucial Juncture, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AL ARISH, EGYPT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) said here today that the
PLO Executive Committee held a meeting at a very delicate
and crucial time in the history of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, a senior member of the committee, said that the
meeting was of great significance as it was convened in the wake
of the recently-held elections in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Abu Mazen said the
committee evaluated the results of the Palestinian elections, in
which the masses enthusiastically cast their votes, constituting a
clear indication of the Palestinian people's desire to exercise
their rights.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee dealt with the ongoing negotiations
with Israel and obstacles in the way, such as the second phase of
redeployment of Israeli troops due to take place shortly, he
said. It also discussed the convocation of the Palestinian
National Council (PNC), slated to be held in Gaza at an unfixed
early date.
</P>
<P>
On the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, the
Palestinian official said that this will be achieved in the course
of negotiations with Israel, a goal that may be realised within
about a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
With regard to an amendment of the Palestinian National
Charter, Abu Mazen said the PLO executive committee has reviewed
the matter and formed a sub-committee to discuss organizational
and political issues that will come up before the PNC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded the PLO to delete a clause from the
charter, as it calls for the destruction of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The PLO Executive Committee meeting, presided over by
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, was held here Monday
evening.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The First Deputy Premier
and Foreign Minister of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah has
called upon Iraq today to implement U.N. Security Council
resolution 986 on the partial sale of Iraqi oil to purchase food
stuffs and medicine.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to newsmen, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed said he
"wished they will accept the resolution as it is without any
changes."
</P>
<P>
Talks between Iraq and the United Nations are due to start in
New York today to discuss ways and means of implementing the said
resolution. It permits Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil
every six months under the supervision of the United Nations. The
revenues will be used in purchasing food stuffs and medicine for
the Iraqi people, after deducting a percentage in favor of the UN
reparations fund.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the U.N.-Iraqi talks will lead to the complete
lifting of the embargo against Iraq, Sheikh Sabah said he was
"not worried about this because today's talks are related to the
partial lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil sales for the purchase
of Iraq's requirements through the U.N.."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official held the Iraqi regime responsible of the
suffering of the Iraqi people, saying that "we regret the
suffering of the Iraqi people, but it is unfortunate that the
ruling regime is the one that opposes the interests of the Iraqis."

<HEADLINE> 89 Retired Lebanese Officers Accused of Collaborating with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- After starting judicial
procedures against the head of Israel's proxy militia, the South
Lebanon Army, last month, a military attorney-general summoned
today 89 retired Lebanese Army officers to appear in the Beirut
military court.
</P>
<P>
The 89 retired militarymen, currently living in an
Israeli-occupied border strip in south Lebanon, are accused of
collaborating with Israel, according to the state-run National
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said if they fail to appear in the military court,
the military attorney-general, Riad Talih, will issue arrest
warrants against them and conduct trials in their absence.
</P>
<P>
The sentences are expected to be imprisonment with hard labour
if they are found guilty in accordance with item 387 of the penal
code, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Lahd, head of the South Lebanon Army, is reportedly to
be tried in his absence by the Lebanese military court on charges
of "collaborating" with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He rejected a summon to appear in court three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Lahd may face death penalty if he is found guilty, the
military attorney-general said.
</P>
<P>
He is charged with "cooperating with the Israeli secret
services and attending training sessions" in Israel, and accused
of having met "Israeli leaders of all levels and taking orders
from them" and of calling for "friendly and privileged ties" with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Lahd, 65, was appointed in 1984 by Israel to head the
3,000-strong SLA, which helps the Israeli Army patrol Israel's
occupied "security zone" in south Lebanon. Lebanese authorities
have also issued warrant for his arrest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reiterates Intention to Push Forward Cyprus Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has been
formally informed by the U.S. that Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Holbrooke has postponed his trip to Cyprus, Greece and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides at his daily press briefing. On Monday, the Cyprus
government expressed its welcome to Holbrooke's visit to the
island despite Greece's decision not to receive the U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said although Holbrooke would not be coming,
Washington had reiterated its intention to push forward its
Cyprus initiative, at a later stage, when a government is formed
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government had invested on the
U.S. intervention since the United States is the power that could
persuade Turkey to change its positions on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who is leaving the diplomatic service later this
month, was planning to visit Athens and Ankara to deal with the
recent crisis in Eastern Aegean, instead of dealing with the
Cyprus problem as he originally planned to do.
</P>
<P>
The decision to postpone the trip was made following an
announcement by Greek Premier Costas Simitis Monday that
Holbrooke's schedule "does not fit in with the obligations of the
Greek government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that the National Council, the
island's top advisory body to the President on the handling of the
Cyprus problem, will meet next Monday to discuss the latest
developments in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
According to Cassoulides, President Glafcos Clerides would
brief the council on his forthcoming talks in Athens this week
with Greek Prime Minister Simitis and political party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Simitis and clerides will hold talks Thursday in the Greek
capital on the Cyprus problem, the island's bid to become a full
member of the European Union and the joint defense pact agreed
upon by the two countries in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
The joint defense policy is expected to be high on the agenda
in the light of the recent crisis in the Aegean Sea, which
climaxed on Tuesday night when Greece and Turkey, both NATO
allies, came close to a war after a dispute on the islet of Imia.

<HEADLINE> Americans Buy Record Foreign Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- American investors have
brought a record amount of foreign stocks in the third quarter of
last year, the "Wall Street Journal" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Through the first three quarters of last year, U.S. investors
added 35.9 billion of overseas stocks to their portfolios, a trend
that "clearly shows that Americans are committed to diversifying
risks by investing in foreign stocks," says David Strongin,
director of international finance at the SIA, Wall Street's main
trade group, in New York.
</P>
<P>
As of September 30, Americans owned 346.9 billion U.S. dollars
of foreign stocks, for the first time surpassing the value of U.S.
shares held by foreign investors, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
In November and December, Americans committed roughly 3.3
billion to mutual funds that invest in foreign stock markets.
Analysts estimated that the U.S. investment in foreign stocks will
climb to about 70 billion U.S. dollars this year from an estimated
55 billion in 1995, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By far, U.S. investors' favorite stock market is Tokyo; in the
third quarter, investors bought a record net 11.8 billion U.S.
dollars of Japanese shares, or 55 percent of their total foreign
purchases.
</P>
<P>
Americans also placed 13 percent of their new investments in
emerging markets, especially in Asia, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The two regions we think look most attractive over the next
six to 12 months are Japan and the Far East, including both the
emerging markets and Hong Kong," the paper quoted Sheila Coco,
vice president at the Fiduciary Trust Co. International in New
York.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Robert Gallucci, the U.S.
President's special advisor, said today he expected free and fair
elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held by the summer of 1996 in
keeping with the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Gallucci, who is in Bosnia on an official visit, made the statement
in the city of Banja Luka, a Serb stronghold in northern Bosnia, while
meeting with the representatives of several Serb parties and the local
leaders of Catholic and Islamic churches, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, a general election will be held within
six to nine months after the agreement was signed and took into effect
in mid-December of last year. The elections will be organized and
monitored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE).
</P>
<P>
But OSCE officials have said they face formidable tasks and huge
challenges concerning the first general elections in Bosnia as
millions of Bosnian refugees were unable to come back to cast their
votes.
</P>
<P>
Gallucci said that the authorities of both the Republika Sprska
(Bosnian Serb State) and the Muslim-Croat federation are under the
obligation to secure the freedom of press to give equal chances to
candidates to run their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the President of the Party of Independent
Social-Democrats, Mile Dodik, told Gallucci that the Bosnian Serb
authorities had prevented Banja Luka Mayor Predrag Radic from meeting
with Gallucci.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb leadership has recently decided that no Bosnian
Serb official can meet independently with foreign delegations without
permission from the leadership.

"The agreement will eventually lead to a decrease of the
threat of landmines in Mozambique," said Modise.
</P>
<P>
The landmines, mostly made in South Africa, are laid in
Mozambique's rural areas and the border areas.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether South Africa should be held responsible for
laying of those landmines, South African National Defense Force
Chief General George Mines said: "We did not lay mines there."
</P>
<P>
He said it was possible that guerrillas, including Mozambican
rebels, had been able to get hold of mines originating in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the two governments today finished
drafting a defense cooperation agreement due to be signed soon,
according to the South African defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, if signed, would entail joint military
exercises, joint training, the exchange of military intelligence
and cooperation between military medical services of the armed
forces of the two southern African countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Asks for Termination of British Military Exercises in Akamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Cyprus and
Britain have an on-going dialogue for the termination of British
military exercises in the Akamas wild life reserve, on the western
tip of the island, Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides
said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark before the House of Representatives
Environment Committee, which is discussing the issue raised by a
MP who said that British military exercises are causing great
damage to Akamas.
</P>
<P>
According to official facts, British military exercises have
burned more than 70 hectares of woodland in Akamas in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides noted the Cyprus government does not raise the
issue in relation to the Treaty of Establishment, which gave
Britain the right to use the area for military exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it has been pointed out to London that
the use of real ammunition during British exercises cause a
problem.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Ministry of Agriculture told the
committee that the British exercises are incompatible with the
administrative plan the government is promoting for Akamas.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus gained independence from British Colonial rule under
the Treaty of Establishment signed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty, Britain retained two sovereign military
bases on this strategic Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty also gives Britain the right to use Akamas as "a
field firing range and for all kinds of engineer training,
including the carrying out of demolitions."
</P>
<P>
It also provides that the western part of the Akamas "may be
used as a naval bombardment range."

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Suspend Contact With Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb authorities
announced today they were suspending all meetings and contacts
with the Muslim government following the detention of 11 Serbs,
including two senior Serb officers whom the government has accused
of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian government said the two officers, Gen. Djordje
Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic, along with three other Serb
soldiers, would be handed over to the Hague international war
crime tribunal for trial. The five were among 11 Serbs seized in
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The two Serb officers and their driver were captured on January
30 on their way to a meeting with IFOR officers on a "blue route"
between the Sarajevo municipalities of Lukavica and Ilidza, where
freedom of movement is guaranteed under the peace agreement,
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international war crime investigators are
beginning to examine the evidence provided by the government
against the five of the 11 detained soldiers and officers. The
Bosnian government said Gen. Djukic was involved in major war
crimes in the Sarajevo area.
</P>
<P>
An IFOR spokesman confirmed Monday in Sarajevo that the Bosnian
government has arrested the Serb general and other soldiers as war
crime "suspects or witnesses." The new row between the former
warring parties is believed to affect the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Serb Army General Staff has issued a communique specifying
that the incident had occurred in a free-movement zone fully
controlled by the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
"The incident was a serious violation of the Dayton agreement's
provisions on the freedom of movement," said the communique, which
also demanded the immediate release of all the Serbs taken under
custody.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Commercial Crime Cases Fell Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua)-- A total of 51,117
commercial crime cases had been reported throughout South Africa
last year, said figures released in pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
According to Commercial Crime Chief Assistant Commissioner M.
J. Schoeman, the commercial crime cases in 1995 were a fall of
4.3 percent from the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
Schoeman ascribed the fall to the crime-prevention strategy of
the police, assistance from the private and business sectors and
media coverage on such crimes.
</P>
<P>
However, Schoeman cautioned that several commercial crimes
might not yet have been detected due to the increased
sophistication of commercial criminals and to technological
innovation.
</P>
<P>
The commercial crimes, including white-collar crime and
corruption, was also on top of the government's crime-prevention
agenda. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peres: S. Lebanon Pullout Independent from Syrian Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said today that an Israeli withdrawal from the
"security zone" in south Lebanon will not depend on the peace
negotiations between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour of the zone, Peres said that Israel
will not demand that Syria withdraw its troops from Lebanon,
because it is the responsibility of the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that "if there would be a real chapter on the part
of the Lebanese government and the Lebanese army to guarantee
there would be just one government and one army, peace and
security, Israel would not wait for the peace talks with Syria,
but would withdraw from south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem is that there are armed groups in
Lebanon which do not take orders from the central government,
like Hezbollah, and the central government and the army were
unable to provide security neither to the southern part of
Lebanon, therefore, nor to the northern part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Israeli army is not "willing" to stay in
south Lebanon, and does not have any ambition to remain there
forever. "On the contrary," he said, "we would like to see a
Lebanon which is completely independent, a Lebanon with
territorial integrity living in peace with us."
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the "security zone" in 1985 after withdrawing
its troops from most parts of the country at the end of the
Lebanon war.
</P>
<P>
Peres went on to say that there is no territorial dispute
between Israel and Lebanon, but a need for a reliable relationship
so that the people on both sides of the frontiers will enjoy peace
and security.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Family
Planning Council today urged the government to take measures to
reduce high birth rates and rapid population growth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Alex Zinaga, director of the council, said "affirmative social
and economic policies should be made to reduce the demand for
large families which explains high birth rates and rapid
population growth in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"These policies should be aimed at changing the costs and
benefits of child-bearing so that more parents will recognise the
value of smaller families while increasing the investment in
children," said Zinaga.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's population growth rate is currently pegged at 3.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
And about 47 percent of the population was under the age of
15, which means a record number of young people are expected to
enter child-bearing years during the next two decades.

JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's crown prince
David Mohato Bereng Seeiso is expected to be sworn in as King of
Lesotho in capital Maseru on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohato, 32, will succeed his father, the late King Moshoeshoe II,

hillside.

The new King is expected to deliver a speech in a radio

<P>
Mohato will be King of Lesotho for the second time. He was
first enthroned on November 12, 1990 after his father Moshoeshoe
was exiled by the military government at the time.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohato abdicated on January 25 last year when his

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress party
has decided not to touch the corruption issue during its poll
campaign although it has become a major issue for opposition
parties in the wake of the hawala scandal, the Times of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
The hawala scandal refers to an 18 million US dollar bribery
case involving many top politicians and bureaucrats in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President P.V. Narasimha Rao views the
achievements of his government since 1991 as the single most
important selling point for his party, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic and political stability, unity and communal
harmony will also be highlighted in the party's publicity
material.
</P>
<P>
"No, there will be no reference to the hawala in our posters or
vedeo films being prepared for the elections," a senior Congress
official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Though some party candidates may talk about it in their
constituencies Mr. Rao has told us that he would not refer to it
in his speeches," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Another high-ranking Congress source said that the meetings
between Rao and party officials in the past fortnight have
concentrated on the training of party cadres to propagate the
achievements of the central government, especially the poverty
alleviation and social assistance schemes.
</P>
<P>
According to the multi-edition English newspaper, though it is
generally accepted in party circles that the corruption issue may
affect the Congress prospects in the coming general elections,
senior Congress officials believe that the situation is not as bad
as it was in the "pre-hawala" period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was only the Congress party that was the target of
attack on the corruption issue, but now almost all the serious
contenders for power are equally placed, they argue.

MOGADISHU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Court of North
Mogadishu today sent 200 heavily armed militiamen to Jowhar,
capital of Somalia's Middle Shabelle Region, to put down
religious rebels.
</P>
<P>
The measure was taken to restore the Islamic laws and order
in the region, said Sheikh Muhidin, Chairman of the Sharia
Implementation Council.
</P>
<P>
Muhidin said those who have been "hampering the smooth
running of the Sharia laws" in the region would face "harsh
punishment according to Islamic laws".
</P>
<P>
Unrest has reigned Jowhar, 90 km north of Mogadishu, since the
regional strongman Sheikh Somow was sacked as chairman of the
Islamic Courts of the region.
</P>
<P>
Somow has insisted that he is still the legitimate chairman of
the regional Islamic Court and refused to recognise his
replacement by the Sharia Implementation Council, which Sheikh
Muhidin chairs.
</P>
<P>
Somow has said he will bring to justice those who sabotaged his
functions.
</P>
<P>
Observers said uncertainty is growing over the future of the
region since Somow belongs to one of the strongest subclans in
the area.

<P>
KUNMING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Most of the injured people in
the earthquake-stricken area in southwest China's Yunnan Province
have received medical treatment, in spite of the fact that
frequent aftershocks have continued to threaten local residents.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the 3,837 seriously injured have improved after
receiving prompt care, and 11 persons have been airlifted to
Kunming, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one thousand doctors and nurses have been busy over the
past three days, and more than 20 tons of medicines have been
airlifted there.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of aftershocks posed new threats to Lijiang and
Zhongdian counties as the death toll and property losses continued
to rise.
</P>
<P>
At least 246 people have been killed, more than 332,600 houses
and buildings destroyed, and 13,400 head of cattle killed in the
area, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
A strong aftershock measuring 5.6 on the Richter Scale hit the
area at 15:36, Beijing time, following the magnitude 7.0
earthquake of three days ago and the 6.0 aftershock early
yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that aftershocks measuring five and above will
continue to rock the area, seismologists warned, noting that more
than 644 aftershocks measuring two and above have been recorded
over the past three days, 79 of them measuring between 3.0 and 6.0.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,550 local army personnel and 350 militiamen are still
digging through the rubble for survivors, while airlift efforts
have been increased.
</P>
<P>
Chinese central authorities decided today to set aside special
funds and materials for the stricken area, and the ministries of
finance and civil affairs will coordinate efforts in allocating
ten million yuan in relief funds, and the State Planning
Commission in disbursing ten million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The State Trade and Economic Commission will provide 5,000 tons
of gasoline and diesel fuel, while the Ministry of Civil Affairs
will send 100,000 padded jackets and 100 tents.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese elsewhere have reacted to the disaster by donating
money and goods. In Yunnan alone, a total of 80 million yuan has
been raised for purchasing emergency goods.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has received thousands of
telephone calls about donations. Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
contributed 15,000 yuan for disaster-relief use.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also begun providing
assistance, and some countries and regions have sent either cash
or emergency supplies to China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) in Hainan, China's southern island province, is
expected to quadruple 1990's figure by 2000, Governor Ruan Chongwu
told a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Its market economy will be more ideal by then, according to an
economic and social development program for the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and the goal for the year 2010, submitted for
discussion at the Fourth Session of the Provincial People's
Congress today.
</P>
<P>
Provincial GDP will double the 2000 figure by 2010, the program
says.
</P>
<P>
When these goals are met, the island will become a new and
booming industrial giant, a highly efficient agricultural base,
and a more attractive tourist center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the possibility of achieving these aims, the
governor said that his province now has a small total economic
volume, so that compared to this base, the relative increase is
not big.
</P>
<P>
The province will also improve agricultural conditions and set
up agricultural bases as part of an effort to increase added value
in agriculture by nine percent annually in the next five years,
Ruan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that industrial added value is projected to grow at an
annual rate of more than 28 percent in the five-year period, and
priority will be given to the development of the pillar industries
of petrochemicals, automobile manufacturing, beverages and food,
chemical fibres and textiles, medicines, paper pulp, and building
materials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, construction of the airport at Haikou, a
round-the-island expressway, ports of entry, railways and telecom
facilities will be speeded up to pave the way for economic growth
of the island, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Shatters World Record in Winter Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, China, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Psyched-up Sun Dan made a
swoop at the finish, anchoring the Chinese foursome to a new world
record plus a gold medal at the women's 3,000 meters short-track
speedskating relay in the Asian Winter Games on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes 23.13 seconds -- the Chinese sliced 01.55 seconds
off their own world mark of 4:24.68, set in Gjovik of Norway at
the world championships on March 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
As Sun dashed home, the South Korean anchor was some 15 meters
away with the Japanese trailing almost a lap.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunlu, known for her explosive power, paced the team to
an early lead. "Elder" Yang Yang, the 1,500 meters gold medalist
here, and her namesake teammate, had never slowed down to give any
chance to the chasing South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
"Elder" Yang's mother bent over the seperation wall to hand a
Chinese national flag to the ecstatic athletes, who skated to a
victory lap, waving the flag in an ovation of the packed crowd.
</P>
<P>
South Korea timed 4:24.62 for the silver medal and Japan
clocked 4:33.91 for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"Perfect teamwork helped us break the world record," said
"Elder" Yang. "Any mishap in the relay could spoil the title
chance."
</P>
<P>
"In order to have a shot at the world record, we have been
training very hard since last May," said Wang Chulu, winner of 500
meters here. "The hardship we had been through is unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Xin Qingshan had expected his skaters to break
the record but he had also been worried that a slip or a
crash in the turn, a common scene in the 111-meter short-track
rink, would ruin their record-breaking efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese women hold an edge over the rest of world in the
3,000 meters relay," he said. "But you know, everything could
happen on the ice. The full preparation and impeccable teamwork
assures our world record."

<HEADLINE> Afghan Refugees in Pakistan Still Need Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Over one million Afghan
refugees living in Pakistan still need help, said Commissioner of
Afghan Refugees Zaibullah Khan today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the Associated Press of Pakistan in Peshawar in the
northwest of Pakistan, he criticized the UN decision to cut off
the help and services provided to those refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said those refugees cannot be repatriated at this time due
to the deteriorating conditions caused by factional fighting in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
They can not be repatriated at the moment also because there
are no conducive conditions of health, education, banking system,
security measures and infrastructure needed for the settlement of
the refugees in their homeland, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official criticized the United Nations High Commission of
Refugee (UNHCR) of its perception that now the refugees have
become self-reliant by living for a period of 16 years in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said if they continue to receive help and assistance
they would not be able to stand on their feet like a living nation
when they are back to their motherland.
</P>
<P>
Khan pointed out that the UNHCR conducted a survey through its
own agencies and came to the conclusion that the refugees no
longer required help and they could pull on themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said that refugees still needed international assistance and
they had not been able to become self-reliant in any manner.
</P>
<P>
He said it was regrettable to note that the supplies of wheat
flour and edible oil had been discontinued since January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Free supply of drinking water to them was also stopped and
about 80 tubewells were handed over to the refugees on a self-help
basis to maintain them and pay the water rates.
</P>
<P>
Khan feared that the system was going to collapse as the
refugees had no means to maintain it and pay the water rates.
</P>
<P>
He said initially it was planned that primary schools would be
set up in the refugee camps but a number of middle and secondary
schools were also established for the Afghan children.
</P>
<P>
The schools were closed down from April 1995 and now the number
of primary schools was reduced to 268 from about 400.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the aid from the UN agencies there were the
sources of non-governmental organizations (NGO) alone on whom the
refugees could depend.
</P>
<P>
But now there are only a few NGOs operating to help the Afghan
refugees in providing them education, health and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistan government is planning to revive some of
the aid in the case of those facing hardships, especially to those
fresh arrivals from Kabul who were in a miserable condition.
</P>
<P>
Income generating schemes were also being introduced to impart
training of arts and crafts to the refugees to make themselves
reliant in earning a living.

<HEADLINE> 812 Billion Yuan Increase In Savings Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese put 812.61 billion yuan
in banks over the past year, an increase of 37.7 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the total in individual savings deposits
reached 2.9662 trillion yuan, according to the People's Bank of
China, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Time deposits, especially among urban residents, are the most
popular, with more than 570 billion yuan coming from urban
residents, or 43.7 percent more than the previous year. By end of
last year, the total amount of individual time deposits was about
2.375 trillion yuan, a growth of 41 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-term deposits put into banks last year accounted for 85.1
percent of the total, eight percentage points higher than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the steady increase in people's income in real
terms last year fueled this growth in savings deposits. According
to the State Statistical Bureau, average per capita income for
urban residents in 1995, when adjusted for inflation, rose about
four percent over the previous year, and that for rural residents
five percent.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in savings deposits also shows that they are
people's top choice for investment, experts say, and that they
have more confidence in the government's efforts to curb
inflation.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister to Visit China to Promote Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette told Chinese reporters here today he hopes to boost trade
ties with China during his five-day visit to the country this
month.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said China is of prime importance to France's
overall Asia policy, hence it should be his first destination on
his first trip to Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Both China and France are permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council and shoulder world responsibilities," he
said. "Their functions and roles exceed their respective
regions. Therefore, France hopes to consult with China on all
major international issues."
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who is to visit China on February 7-11, also
stressed that France hopes to expand economic ties with China. He
said that the two countries should balance their bilateral trade
to allow France to get an adequate share of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some French companies in the energy and
auto-manufacturing industries scored significant success in China
last year, De Charette encouraged more French enterprises to
invest in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed France's support for economic cooperation
between the European Union and China. The EU views China as an
important partner and maintains a constant dialog with its leaders.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the EU has signed agreements on cooperation
programs with China, particularly on development aid and training.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan, the foreign minister said his country's position, as
demonstrated in the Sino-French joint communique issued in January
1994, is clear and coherent.
</P>
<P>
France recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole
legitimate government of China with Taiwan as its inalienable
part, he added.

KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Karim Kabariti said his government "will work to upgrade the

reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Belad

He expressed appreciation to the Saudi policy on the Arab and
Islamic issues and praised Saudi Arabian King Fahd's role toward
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official sources in Jordan said King Hussein would
visit Saudi Arabia next Sunday, the first in more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which
groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, deteriorated due to its support for the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. enditem

SEOUL -- The South Korean prosecution has started looking into
bank accounts held by three incumbent members of the National
Assembly to confirm whether they were involved in former President
Chun Doo-hwan's slush fund scandal, a prosecutor said here today.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers, Chung Ho-yong, Hur Sam-soo and Hur

their roles in the military crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in Kwangju, Capital of South Cholla Province, on May 18,

The State Seismological Bureau told Xinhua that the latest
tremor occured at 15:36, Beijing time, following the magnitude 7.0
earthquake of three days ago and the 6.0 aftershock early
yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 246 people have been killed and 3,837 seriously
injured in the area so far, according to the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that aftershocks measuring five and above will
continue to rock the area, and casualties and property losses
could mount, seismologists warned, noting that more than 644
aftershocks measuring two and above have been recorded over the
past three days, with 79 of them measuring between 3.0 and 6.0.
</P>
<P>
More than 332,600 houses and buildings collapsed and 13,400
head of cattle died in Lijiang and Zhongdian counties.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,550 local army personnel and 350 militiamen are still

</P>
<P>
As many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were used as
prostitutes, or "comfort women", for Japanese soldiers before and

1945.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report urges the Japanese government to acknowledge
that such action violated international law.

<HEADLINE> European Carmakers Pessimistic About Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading carmakers are
generally pessimistic about car sales this year because of severe
overcapacity of the industry and expectations of stagnant demand
in many markets, Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, Helmut Werner, chairman of
Mercedes-Benz, said that the car industry was "heading into a very
difficult year" because of poor demand in Europe for new cars.
</P>
<P>
He forecast that new car sales in Europe would rise by only one
per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
Giogio Garuzzo, the chief operating officer of Fiat, said he
expected sales to rise by between 3 and 4 per cent this year.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that even such limited improvements may leave the
industry in poor shape because of the introduction of new
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Toyota and Honda are planning to boost
output at their UK plants before the end of the decade, while
NedCar, the Netherlands-based joint venture between Volvo and
Mitsubishi, also expects to build up output.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers' pessimism follows poor figures recorded in
1995 when new car sales rose by just 0.6 per cent to 12 million
units, compared with a peak of 13.5 million in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Last year's depressed sales performance came in spite of a
wide-ranging government incentive scheme to stimulate new car
sales in some countries and unprecedented financial incentives by
manufacturers to boost demand.
</P>
<P>
The European Automobile Manufacturers Association blamed last
year's poor sales on high unemployment in parts of Europe, as well
as low economic growth and high debt levels in some countries.

The American girl was with twenty foreign tourists trapped at
Hutiao Gorge, a scenic spot some 40 kilometres from Dayan Town in
Lijiang County, according to the provincial foreign affairs office.

<HEADLINE> More Attention Given To Clear Skies Around China's Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A civil aviation official has
called for more attention to be paid to China's airport
environment, with the threat to flight safety growing with the
mushrooming number of city and rural construction projects across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Xu Cunxin, chief administrator for capital construction and
airport management with the Civil Aviation Administration of
China, pointed out that China issued regulations in early 1980s to
control buildings and trees surpassing safe-height limits in the
vicinity of airports.
</P>
<P>
He added that factories emitting smoke that interferes with
visibility around airports or facilities that interfere with
electromagnetic waves are also banned.
</P>
<P>
A survey by CAAC last year showed that more than 30 airports
across China have to cope with these kinds of obstacles and
interference.

Night flights were suspended at Haikou airport on China's
island province of Hainan over the weekend due to bad landing
conditions. This was the second time that air traffic was affected
in this busy town due to illegal construction projects around its
airport.
</P>
<P>
Xu explains that city planning departments are responsible for
these problems in many cases because they either have insufficient
knowledge about the problem or have given local business expansion
top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said that CAAC and the Ministry of Construction will issue a
joint circular to keep skies clearer around airports, and that
CAAC will formulate more detailed regulations, and deal with this
important issue in accordance with the stipulations of China first
civil aviation law, which is scheduled to take effect on March 1.

<HEADLINE> New Rebel Attacks Cast Doubt On Sierra Leone's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A series of rebel attacks
have taken place in east and north Sierra Leone in the past four
days, casting doubt on the February 26 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Military sources have confirmed that three campaigning
presidential candidates were held by the rebels amid the attacks.
They were former Foreign Secretary Abass Bundu, who is now leader
of the People's Progressive Party, former Minister of Information
Thaimu Bangura, who now leads the People's Democratic Party, and
former Attorney General Abu Aiah Koroma, who heads the Democratic
Centre Party.
</P>
<P>
They "were stranded in Makeni for a couple of hours" during
their separate campaign tours, but were later released by air to
the capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"It is good they (the presidential candidates) are
experiencing the rebel war in this manner for the first time,"
said some local citizens in favor of peace before elections.
</P>
<P>
One of the rebel attacks occurred over the weekend along the
Mageray Junction, 160 kilometres north of Fre lines.
</P>
<P>
Military sources have confirmed that five rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and one civilian were killed in
the rebel attack at Mano Junction, 340 kilometres east of
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
In another attack, an 18-year-old rebel, Mohamed Kamara, was
captured by government troops at the town of Habu near the Kamboi
Hills in the northern town of Kenema.
</P>
<P>
Military sources have said the captured rebel confessed that
he was on a spying mission for the rebel RUF.
</P>
<P>
A rebel ambush, which occurred at Wanjama village near Kenema
on Saturday, led to the death of more than 10 people.
</P>
<P>
The rebel attacks also caused several casualties of the
government troops.
</P>
<P>
Two survivors of the rebel attacks, Staff Sergeant Abubakarr
of the Sierra Leone army and a policeman Ibrahim Kargbo said they
were onboard a military vehicle traveling to Kenema when they
were ambushed.
</P>
<P>
"We saw lots of bodies," Kargbo told newsmen here today.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, over 55,000 displaced people in Sierra Leone's
second biggest city of Bo called for the postponement of the
forthcoming elections "until peace is restored" in the country.
</P>
<P>
They carried placards citing "serious risk" as the need to
postpone the elections.
</P>
<P>
Paramount chiefs in the south have also called for the
postponement of the elections at a rally in Bo over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, some people are opposed to the postponement of the
general elections scheduled for February 26.
</P>
<P>
"Any deferment of the present election date would lead to lack
of donor funds for the elections to be held on any other date
other than 26 February, 1996," the powerful Bar Association said
in a press release today.
</P>
<P>
The United National People's Party, one of the 15 registered
parties in the country, also opposed any postponement of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Peace cannot at this stage be separated from the electoral
process of choosing a democratically elected parliament and
president," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that elections as scheduled and peace negotiation
must proceed simultaneously," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military government refused to confirm a front
page article in the weekly newspaper For Di People on Tuesday
which claimed three South African mercenaries were captured by
the RUF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the South African soldiers were guarding the
Sierra Rutile Mines run by the Americans in the southern town of
Moyamba, where they were captured.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed that the government has already sent a top
level delegation to negotiate with RUF for the release of the
South Africans. enditem

handled over 1.96 million cases over the past five years and the
total amount of goods recovered in cases that were solved amounted
to 24 billion yuan (3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>

</P>
<P>
In addition to having confiscated 120,000 guns and some 7
million cartridges, police nationwide have cleared up 680,000
cases of prostitution, drug trafficking, and pornographic
materials over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Crisis May Drag on in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) admitted that it did not have any clue of the whereabouts
of the kidnappers of the New Papua Movement (OPM) and their
captives, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by the chief of Jayawijaya Military
Commander Lt. Col. Sumertha Ayub, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The military also admitted that they had no further contact
with the OPM, which are still holding 13 hostages, including six
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The OPM, a separatist movement in Irian Jaya, seized 26 people,
including seven foreigners, on January 8 in the mountainous,
jungle-clad area of Mapnduma.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen hostages, including one foreigner, were later
released.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the OPM and the hostages have moved out of
their jungle hideout in Mapunduma village for an unknown
destination, which might be somewhere in Indonesia's border areas
with Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal on Monday of some of the ABRI's special forces
from Wamena town, Irian Jaya, is considered as another sign that
the hostage crisis is likely to drag on for some time.
</P>
<P>
The standing order from Jakarta remains that persuasion should
be used to ensure the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The OPM members have been fighting for an independent state
since the former Dutch colony of Western Papua was incorporated
into Indonesia in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has firmly rejected the OPM's demand
for the recognition of a West Papua state in Irian Jaya in return
for the release of the hostages.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China aims to safeguard social
stability, strengthen the feeling of security among the people,
and make its police force more adaptable to the socialist market
economy in the next five years, according to an official in the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The comment came in a speech that Tao Siju, minister of public
security, delivered at the 19th National Conference on Public
Security here today, in which he outlined the general objective in
public security work over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Tao pointed out that although great achievements have been made
in the past five years, the police nationwide should be aware of
the arduous work that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the number of criminal cases is on the rise
and that inter-provincial and multinational crimes and those
committed by computer and other high-tech methods are also
growing, and predicted that severe criminal violence, major
economic crimes, drug trafficking and prostitution, the production
and selling of pornographic materials could further jeopardize
social security and economic order in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the minister said, priority should be given to
safeguarding social stability and halting the increase of severe
criminal cases, to give people more favourable living conditions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urged to Enact Special Housing Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government was
suggested to enact a special housing law to protect consumers
against deceitful developers.
</P>
<P>
Noted Professor Saleh at the University of Tanjungpura in West
Kalimantan made the suggestion recently, saying that his
suggestion is based on the consideration that the demand for
housing is continuing to increase and it may cause legal
violations by developers.
</P>
<P>
According to Saleh, the law should regulate the selling and
buying, contract and other aspects of the relations between the
consumers and the developers.
</P>
<P>
Another measure in preventing the violation by developers and
financial loss for consumers is to tighten the procedure whereby
the authorities grant licenses to developers. Besides, consumers
should learn about laws regulating the developers.
</P>
<P>
Previously, President Soeharto asked Public Housing Minister
Akbar Tanjung to force deceptive developers to repay consumers'
money.
</P>
<P>
The Public Housing Ministry opened a mail box in anticipation
of possible complaints of consumers last year.
</P>
<P>
So far the ministry through the mail box received 48 letters,
out of which 30 filed complaints against deceptive developers.
</P>
<P>
The letters would be discussed by a special team which
comprised officers of the Public Housing Ministry and Indonesian
real estate.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urges Policemen on Alert against Sabotage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today urged the law enforcement officials to
be on alert against possible sabotage during the upcoming
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
"Today, more than any other time, the whole world is watching
how the elections will be held in Iran," said Rafsanjani while
addressing high-ranking officials of the law enforcement forces.
</P>
<P>
Some 170,000 law enforcement agents are to provide security
for the 30,000 polling stations, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The official statistics showed that 5,121 candidates were
registered in the past week to run for 270 seats in the Fifth
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani stressed that due to the "political importance and
sensitivity" of March 8 parliamentary elections, the role of
enforcement forces had gained in significance.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to create a sense of security and tranquility
in the Islamic Republic where efforts are directed toward
establishing an atmosphere which is free and appropriate for the
healthy conflict of ideas in order to choose the best
candidates," he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a commander of Iran's law enforcement forces
said that plans have been made to secure the border areas during
the elections.
</P>
<P>
With four weeks left to the elections, observers here have
notice a more prominent presence of Iran's dark-blue-uniformed
police in the streets of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The increased number of policemen, they noted, shows the
government's anxiety that elections this year would be disrupted
by the sabotage of the Iraq-based armed opposition group People's
Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI).
</P>
<P>
In 1992, PMOI staged a series of bombing around the country
during the fourth parliamentary elections. The Iranian government
reacted by staging an air raid on PMOI base inside the Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
Recently pro-PMOI graffiti has appeared prominently on Sadre
Highway, one of Tehran's major highways. The graffiti, which has
not been yet whitewashed by the government, says "Hail Rajavi,
Long Live PMOI."
</P>
<P>
Mass'oud Rajavi is PMOI's leader who lives in Iraq at the
moment. There are about 20,000 anti-government forces in
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Train More Civil Servants for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Macao will send 25 civil servants
to Beijing in April to attend a five-week special training course,
an executive of the Beijing-based National School of
Administration said here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second of such seminars offered by the mainland
school, designed to train more civil servants for Macao, including
Macao-born Portuguese people, said Cheng Lianchang, vice-president
of the school.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of the school, headed by Cheng, visited related
departments of Macao and called on Macao Governor Vasco Rocha
Vieira today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to expand their cooperation so that more
Macao senior civil servants will be trained in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The school trained 23 Macao government officials last year,
giving them lectures on China's policies, Chinese history and
culture, and teaching them the standard Chinese language as well.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has over 15,000 civil servants, with most of the
middle- and high-level positions of the government held by people
from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it remains an uneasy task to have local citizens as
middle and senior civil servants before 1999 when China resumes
the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
praised the cooperation in the training of civil servants, saying
that it is evidence of the friendly cooperation between China and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"It will help Macao civil servants know the structure of the
Chinese public service system, improve their comprehensive quality
and help ensure a smooth transition of Macao," he said.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged officials to attach greater importance to fighting
corruption and to regard it as a basic task for consolidating
state power.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth working conference on fighting corruption
of the State Council, China's highest governing body, Li said that
fighting corruption and keeping the government clean and honest
are essential for the nation's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Fighting corruption is a long-term, arduous job, he said,
noting that corrupting behavior is still spreading in some fields
and a number of problems are yet to be tackled.
</P>
<P>
"Officials at various levels should be aware of the grave and
complex nature of the job and never be slack in their work," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
China has gradually gotten experience in its anti-corruption
drive that is conducive to doing the job, he said.
</P>
<P>
The next 15 years will be a key period for China's reform and
opening to the outside world and the state will continue to focus
on developing the national economy. To adapt to the situation, the
anti-corruption efforts must be stepped up so that society's mood
will improve radically, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In asking that officials increase self-discipline and be clean
and honest, Li stressed that it is necessary to concentrate on
handling major cases, which is an important aspect of fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government made progress in handling major cases
and cracking down on corruption, Li said, and the work will
continue this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will never tolerate such evils. All corrupt officials will
be subject to the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that collection of random fees by some
departments is one of the major problems complained about by
people, and urged all departments and local government to tackle
the problem.
</P>
<P>
He also targeted illegal behaviors in the banking sector and
finance departments, calling for stricter supervision over those
departments and punishment of corrupt behavior.
</P>
<P>
It is essential that leadership in the anti-corruption drive
be increased and the system of supervision and law enforcement be
improved, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will perfect its mechanism for preventing officials'
abuse of power and reinforce anti-corruption controls over major
industries and posts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier on Latin American Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DRESDEN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between China and
Latin American has a bright future, Chinese Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji said at the end of his 11-day Latin American tour.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who starts a week long visit to Germany today, said his
visit to Argentina, Chile and Uruguay has helped enhance
high-level contacts, strengthen understanding, and promote mutual
cooperation between China and the three countries.
</P>
<P>
He said developing friendly relations with Latin American
countries and increasing high-level contact is increasingly
important for China as economic and trade relations have developed
rapidly over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total volume of bilateral trade between China and
Latin American countries jumped 30 per cent to 6.1 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Zhu said that during his visit to the region
between January 26 and February 5, he exchanged views with leaders
of the three countries on bilateral relations and international
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He witnessed the great achievements made by the people of the
three countries, their warmth towards the Chinese people and their
strong desire to develop relations with China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed gratitude to the three countries for their
one-China policy and their policy of not having official relations
with Taiwan, which is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
China and Latin American countries, which share a strong desire
to enhance their economic and trade relations, have both
advantages and disadvantages which complement each other, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sino-Latin American relations, which already have
a solid foundation, should be further developed both in depth and
breadth.

<HEADLINE> Financing, Central to Agenda 21 Implementation: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said today that financing issues are central to the successful
implementation of Agenda 21 adopted during the 1992 Earth Summit
held in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the third expert group
meeting on financial issues, ADB Vice President Pierre Uhel said
that Agenda 21 and other outcomes of the Earth Summit provide an
agreed political framework for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he noted that the general response to the
recommendations of the Earth Summit regarding financing falls
short of expectations so far.
</P>
<P>
At the international level, he said that prospects for
achieving adequate, predictable and additional financing flows to
developing countries face many challenges.
</P>
<P>
He added that the prospects for a substantial increase in aid
flows in the near future are also poor.
</P>
<P>
According to experts' estimate, implementation of activities in
the context of Agenda 21 amounts to an annual average of over 600
billion US dollars for the period from 1993 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian-Pacific region alone, the annual financial
relevant needs are estimated at 70 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Uhel indicated that the goal of financial mobilization for
sustainable development makes it necessary to act without delay on
all possible fronts.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that there are limits to reliance on external
financing.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of financing environmental programs will need to come
from domestic resources, including private sources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is sponsored by the governments of the
Philippines and Japan, the United Nations and the Asian
Development Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A professional soccer player for
English first division side Wolverhampton Wanderers was jailed for
five years on Tuesday for kicking a man to death in a brawl.
</P>
<P>
James Kelly, 22, was convicted of manslaughter after giving
Peter Dunphy a ferocious kick in the head in an early morning
fight outside a Liverpool hotel last September.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said Kelly had aimed the blow as though he were
kicking a football. Dunphy, 26, died instantly from the blow to
the base of the skull and upper neck.
</P>
<P>
The judge also jailed Kelly's 23-year-old brother John and a
third man for nine months each for their role in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a midfielder, had made six appearance for the first
team at Wolverhampton.
</P>
<P>
Graham Taylor, former England boss and a previous manager of
Wolverhampton, had earlier told the court that the player was
popular and trustworthy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police tonight have
charged seven Vietnamese men jointly with one count of murder in
which a Vietnamese inmate was killed in the High Island Detention
Center last week.
</P>
<P>
According to a police spokesman, all the seven Vietnamese men
were migrants in the High Island Detention Center before they were
arrested  in a police raid at the center for a murder case.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that it has been the third murder at the
center since 1995, adding that two men were seriously wounded in
the same incident.
</P>
<P>
He said that the spokesman attributed the case to gang warfare
over control of the camp.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the murder, he said, Hong Kong police and the
Correctional Services Department (CSD) officers jointly launched a
five-and-half-hour raid operation in the center.

He called the raid "one of the most successful camp searches",
resulting in the seizure of about 1,000 miscellaneous items of
home-made weapons, including daggers, blades, spears and sharpened
bamboo poles.
</P>
<P>
Other objects used in the manufacture of weapons, such as files
and hacksaw blades, were also recovered, he said.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Gold-rich Kazakhstan is
planning to boost production to turn the country into one of the
world's top 10 gold producers.
</P>
<P>
The central Asian country has gold reserves of some 552 million
U.S. dollars, Alievich Djandosov, President of the State Bank of
Kazakhstan, said today.
</P>
<P>
The country has an annual production capacity of 100 tons,
Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin told reporters, but with actual
annual output of only 50 tons, Kazakhstan is now planning to
modernize its equipment and encourage foreign investment to boost
production.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan has been gradually increasing its gold production
over the last few years to fund economic development and earn
foreign currency. The government launched an ambitious
gold-exploitation plan in 1994, in a bid to become one of the top
ten gold-production nations in the world.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Croatian Deputy-Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Mate Granic said that he believes
Chinese influence can be very helpful to the peace process in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The comment came at a press conference in the Great Hall of the
People here today, where Granic said that this is because China
has very good relations with both Belgrade and Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
"Croatian-Chinese political relations are stable," he told
reporters, and emphasized that "there are no political questions
between our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Concerning economic cooperation, he said that the trade volume
last year stood at 70 million U.S. dollars, and 500 million
dollars in a petrochemical project.
</P>
<P>
He said that during these two days, he has met with his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen, with Premier Li Peng, and with
Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee
Buhe.
</P>
<P>
The discussions focused on bilateral relations, political,
economic, cultural and scientific cooperation, the situation in
the former Yugoslavia, and the global political situation.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome China's support for Croatia's territorial integrity
and sovereignty, for the peaceful solution of problems in the
former Yugoslavia, and for the normalization of relations between
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He re-affirmed Croatia's support for China's resumption of
exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and Croatia's
adherence to the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Croatia's economic and agricultural minister and
president of parliament will visit China this year, and a Chinese
economic delegation and high ranking officials will tour Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh Prime Minister Rules out Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's Prime Minister
Akezhan Kazhegeldin today ruled out the possibility of his
resigning and vowed to carry out the government's reform plan to
revitalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The government resigns only when someone forces us to step
down, or someone wants to replace us, or we are willing to do so,"
Kazhegeldin told reporters here and said he would not step down of
his own volition.
</P>
<P>
He said he is "obligated to fulfil the reform plan" the
government set out at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev's criticism of the government's
performance in a speech to the new congress in January 30 has
fueled widespread speculation that the prime minister would be
removed.
</P>
<P>
But Kazhegeldin said he had promised the president, who has the
constitutional right to dismiss the prime minister, he would
continue to work for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Refuting a TV report last week that he may step-down due to ill
health, Kazhegeldin said he had never been in hospital since
entering the government in 1993. "I will try to take good care of
myself," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the new position of secretary of state created by
the president, a post widely seen as coming between the president
and the prime minister, Kazhegeldin said the appointment will be
decided by the president himself, because "it is not a government
post."

JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that commitment and courage are needed to scrap
levies in the country.
</P>
<P>
He instructed all ministries and state offices to have the
commitment to abolishing levies that are closely related to
production.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Manpower Adbul Latief today briefed the president

After the elimination of the 17 levies, the government will

<P>
According to Latief, the policy aims to stop the collection of
illegal levies and prevent the red tape from besetting the
business community.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of illegal levies will increase the competitive
edge of Indonesian products, the minister noted.

Speaking at a national meeting, Tao described this as the
"major work of public security departments at all levels".
</P>
<P>
The police must be "politically reliable, professionally
efficient, qualified in working style, strict in discipline, and
fair in enforcing the law," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that priority must be given to political education to
ensure that the police force keeps unison with the Party's Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
"They must bar their minds from temptation and corrupt
ideology," he stressed. The ministry will make efforts in rooting
out corruption in public security departments, and will strengthen
the supervision over the abuse of power for personal interest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the laws, regulations and rules that concern the
police should be further improved, he said, adding that China will
resort to the use of science and technology to increase its
ability to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
The training of police is to be improved dramatically over the
next five years and 10 percent of the police force will get
college education, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Help Cambodia Fight Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
promised to help Cambodia in its fight against drug trafficking,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's second Prime Minister Hun Sen appealed to the
U.N. for help when he met here Monday with Giorgio Giacomelli,
U.N. under-secretary general and executive director of the United
Nations International Drug Control Program (UNDCP).
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said the world body would help strengthen
Cambodia's drug control legislation and would respond to
Cambodia's request for help to train technical drug staff how to
distinguish different kinds of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told Giacomelli his government is very concerned with
drug trafficking in the country and that an draft law on fighting
drugs would be adopted by the national assembly in the near future.
</P>
<P>
A special department to fight drug trafficking has already been
set up, with a secretariat in the Interior Ministry and in some
provinces to fight the problem, said Hun.
</P>
<P>
The UNDCP was set up in 1990 to help countries, primarily in
the developing world, to fight illicit drug production,
trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cambodia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
on drug control covering the six countries of the greater Mekong
region.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Vie for Manila's Wholesale Banking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one year after ten
foreign bank branches made their soft opening last year in the
Philippines, competition among the ten new entrants is expected to
start this year.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Panlilio, executive vice president and treasurer of the
Far East Bank and Trust Company, said today that the focus of
competition is expected to be on wholesale banking and treasury
operations.
</P>
<P>
While the foreign banks have been in operation since last year,
he said they are only building up their capability and putting
into place their operating systems.
</P>
<P>
Most likely, he observed, the new foreign bank entrants are set
to compete in wholesale banking and treasury including the still
new derivatives trading business.
</P>
<P>
However, Panlilio was confident that while the foreign banks
may be able to eat up part of the local banks' market, in time the
local banks would also be able to eat up the foreign banks'
market.

<HEADLINE> Tire Producer To Retread Airplane Tires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation
Administration of China recently gave approval for retreading
airplane tires to the Lanyu Tire Development Company in Guilin
City of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the field say the event marks a historical step in
the aircraft tire industry in China, because it will save Chinese
airlines the cost of sending all their airplane tires to Hong Kong
and Thailand for retreading.
</P>
<P>
Retreaded tires are widely used worldwide to replace new tires
and can cut the cost in half, but only a few companies in Japan,
the United States, and France have the technology.
</P>
<P>
Lanyu is owned by the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry and
is one of the major aircraft tire producers in China. It acquired
a license from the Federal Aviation Administration of the United
States for designing aircraft tires in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company started research on retreading of airplane tires in
1994.

HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka tennis team
arrived here Monday to prepare their Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Zone
Group Two first round tie against Hong Kong starting here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan captain Arjun Fernando said that the team's
preparations for the tie was slightly disrupted as a result of the

<P>
The bomb blast devastated the Central Bank Building in
Colombo's financial district.

"A few days after the blast, there were Independence Day
celebrations," he said. "The security was very tight and we could
not use our courts because they were right in the middle of it,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
But since the team only lost a couple of days for practice, the
captain was not worried of its form.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan team arrived with only three players, with the
fourth one, Sanjay Wijemanne, pulled out for personal reasons.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Downplays Inflation Fears  (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
downplayed fears of higher inflation in the country as the
national inflation rate remained in the double-digit level for the
fifth straight months.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Statistics Office, the country's
inflation rate stood at 11.2 percent, which was slightly higher
than the 10.9 percent posted in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The double-digit figure was attributed to the implementation of
the expanded value added tax (EVAT).
</P>
<P>
However, Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito told
reporters that the 11.2 percent inflation rate is a positive
out-of-line direction, as the government and the private sector
were expecting something even worse than the actual January
inflation rate level.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the double-digit inflation is purely due to
the arithmetic implication of measuring the year-on-year basis,
but on the month-on-month basis, inflation is not expected to be
on the uptrend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson also assured
the public that monetary management remains consistent with the
inflation control.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the growth in domestic liquidity (M3)
slowed down from 31.4 percent in June to 28.9 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the indicative target, M3 was actually 24.2
billion pesos (968 million US dollars) below in November.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, reserve money, a prime determinant of
liquidity, was 12.7 billion pesos (508 million US dollars) and
19.8 billion pesos (792 million US dollars) below the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) ceilings for December 1995 and
January 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
IMF resident representative to Manila David Nellor said that
the January inflation rate was way below what market participants
had expected.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that inflation rate has stabilized," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Financial officials said that the recent oil price hike is
expected to have an impact on the February inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the country's inflation is likely to remain in
the double-digit level during the first quarter of the year and
will start tapering off after March.
</P>
<P>
However, former budget undersecretary Benjamin Diokno,
professor at the University of the Philippines, indicated that the
implementation of the EVAT, and the wage and oil price hikes have
exerted "tremendous inflationary pressure" in the country.
</P>
<P>
he expected inflation to be at double-digit figure in the next
two quarters with the annual rate in the neighborhood of eight
percent to nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The government is targeting a six to seven percent inflation
rate in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Customs Seizes 314 Tons of Smuggled Tea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan customs seized 314
tons of smuggled tea in surprise raids in Peshawar in the
northwest of Pakistan Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Customs
intelligence first worked out locations of godowns in Peshawar
where tea was stored and chalked out raid plans with the help of
local police authorities.
</P>
<P>
The first raid lasted six hours Monday and 187 tons of smuggled
tea were recovered.
</P>
<P>
During the second raid conducted early Tuesday morning, 127
tons of tea were seized in addition to smuggled chemicals and
drilling machines.
</P>
<P>
Customs intelligence sources said that two people have been
arrested while further arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale market value of seized goods was estimated at 38
million rupees (1.11 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Duties and taxes evaded on seized goods were estimated at 16
million rupees (466,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Pakistan's major revenue spinners. In 1994-95 the
government realized four billion rupees (117 million dollars) in
duties and taxes on the import of tea.
</P>
<P>
High quality tea has been smuggled into Pakistan through
Afghanistan for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistan Tea Association, 20 million kilograms of
Kenyan and Indonesian origin tea valued at one billion rupees (29
million dollars) were smuggled through this route in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Israel Puts Huge Investment on Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government
invested some 100 million shekels (32 million U.S. dollars) last
year to develop infrastructure and industry on the Golan Heights
Israel occupied from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat
today during a tour of the Golan Heights, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Shohat said that until political decisions are made on the
future of the plateau, the government must provide for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Golan Regional Council Yehud Volman said that in
the coming year, the government will invest another 50 million
shekels (16 million dollars) in infrastructure including
construction of roads.
</P>
<P>
The future of the Golan Heights is key to the peace talks
between Israel and Syria. Syria demands a complete Israeli
withdrawal from the area, but Israel has not made such a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
Security arrangements on the Golan Heights have dominated the
agenda of the Israeli-Syrian negotiations so far, and no
significant breakthrough has been made.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- British world boxing champions
Frank Bruno and Nigel Benn face investigation after allegations
they are putting their health at risk by taking too many vitamin
pills.
</P>
<P>
The British Board of Boxing Control said it would look into
reports claiming the two World Boxing Council (WBC) champions,
heavyweight Bruno and super-middleweight Benn, were taking 150
vitamin pills a day at their Tenerife training headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken to Frank Warren, the promoter of Bruno and Benn,
and had a chat with Frank Bruno's wife Laura, and we just want to
know the details," Board secretary John Morris said.
</P>
<P>
"If you read a story that says Britain's top boxers could be
putting themselves at risk, we want to know how and why."
</P>
<P>
Professor Tom Sanders, head of nutrition and diet at King's
College Hospital in London was quoted as saying such a quantity
of vitamins "can cause problems".
</P>
<P>
Morris said: "Our own medical panel have initiated the
inquiries. But you can't get advice on something until you get
answers."
</P>
<P>
The Board's chief medical officer Adrian Whiteson said: "If
they've got a balanced diet, and they have -- there's no reason
to believe they haven't -- their nutrition is better than most
people's.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe any vitamins they take would have any benefit
to them whatsoever, other than a psychological one."
</P>
<P>
Bruno and Benn are preparing together in the sunshine of the
Canary islands in readiness for their title defences against Mike
Tyson and Sugar Boy Malinga respectively.

<HEADLINE> PLO Executive Committee Denounces Israel for "Expansionist Measures" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Arish, Egypt, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The PLO Executive
Committee, which ended its two-day meeting in this Egyptian
resort town today, denounced what it called the "expansionist
measures" taken by Israel in the Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Abed Rabbo, member of the Executive Committee of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), told reporters following
the meeting that the committee discussed "in details and with deep
concern the expansionist measures that are being taken" by Israel
in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is trying to expand Jewish settlements on
the Palestinian land under the pretext of building the by-pass
roads and other so-called security reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The PLO Executive Committee denounces these measures," he
said, adding that these violations will poison the peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo said the PLO calls for Israel to halt the measures
and respect all its obligations in accordance with the PLO-
Israeli peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Eleven members, including President of the Palestinian
Authority Yasser Arafat, attended the meeting, which began Monday
evening and adjourned early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kaddoumy, head of the PLO Political Department, and
six other Executive Committee members did not attend the
meeting. Kaddoumy has expressed opposition to the direction the
peace talks with Israel are moving.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting today, Arafat said that the meeting
was very important as it has been the first by the Executive
Committee since the first ever Palestinian elections held last
month.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo said that the PLO Executive Committee, which
resumed its meeting this morning, also urges Israel to release
Palestinian prisoners as agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The committee also discussed the convocation of a meeting of
the Palestinian National Council (PNC), or parliament-in-exile, to
amend the PLO National Charter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded that the PLO revoke sections in the charter
that call for Israel's destruction before the Palestinian-Israeli
talks for a final settlement due to start in May.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee has appointed a special committee to
make preparations for "a quick and successful meeting of the
PNC," Abed Rabbo said.
</P>
<P>
The special committee is composed of some members of the
Executive Committee and the Presidency of the PNC, he told
reporters, adding that he expects the PNC meeting will be held in
not more than two months.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority vote of the PNC is needed to amend the
charter. The PNC currently has 483 members. But the 88 members of
the newly elected Palestinian Council governing the West Bank and
Gaza Strip will be automatically added to the PNC.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has reportedly hinted that the PNC will be convened in
April, after the meeting of the Palestinian Council.
</P>
<P>
But the PNC's acting Chairman Salim al-Zaanoun has said that he
doesn't think a vote was possible before May.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee is made up of 18 representatives from
various Palestinian factions and independents. It acts as a sort
of government-in-exile.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo said the Executive Committee meeting also
discussed the final-state talks between the Palestinians and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the PLO has called for an immediate start of the
negotiations, adding that the talks should start in a date not
later than the beginning of May.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also dealt with continuing the implementation of
PLO-Israel agreement reached last September, including the Israeli
withdrawal from Hebron and other parts of the Palestinian land
in the West Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the meeting reviewed the Palestinian
elections and discussed the relations between the institutions of
the PLO and those of the Palestinian Authority, reiterating that
the PLO is the sole and legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people inside and outside Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He said the Executive Committee considers that the election
"has shown the will of our people toward building its national
institutions as a step toward building a Palestinian independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital."

approval on some seating and scheduling issues which had dogged
them, organisers said.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano Games, to be held from February 7 to 22, 1998, will
be the biggest ever Winter Olympics with the addition of three new
medals events -- women's ice hockey, curling and snowboarding.
</P>
<P>
The final of the men's ice hockey, one of the biggest draw
cards of the games, was rescheduled to start at 2:00 p.m. (0500
GMT), which would make it midnight for television viewers on the
east coast of the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The ice hockey federation had demanded that NAOC start the
final earlier given the interest among North American fans in the
participation of National Hockey League professionals at the
Winter Olympics for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"We won basic approval on this new time schedule," Naokichi
Nishimura, NAOC's deputy managing director, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
NAOC also convinced the ice hockey federation over another
issue -- seating capacity for the main ice hockey stadium. The
main stadium, contrary to its name "Big Hat," has permanent
facilities for only 5,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
This would be increased to at least 10,000 using temporary
seats, Nishimura said. Tickets for Nagano's ice hockey "Dream
Tournament", so called because of the participation of NHL
players, could become a premium item.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also agreed on seating capacity for the figure
skating rink and the venue for curling.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have yet to discuss one of the biggest
pending issues -- NAOC's promise to pay for the air fare of every
foreign athlete and official.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 when Nagano beat Salt Lake City for the 1998 games,
organisers pledged to pay the air fares of all the estimated
3,000 athletes and officials taking part.
</P>
<P>
That was at the height of Japan's so-called "bubble" economy,
which crashed in 1992 and was followed by almost four years of
recession.
</P>
<P>
During this time, the addition of the three new medals events,
the appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and
lack of domestic commercial sponsors have meant that NAOC would
suffer an expected revenue shortfall of about 30 billion yen (300
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
NAOC is in no position to pay the estimated one billion yen
(10 million U.S. dollars) for the air fares.
</P>
<P>
The issue was expected to be taken up in Wednesday's talks.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, had a meeting here this evening with Meechai
Ruechupan, speaker of the Thai Senate.
</P>
<P>
Li, who visited Thailand last December, extended a warm welcome
to Meechai, who is here as Li's guest.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visit between
the two countries play an irreplaceable part in promoting the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the current visit of Meechai would
help promote the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that bilateral relations between the two
countries are like those between relatives and the two countries
have every reason to further develop such ties.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman quoted King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand
as saying that relations between the two countries "were good in
the past, are good at present and will be better in the future,"
and that China's development benefits not only China itself, but
its neighbors and the whole world as well.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes the two countries would make joint efforts to
push bilateral relations further ahead.
</P>
<P>
Meechai shared Li's view by saying that there exists
traditional friendship between Thailand and China and that he is
here as if he is visiting a relative.
</P>
<P>
Meechai expressed his appreciation of China's rapid economic
development and the achievements the Chinese people have scored.
</P>
<P>
He said that a strong China is conducive to peace and
development in this region as well as the world as a whole. He
added that China's development has increased the confidence of the
countries in this region.
</P>
<P>
Meechai added that the exchanges and cooperation between his
senate and the CPPCC National Committee would be further
strengthened.

drawn from China's civilization and the traditions of China's
nationalities, she said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Lawmakers Suspected of Involvement in Slush  Fund Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution has
started looking into bank accounts held by three incumbent members
of the National Assembly to confirm whether they were involved in
former President Chun Doo-hwan's slush fund scandal, a prosecutor
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers, Chung Ho-yong, Hur Sam-soo and Hur
Hwa-pyung, were arrested on January 31 on insurrection charges for
their roles in the military crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in Kwangju, Capital of South Cholla Province, on May 18,
1980.
</P>
<P>
Chung is suspected of having taken over 10 million U.S.
dollars from defense contractors while serving as defense minister
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution is investigating 16 bank accounts held by the
three legislators and members of their families to determine
whether they accepted money from businessmen for themselves or
Chun while they occupied positions of influence during Chun's
presidency from 1980 to 1988, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
The three lawmakers will be charged with political fund
violations and bribery if it is confirmed that they accepted money
for chun and themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution is also investigating allegations
that Chun gave money to some lawmakers so that they would support
his efforts to found a new political party.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, has been
indicted for bribery, insurrection and treason.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Casts Doubt on EMU Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Eddie George, the Governor of
the Bank of England, gave a warning Monday that pressing ahead
with European monetary union (EMU) without the right economic
conditions could cause serious tensions in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on BBC TV, George said that a currency union
would work only if all the countries involved had met strict
conditions to bring their economies into line, with similar levels
of national debt and rates of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Failure to meet those criteria could create turmoil through the
mass migration of people from poor countries to richer neighbors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if economic conditions were not satisfied by 1999,
he would be against the union. Pressing on with a single currency
for solely political motives would be a mistake, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The political advantages would be very considerable if the
economic conditions were right," he said, "But I think simply to
insist upon political advantage and to take a risk with the
economics could actually risk producing political dissension
within Europe and achieve quite the wrong result."
</P>
<P>
The governor reinforced the views of Kenneth Clarke, the
Chancellor of the Exchequor, who said last week that the UK would
not accept any softening of the criteria for a single currency.
</P>
<P>
George added that it was right for the government to join
preparations for a single currency so that, if ministers
ultimately decided to stay outside, they could do so from a
position of strength rather than weakness.
</P>
<P>
His remarks have also echoed the views of many members of the
cabinet, including John Major's, and may be seen in other EU
countries as part of a concerted UK attempt to raise obstacles to
the creation of a single currency.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the economic slowdown in European countries,
there are now serious doubts over whether any leading countries,
including France and Germany, can qualify for the single currency
on time. Some are pressing for the conditions to be reviewed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 204 Vietnamese
boat people, 145 men and 59 women, today voluntarily left Malaysia
for their home country.
</P>
<P>
These boat people left for Ho Chi Minh City on two flights this
evening, according to the commander of the Malaysian Police Field
Force's central brigade, SAC II Hanif Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
Hanif said two other boat people who were supposed to return
home today pulled out at the last minute on medical grounds.
</P>
<P>
Hanif told the press that the number of Vietnamese boat people
left in Malaysia was 4,430, of whom 3,636 were housed at the
Sungai Besi Camp, where the Vietnamese clashed with police force
last month protesting against repatriation. During the incident,
23 people, including seven policemen, were injured and one left
dead.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said shortly after
the incident that Malaysia would not tolerate those people who
came to Malaysia and then made problems.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, a total of 5,060 Vietnamese boat people have
returned to their home country from Malaysia under a voluntary
repatriation program.
</P>

Hanif said the next flight would be on February 13, and 200 to
250 people would be expected to return to Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ruling Party Releases Poll Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) today formally released its manifesto for the upcoming
general elections fixed on February 15, pledging continuation of
the ongoing development process to ensure a better economic and
social life for the people.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto was released at a press conference in the party's
office by BNP Secretary General Abdus Salam Talukdar.
</P>
<P>
The party has striven hard to accomplish the pledges it made in
the last election manifesto in 1990, the BNP said in its new
manifesto, urging the people to vote for the BNP and help it in
power to complete the welfare-oriented programs.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto listed the programs to bring all-round welfare to
the people, saying all economic policies will be formulated based
on poverty alleviation and attaining national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
It is through understanding and cooperation but not conflict
and belligerence that the party wants to create a happy and
healthy society with the united efforts of the people, the
manifesto stressed.
</P>
<P>
On national security and foreign policy, the manifesto noted
that the 25-year treaty with neighboring country India signed in
1973 will not be renewed if the party remains in power.
</P>
<P>
But it pledged all-out efforts to secure the rightful share of
the waters of the river Ganges and for a permanent solution to the
water-sharing problem between Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
The BNP also pledged to pursue a neutral foreign policy based
on friendship with all nations, stressing special ties with the
Islamic countries.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Economy Hit by Central Bank Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The attack by Tamil rebels on
Sri Lanka's Central Bank in Colombo last Wednesday is seen by
observers as a direct blow to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The blast also destroyed some high rise buildings in the
neighborhood that housed key financial institutions belonging to
several sectors of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Setbacks are in store for many sectors of the economy until
after the reorganization of these institutions.
</P>
<P>
Economists here said that the bomb attack would have adverse
effects on the country's economy both in the short and longer
terms.
</P>
<P>
They warned that potential foreign investors are likely to shy
away. The country's liquidity situation is in question with the
Central Bank's activities heavily restricted.
</P>
<P>
They also expected a halt in the government's urgent
privatization program to meet this year's huge budget deficit of
nearly two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the World Bank, long term foreign
investment in Sri Lanka will not suffer.
</P>
<P>
An official of the World Bank's South Asia Desk said that
foreign investors who have been looking at Sri Lanka for a long
time are aware of the problems, adding that it is unlikely for the
incident to influence their decisions fundamentally.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor A.S. Jayawardena said that nothing would
be allowed to affect the banking system. The operations of the
money market will begin soon, he promised.
</P>
<P>
Leading Sri Lankan economists nevertheless seem to think
otherwise. They predict a cash shortage in the coming weeks and
say the government would not have sufficient cash to meet its
day-to-day needs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the loss of documentation in the blast will have
serious repercussions on financial and commercial decision-making
in the immediate future, they said.

<HEADLINE> Strong Aftershock Hits Lijiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A strong aftershock measuring
5.6 on the Richter Scale hit quake-stricken Lijiang county in
southwest China's Yunnan Province this afternoon as the death toll
in the area continued to mount.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau told Xinhua that the latest
tremor occured at 15:36, Beijing time, following the magnitude 7.0
earthquake of three days ago and the 6.0 aftershock early yesterday
morning.
</P>
<P>
At least 246 people have been killed and 3,837 seriously
injured in the area so far, according to the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
It is likely that aftershocks measuring five and above will
continue to rock the area, and casualties and property losses
could mount, seismologists warned, noting that more than 644
aftershocks measuring two and above have been recorded over the
past three days, with 79 of them measuring between 3.0 and 6.0.
</P>
<P>
More than 332,600 houses and buildings collapsed and 13,400
head of cattle died in Lijiang and Zhongdian counties.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,550 local army personnel and 350 militiamen are still
digging through the rubble for survivors and a number of medical
teams are on the scene. Airlift efforts have been increased to
transport victims to other areas for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that, in spite of all-out efforts by the
government, the rescue work is hampered by a shortage of funds and
disaster-relief supplies, and by poor transportation conditions in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central authorities decided today to set aside
special funds and materials for the stricken area, and the
ministries of finance and civil affairs will coordinate efforts in
allocating ten million yuan in relief funds, and the State
Planning Commission, ten million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The State Trade and Economic Commission will coordinate in
providing 5,000 tons of gasoline and diesel fuel, while the
Ministry of Civil Affairs will send 100,000 padded jackets and
100 tents.
</P>
<P>
After the Red Cross Society of China made an appeal to the
international community for humanitarian aid on Sunday, the Red
Cross of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan provided a total of about
190,000 U.S. dollars in cash for purchasing emergency supplies.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the time is right and it is the desire of the
people for Hong Kong to be returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks here this afternoon at a meeting with a
delegation from the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of Hong
Kong, led by its chairman, Tsang Yok Sing.
</P>
<P>
Li said, "We are pleased to note that positive changes have
taken place in Hong Kong residents' feelings about this and their
understanding of China's principles and policies on Hong Kong is
increasing."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the delegation, Li noted that since its founding, the
Democratic Alliance has adhered to the principles of loving both
the country and Hong Kong and done a lot in uniting Hong Kong
residents, especially at the grass roots level to involve them
during the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the Democratic Alliance, as a
patriotic organization, will continue to make contributions to
Hong Kong's stable transition and the smooth transfer of the power
in the remaining 511 days.

Patriotism means loving Hong Kong too, he said, adding that the
formulation of China's principles and policies toward Hong Kong
has fully considered the actual conditions of the region, which

<HEADLINE> South Korea Welcomes U.N. Report on Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today welcomed a
United Nations report calling on the Japanese government to accept
legal responsibility for women forced to serve as sex slaves for
the Japanese army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
As many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were used as
prostitutes, or "comfort women", for Japanese soldiers before and
during the war. Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to
1945.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report urges the Japanese government to acknowledge
that such action violated international law.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Ministry said the report, issued in
Geneva today by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Violence Against
Woman, would provide an opportunity for Japan to act to settle the
"comfort women" issue.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has consistently urged Japan to bring the issue
into the open. The ministry said the U.N. report is meaningful
because it is the first such report resulting from investigations
by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo insists that it is not legally bound to compensate
individual victims, saying that it has settled all claims under
the 1965 Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty which normalized relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
By establishing a civilian-led Peace and Friendship Fund for
Women in Asia to provide financial aid to the surviving "comfort
women," Japan also refused to accept legal responsibility for
atrocities committed against the "comfort women."

<HEADLINE> 24-Hour Shops Bring Convenience to Shanghai Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of 24-hour chain
stores, shops and groceries in shanghai has risen to more than 200
from less than ten three years ago, bringing great convenience to
the local residents, according to the Municipal Financial Affairs
and Trade Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to residents living round about and staff working
in recreational units, most of these shops' customers are passing
travellers.
</P>
<P>
"The per-night sales volume of a shop covering less than 40 sq
m can reach 3,000-4,000 yuan (about 361.4-481.9 US dollars),
amounting to as much as half of the daytime sales amount," said a
sales clerk at one of the Baishi chain stores.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai residents' schedule of work and rest has changed
because of the more colorful night life nowadays. They are now
used to participating in recreational or social activities at
night, which contributes a lot to the rise of the number of these
24-hour shops.
</P>
<P>
There are also more than 100,000 night-shift workers in the
city, who constitute a large consumer group, together with people
who would like to stay out late at night.
</P>
<P>
These shops not only offer customers goods but also convenience
services. For instance, the sales clerks at the Baishi chain
stores give directions to at least 20 passing travellers or taxi
drivers every night, and they usually let residents use the
store's telephone for emergency purpose.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Reach Deal on Joint List for Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel's two major
opposition parties, Likud and Tsomet, reached today an agreement
on a joint list for the coming Knesset (Israel's parliament)
elections.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached between Likud Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu and Tsomet party leader Rafael Eitan who met this
morning in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Netanyahu announced that the two parties are
joining forces before the elections and will remain together
after them.
</P>
<P>
The agreement contains a clause which prevents the Tsomet
party from entering a coalition government led by Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres if he wins the election for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Peres is the current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Tsomet will receive seven in the first 40
slots in the joint list for the elections, one less than it
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Sources in both parties have estimated that a joint list will
enable them to win 44 out of the total 120 Knesset seats,
compared with 37 or 38 separately.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the two parties won 40 seats altogether, while the
Labor had 47 seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a mock election at Blich High School in Ramat Gan
this morning has resulted in a resounding victory for the Labor
Party and Peres.
</P>
<P>
Labor won 46 percent of the votes and the Likud-Tsomet faction
obtained 36 percent, with the Meretz party 10 percent, the Third
Way 6 percent and Moledet 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the prime ministership, Peres garnered 61 percent of the
votes, while Netanyahu received only 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the poll in the school closely predicted the
voting trend in the nationwide balloting.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Labor faction in the Knesset Ra'anan Cohen said
Monday that Prime Minister Peres would decide on February 15 on
wether to hold early elections, which can take place probably in
late May, five months ahead the original schedule.

MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today urged the country's congressmen to pass the bills
deregulating the oil industry and the retail trade and bills on
economic and social reforms at an early time.
</P>
<P>
"These bills are now in Congress, and should be soon seen
approval," Ramos said before influential local and foreign
businessmen attending the 5th Roundtable Conference held in
Manila.
</P>
<P>
The president said an early passage of the bills would further
liberalize the economy and create a more favorable investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
With regard to oil deregulation, the president said if oil
prices go up in the world market, it is not sensible to subsidize
further.
</P>
<P>
He said the oil industry, like many sectors of the economy,
must and will be deregulated and market forces will be allowed to
play their due part there.
</P>
<P>
The president said other bills before Congress are the
government reorganization bill, and bills on police, electoral and
judicial reforms, which are the core of his economic and social
reform package.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine economy is expected to achieve a six to
seven percent increase in the gross national product (GNP) this
year with the successful implementation of the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests 35 Narcotics Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities arrested 35
people on charges of smuggling narcotics into Arab countries in
the Persian Gulf, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Reza Seifollahi, commander of Iran's law enforcement forces,
said that about two tons of opium, 28 cars and five houses were
seized from the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers were involved in smuggling narcotics in Iran's
southern provinces such as Fars, Kerman, Hormuzgan, Sistan and
Baluchestan and Bushehr, he added.
</P>
<P>
They tried to bribe law enforcement agents on duty with
280,000 U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the state-run Tehran Radio did not reveal the
nationalities or names of those arrested.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, the law enforcement forces
seized 125 tons of narcotics in the first nine months of the
Iranian year starting on March 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Iran captured more than 150 tons of narcotics, among
them 117 tons of opium and 13 tons of morphine.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems of
the country since it is one of the best transit for drug to
Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest
drug-producing center in the world.
</P>
<P>
On its border with Afghanistan and Pakistan, Iran has made
1,400 kilometers of roads and 150 kilometers of canals in order to
prevent drug smugglers from entering the country.

HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong posted the biggest

</P>
<P>
Hong Kong equity market took the lead by registering a growth
rate of 12.6 percent in January, according to Morgan Stanly
Capital International (MSCI), which has measured the performance
of international securities since 1969. The general index of 22

the gains in the territory.

<P>
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index, the major indicator of the Hong
Kong stock market, surged more than 1,200 points in the first
month of 1996 to 11,359. The successive advance was led by
vibrant trading of financial and property shares, which are

<HEADLINE> Two Fallacies on "Taiwan Independence" Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A signed article today refutes
two kinds of fallacies concerning the "independence of Taiwan",
namely, the "invisible independence of Taiwan" advocated by Lee
Teng-hui and the "visible independence of Taiwan" by Peng Ming-min.
</P>
<P>
The article signed by Li Jiaquan says that a long time ago Peng
Ming-min became a notorious element advocating the "independence
of Taiwan" and an agent of foreign interests who completely lost
his dignity of being a member of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
As he openly preached the "independence of Taiwan", he was
forced into exile overseas for a long time, it notes.
</P>
<P>
But as Lee Teng-hui hid his intention for advocacy of the
"independence of Taiwan", he worked for the Kuomintang for a long
time until rising to the "peak" of power in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Both Lee and Peng studied in
Japan. After Japan's surrender in 1945 they both returned to
Taiwan to study at Taiwan University before going to the United
States and France for further study, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Since their youth they have been "intimate friends" because
their political viewpoints are similar, it says.
</P>
<P>
While studying at Taiwan University, they formed an "iron
triangle" with Liu Ching-rui, a man who had returned from Japan
and was inclined to the "independence of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Peng was chosen as one of the "ten
outstanding youths" in Taiwan and received by Chiang Kai-shek
twice. Then he and Lee were on very good terms.
</P>
<P>
In September 1964 Peng was arrested on charges of treason
because he printed and distributed the "Declaration of the Taiwan
People's Salvation Movement". At a meeting in New York on February
9, 1990 he said, "I was with Lee Teng-hui the day before I was
arrested."
</P>
<P>
While in exile overseas Lee cared very much about what Peng
did. After becoming "vice-president", he ordered his close
followers to contact Peng secretly.
</P>
<P>
In May 1990 Peng told a Taiwan newspaper reporter: "When Lee
was still vice-president I was told that at the mention of me, Lee
asked whether I was now fond of reading."
</P>
<P>
Lee was in a rather difficult situation in the early period of
wielding power. In the US Peng appealed to overseas personalities
to support Lee, saying: "I have a good understanding of Lee
Teng-hui's personality, style of work and ideals. Lee is worth 100
percent backing for creating a new situation in foreign affairs."
</P>
<P>
Having consolidated his power, Lee solicited Peng's ideas on
many important issues, such the candidates for the "cabinet" and
the direct election of the "president".
</P>
<P>
In April 1990 Lee invited Peng to return to Taiwan from the
United States. In the fall of 1992 he ordered the cancellation of
the arrest warrant for Peng.
</P>
<P>
Before and after then Peng was actually Lee's "super-aide," the
article says.

The statement said: "The conference has as its aim the
promotion of bilateral negotiations and the constitutional
process by airing the current international approach to the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
of the Philippines (AMCHAM) is urging Manila to grant a number of
tax and visa privileges for regional headquarters to give itself
an edge over its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The AMCHAM said today in a news release, "When a multinational
firm selects a base for its regional activities, it is sending a
strong message that the base country is stable, sound and
competitive."
</P>
<P>
Among the incentives proposed by the AMCHAM are a multiple
entry visa valid for three to five years and tax and duty-free
importation of personal and household effects and training
materials.
</P>
<P>
Duties and taxes on imported cars should not be more than 25
percent of applicable rates.
</P>
<P>
As a safeguard, "adequate control must be in place to prevent
importation abuses, and the regional headquarters must be held
responsible for compliance."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today approved a technical assistance grant of 750,000 US dollars
to tackle chronic child malnutrition in eight Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance will draw up an investment plan, which
will justify raising resource commitments both domestically and
externally.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will provide an
additional 250,000 US dollars equivalent in co-financing. Both
the bank and UNICEF will manage the project.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance aims to create a self-sustaining
regional network of research institutions and policy-makers who
will continue the policy dialogue and share proven approaches in
the interest of the region's children.
</P>
<P>
Participating governments -- Bangladesh, Cambodia, China,
India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka -- will
prepare investment plans to reduce child malnutrition by half by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The eight developing member countries covered by the grant
account for roughly two thirds of the world's 190 million
malnourished children.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Confident Of Overcoming Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that he was confident that the
country's trade deficit would continue to fall due to aggressive
measures taken by the government and the private sector to cut
imports and boost exports.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a gathering: "If we act to reduce imports
and step up exports, then the deficit will fall. It has nothing to
do with economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"Merely slowing down economic growth will not help to reduce
the deficit," he said when commenting on a report that the current
account trade deficit for last November was slashed to 49.2
million Malaysian ringgit (about 19.68 million US dollars) from
October's 1.6 billion ringgit (about 640 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir disclosed that one of the measures adopted to boost
exports was to step up the production of Proton car, the Malaysian
home-made car, and export more.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said the private sector had responded very well
to the government's efforts to produce more goods for exports.
</P>
<P>
On reducing imports, the prime minister said the measures taken
included using more local resources.

<HEADLINE> Australia, West Indies Could Face Bill over Missed Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 6 (Xinhua) - A senior Indian cricket
official said on Tuesday that the World Cup organisers could sue
Australia and West Indies if they failed to play scheduled
matches in Sri Lanka, the Reuters reported today.
</P>
<P>
"All sponsorship contracts have an in-built clause which
reduces the payment (by sponsors) if any match is not played,"
the official, who is a member of the Pakistan-India-Lanka
Committee (PILCOM), said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"If any country skips any match, the organisers are empowered
to seek damages to compensate for the losses, though we are not
talking about this at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The teams were bound by contract to pay except where matches
suffer on account of natural calamities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after Australia and West Indies requested to
shift the competition venue from Sri Lanka, fearing for their
safety after a bomb blast which left 80 people dead in downtown
Colombo last week.
</P>
<P>
The organisers stand to lose sponsorship money if any of the
37 matches is not played, but each of the 12 participating teams
has signed a contract promising to play all matches scheduled,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The PILCOM official said the losses for each match would run
into millions of rupees.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Still Hope to Persuade Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka still hope to
persuade Australia and West Indies to change their minds and agree
to play their World Cup cricket matches in Colombo, officials said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both teams have asked for their matches to be switched to
another country because of safety fears following the huge bomb
blast in the center of the capital Colombo last week which killed
more than 80 people.
</P>
<P>
Thilanga Sumathipala, vice-president of the Board of Control
for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL), said officials would continue
to lobby Australia and West Indies to reverse their decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't given up hope. Our doors are wide open for
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
A promise of extra-tight security by the Sri Lankan
authorities has failed to persuade the two teams to withdraw
requests for their matches to be switched to either India or
Pakistan, the other World Cup co-hosts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) rejected the offer earlier
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A proposal received from Sri Lanka to transport the
Australian team to the stadium in Colombo by helicopter under
maximum security was considered and declined by the ACB today," a
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The World Cup organising committee PILCOM on Tuesday insisted
the matches would go ahead in Sri Lanka as planned.
</P>
<P>
"PILCOM has taken a decision. The matches will be played
according to schedule," Jagmohan Dalmiya, the committee's
convenor secretary, said in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Kenya are also scheduled to play matches in Sri
Lanka and both have so far said they will go ahead with them.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Cricket Association chairman Jimmy Rayani said in
Nairobi on Tuesday: "At this stage, we would like to say that we
shall play in Sri Lanka. But basically we will wait and see how
things develop.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Issue Basical and Dangerous Point: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, in his first remarks to the press since his triumph in
the historic January 20 Palestinian elections, has admitted that
the problem of Jerusalem's final status is a "basical and
dangerous point."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Arabic-language daily
Al-Hayat published today, Arafat said, "There are a lot of things
still suspended with the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The interview of Yasser Arafat with the Saudian-owned daily
was held on Sunday night in Davos, Switzerland, where he was
attending an annual economic meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are passing a historic circumstance," the Palestinian
leader said. "We are at the door of a dialogue with the Israelis
on the final stage, and this is the most important and most
dangerous stage where a right (for the Palestinians) to determine
their fate, to establish an independent Palestinian state with
Al-Quds as its capital will be decided."
</P>
<P>
He said that Al-Quds (Jerusalem), the Palestinian refugees, the
Jewish settlements and the final borders are the "four basic
issues" to be raised in the final stage of the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He added that among the things still suspended with the
Israelis are also the security corridors between the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, the problem of Palestinian prisoners jailed by
Israel and the economic situations.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of Al-Quds, the Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman underlined that "Al-Quds, no matter whether
we want it to be or not and whether they want it to be or not, is
a basic and dangerous point and it is linked with the honor for
us."
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis and the Israeli leadership should know and
understand that Al-Quds not only concerns the Palestinians, but
also concerns the Palestinians, the Arab, the Christians and the
Moslems in the world as a whole," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Palestinians have "many ideas" on the
final solution on Al-Quds but "we are waiting for the other party
(the Israelis) to say its opinions."
</P>
<P>
Arafat revealed that during his last meeting with Jordan's King
Hussein, the latter told him that the Kingdom will think about a
confederation with Palestine "when the Palestinian state is set
up."
</P>
<P>
"And I thanked him for his stand," the Palestinian leader
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor
government promised new funds to improve public medical services
in the election campaign today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Paul Keating unveiled the Labor party's medicare
policy in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
In the policy package, the Labor party promised to increase
government medicare subsidies for Australian families by 368
million Australian dollars (277.8 million US dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Families covered by the public medicare system will receive
350-500 Australian dollars (264-378 US dollars) more of rebate a
year for the money they spend on medical services. These families
account for 80 percent of the Australian total.
</P>
<P>
The Government also promised the same amount of extra payments
every year for families who have private medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Labor's package is in stark contrast with the medicare
policy of the Liberal-led Opposition coalition. The Opposition
said that it would encourage people to take out private medical
insurance instead of receiving government medical subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition also attacked the medicare system under the
Labor Government as inefficient to meet the needs of patients.
</P>
<P>
In a counter-attack, Labor Health Minister Carmen Lawrence
announced today that the Government would spend more on cutting
the waiting times of patients if it was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence said that the Labor Government would invest 150
million Australian dollars (113.3 million US dollars) in two years
to cut waiting times of elective surgery. The funds will go
directly to the states and territories to make sure that patients
do not wait longer than their doctors recommend.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Federal Government will push state
governments to reform their medicare systems by re-negotiating the
Medicare agreements with the states and territories.

<HEADLINE> Russia Assures Kuwait of Unchanged Policy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia has assured Kuwait
that its foreign policy on Iraq will remain Unchanged and
reiterated its full commitment to Kuwait's sovereignty and
security, the local English-language newspaper Arab Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that new Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov told Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Sulaiman
Majed Al-Shahin during their meeting last week that Russia's
foreign policy regarding Iraq's 1990 aggression on Kuwait will not
change and will remain in line with the international consensus on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Shahin was the first senior foreign dignitary to have met with
Primakov in Moscow since Primakov's appointment to the post.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Arab Times, Shahin said that Primakov
assured him of Russia's unequivocal support during their two-hour
meeting. Shahin also conveyed to Primakov a message from Deputy
Premier and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed calling for
expanding the scope of cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia would continue to demand Iraq's full
compliance with all U.N. resolutions, especially Kuwait's just
right for compensation against war damages, releasing of Kuwaiti
POWs and return of stolen Kuwaiti properties.
</P>
<P>
Shahin also discussed with Primakov recent developments in the
Gulf region and the Arab-Israeli Peace talks in addition to
Kuwaiti-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
Shahin added that Primakov reiterated his country's
irreversible commitment to Kuwait's security, sovereignty and
territorial integrity. He also announced Russia's intention to
effectively contribute to achieving comprehensive stability in the
region, in which the use of force to resolve disputes will have no
place.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also assured Shahin that there will be no return to
the old type of relations and that Moscow was looking forward to
strong ties with Kuwait and the Gulf countries. He affirmed that
the resumption of Russia's traditional ties with Iraq will not be
at the expense of Kuwait and the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources, Primakov has agreed to
visit Kuwait during his first tour of the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Names Rowers for Olympic Qualifying Regatta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has named an
eight-member rowing squad for the Asian Zone Olympic Qualifying
Regatta to be held in Toda, Japan in June.
</P>
<P>
The team is spearheaded by women's lightweight double scullers
Ho Kim-fai and Fenella Ng while others include men's lightweight
four Lo Sing-yan, Lui Kam-chi, Chau Fung-yau, Chiang Wing-hung and
men's open single sculler Michael Tse.
</P>
<P>
The team, with its members being all scholarship holders of the
Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), is believed to be the strongest
ever assembled in Hong Kong. They were all finalists in the 1994
Asian Games in Hiroshima and returned from the 1995 Asian
championships held in China, with at least one medal.
</P>
<P>
But the team still faces a real test as reaching the qualifying
standard would not be an easy task. "Only the winning crew in each
event at the qualifying regatta will be guaranteed a place for
Atlanta," said Chris Perry, coach of the team.
</P>
<P>
"Second or third placed crews will have to be among the fastest
boats from among all the world zones to have a chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Perry added that only three crews from Asia are so far
qualified for last year's world championships and therefore every
Asian country is expected to send crews for the qualifying
regatta.
</P>
<P>
"Our crews are presently very competitive in the region, but I
expect strong opposition from China and Japan," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK's League Format Cripples Players: Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Rugby Union coach
believes that this season's league format has hampered the
development of its front-row players.
</P>
<P>
George Simpkin blamed the First Division format of having led
to the professionals not getting tough enough match practice,
according to a local press report.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments after Hong Kong won over a South Korean
side 27-16 in the opening game of the two-game test series.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local rugby officials are considering a move to
extend the domestic season to ease the load of the internationals.
</P>
<P>
A congested fixture means Hong Kong's top players have to play
non-stop from now and the next season.
</P>
<P>
They are to compete in seven Tests in the new Pan Pacific
Series and the Asian championships at the beginning of next
season.
</P>
<P>
Also on their schedule are three Sevens outside Hong Kong
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Rugby Football Union director of development Peter
Duncan said officials were looking at re-scheduling next season's
start to October. In that case, Hong Kong's leagues would break
for a month over Christmas before resuming in late January.
</P>
<P>
The league season would then end later this year, probably in
April, Duncan said, which would enable the players to be fully
match fit before competing in the Pan Pacific Series, the official
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Party Leader: "I Will not Meet with Arafat" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Likud Chairman Binyamin
Netanyahu has said that if he is elected prime minister, he will
not personally meet or deal with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Israel Television Monday night, Netanyahu claimed
that "I will not meet with Arafat, will not chase him nor stroll
hand in hand with him in the hotels of Europe."
</P>
<P>
"If the PNA meets basic conditions, such as giving up its aim
of destroying Israel and ceasing to support terrorism, then I
will have my people deal with the PNA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Netanyahu confirmed that the Likud, the
largest opposition party, and the Tsomet party are to form a
joint list in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli elections were scheduled for October this year and
are likely to be advanced to May.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Tsomet leader Rafel Eitan are to meet today to
put the finishing touches on the agreement and discuss the
allocation of slots and the joint platform they hope to announce.
</P>
<P>
The move came after polls show that a joint list would win
more Knesset seats than separated Likud and Tsomet lists.
</P>
<P>
Some sources in both parties estimated that they will win 44
seats jointly, against 37 or 38 separately. In 1992, the two
lists won 40 seats together.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The University of Zimbabwe
launched on Monday a Litraid project to improve literacy in the
remote areas through distance education aimed at improving
literacy.
</P>
<P>
Litraid is a video-led, in-service distance education program
which places emphasis on the teaching of reading, communicative
language and development of teaching aids.
</P>
<P>
The program is targeted at teachers who will impart skills to
students and pupils. Rotary clubs of England and Harare, with the
support of the Open University of Britain, are behind the
project. The University of Zimbabwe had received an entire
distance education course, an outreach land-rover equipped with
video and independent power source, some 1,200 volumes of
teaching material and lecture notes, 35 hours of video footage
and six full trained tutors.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Higher Education Chombo said that the Litraid
program was timely as it came at a time when Simbabwe was trying

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Cricket Board
(ACB) rejected on Tuesday a Sri Lankan offer that it will make
extra efforts to tighten the security for a World Cup cricket
match.
</P>
<P>
The ACB said that it is still waiting for a formal answer to
its request to change the venue for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
The offer was aimed to bring Australia to the capital city to
take part in the match against Sri Lanka on February 17.
</P>
<P>
A huge bomb exploded in the city last week that killed more
than 80 people.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said in Colombo
on Monday the ACB had been told the Australians could stay in
India, fly in amid top security early on February 17 for the match
and leave immediately afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The latest ACB statement reaffirms the board's decision not to
allow its players to compete in Sri Lanka and appeared to rule
out any chance of compromise.
</P>
<P>
"A proposal received from Sri Lanka to transport the
Australian team to the stadium in Colombo by helicopter under
maximum security was considered and declined by the ACB today,"
the ACB statement said.
</P>
<P>
The West Indies on Monday also asked for their February 25
match against Sri Lanka to be moved from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
But Zimbabwe and Kenya have said they will go ahead with their
matches in Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> New Rice Transplanting Technique Spreads in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A modern rice transplanting
technique which can raise both output and efficiency has been
popularized in more than 20 Chinese provinces, autonomous regions
and cities.
</P>
<P>
The new technique, known as the seedling-throwing method, can
increase the per-unit yield by 100 kg and raise work efficiency by
five to seven times compared with conventional methods, said an
agriculture expert.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, it can relieve farmers from the suffering of
bending over for hours every day during the transplanting season,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The acreage covered by the technology expanded to 682,000 ha in
1995, according to a national conference on the spread of the
technology held in this capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
One quarter of the paddy fields in rural Shanghai have adopted
the technique. The area sown with the new method has been enlarged
year by year in northeast China's Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang
provinces, central China's Hunan and Hubei provinces and east
China's Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the technique will be applied on four million
ha of paddy fields throughout China.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's high court judge
justice Mubako has called for stiffer sentences for convicted
rapists.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first Masvingo high court circuit for 1996 justice
on Monday, Mubako urged the government and the courts to revisit
sentences set out in rape cases, particularly those involving
children victims.
</P>
<P>
''Judicial officers must follow the rules in imposing
sentences. However, I agree that sentences, partilcularly on rape
cases I have referred to, are invariably inadequate. The public
have every right to demand stiffer penalties,'' he said.

Zimbabwe is experiencing an upsurge in the number of cases of

<HEADLINE> Bahrain's Crisis to End Soon: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain's 14-month long riot
will end soon, Bahraini Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman
al Khalifa said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Abu Dhabi-based Emirates News quoted Sheikh Khalifa as
saying Monday that "the crisis which we passed through will be
over soon after we took some precautions which ensure the citizens
safety."
</P>
<P>
Unrest erupted first in December, 1994 when the Bahraini
authorities arrested a cleric who called for the restoration of
parliament which was disbanded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The recent unrest began in last December. Riots erupted several
times in different parts of the tiny Gulf Arab country in the past
two months.
</P>
<P>
The opposition says it is not seeking to topple the ruling
family, but rather seeks freedom of speech and the reinstatement
of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
During the crackdown operations launched in the past three to
four weeks, nearly 500 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the degree and the scale of these crimes
have reduced following stiff measures taken by the security
patrols and guards to deal such situation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Bahraini government has announced
several plans to create more jobs, launch training programs and
hire more Bahrainis in a bid to ease the unemployment, one of the
factors that contributed to the unrest.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority is to ensure the right climate for investment
from the Gulf, Arabs and Westerners to invest in our country and
to build new projects which will help us develop our plans and
create more jobs." Sheikh Khalifa stressed.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Eyes Overseas Banks (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Lam, president of the Shenzhen Branch of the Shenzhen ING
Bank of the Netherlands, said that Shenzhen has introduced the
"most perfect" banking system in China.
</P>
<P>
Lam, who resides in Hong Kong, said: "I believe that Shenzhen
enjoys bright prospects in adapting its financial market to the
global financial market."
</P>
<P>
He explained that Shenzhen enjoys a unique advantage in opening
its banking industry to the outside world because business and
personnel exchanges between it and Hong Kong are so convenient.
</P>
<P>
He said that an export-oriented economy has become the driving
force behind the opening of Shenzhen's banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Demand from Shenzhen-based enterprises and institutions for
international financial business, such as raising money for trade
has been growing rapidly, thus providing vast scope for foreign
banks to expand their business, he said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded banks now handle 30 percent to 40 percent of
international banking business related to China's trade with the
rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
They pay close attention to extending long-term loans to
projects with good market prospects, he said, adding that they
co-operate with Chinese banks in extending such loans.
</P>
<P>
For example, in June 1995, his branch and the Shenzhen Branch
of the People's Construction Bank of China jointly organized a
consortium of Chinese and foreign banks. The consortium extended a
30 million US dollar loan to a project for production of
ultra-thin glass undertaken by Shenzhen's Nanbo Company.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Shenzhen branch of the Bank of China has organized
nine consortiums of foreign banks, which have extended a total of
500 million dollars to key construction projects in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Allen K.H. Chow, president of the Shenzhen Branch of the
Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation, said, "My bank's
business has been expanding with the increasing prosperity of the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone."
</P>
<P>
The branch is now handling business in such sectors as real
estate, trade, hotels and manufacturing, he said.

Shenzhen, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone will open its banking industry still wider to the outside
world and encourage foreign banks to open offices in the city over
the next five years, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sino-foreign co-operative banks, joint fund
companies, joint investment companies and joint insurance
companies will be set up in Shenzhen, an official of the Shenzhen
Branch of the People's Bank of China said.
</P>
<P>
Flexible policies are being pursued in Shenzhen bordering on
Hong Kong to encourage investors from Hong Kong, Macao and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Mayor Wu Jiesi, during the 1996-2000 period
Shenzhen will invest a total of 180 billion yuan on urban
construction, transportation, power industry and the manufacturing
industry, averaging 36 billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
He invited foreign banks to become involved in this investment
program.
</P>
<P>
The official said that foreign-funded banks in Shenzhen are
operating successfully, with their profits totaling 56.55 million
US dollars in 1995, up 68 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign banks are eager to invest in the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, foreign banks had extended loans to the
zone, totalling three billion dollars, up 25 percent over the 1994
figure. Their savings deposits reached 700 million dollars at the
end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen currently has 24 branches of banks in Britain, France,
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United
States. Twenty-four foreign financial institutions have opened
representative offices in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the banking industry has become the most
important component of Shenzhen's service sector, contributing
ten percent to the city's gross domestic product (the value of
goods and services produced) and 40 percent to the output value of
the city's service sector.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Promises Greater Backing for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) will double its loans for domestic exporters to 1.35
billion US dollars-worth this year, the bank's president Lei Zuhua
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the bank's board of directors, Lei
said that the Eximbank will extend to exporters 11.2 billion yuan
(about 1.3 billion US dollars) and 50 million US dollars-worth of
foreign exchange in export seller's credits this year, up from
5.603 billion yuan and 13 million US dollars for 105 projects last
year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's credits helped boost China's exports of electronic
products and machinery, and generated a profit of 1.7 billion
yuan, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that machinery and electronic products
replaced textiles to become China's single largest export item
last year.
</P>
<P>
Lei said that the Eximbank also signed 22 export credit letters
and guarantees valued at 161 million US dollars last year, adding
that progress was also made in offering preferential Chinese
government loans to overseas borrowers and in relending foreign
government loans to domestic borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese bank's loans will continue to take the form of
export credits, with lending priority given to the export of
complete sets of equipment and high-tech products as well as to
overseas projects aided by China, Lei told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank is one of China's policy-oriented banks
established in 1994 to finance the country's export of capital
goods represented by electronics products and machinery. It plans
to open a representative office for business in central and
western Africa this year. Currently the bank has two domestic
representative offices respectively in Shanghai and Dalian, a
coastal city in the northeastern province of Liaoning.

<HEADLINE> Book Discusses Three Gorges Project Environmental Impacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China has published a book on
environmental and ecological problems that may arise from the
gigantic Three Gorges Project, the first time for the country to
give a full account of these problems to the world.
</P>
<P>
The book, "Environmental Impact Statement for the Yangtze Three
Gorges Project (Abridged Edition)", cites almost all the problems
that may be brought about by the project, and has come up with
countermeasures and suggestions to solve them.
</P>
<P>
China began to construct the project in 1993 in a bid to
control Yangtze River floods, provide a huge supply of extra
electricity, reduce pollution aggravated by the burning of coal,
improve navigation on the Yangtze and bring other benefits.
</P>
<P>
The project will also, however, submerge 600 sq km of land
affecting 21 counties. By the year 2008 over one million people
will have been resettled.
</P>
<P>
The project has raised ecological and environmental concerns
both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The book was compiled by Wu Guoping and Huang Zhenli, of the
Three Gorges Project Construction Committee of the State Council,
and some scientists and researchers. It has condensed large
quantities of achievements made by Chinese scientists and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
"The publication of the book is aimed at dismissing people's
misgivings with scientific analysis," said Dr. Huang.
</P>
<P>
The book has evaluated more than 70 environmental factors,
covering natural environment, social environment and problems of
particular public concern.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the conclusion the book points out, "The
ecological and environmental impacts of the project have both
positive and negative aspects, to which adequate attention must be
paid. Once the effective measures, in terms of policy,
engineering, supervision and management, scientific research as
well as investment, etc., are taken into account and fully
implemented to minimize the negative impacts, none of the
ecological and environmental issues will affect the feasibility of
the Three Gorges Project."
</P>
<P>
The English-language version of the book is published by
Science Press and is now available in bookstores overseas.

</P>
<P>
But that does not necessarily mean Hong Kong will be able to
field a team at the event as there is no guarantee that the First
Division clubs would supply the selected players when the
tournament kicks-off on February 19 in the Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The 26-strong League eleven was named by a seven-member panel,
headed by South China Athletics Association supremo Albert Hung
Cho-hou.
</P>
<P>
The naming was followed by a rebel group's announcement which
at once plunged the tournament into doubt. The cartel, the
Association of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs (AHKPFC),
said people would know within the next two day how the group would
act on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a press conference to announce our forthcoming
actions," said Ken Ng Kin, a spokesman of the AHKPFC.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken any action in the past two weeks because we
did not want to spoil the morale of the Hong Kong team during the
Asian Cup."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, all the 10 senior clubs are still boycotting
the Carlsberg Cup until further notice."
</P>
<P>
"The HKFA has made a lot of comments in the past two weeks. Now
it's our turn. Our actions will be very effective."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the HKFA had yet met the group's demands, which
could be summarized as more say in the running of the local game
and hand over of HKFA's over 30 percent share of the game
receipt.
</P>
<P>
Hung said that the dispute between the HKFA and AHKPFC is not
over.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I have been put in the middle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I support both parties. It is a difficult situation," he
added.
</P>
<P>
And in another development, Wong Man-wai, the coach of the new
Hong Kong league team, said he might withdraw for health reasons.
Wong belongs to South China, one of the senior clubs under the
AHKPFC.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao chairman Ng Chung, along with Happy Valley's Leung
Ting and South China's Andy Lo Yung-sum will serve as League XI
managers.
</P>
<P>
Derek Currie, Carlsberg public relations manager, said that in
that case, they might invite a current national coach from Europe
to assist the Hong Kong league team.

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Promises Greater Backing for Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) will double its loans for domestic exporters to 180
million US dollars-worth this year, the bank's president Lei Zuhua
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the bank's board of directors, Lei
said that the Eximbank will extend to exporters 11.2 billion yuan
(about 130 million US dollars) and 50 million US dollars-worth of
foreign exchange in export seller's credits this year, up from
5.603 billion yuan and 13 million US dollars for 105 projects last
year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's credits helped boost China's exports of electronic
products and machinery, and generated a profit of 1.7 billion
yuan, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that machinery and electronic products
replaced textiles to become China's single largest export item
last year.
</P>
<P>
Lei said that the Eximbank also signed 22 export credit letters
and guarantees valued at 161 million US dollars last year, adding
that progress was also made in offering preferential Chinese
government loans to overseas borrowers and in relending foreign
government loans to domestic borrowers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese bank's loans will continue to take the form of
export credits, with lending priority given to the export of
complete sets of equipment and high-tech products as well as to
overseas projects aided by China, Lei told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank is one of China's policy-oriented banks
established in 1994 to finance the country's export of capital
goods represented by electronics products and machinery. It plans
to open a representative office for business in central and
western Africa this year. Currently the bank has two domestic
representative offices respectively in Shanghai and Dalian, a
coastal city in the northeastern province of Liaoning.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigate Ferry Accident in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian police in Aceh
province launched their own investigation on the January 19 ferry
accident.
</P>
<P>
The police's investigation was separated from the one
commissioned by the Aceh provincial administration, according to
local press reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Ferry "Gurita" with passengers and cargo on its way from Sabang
island to Aceh sank on January 19.
</P>
<P>
The government's official investigation has all along stated
that the ferry was seaworthy and not overloaded. Preliminary
investigations suggested bad weather was the cause of the January
19 accident.
</P>
<P>
According to the Transportation Ministry, 210 passengers and 16
crew members were on board. The ferryboat sank leaving 54 dead
and more than a hundred others missing. Only 40 passengers
survived so far.
</P>
<P>
However, the police investigation determined that the ferry may
have been carrying as many as 400 passengers, and not 210.
</P>
<P>
The police investigation, as reported by 'Suara Karya' daily,
found that the vessel had leaks which were only plugged by cement.
 The news that the ferry had leaks has been confirmed by Teuku
Darwin, chairman of the ruling party Golkar Board in Aceh. Teuku
Darwin said he had spoken to two "Gurita" crewmen who worked in
the engine room, according to a report on "the Jakarta Post".
</P>
<P>
The search for the missing ferry passengers officially ended on
February 2. The government's official investigation is still
underway.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Zoo's Pandas Short of Favorite Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The 14 giant pandas in Beijing
Zoo, the country's national zoo, are threatened with inadequate
supplies of arrow bamboo, their favorite food, according to the
"China Forestry News".
</P>
<P>
The weekend edition of the newspaper, published by the Ministry
of Forestry, said panda keepers in the zoo have to feed them beef,
eggs, milk, apples, carrots and compound feed because of
insufficient supplies of arrow bamboo.
</P>
<P>
The lack of arrow bamboo has caused digestion disorders,
abdominal distension and diarrhoea, loss of weight and lowering of
their resistance to disease, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Wang Wanmin, who is in charge of raising the pandas,
as saying that ten giant pandas have been born, of whom eight have
survived in the zoo since 1990.
</P>
<P>
An average giant panda consumes 10 kg of fresh arrow bamboo
every day and the wastage is usually several times that of what is
consumed.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that only 1,500 kg of arrow bamboo is available
at present, far from what is needed.
</P>
<P>
Only bamboo chopped within 24 hours is suitable for the pandas'
consumption, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Though China is a big bamboo producer, the nearest
bamboo-producing area is Jiaozuo City in Henan Province, central
China, which has been providing arrow bamboo for Beijing Zoo over
the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
As farmers are getting rich in that area, arrow bamboo
producers are losing interest in growing the plant, as it is less
profitable.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a lot of bamboo stands have been chopped down to
make way for housing construction.
</P>
<P>
The zoo, with a deficit of 15 million yuan in 1995, can not
afford more supplies of the bamboo, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian State Firms Urged to Manage Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian state-owned forestry
companies have been urged to manage at least 50 percent of the
country's productive forests to ensure sustainable management.
</P>
<P>
Currently, state companies control only about 11 percent of
Indonesian forests, disclosed Hasanu Simon, an environmental
analyst in Gadjah Mada University, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent statement by Hasanu, the government
should allow all the six state-owned companies under the Ministry
of Forestry to take over all of the ill-managed forest concessions
for rehabilitation purposes.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has an estimated 109 million hectares of forests, of
which only about 64 million hectares are considered as productive
forests.
</P>
<P>
Hasanu's statement came amid the government's efforts to
gradually replace the current forest concession system with a new
arrangement called the forest management unit to anticipate the
worldwide application of ecolabelling in the year 2000, a system
whereby all wooden products made from sustainable forests will
have special labels attached.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, the end of the current sixth five-year development
plan, the Indonesian government will set up 195 such units. Each
unit will have an average forest area of 100,000 hectares and will
have to be managed sustainably on a long term basis.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the new system will be finalized all over
Indonesia during the second long term (25-year) development plan
ending in 2019.

HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe urged other governments in the world to pursue the
principle of collective security for their common good.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks yesterday when he bade farewell to
Zimbabwe's relief battalion being sent to Angola to replace the
its first peacekeeping units there.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zimbabwe was ready to cooperate with other states
in the search for solutions to problems of conflict and
challenges for human survival, he said.
</P>

''The governments should pursue more vigorously the principle
of collective security for their common good. It is in this
spirit that my government has honoured its international
obligations and has now pledged a second battalion to take part
in the United Nations peacekeeping operations in Angola alongside
the defence forces of other countries in order to realize peace
and tranquility in that country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Zimbabwe was not only committed to the
principles of collective security in the region, but also
believed in the management of conflicts through peaceful means.

resolution of conflicts and crisis situations through preventive
diplomacy,''he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President to Be Subpoenaed to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge on Monday
granted a defendant's request to subpoena U.S. President Bill
Clinton to testify at the trial of James and Susan McDougal, his
former partners in a failed Arkansas land deal.
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to begin on March 4 in Little Rock,
Arkansas, according to wire services.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal is accused of receiving a loan that a former
Little Rock businessman and municipal judge, David Hale, says
Clinton pressured him to make. Clinton, who has not been charged,
has denied the accusation, and said he doesn't recall talking to
Hale about money.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals and Governor Jim Guy Tucker, who has other
business dealings with the McDougals, face trial on conspiracy and
fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. approved the subpoena on
behalf of both the McDougals, directing their lawyers to proceed
in a way that does not interfere with the president's official
duties.
</P>
<P>
If a personal appearance cannot be arranged, the judge said,
the McDougals' lawyers should consider either videotaped testimony
or an appearance by satellite.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the testimony of the president was relevant and
vital if the McDougals are to receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The subpoena was still being prepared Monday afternoon and is
expected to be submitted to the clerk of the court for signing
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals were the owners of the now-defunct Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loans before it failed in the late 1980s and
were partners with the Clintons in Whitewater, a real estate
development deal in northern Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Run out of Cash in December, Official Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Based on current
projections, the United Nations will run out of cash by the end of
the year, a senior U.N. official said today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, the head of the U.N.'s Department of
Administration and Management, told a U.N. committee that by
mid-1996 the world body's regular budget would reach a negative
cash position and then go into deep decline.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid dues from member-countries had continued to rise very
steeply and now totaled over 3.3 billion U.S. dollars, he said. As
of today, only 26 countries had paid their assessments in full and
16 had made partial payments.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations' chronic illness -- paying out more than it
takes in -- has now become acute," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
He said that after exhausting the Working Capital Fund and the
Special Fund, the U.N. was only kept afloat by borrowing
continually and extensively from peace-keeping operations to fund
the regular budget from early August till the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
By December 31 last year, the borrowings amounted to an
unprecedented 176 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that by the end of June 1996, the cash on hand
would total 627 million dollars, which would drop to 195 million
dollars by September and then minus 80 million dollars on 31
December.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the complete shutdown of the world organization,
Connor said it was necessary that wealthier countries pay all or
part of their 1996 dues earlier than usual.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates to Remain High in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The drop of interest rates in
the United States will not affect interest rates in Indonesia,
according to analysts in Indonesian Banks.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the interest rates drop in the US, the
analysts said at a recent workshop that the drop of a quarter of
one point is too small to affect Indonesian domestic rates.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that it will be difficult for banks to lower
rates while they still need a lot of funds to finance loans.
</P>
<P>
Marjanto Danoesapoetra, one of the analysts, said that the
strong demand for loans is the main reason why it is difficult for
the Indonesian banks to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said that another factor which could push up domestic
interest rates further is the continuous increase of demand for
credit.
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jonki Dresnadi said that the Central Bank's recent
decision to raise the reserve requirement of private banks to
three percent would make the monetary condition in Indonesia even
tighter and put further pressure on the upward trends of interest
rates on time deposits and other savings.

<HEADLINE> Deer Industry Earns More for New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's deer industry
exports topped 210 million dollars (138 million US dollars) for
the year to September 30, up nine percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive Richard Janes of the Game Industry Board was
quoted by a press report today as saying that strong farm gate
prices and profitability for the year represented a significant
turnaround after difficulties in the previous year, and set the
industry up for a more stable future.
</P>
<P>
Though venison exports to Europe rose only one percent to
14,781 tons, export value rose 24 percent to 151 million dollars
(100 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, European market prices had been at their
highs and lows for this decade, Janes said.
</P>
<P>
"That volatility is not what we want for this industry," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
European markets took 89 percent of the total volume and 82
percent of the total value of New Zealand's deer products.

<HEADLINE> Assassination Attempt on Arzu Condemned in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan Archbishop,
Prospero Penados del Barrio condemned the attempted assassination
of President Alvaro Arzu, saying it cast "a shadow over peace."
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from the capital of
Guatemala, the archbishop said that the attempt "does not lead to
anything positive and only casts a shadow over the peace created
by Pope John Paul II's visit."
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt occurred in Antigua, Guatemala, 45
kilometers west of the capital Sunday when a man tried to drive
his car into the horse the president and his wife were riding.
</P>
<P>
The couple was unharmed but an officer was wounded in the
assassination attempt. The assailant was shot to death instantly
by the presidential guards.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Group of Mutual Aid, an organization of
people who have missing relatives, said that the perpetrators of
the attack may be members of groups or sectors who are at war with
the government and feel displaced by the president's measures.
</P>
<P>
According to other reports, just one day after the foiled
attack, Pope John Paul II arrived on schedule in Guatemala City
for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has stepped up security for the papal visit after the
assassination attempt.

HANOI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Rare species of animals and
plants have been spotted in an isolated primeval forest which has
been discovered in the central highlands of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The forest, named Bi Dup-Nui Ba, is the habitat of the

<P>
The reports quoted forestry experts as saying that the
4,000-year-old forest covers 74,000 hectares of which 20,000
hectares are covered by broad-leafed trees and 24,000 hectares by
needle-leafed trees.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Business Community Calls for Poll  Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi business community
has called for immediate cancellation of the parliamentary
elections scheduled for February 15.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made Monday by business leaders at a meeting
with some opposition leaders from the Awami (people's) League
(AL), the largest opposition party in the country.
</P>
<P>
The business leaders exchanged views on the political situation
prevailing in the country with AL leaders and said that the one
party "farcical" election by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) and some small parties would deepen the political
crisis instead of solving it.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing election would not ensure a political stability
which is "so vital" for economic development, the president of the
Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the
apex trade body in the country, Salman F Rahman said, adding that
"we are convinced that the coming election will not produce the
much needed stability in the country."
</P>
<P>
"Businessmen will not be able to live in peace if the February
15 farcical elections are held without the participation of the
major opposition parties," AL President Sheikh Hasina also said
during the meeting, assuring that all political parties would
participate in the general election only if it is held under a
neutral caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Targets 18 Percent Export Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Council of Economic
Ministers have approved an 18.01 percent growth in exports in 1996
on last year's level.

billion baht (64 billion US dollars), while imports this year are
estimated to be worth 1,900 billion baht (76 billion dollars), up
19.95 percent on last year's figure, resulting in a 29.23 percent
increase in the deficit.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit this year is expected to stand at 300 billion
baht (12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In terms of export value, major export categories are
agricultural products, agro-industrial products, industrial
products, and fuel and minerals.
</P>
<P>

devices, electrical circuits, plastic products, videos, stereos,
and rubber products, are projected to grow 18.1 percent,
agricultural exports 3.83 percent, and agro-industries 6.88
percent.
</P>

ASEAN members this year would be worth 300 billion baht (12
billion dollars), up by 20 percent from last year's level.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Becomes World's Top Rubber Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has become the world's
biggest rubber producer, edging out Indonesia to second place,
according to the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produced 1.8 million tons of rubber last year, 100,000
tons more than the year before.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was followed by Indonesia with 1.4 million tons and
Malaysia with 1.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the biggest rubber buyer, consuming one
million tons annually, or 16 percent of Thailand's exports. Other
major consumers are China, Japan, India and Germany.
</P>
<P>
For 1996, Thailand's rubber production capacity will be raised
to two million tons, up 4 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a policy to encourage cultivation of cash crops,
which fetch better and more stable prices than rice for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand aims to increase rubber production by extending rubber
cultivation to the northeast, where labor is cheap and cultivation
conditions are suitable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshis Differ on Upcoming Elections (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- With less than ten days to go for
the upcoming national elections in Bangladesh, polemics on the
polls are going on among political parties and various walks of
life with even stronger smell of gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and three
mainstream opposition parties including the Awami (people's)
League, the Jatiya (national) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami are
the major rivals.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its government have got ready to hold the elections
on schedule, which is slated for February 15, "to maintain
constitutional continuity." 1467 candidates from the BNP and some
small parties contesting for 252 parliamentary seats are running
for office. 48 candidates all from the BNP have already been
elected unopposed.
</P>
<P>
The constitution provides that general elections must be held
within 90 days after the dissolution of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas dissolved the 5th parliament last
November 24 and the next general elections must be held before
February 23, the ruling party argued, adding that constitutional
rule and democracy would be jeopardized if the elections were not
held in due time.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition parties have boycotted the election process
from the very beginning, demanding for the resignation of Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to pave the way for holding the
elections under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Since the BNP decided to hold the election despite the
opposition boycott, the opposition parties have strengthened their
agitation movement against the alleged "one-party" or "farcical"
polls.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between the ruling BNP and the opposition has set
off a chain reaction from the entire society. people from various
walks of life have had to express their attitude towards the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
About 50 small parties, many of them are just in names, have
decided to join force with the BNP for the February 15 polls.
Sources disclosed that the parties including the 7-party alliance,
the Freedom Party, the National Democratic Alliance and the
Bangladesh Muslim League have been promised to gain some 50
parliamentary seats no matter they will win or not during the
elections.
</P>
<P>
While getting support from the left Democratic Front, the
Workers Party and some other smaller parties, the opposition are
launching "mass contact" movement to win more support from the
society.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Sheikh Hasina, president of the largest
opposition party -- the Awami League, on Sunday, leaders of
different professional groups including trade union leaders,
lawyers, writers, poets, dramatists and intellectuals called for a
united resistance against a BNP-held "farcical" poll and to
realize the demand for elections under a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that pre-election violence in local districts
and university campus has been a visible feature of the recent
government-opposition conflict. Hundreds of people have been
injured and many vehicles damaged during the violent clashes in
recent days in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the government-opposition conflict is spreading like
wildfire, the common people seem to be unconcerned about who is
right and who is wrong.
</P>
<P>
The business community are particularly worried about the
political situation for the sake of their economic interests. "We
had earlier decided not to take any political stand because we did
not want to politicize our issues, but the situation has compelled
us to take a political stand to protect business interests," said
Salman F. Rahman, president of the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the opposition announced a fresh agitation program
including 48-hour nationwide general strike on February 14-15 and
a nationwide dawn to dusk rail, road and waterways blockade on
February 13.
</P>
<P>
If the situation runs out of control, the military may probably
</P>
<P>
interfere in politics, observers here guessed.
</P>
<P>
But up to now the military has kept silent about the politics
although armed forces have been joining the other law-enforcing
agencies to recover illegal arms at the request of the Election
Commission.

WASHINGTON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Former American football
star O.J. Simpson took his defense in a television interview in
Los Angeles on Monday to convince the public of his innocence
months after he was acquitted by a jury of killing his ex-wife and
her friend Ron Goldman.
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that it takes the resources that I had to spend
on this case to prove my innocence ... It shouldn't take this
amount of money to prove someone's innocence," he told CNN in an
unscheduled interview.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have spent nearly four million dollars on the
defence.
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I agree with (Ron's father) Fred Goldman on, is
that these people were butchered," Simpson said, his voice
cracking with emotion.
</P>
<P>
Like his attorneys during his criminal trial, Simpson alleged
that the killings occurred because of his ex-wife's involvement
with her best friend Faye Resnick was involved in drugs.

<HEADLINE> Urban Environmental Deterioration Curbed in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Environmental deterioration in
the cities of northeast China's Liaoning Province, one of China's
main bases of heavy industry, has been brought under control
thanks to efforts by all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province has become one of the most polluted areas in
China simply because of the concentration of the metallurgical,
machinery, petrochemicals and energy industries.
</P>
<P>
The leading officials of the province have pointed out
that priority should be given to environmental protection,
especially to the handling of major pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 Liaoning has poured 2.1 billion yuan (about 250
million US dollars) into more than 5,100 environmental protection
projects and managed to integrate the work of environmental
protection with the readjustment of old industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has also reinforced its protection of water by
investing 380 million yuan to deal with major pollutants: Some 80
projects have been completed to treat 77 million tons of sewage
annually, and another 16 projects have been set up which have an
annual capacity of saving 36 million tons of water.
</P>
<P>
The dust fallout and discharge volume of industrial waste water
have declined considerably in the province's cities since 1980,
while the provincial gross industrial output value has jumped by
183 percent and the volume of fuel coal has increased by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
To date, the industrial waste gas treatment rate in the
province has reached 77.5 percent and 78 percent of its disposed
industrial waste water has been up to the country's relevant
standards.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Prepares for Presidential Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Less than 72 hours
before Haiti's first democratic transfer of power, outgoing
President Jean Bertrand Aristide is getting the National Palace in
shape for its new occupant, President-elect Rene Preval who will
be sworn in on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Workers took advantage of the weekend to polish marble, wax
floors and white-wash the walls of the Haiti's government house.
</P>
<P>
This morning, school children rehearsed their performance for
the investiture ceremony in the National Palace gardens.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all public buildings have been given a new coat of paint
and their balconies and windows have been festooned in red and
blue, the colors of the national flag.
</P>
<P>
About 600 people are waiting in front of the city hall to be
hired as street cleaners to clear the capital of
garbage. Steamrollers and bulldozers have been filling the
potholes that pockmark every street in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
Aristide, elected president after the fall of dictator Jean
Claude Duvalier, was ousted in a military coup in September 1991
and restored to power by U.S. troops in October 1994. He was
banned by Haiti's Constitution from seeking re-election in last
December's presidential poll, which was won by his ally Preval.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has been receiving numerous official
delegations and special guests who have arrived here to show
solidarity with Haiti's young democracy.
</P>
<P>
But for many Haitians who are more concerned with scratching a
living, the first transition from one democratically elected
president to another already seems to be taken for granted as a
well-entrenched part of national life.

LONDON, February 5 (Xinhua) -- English soccer's governing body
the Football Association on Monday accused some hotels for this

<P>
FA's Director of Public Affairs David Davies said one center
hotel has charged 160 pounds (about 240 U.S. dollars) without
breakfast a night.

However, Davies said their normal fee was only 40 pounds
(around 60 U.S. dollars) a night for bed and breakfast on a
Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
That represents a 400% increase.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the fans would be unable to afford to stay and this
would also be harmful to host country's economy.
</P>

Davies said the soccer meeting reflects the credit on this
country and appealed to the hotels to rethink what they are
doing.

banana-producing countries in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said in a press release today that the
16-member EU "never obeyed the decisions of those panels."
</P>
<P>
Since last September, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and the
United States, later joined by Ecuador, have been appealing to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), a successor to GATT, to mediate in
their efforts to end Europe's import barriers.
</P>

Mexican officials said that as a WTO member, Mexico is entitled
to request its access to the European banana markets without
having to resort to the formation of a special panel within the
WTO to solve the trade dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANYA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- China has started the
construction of a Buddhist culture zone on its southern island
province of Hainan, sources at the local government said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The zone is being built at the foot of Mount Nanshan, a dozen
miles from this southernmost city of China.
</P>
<P>
The zone is expected to attract Buddhists from all over
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
With a floor space of 166 ha, containing temples, caves and a
Buddhist college, the zone will involve an investment of 870
million yuan (about 108 million US dollars), mainly from a Hong
Kong consortium.
</P>
<P>
The new attraction will feature a 93-m-tall bronze statue of
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the construction will be completed before
1998, according to an official.
</P>
<P>
This is the second Buddhist cultural zone being built in the
country. The first is a Buddhist town in east China's Nanjing
city.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now is becoming a tourist attraction, some people
calling it "China's Hawaii".
</P>
<P>
There are air connections between Sanya and most Southeast
Asian destinations.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 years ago, a prominent Chinese monk arrived at
Sanya on a pilgrimage. A Tang Dynasty (618-907) emperor built a
temple at the foot of Mount Nanshan to commemorate him.

BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Some cars and buses will be
banned from the roads every other day as of February 12 to ease
the increasing traffic jams in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to a local decree released Monday, except on
holidays, jeeps, light buses, mini-buses and sedan cars bearing
licence plates ending with an odd number may drive only on
odd-numbered days in areas within the Third Ring Road from 7 am to
8 pm.
</P>
<P>
And those bearing licence plates ending with an even number
will be allowed to travel in such areas only on even-numbered days.
</P>
<P>
Police and army vehicles, taxis, commuter buses and licensed
mini-buses will not be affected.
</P>
<P>
All freight trucks are prohibited from driving within the
Second Ring Road from 7 am to 8 pm, and vehicles with a load
capacity over two tons will not be allowed between the Second and
Third Ring Roads during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the number of vehicles in the capital has been
increasing rapidly. Some 150,000 more were registered last year,
bringing to 980,000 the total number of vehicles in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the average speed of vehicles on the Second and
Third Ring Roads slowed to 33 kph in 1995 from 45 kph in 1994, as
freight trucks often hold up other vehicles because of their low
speed and frequent breakdowns.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River Dolphin, a
rare dolphin lives only in China and only in the Yangtze River,
are in great need of protection, Chinese experts said.
</P>
<P>
The experts warned that the species, only fewer than 100
creatures left right now, will be extincted within 25 five years
if actions are not taken now, since they are facing problems
reproducing as their natural living habitat becomes harsher and
harsher, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Just one month after a female river dolphin was captured and
taken to a sanctuary in Shishou, Hebei Province, another female
was seen floating on the lower reaches of the river in Jiangsu
Province, dying, which was the largest ever discovered, it said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhou Kaiya from Nanjing Normal University in Jiangsu
Province said it had been electrocuted, probably unintentionally,
by a fisherman. The Fishery Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture
is seeking public support and financial assistance in the fight to
save the species. The experts are calling for action on a scale
with campaigns to save the country's giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will hold a seminar next week to discuss adapting
and strengthening river dolphin protection policies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when the river dolphins numbered 300, one nature
and two semi-nature protection areas have been designated along
the Yangtze River. But these efforts have not stopped the sharp
decrease of the rare species in numbers.

<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The true worth of the 7.112
billion US dollars-worth of overseas assets investment reported
to China's assets appraisers in the 1991-1995 period was only
valued at 6.062 billion US dollars, meaning that some 1.05 billion
US dollars were in the form of "fake assets".
</P>
<P>
Since China started the appraisal of overseas-invested assets
in 1991, goods inspection authorities across the country have
valued 165,000 overseas-invested assets, said Guo Xiao'en, a
director with the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities (SAIIEC), adding that the average
devaluation rate was 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that cases involving overseas investors who have
made gains by falsely reporting the value of their assets
investment have cropped up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To halt the irregular practices by overseas investors, the
SAIIEC has demanded that its offices across the country fully
implement state rules concerning the valuation of
overseas-invested assets, and the examination and licensing system
for valuers, and to extend the scope of appraisal.

LAGOS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said on Monday that it
would protest against the ban imposed by the Confederation of
African Football (CAF) for its withdrawal from the African
Nations' Cup in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The ban from the CAF was very unfair and we will put up a
very strong protest against it," Sports minister Jim Nowbodo told
a news conference in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
"Our withdrawal from the recently-ended African Cup of Nations
was based on very solid reasons of insecurity in South Africa," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Nowbodo said that they had documents to prove that South
Africans would put up a very hostile attitude towards Nigeria
before the tournament and it would have been unwise to attend the
event and harm the lives of the Nigerian team.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, winners of the Nations' Cup in 1994, was suspended
from the 1998 and 2000 Cups and fined 15,000 U.S. dollars for
pulling out of the biennial 16-nation tournament.
</P>
<P>
Viken Djizmedjian, a spokesman for the CAF said the suspension
would remain in force after the 1998 and 2000 tournaments if
Nigeria did not pay the fine and damages costs.

FIFA might also impose sanctions on Nigeria after CAF submits a

BUDAPEST, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Registered jobless people in
Hungary increased by 21,000 to more than 517,000 last month,
taking the unemployment rate to 11.3 percent from 10.4 in December.
</P>
<P>
The north-eastern county of Szabolcs-Szatmar had the highest
jobless rate of 20.9 percent and the capital had the lowest rate
of 5.9 percent, according to figures released by the National
Labor Center today.
</P>
<P>
School graduates aged between 15 and 19 made up one-third of
the registered unemployed, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The center predicted no quick improvement in youth employment
because of a possible reduction of 280,000 to 350,000 jobs across
the country in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years Hungary has lost 1.5 million job
opportunities as a result of the difficult transition from the
planned economy to a market-oriented one.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe the number of registered jobless does
not give the whole picture of overall unemployment.
</P>
<P>
They estimate that, apart from retirees, at least 500,000
people who are able to work but have no job are not registered
with the government.

UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) - The cash-strapped United

</P>
<P>
The decision was made known by The Journal of the United
Nations which also read: "Beginning this week, only documents
containing draft proposals which require action will be circulated
in the rooms."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. publication requested delegates to bring to meetings
their pre-session or reference documents which were provided at
permanent and observer meetings.
</P>
<P>
The modification of the long-established U.N. practices is
expected to save another 250,000 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, however, will have to consider other
money-saving expedients as the world body was faced with a debt of

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Restrict Ports of Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province adjacent
to Hong Kong and Macao is to curb the construction of new ports of
entry in a bid to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
This economic powerhouse in south China now boasts 51 Category
One ports of entry open to overseas travellers and vessels and 159
Category Two outlets serving foreign trade, which account for 22
and 45 percent of the country's total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The mere pursuit of quantity in some localities in the province
has caused low efficiency in the use of these outlets, incurring
2.4 billion yuan (about 289.1 million US dollars) in debts for the
province.
</P>
<P>
In move to address the situation, the provincial government has
decided to make better use of major ports of entry, mainly on the
coast and in the Pearl River Delta while closing or merging some
low-efficiency small facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province will make great efforts for technical
transformation of some old outlets while curbing the construction
of new ones.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Estimates 10% Personnel Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The head of U.N.
Administration and Management said on Monday that with a zero
growth budget for the U.N. 1996-1997 biennium, he would estimate
that personnel will drop by 10 percent over the level of
1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
Joseph E. Connor complained to a high-level open-ended working
group on the financial situation of the United Nations that
the program budget appropriated for 1996-1997 biennium contained a
significant commitment to do more with less.
</P>
<P>
"All of the mandates you have asked to be done have been
provided for without an increase in cost," he said.
</P>
<P>
As shown in a charter he presented to the working group, for
the 1994-1995 biennium, the General Assembly authorized regular
budget posts totalling 10,115 and an appropriation level of 2.6
billion U.S. dollars,
</P>
<P>
Adjusted for inflation and for the added dollar costs of
payrolls and other expenditures made in currencies that have
appreciated against the dollar, the level of appropriation in
1996-1997 would have grown by 267 million U.S. dollars, about 10
percent more than in 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
Connor said the United Nations has to offset the increased
amount of money by cost reduction through efficiency gains.
</P>
<P>
"The result: 250 million U.S. dollars in real savings produce a
zero growth budget. I would estimate that personnel will drop by
10 percent over the level of 1994-1995," he said.
</P>
<P>
That means at least 1,000 U.N. staff will lose jobs in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Garment Industry Looking For Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 6 (Xinhua) -- More Chinese garment
manufacturers have joined the trend in hiring foreign experts to
help manage their business, to improve technology, and to expand
their market share through competition.
</P>
<P>
One of China's biggest western-style suit producers, the Firs
Group, hired Irie Koichi, a famous Japanese suit designer, this
year. According to the contract, the Japanese expert will not
only provide the group with his latest designs, but also help it
open shops in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yonggang, chairman of the board of the group, said that
he previously hired two Hong Kong experts who had worked as
technological director of the US Texwood Corporation and the
Montageut Group of France. This year he will ask three Italian
technicians join in the group.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's Hongdou Group, the largest garment manufacturer in
the province, also hired a Japanese suit designer, Kato, and a
shirt expert from Taiwan, and put out a call for a president this
year from at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Caiqing, vice-general manager of China National Garment
Corporation, said that the trend in hiring overseas professionals,
which started in China at the beginning of the 1990s, now is
widely regarded to be an important development strategy for big
garment manufacturers here. Statistics put the number of foreign
experts in senior or mid-level positions at between 200 and 300.
</P>
<P>
"The import of talent will give a new push to the growing
garment industry," Sheng commented.
</P>
<P>
The Nantong Haimeng Corporation hired two Japanese experts as
deputy general managers and had comprehensive technical
improvements in a short period of time, and now has an annual
production capacity of 24 million meters of lining cloth,
accounting for 40 percent of China's garment accessory supplies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts have also appeared in the workshops of the
Sanyou Women's Garment Group of Jiangsu, Youngor of Zhejiang, and
Jinda of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that there will be more overseas fashion experts
hired to work in China's during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), because the country will launch a "Garment Brand-Name
Project" to encourage the industry to improve quality and create
more brands.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Economy Up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Romania's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 6.9 percent in 1995 over the previous year
though the country was still faced with an annual inflation rate
of 32.3 percent and an unemployment rate of 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figures were announced at a press conference today by
Alexandru Radocea, secretary of state and chairman of the
national statistics committee.
</P>
<P>
The primary and secondary industries accounted for 59 percent
of the 1995 GDP while the tertiary industry made up 38 percent of
the total, Radocea added.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth posted a five-year high of 9.4 percent in the
past year as industrial productivity increased by 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Radocea also reported an increase in the sector of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19.9 million tons of grain was produced last year
and the harvest not only met domestic need but afforded export as
well.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade increased 22.2 percent to 7.5 billion
U.S. dollars. But there was a trade deficit of 1.16 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the encouraging figures, the government still has to
contain inflation and to create jobs for nearly one million
jobless.

<HEADLINE> UN Officials Expect Fruitful Habitat II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 5 (Xinhua) -- The Second United
Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) would pioneer
ground breaking rules changes, which could set a new pattern in
the ways that the international community did business, the U.N.
Chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the third and final session of the
Conference Preparatory Committee, Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali said that the draft commitments before the committee
demonstrated the seriousness with which the international
community considered the upcoming "city summit" in Istanbul from
June 3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
"The one crucial step yet to be taken was to arrive at a
consensus for the Habitat agenda, the Global Plan of Action. That
would be the Conference's legacy for the future -- a legacy of
sustainable human, social, economic and environmental
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wally N' Dow, secretary-general of the conference, said that
with some 150 countries participating in the preparatory process,
the conference would affect nothing less than the major issues of
the world today -- jobs, housing, security, services, the quality
of the living environment, and the right of ordinary people to
have a say in the decisions affecting their lives.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory Committee Chairman Martti Lujanen said that many
present development trends were damaging urban environments: more
than 1 billion persons were inadequately housed while fresh water
was diminishing, air pollution and traffic congestion were
increasing.
</P>
<P>
Chinese representative and Vice-Minister of Construction Li
Zhendong said at today's meeting that the Chinese government hoped
that all sides would show their sincere wish and prepare a habitat
agenda which would take into consideration the interest of
developing countries and be accepted by all parties.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soldiers Replace French Troops in Grbavica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Troops from the Italian
brigade of the Implementation Force (IFOR) today took command over
from French troops in Grbavica, a frontline Serb district in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency said 300 Italian troops were deployed along
the former lines of separation on two bridges linking Serb
Grbavica and the Muslim-held center of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Grbavica is one of the five Serb Sarajevo districts to be
transferred to Muslim-led government control on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Italian brigade commander General Augustin Pedone said
following a meeting with officials of the Serb municipality of
Novo Sarajevo that IFOR troops will organize humanitarian
activities for the Grbavica population and provide health care for
the sick and wounded in an Italian military hospital.
</P>
<P>
However, the opening of border crossings on the bridges will
depend on higher IFOR command, General Pedone said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a possible mass exodus, the IFOR commanders and
chief envoy for civilian affairs in Bosnia Carl Bildt have
persuaded the Muslim government to allow Serb police to stay in
the five Serb Sarajevo districts until March 19. They have also
promised to increase the presence of IFOR troops in these areas to
secure the safety of the local population.

<HEADLINE> Serbs to Return to Mrkonjic Grad in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 5 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Mrkonjic Grad Dragan
Celic said today after inspecting the town that the Serbs could
possibly return to their ruined homes only in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
"The water supply network, the power network and the entire
infrastructure in the town as well as houses have been destroyed,"
Celic said in Mrkonjic Grad, a mountainous town 120 km west of
Sarajevo, ruling out any possibility of an earlier return.
</P>
<P>
The situation was made worse by unknown numbers of mines and other
explosive devices left in the town, Tanjug news agency quoted the
mayor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reconstruction of Mrkonjic Grad, which had been under Croatian
occupation between last October and February 4, will be impossible
without extensive international aid.
</P>
<P>
"Such aid is needed especially for its formerly very well developed
industry, whose installations have been looted by Croatian army," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand former inhabitants of Mrkonjic Grad, Sipovo and
several villages in Kljuc, Jajce and other districts in western Bosnia
visited their homes on Sunday in a convoy of buses and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Mrkonjic Grad was occupied on October 12, 1995, by the regular
army of neighboring Croatia and Bosnian Croat forces, whose troops
subsequently remained in the town before it was tansfered to the
Serbs under the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
When Serb representatives entered the town, they confirmed earlier
reports that looting and burning of Serb property by Croatians in
Mrkonjic Grad and Sipovo were extremely extensive.

<HEADLINE> African Bank's New Loans Affected by US Budget Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- African Development Bank's
(ADB) president complained today that the U.S. budget impasse is
holding up the revival of loans to some of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
Although the ADB has shed almost 20 percent of its staff and
introduced a new organizational structure, a revival of its
African Development Fund (adf) soft loans arm targeted at the
bank's poorest members is held up by the budget impasse in the
bank's biggest non-African shareholder, the U. S., President Omar
Kabbaj said.
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed the key problem in the reconstitution of the
adf," a report quoted Kabbaj as telling reporters in Abidjan of
Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The adf is the only source of bank credit for 39 of the
institution's 53 African members.
</P>
<P>
The United States leads the bank's 24 non-regional
shareholders with 5.8 percent of voting shares, followed by Japan
with 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is still locked in a standoff over
budget proposals with the Republican-dominated congress, four
months into the 1996 financial year. The World Bank's soft loans
arm, the International Development Association, is also without
new cash because of the U.S. funding impasse.
</P>

Kabbaj, a newly-elected Moroccan, said donor confidence in the
ADB has returned because of reforms undertaken since he became
president last September.
</P>
<P>
The fund, which used to lend more than 1 billion US dollars a
year on easy terms, has not been replenished since January 1994.
It was held up first by a row over credit policy, then by delays
in the election of a new bank president.
</P>
<P>
Bank sources say this replenishment is likely to be worth 2 to
2.5 billion dollars over three years, compared with 3.42 billion
pledged for 1991 to 1993.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Left Parties Oppose Government Formation With Welfare Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Two left-wing parties in Turkish
parliament reiterated today their opposition against any
government formation with the participation of the Islamist
Welfare Party (RP).
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Republican People's Party (CHP) and
Democratic Left Party (DSP) received Mesut Yilmaz, Chairman of
the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP), who was assigned to
form a coalition government following the failed efforts by True
Path Party (DYP) chairwoman and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller and RP leader Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
They told Mesut Yilmaz that their parties would not join an
ANAP-RP coalition or support it from outside.
</P>
<P>
"We are not for any model that includes the RP and it is out of
question for us to lend direct or indirect support to such a
coalition. We have said this openly to Yilmaz," CHP leader Deniz
Baykal told reporters here after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
DSP leader Bulent Ecevit, who met with Yilmaz later also
called on the two center-right parties, ANAP and DYP to overcome
their differences and set up a government "for the good of the
country."
</P>
<P>
No political party gained a necessary majority in the December
24 general election to form a government on its own. The two
center-right parties have so far failed to set up a coalition
which is widely supported by the public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who see each other as political rival, has
refused to make any compromise over who would be, or first be the
new Prime Minister if a rotating premiership is concerned.
