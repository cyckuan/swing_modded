<HEADLINE> Harriet Tubman could get her own state holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When Harriet Tubman conducted more than 300 slaves
to New York and other northern states in the 1850s, they often traveled in small
groups under cover of night, from one dark, damp, basement hiding place to
another.
<P>
	   Her efforts have since become public and celebrated, and New York
legislators want to further promote this famous conductor of the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of the majority parties in the state Assembly and Senate are
sponsoring legislation to make March 10, the anniversary of Tubman's death in
1913, a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "For too long, Harriet Tubman's accomplishments have been in the background
of New York state history," Republican state Sen. Michael Nozzolio said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio represents parts of the Finger Lakes region where Tubman moved in
the 1850s. Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Buffalo Democrat who is deputy speaker of
the Assembly, is sponsoring the bill in his house with 30 cosponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure would make Harriet Tubman day the 13th official state holiday
and the most recent since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created.
</P>
<P>
	   Eve and Nozzolio are also sponsoring a resolution that calls upon Gov.
George Pataki to declare March 10 Harriet Tubman Day in New York. That
resolution would not have the force of making the day an official annual
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has attempted lately to highlight its connection with the
Underground Railroad, naming a New York Freedom Trail Commission and including
more details on the Underground Railroad in school curricula.
</P>
<P>
	   Slaves either stayed temporarily or settled in New York and other northern
states as the route ferried them in basements and other secretive locations from
the South in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
	   Tubman was born into slavery around 1820 on a Maryland plantation. She
escaped in 1849 to Philadelphia, where she learned of the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While living in Canada, she met William Seward, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of
State, and former governor of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Seward provided Tubman a home in 1857, which she later purchased, to serve
as a headquarters for her railroad work.
</P>
<P>
	   She was one of the most influential "conductors" of the railroad, traveling
south 19 times to free slaves.
</P>
<P>
	   Tubman was also known for inciting a riot at the spot in Troy where an
escaped slave was recaptured. The riot has been called one of the fiercest in
the antislavery movement.
</P>
<P>
	   No other state has a Harriet Tubman Day, Eve's office said. However, the
lawmaker said other states have followed New York in passing Underground
Railroad measures, and he hopes the same will happen with Harriet Tubman Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Eve added that the Underground Railroad was significant to whites, blacks,
and Native Americans, because members of each group participated in the pathway.
He said the legislation would be an effort to recognize that union.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will help bind us closer to one another," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's office would not immediately comment on the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Health commissioner questions timing of expanded drug program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An expansion of the state's program to help senior
citizens pay for prescription drugs is a good idea whose time may not have yet
come, Gov. George Pataki's health commissioner says.
<P>
	   Dr. Antonia Novello said Monday she has a quarter-century experience with
the federal government and thinks the state could end up being penalized if it
boldly develops its own expanded drug program at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that President Clinton has called for a $195 billion program for
Medicare prescription benefits over the next decade. It might make sense, she
told a joint state Assembly-Senate hearing Monday on the 2000-01 state budget,
to get an idea of what Washington has in mind before New York acts.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York should wait to see what the feds do first before we act, because
our experience shows that when we have moved forward with a program which is
then followed by a federal program, our state has been penalized," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   If history is any guide, Washington will adopt on a national scale much of
what New York has been doing for 12 years with its "extremely wonderful"
prescription program, Novello said. New York shouldn't struggle to set up its
own expanded version of a prescription program, only to then take potentially
costly steps to conform the state program with the national one, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Knowing the feds, it's best to let them put it first," Novello said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Novello spokesman, John Signor, said later the commissioner also told
lawmakers that if the Legislature and governor go ahead with a more ambitious
state drug plan, her department would try to work with Washington to minimize
the changes that would be necessary if a federal program follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Novello spent a quarter century in Washington with the U.S. Public Health
Service and as U.S. surgeon general before joining the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's proposed budget calls for funding the state's pharmaceuticals
program - Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage or "EPIC" - to increase by
about $30 million to $148 million in fiscal 2000-01. Enrollment would also rise
from the current 112,000 to 122,500 by March 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's budget proposal anticipates that more people will enroll in the
EPIC program, not that eligibility requirements would be expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Senate, meanwhile, has proposed expanding the income limits on
EPIC to double the eligibility pool to 229,900 senior citizens statewide. Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said the state should spend $125 million out of its
share of the settlement with the tobacco companies to help pay for the expanded
program.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Nassau County Republican who chairs the Senate
health committee, suggested at the budget hearing Monday that the Legislature
could enact its own EPIC expansion and then tailor it to whatever Washington
adopts.
</P>
<P>
	   John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, also indicated that the Senate was not
inclined to delay expanding the prescription program.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe very strongly that providing seniors with immediate relief is
critical and we will not wait for any lame duck president to act," McArdle said.
"We are going to act and we are going to make it our chief and primary budget
initiative."
</P>
<P>
	   Currently under EPIC, New Yorkers age 65 and older who make $18,500 a year
as an individual or $24,400 a year as a couple, are eligible for
state-subsidized cuts in prescription drug costs.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 3, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Igor Larionov, Pat Verbeek and Brendan Shanahan scored
during first-period power plays, and the Detroit Red Wings won their third
straight, beating the Phoenix Coyotes 3-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Wregget, spotted an early lead, stayed focused and stopped 28 shots to
extend his unbeaten streak to six games (5-0-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Adams scored during a Phoenix advantage in the second period, but
otherwise the Coyotes had difficulty getting past neutral ice after Detroit
turned defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes won the first three games in the series, but the idea of a
season sweep was dashed early by the Wings' speed and strength on special teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Lapointe had two assists, and Shanahan had one.
</P>
<P>
	   Larionov scored on Detroit's second shot and Verbeek on the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wings are 17-0-4 when Verbeek scores, and when Shanahan made it 3-0 with
his 30th goal with 5:13 remaining in the first period, the suspense went out of
the contest.
</P>
<P>
	   The outburst came within one of Detroit's franchise record of power-play
goals in a period, set against the New York Rangers on Nov. 5, 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix goalie Sean Burke had 18 saves, but only four in the first period,
when the game was decided. Bob Essensa replaced him in goal for 47 seconds in
the second period and stopped the only shot he faced.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes stopped Detroit's fourth and last power play, but their bad luck
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Radoslav Suchy beat Wregget 7:21 into the second, but the whistle had
already blown to assess a penalty on Rick Tocchet, and the goal was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes had a 5-on-3 advantage for 41 seconds in the second period,
because Steve Yzerman delayed the game by sprawling on the puck during Phoenix's
original power play.
</P>
<P>
	   As it was ending, Shane Doan took a shot, Jeremy Roenick retrieved the
rebound and sent a cross-ice pass to Adams, who scored into the near side of the
net with 2:20 left, cutting the deficit to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   It took just 16 seconds of the first Red Wings power play for Larionov to
score, just 1:33 in. Shanahan took a shot from the slot, and Larionov poked the
rebound past Burke's stick side.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet was called for boarding minutes later, and Verbeek scored at 6:03.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, Bruno exchange Valentine's wishes, for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LATHAM, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno are over their Republican spat - not that either acknowledged one
in the first place.
<P>
	   Pataki spoke Monday of Bruno's significant role and accomplishments during
the governor's two terms. Asked if he wants Bruno to continue to lead the
Senate's Republican majority, Pataki said: "It's not my decision, but I like
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno wouldn't be outdone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Valentine's Day is a day of love and togetherness," said Bruno at a ribbon
cutting for a plant at the Plug Power plant near Albany that develops fuel cells
with chemical reactions to power homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this doesn't represent love and togetherness I don't know what does,"
Bruno said. "And what happens when people work together? Things like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he is "proud to have partnered with our great governor, George
Pataki." Then Bruno noted several other "partners," including Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republicans worried the Pataki-Bruno feud would detract from a unified
Republican front with the suddenly contentious New York presidential primary
less than a month away, sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state GOP leadership's choice, Pataki friend George W. Bush, is fighting
to regain momentum nationally and in New York state after losing to Arizona Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire's primary in January.
</P>
<P>
	   And last week, Rep. Rick Lazio - drawing parallels with McCain - said he is
seriously considering the state Conservative Party's invitation to enter the
U.S. Senate race, but only if he also had the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday repeated his strong support for New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Since late January, Pataki and Bruno, of Rensselaer County, have been
fighting over whether the state should pick up the counties' share of a new
health insurance program, plus other policy issues and perceived or actual
slights.
</P>
<P>
	   Most dramatically, those slights included the firing of at least three
Bruno-sponsored state workers in the Pataki administration in an action widely
interpreted by Bruno's members as a show of gubernatorial displeasure in Senate
Republicans. GOP senators also said the governor contacted them directly to ask
about Senate politics, instead of going through Bruno.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday would not acknowledge any connection between a spat with
Bruno and the dismissals within his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "This administration has made thousands of changes over the course of the
last five years and we're going to make thousands more," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   What aides described as a heated meeting last week between Pataki and Bruno
appeared to have helped clear the air somewhat, and staffers for both men
resumed arranging joint public appearances for the pair late last week. Monday
was the first such event. Neither camp on Monday would directly talk about the
reason for the rift.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno and Pataki are state government's most powerful Republicans, and their
spat came at an important time governmentally, as well as politically.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the time of year when Pataki and Bruno try to reconcile their state
budget agendas for the next fiscal year in hopes of being allied in negotiations
against the Democratic state Assembly, though in current years that has not
always happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hoping that all the differences of opinion or political bumps in the
road are over so we can pass a budget on time, with substance," said Democratic
Assemblyman Paul Tonko of Amsterdam at Monday's event.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani steps up campaign pace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Stepping up his campaign pace in the face of
complaints from some Republican leaders, Rudolph Giuliani is blasting his Senate
rival's husband, President Clinton.
<P>
	   "A president who is so famous for feeling our pain, somehow doesn't feel the
pain of New Yorkers," Giuliani told a news conference Monday after meeting
privately with state GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fourth political stop in five days outside New York City, the mayor
replayed his Saturday criticism of the president's unwillingness to dip into the
nation's strategic oil reserves in the face of sharply rising fuel oil costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, if he's not going to feel our pain, maybe if we create enough
political pain, he'll finally act," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton are competing for the Senate seat being
vacated this year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, New York Gov. George Pataki sought to knock down speculation
that he was somehow looking to hurt Giuliani's chances by encouraging U.S. Rep.
Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, to renew his interest in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio, with encouragement from state Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long, a Pataki ally, has said he is again weighing an entry into the race for
the GOP and Conservative parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining he wants Lazio to remain on the sidelines, Pataki said Monday
that he would "like to see all Republicans get behind Mayor Giuliani. I think
that's the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has been very supportive," Giuliani said at his news
conference that did not include the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, and under pressure from national party leaders, Pataki convinced
Lazio to put his Senate race plans on hold in favor of Giuliani. But since
then,Longhas become increasingly vocal with complaints that Giuliani, who
supports abortion and gay rights, is not conservative enough for Conservatives.
Long has said he is looking for an alternative candidate. Pataki and the mayor
have had an icy relationship in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   No Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without having
both the GOP and Conservative ballot lines. Unlike other states, New York allows
votes on third-party lines to count for major party candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's visit to Albany on Monday came in the wake of criticism from some
Republican leaders that he was not paying enough attention to upstate New York,
a critical battleground in his race with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's been all over," one upstate GOP leader, speaking on condition of
anonymity, grumbled after Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   After formally announcing her candidacy on Feb. 6, Clinton set off on a
four-day swing across upstate New York that took her from Buffalo to Albany.
Giuliani held political events in Buffalo on Thursday, suburban Westchester
County on Friday and on Long Island on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, the mayor said he wasn't intentionally stepping up his political
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the best that we can, given the fact that I have
responsibilities as the mayor of New York City," Giuliani said before hurrying
back to the city to perform a Valentine's Day wedding.
</P>
<P>
	   The heating oil issue seemed tailor-made for Giuliani given that the highest
price hikes have come in New York state and the Northeast since the OPEC nations
cut production. Thus far, despite pressure from a bipartisan group that includes
Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, President Clinton has refused to dip
into the oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Hillary Clinton said she favored dipping into the reserves with a
swap system under which U.S. oil companies would be able to borrow from the
stockpile and make larger donations back to it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Clinton administration's Energy
Department, said Monday that "the administration is not actively considering
using the strategic petroleum reserves in the current context."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the administration has been providing extra money to the poor to
help pay their heating oil bills and is trying to help heating oil distributors
with possible cash-flow problems. She said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
would be meeting Wednesday in Boston with officials from the heating oil
industry and others to discuss the problem.

<HEADLINE> Ski Gondolas: Public Transportion?  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT WELLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Gondolas are becoming the rage for Colorado ski resorts, but
not to drop skiers and boarders on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park is the latest to propose a gondola as public transportation.
Crested Butte also is considering one as a way to get people to the mountain
without their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   It has long been a dream of Aspen to link some of its mountains with a
European-style gondola system. Breckenridge has talked of a gondola from the
town to Peak 8. The town of Avon has considered a gondola to Beaver Creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A gondola built by Telluride in 1996 is being used by more than 1.65 million
riders a year. It connects the town and the Mountain Village, allowing people to
travel back and forth to buy groceries, eat, drink or get to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fabulous. Everybody loves it. Everybody uses it. It is faster than
driving, and the views are beautiful and relaxing," said Telluride Town Manager
Peggy Curran. She said air pollution in the valley is down significantly as a
result of the use of the gondola, road paving projects and limits on wood
burning.
</P>
<P>
	   Dust from roads and wood smoke are the main pollutants in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Gondolas are not cheap. Telluride's cost $16 million, and in both Winter
Park and Crested Butte they could cost as much as $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Callaway, whose family is a co-owner of Crested Butte, said Gunnison
County has signed an agreement with a consultant to study the concept of a
gondola between Crested Butte and Mount Crested Butte.
</P>
<P>
	   Callaway said the ski area and the two towns, separated by a narrow,
winding, three-mile road and 500 feet of elevation, would be equal partners in
financing the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "Warp speed on this is probably five to seven years," cautioned Winter Park
Mayor Nick Teverbaugh. "I'm sure we will be involved in the financing. There is
no way Winter Park by itself can finance that type of a capital improvement."
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park spokeswoman Joan Christensen said $20 million would be the
resort's entire capital budget for four or five years.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the gondola is an exciting idea that would help Winter Park
stay competitive. "It's also important because as more people keep coming we
don't want to have an air pollution problem."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the reasons Telluride built the gondola was to curb the pollution
mountain towns often experience in the winter when temperature inversions trap
air in valleys.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park also is hoping construction of a new base village with 230
housing units will make the hill itself a major destination area. "When the
gondola goes in people will be able to go back and forth to the town without the
hassle of parking," Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People love to ride skyrides. There is a reason amusement parks put them
in," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The resort this month completed the purchase of land necessary for the
three-mile-long gondola. It likely would be a 15- to 20-minute ride.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would help with air pollution and traffic, as well as making our town
more available to day skiers," Christensen said.

<HEADLINE> State attorney takes last swipe at inflated appraisal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal government appraiser's calculations of
damages in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim are riddled with self-serving
mistakes, questionable methods and arbitrary data, says a state attorney.
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General David Roberts spent nearly four hours Monday
assailing the testimony of Arvel Hale, the federal government's expert property
appraiser, as he laid out the state's final arguments in the groundbreaking
damages trial in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale has said the Cayugas should receive $335 million for their lost
ancestral lands in Cayuga and Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Monday, Robert's co-counsel, John Pickett, took the nine-member U.S.
District Court jury back over the testimony from the state's expert appraiser,
John D. Dorchester, who said the 64,015 acres was worth no more than $51
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Neal McCurn had expected to give his instructions to the jury Monday
afternoon but that timeline was derailed by Roberts' lengthy summation. Closing
arguments will continue today.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn has said his instructions in the complicated case could take up to
two hours. The jury must then decide on a present-day market value as well as
the land's rental worth for its use and occupancy for each year from 1795 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayuga's case is the first of several pending Indian land claims against
New York to reach the damages stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Using an overhead projector, Roberts went into a point-by-point attack of
what he called Hale's "flawed analysis." Roberts spent three days during the
11-day trial cross-examining Hale about his appraisal methods.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are layers upon layers upon layers of reasons to reject Mr. Hale's
methods. He has inadequate evidence. There's nothing reliable. His model fails
woefully," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And why is it that none of his mistakes, none of his alterations, ever
seemed to reduce the amount. It always goes up," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale categorized nearly 5,700 separate parcels and used a best-use formula
to come up with average per-acre prices that he multiplied to reach a "grossly
inflated" total for the claim area, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   An electronic memo from Hale to federal attorneys showed that Hale
understood that the court wanted the claim area appraised as a single, large
tract without consideration of any private development, such as houses,
businesses or other private improvements, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts called the electronic memo a "smoking gun," noting that it was
mistakenly included in deposition materials that were turned over to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts argued that Hale later changed his approach after receiving
different instructions in a May letter from Justice Department lawyers. That
letter asked Hale for a "summation of the existing value of all the parcels"
based on their current use, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is diametrically opposite of what the court instructed," said Roberts.
"It's so apparent what they did, it screams at you."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts noted for the jury that the Cayugas' original deed to the land
prevented the tribe from subdividing or leasing to private individuals, another
factor that would have diminished its value over two centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the electronic memo, Roberts said even Hale recognized that the
Cayugas should not benefit from how others had developed the land, even in
200-plus years of trespass.
</P>
<P>
	   "In his own words, he said the Cayugas should not reap benefits based on the
sweat and toil of others who managed the land for over 200 years and turned a
forest into what it is today," Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> State consolidates pheasant breeding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hunters and animals rights activists have each taken
shots at a cost-saving consolidation of New York's pheasant breeding program.
<P>
	   For decades, New York has raised ring-necked pheasants for the benefit of
hunters - most recently at state-run game farms near Batavia and in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Batavia-area John White Game Farm was closed in January to ease the
drain on the state's troubled Conservation Fund, which pays for the program.
Gov. George Pataki is seeking a one-time $700,000 appropriation in his budget
proposal to upgrade Reynolds Game Farm, the remaining Ithaca-based pheasant
raising operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunters and animals rights activists have both criticized the consolidation
moves - for very different reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunters, like those represented by the New York State Conservation Council,
oppose closing the White farm. On the other side of the spectrum, the Fund for
Animals has criticized the plan to use $700,000 in general tax revenue instead
of money from the sports license-financed Conservation Fund to pay for the
Reynolds upgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   "This program uses hand-raised birds as targets for living amusement," said
the fund's Heidi Prescott. The state "should not be serving 'pheasant under
glass' at the public's expense."
</P>
<P>
	   State Department of Environmental Conservation spokeswoman Jennifer Post
said the pheasant program is part of the department's mission of providing and
protecting game species.
</P>
<P>
	   "This provides a type of hunting opportunity that wouldn't otherwise exist,"
she said. Closing the White farm and upgrading facilities at the Reynolds farm
will be more economical, according to Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Reynolds, next to Cornell University, is the last of seven state pheasant
farms. The requested $700,000 would go to roughly doubling the farm's
capacities. Pheasant production is expected to dip for one year during
construction, but rebound after that.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, New York state has raised some 40,000 pheasants annually
for release in areas accessible to hunters. Another 60,000 day-old chicks go to
4-H Clubs and hunters' groups, which raise and release the birds on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   The program costs the Conservation Fund about $700,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki administration is looking to shore up that fund in the face of a
potential deficit, most notably through a proposed increases of up to $5 in
sports license fees. The closing of the White farm is expected to save the fund
$200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Tone, chairman of the New York State Conservation Council's small game
committee, complained that with all the pheasants raised in one location, they
are more vulnerable to devastation by disease or disaster. And he added that
there are fears pheasant production will dip beyond the year promised by DEC,
meaning fewer birds in the wild.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people go out there and they're not going to find pheasants, they're
going to give up their hunting licenses," Tone said, noting that could crimp the
Conservation Fund even further.
</P>
<P>
	   That might be just fine by the Fund for Animals, which has a long-standing
opposition to hunting and the pheasant program. Prescott notes that few of the
domestically raised pheasants survive the winter. Those that are killed by
hunters often fall victims to other predators or cars.
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials reported 90,774 pheasants hunted in the
1998-99 season based on a telephone survey of hunters. That number is down from
earlier years because of fewer small game hunters and fewer wild birds, Post
said. The Fund For Animals, relying on data from the DEC, said there were
123,743 pheasants hunted in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than fish, pheasants are the only animal the state stocks for the
sporting community, Post said.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plan May Strain Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by brokerage titan Merrill Lynch to switch some
customers' money into insured bank accounts could lead to a sudden surge in
insured deposits that may strain the federal insurance fund, an FDIC senior
policy analyst is warning officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses from bank
failures. But the move by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which could be emulated by other
financial companies as the line between banking and brokerage blurs, has raised
concern among regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the plan could pump as much as $100 billion into insured bank
accounts without a corresponding increase in insurance premiums paid by banks to
replenish the federal fund, according to a memo Monday by FDIC senior policy
analyst James McFadyen to the director of the agency's research division.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC's chairwoman, is expected to raise the issue
Wednesday at a House Banking subcommittee hearing on the bank insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on FDIC material. This
is an industry(-wide) question," said Joe Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch
at its New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant, suggested that by raising the
issue, the FDIC could be trying to make a case for an industrywide increase in
bank insurance premiums. The federal insurance fund was socked by more than $1
billion in losses last year from eight bank failures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not quite sure what game is being played here," said Ely, who is based
in Alexandria, Va. "They're trying to scare people."
</P>
<P>
	   The plan by the world's biggest brokerage firm, announced two weeks ago, is
part of the transformation of the nation's financial landscape brought by
legislation enacted last November allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms are offering more banking services, such as home mortgages,
estate planning and federally insured savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill's strategy involves a new version of its 25-year-old Cash Management
Accounts, which combine interest-bearing checking -- not currently federally
insured -- and a credit card with a brokerage account holding stocks and bonds.
Customers must have $20,000 to open such an account.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in June, Merrill plans to offer customers an option that will
automatically "sweep" the cash now in money-market funds in the Cash Management
Accounts into FDIC-insured savings accounts in its two bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Merrill Lynch example, an increase in insured deposits of $100
billion would cause" the reserve ratio -- or the balance of the insurance fund
divided by insured deposits -- to fall from around 1.38 percent to 1.32 percent,
McFadyen, the FDIC policy analyst, said in the memo. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Merrill's bank affiliates have the best risk rating, they are not
required to pay FDIC insurance premiums, McFadyen noted in the memo Monday to
William R. Watson, director of the agency's research and statistics division,
and Barry Kolatch, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, barring the unlikely event that the banks' ratings were
downgraded, McFadyen wrote, "no (insurance) fund growth would result from the
insured-deposit growth attributable to the Merrill program."
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that major brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. manages more than
$100 billion in cash management accounts and other money-market funds. The
possibility that Merrill, Schwab and other financial companies could suddenly
switch large amounts of money into FDIC-insured accounts "raises questions for
the federal deposit insurance system regarding the adequacy of the (insurance)
funds," McFadyen wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ely said he is "a little skeptical that the shift (into insured
accounts) is going to happen that fast."

<HEADLINE> Gondolas the Rage of Ski Resorts  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBERT WELLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Gondolas are becoming the rage for Colorado ski resorts, but
not to drop skiers and boarders on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park is the latest to propose a gondola as public transportation.
Crested Butte also is considering one as a way to get people to the mountain
without their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   It has long been a dream of Aspen to link some of its mountains with a
European-style gondola system. Breckenridge has talked of a gondola from the
town to Peak 8. The town of Avon has considered a gondola to Beaver Creek.
</P>
<P>
	   A gondola built by Telluride in 1996 is being used by more than 1.65 million
riders a year. It connects the town and the Mountain Village, allowing people to
travel back and forth to buy groceries, eat, drink or get to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fabulous. Everybody loves it. Everybody uses it. It is faster than
driving, and the views are beautiful and relaxing," said Telluride Town Manager
Peggy Curran. She said air pollution in the valley is down significantly as a
result of the use of the gondola, road paving projects and limits on wood
burning.
</P>
<P>
	   Dust from roads and wood smoke are the main pollutants in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   Gondolas are not cheap. Telluride's cost $16 million, and in both Winter
Park and Crested Butte they could cost as much as $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Callaway, whose family is a co-owner of Crested Butte, said Gunnison
County has signed an agreement with a consultant to study the concept of a
gondola between Crested Butte and Mount Crested Butte.
</P>
<P>
	   Callaway said the ski area and the two towns, separated by a narrow,
winding, three-mile road and 500 feet of elevation, would be equal partners in
financing the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "Warp speed on this is probably five to seven years," cautioned Winter Park
Mayor Nick Teverbaugh. "I'm sure we will be involved in the financing. There is
no way Winter Park by itself can finance that type of a capital improvement."
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park spokeswoman Joan Christensen said $20 million would be the
resort's entire capital budget for four or five years.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said the gondola is an exciting idea that would help Winter Park
stay competitive. "It's also important because as more people keep coming we
don't want to have an air pollution problem."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the reasons Telluride built the gondola was to curb the pollution
mountain towns often experience in the winter when temperature inversions trap
air in valleys.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter Park also is hoping construction of a new base village with 230
housing units will make the hill itself a major destination area. "When the
gondola goes in people will be able to go back and forth to the town without the
hassle of parking," Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People love to ride skyrides. There is a reason amusement parks put them
in," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The resort this month completed the purchase of land necessary for the
three-mile-long gondola. It likely would be a 15- to 20-minute ride.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would help with air pollution and traffic, as well as making our town
more available to day skiers," Christensen said.

<HEADLINE> Health commissioner questions timing of expanded drug program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An expansion of the state's program to help senior
citizens pay for prescription drugs is a good idea whose time may not have yet
come, Gov. George Pataki's health commissioner says.
<P>
	   Dr. Antonia Novello said Monday she has a quarter-century experience with
the federal government and thinks the state could end up being penalized if it
boldly develops its own expanded drug program at this time.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted that President Clinton has called for a $195 billion program for
Medicare prescription benefits over the next decade. It might make sense, she
told a joint state Assembly-Senate hearing Monday on the 2000-01 state budget,
to get an idea of what Washington has in mind before New York acts.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York should wait to see what the feds do first before we act, because
our experience shows that when we have moved forward with a program which is
then followed by a federal program, our state has been penalized," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   If history is any guide, Washington will adopt on a national scale much of
what New York has been doing for 12 years with its "extremely wonderful"
prescription program, Novello said. New York shouldn't struggle to set up its
own expanded version of a prescription program, only to then take potentially
costly steps to conform the state program with the national one, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Knowing the feds, it's best to let them put it first," Novello said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Novello spokesman, John Signor, said later the commissioner also told
lawmakers that if the Legislature and governor go ahead with a more ambitious
state drug plan, her department would try to work with Washington to minimize
the changes that would be necessary if a federal program follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Novello spent a quarter century in Washington with the U.S. Public Health
Service and as U.S. surgeon general before joining the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's proposed budget calls for funding the state's pharmaceuticals
program - Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage or "EPIC" - to increase by
about $30 million to $148 million in fiscal 2000-01. Enrollment would also rise
from the current 112,000 to 122,500 by March 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's budget proposal anticipates that more people will enroll in the
EPIC program, not that eligibility requirements would be expanded.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Senate, meanwhile, has proposed expanding the income limits on
EPIC to double the eligibility pool to 229,900 senior citizens statewide. Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said the state should spend $125 million out of its
share of the settlement with the tobacco companies to help pay for the expanded
program.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Nassau County Republican who chairs the Senate
health committee, suggested at the budget hearing Monday that the Legislature
could enact its own EPIC expansion and then tailor it to whatever Washington
adopts.
</P>
<P>
	   John McArdle, a spokesman for Bruno, also indicated that the Senate was not
inclined to delay expanding the prescription program.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe very strongly that providing seniors with immediate relief is
critical and we will not wait for any lame duck president to act," McArdle said.
"We are going to act and we are going to make it our chief and primary budget
initiative."
</P>
<P>
	   Currently under EPIC, New Yorkers age 65 and older who make $18,500 a year
as an individual or $24,400 a year as a couple, are eligible for
state-subsidized cuts in prescription drug costs.

<HEADLINE> Don't Blame the Public  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN CUNNIFF AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Who are these ubiquitous "investors" who produce daily and
weekly quakes in the stock market and who receive all the blame or credit,
whichever happens to apply?
</P>
<P>
	   Once upon a time we had a well-defined picture, it being that of a somewhat
portly gentleman, bevested and with a gold watch chain, standing with
exaggerated dignity before a portrait of himself.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a caricature, for sure, but most likely it was nearer the reality
than the investors we picture today, and who are referred to routinely, as in
the phrase, "Investors pushed prices higher ..."
</P>
<P>
	   Today's market is more of a populist place, made up of a good many
middle-aged aspirers to the good life, deeply concerned about taxes and seeking
a cushion of assets beneath their future pensions.
</P>
<P>
	   It also includes the elderly and the more knowledgeable and ambitious
newcomers to the workplace. In all, people like you or me account for a major
portion of the 60 million or 70 million individual investors.
</P>
<P>
	   They may be the "investing public," but they aren't likely to be the
investors who move the market. They aren't the decision-makers. They don't take
the huge risks. They're hardly active traders.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, they are likely to do most of their investing through
intermediaries, such as pension and mutual funds. Of the latter, there at least
7,786 with assets of $25 million or more. That's a minimum asset figure; many
are in large multiples of that figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to impressions, perhaps generated by their advertising, funds are
not necessarily long-term investors. More than ever, they are traders, buying,
selling and turning over portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a reason. Equity mutual funds, which collectively have assets of
more than $4 trillion, are highly competitive with each other, and so tend to
use assets actively rather than sitting on them.
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder that institutions together account for most of the daily trading
on public exchanges. Consider: There are twice as many mutual funds as there are
stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Institutions, of which mutual funds are numerically the largest segment,
account for most of each day's trading and much of the volatility. They are the
"investors."
</P>
<P>
	   This is hardly news to marketplace sophisticates, but now university
researchers, Deon Strickland of Ohio State University and Patrick Dennis of the
University of Virginia, have supplied data.
</P>
<P>
	   They found, for example, that stocks owned predominantly by institutional
investors, mainly mutual funds, surged much more than other stocks when the
market rose sharply, and dropped more when the overall market declined.
</P>
<P>
	   They were able to quantify findings in terms perhaps best left for
academics. In up markets, for example, stocks heavily owned by institutions,
mainly mutual funds, had double the turnover rate of those with low
institutional ownership. And in down markets, fund-dominated stocks fell more
sharply than other stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   To Strickland, "this suggests that institutional money managers may be
panicking and trading a lot more on days when the market is particularly
volatile."
</P>
<P>
	   He describes it as "herding behavior," and suggests that fund managers
conclude that if their performance is not too different from other money
managers, they are unlikely to be replaced."
</P>
<P>
	   And so, when you see and hear of references to investors and what they did
in the marketplace, think not of some prototypical individual, but visualize the
herd instead.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani steps up campaign pace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Stepping up his campaign pace in the face of
complaints from some Republican leaders, Rudolph Giuliani is blasting his Senate
rival's husband, President Clinton.
<P>
	   "A president who is so famous for feeling our pain, somehow doesn't feel the
pain of New Yorkers," Giuliani told a news conference Monday after meeting
privately with state GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fourth political stop in five days outside New York City, the mayor
replayed his Saturday criticism of the president's unwillingness to dip into the
nation's strategic oil reserves in the face of sharply rising fuel oil costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, if he's not going to feel our pain, maybe if we create enough
political pain, he'll finally act," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton are competing for the Senate seat being
vacated this year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, New York Gov. George Pataki sought to knock down speculation
that he was somehow looking to hurt Giuliani's chances by encouraging U.S. Rep.
Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, to renew his interest in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio, with encouragement from state Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long, a Pataki ally, has said he is again weighing an entry into the race for
the GOP and Conservative parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining he wants Lazio to remain on the sidelines, Pataki said Monday
that he would "like to see all Republicans get behind Mayor Giuliani. I think
that's the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has been very supportive," Giuliani said at his news
conference that did not include the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, and under pressure from national party leaders, Pataki convinced
Lazio to put his Senate race plans on hold in favor of Giuliani. But since
then,Longhas become increasingly vocal with complaints that Giuliani, who
supports abortion and gay rights, is not conservative enough for Conservatives.
Long has said he is looking for an alternative candidate. Pataki and the mayor
have had an icy relationship in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   No Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without having
both the GOP and Conservative ballot lines. Unlike other states, New York allows
votes on third-party lines to count for major party candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's visit to Albany on Monday came in the wake of criticism from some
Republican leaders that he was not paying enough attention to upstate New York,
a critical battleground in his race with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's been all over," one upstate GOP leader, speaking on condition of
anonymity, grumbled after Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   After formally announcing her candidacy on Feb. 6, Clinton set off on a
four-day swing across upstate New York that took her from Buffalo to Albany.
Giuliani held political events in Buffalo on Thursday, suburban Westchester
County on Friday and on Long Island on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, the mayor said he wasn't intentionally stepping up his political
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the best that we can, given the fact that I have
responsibilities as the mayor of New York City," Giuliani said before hurrying
back to the city to perform a Valentine's Day wedding.
</P>
<P>
	   The heating oil issue seemed tailor-made for Giuliani given that the highest
price hikes have come in New York state and the Northeast since the OPEC nations
cut production. Thus far, despite pressure from a bipartisan group that includes
Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, President Clinton has refused to dip
into the oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Hillary Clinton said she favored dipping into the reserves with a
swap system under which U.S. oil companies would be able to borrow from the
stockpile and make larger donations back to it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Clinton administration's Energy
Department, said Monday that "the administration is not actively considering
using the strategic petroleum reserves in the current context."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the administration has been providing extra money to the poor to
help pay their heating oil bills and is trying to help heating oil distributors
with possible cash-flow problems. She said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
would be meeting Wednesday in Boston with officials from the heating oil
industry and others to discuss the problem.

<HEADLINE> Harriet Tubman could get her own state holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - When Harriet Tubman conducted more than 300 slaves
to New York and other northern states in the 1850s, they often traveled in small
groups under cover of night, from one dark, damp, basement hiding place to
another.
<P>
	   Her efforts have since become public and celebrated, and New York
legislators want to further promote this famous conductor of the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of the majority parties in the state Assembly and Senate are
sponsoring legislation to make March 10, the anniversary of Tubman's death in
1913, a state holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   "For too long, Harriet Tubman's accomplishments have been in the background
of New York state history," Republican state Sen. Michael Nozzolio said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nozzolio represents parts of the Finger Lakes region where Tubman moved in
the 1850s. Assemblyman Arthur Eve, a Buffalo Democrat who is deputy speaker of
the Assembly, is sponsoring the bill in his house with 30 cosponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure would make Harriet Tubman day the 13th official state holiday
and the most recent since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created.
</P>
<P>
	   Eve and Nozzolio are also sponsoring a resolution that calls upon Gov.
George Pataki to declare March 10 Harriet Tubman Day in New York. That
resolution would not have the force of making the day an official annual
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has attempted lately to highlight its connection with the
Underground Railroad, naming a New York Freedom Trail Commission and including
more details on the Underground Railroad in school curricula.
</P>
<P>
	   Slaves either stayed temporarily or settled in New York and other northern
states as the route ferried them in basements and other secretive locations from
the South in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
	   Tubman was born into slavery around 1820 on a Maryland plantation. She
escaped in 1849 to Philadelphia, where she learned of the Underground Railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While living in Canada, she met William Seward, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of
State, and former governor of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Seward provided Tubman a home in 1857, which she later purchased, to serve
as a headquarters for her railroad work.
</P>
<P>
	   She was one of the most influential "conductors" of the railroad, traveling
south 19 times to free slaves.
</P>
<P>
	   Tubman was also known for inciting a riot at the spot in Troy where an
escaped slave was recaptured. The riot has been called one of the fiercest in
the antislavery movement.
</P>
<P>
	   No other state has a Harriet Tubman Day, Eve's office said. However, the
lawmaker said other states have followed New York in passing Underground
Railroad measures, and he hopes the same will happen with Harriet Tubman Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Eve added that the Underground Railroad was significant to whites, blacks,
and Native Americans, because members of each group participated in the pathway.
He said the legislation would be an effort to recognize that union.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it will help bind us closer to one another," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's office would not immediately comment on the legislation.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, Bruno exchange Valentine's wishes, for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LATHAM, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno are over their Republican spat - not that either acknowledged one
in the first place.
<P>
	   Pataki spoke Monday of Bruno's significant role and accomplishments during
the governor's two terms. Asked if he wants Bruno to continue to lead the
Senate's Republican majority, Pataki said: "It's not my decision, but I like
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno wouldn't be outdone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Valentine's Day is a day of love and togetherness," said Bruno at a ribbon
cutting for a plant at the Plug Power plant near Albany that develops fuel cells
with chemical reactions to power homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this doesn't represent love and togetherness I don't know what does,"
Bruno said. "And what happens when people work together? Things like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he is "proud to have partnered with our great governor, George
Pataki." Then Bruno noted several other "partners," including Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republicans worried the Pataki-Bruno feud would detract from a unified
Republican front with the suddenly contentious New York presidential primary
less than a month away, sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state GOP leadership's choice, Pataki friend George W. Bush, is fighting
to regain momentum nationally and in New York state after losing to Arizona Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire's primary in January.
</P>
<P>
	   And last week, Rep. Rick Lazio - drawing parallels with McCain - said he is
seriously considering the state Conservative Party's invitation to enter the
U.S. Senate race, but only if he also had the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday repeated his strong support for New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Since late January, Pataki and Bruno, of Rensselaer County, have been
fighting over whether the state should pick up the counties' share of a new
health insurance program, plus other policy issues and perceived or actual
slights.
</P>
<P>
	   Most dramatically, those slights included the firing of at least three
Bruno-sponsored state workers in the Pataki administration in an action widely
interpreted by Bruno's members as a show of gubernatorial displeasure in Senate
Republicans. GOP senators also said the governor contacted them directly to ask
about Senate politics, instead of going through Bruno.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday would not acknowledge any connection between a spat with
Bruno and the dismissals within his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "This administration has made thousands of changes over the course of the
last five years and we're going to make thousands more," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   What aides described as a heated meeting last week between Pataki and Bruno
appeared to have helped clear the air somewhat, and staffers for both men
resumed arranging joint public appearances for the pair late last week. Monday
was the first such event. Neither camp on Monday would directly talk about the
reason for the rift.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno and Pataki are state government's most powerful Republicans, and their
spat came at an important time governmentally, as well as politically.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the time of year when Pataki and Bruno try to reconcile their state
budget agendas for the next fiscal year in hopes of being allied in negotiations
against the Democratic state Assembly, though in current years that has not
always happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hoping that all the differences of opinion or political bumps in the
road are over so we can pass a budget on time, with substance," said Democratic
Assemblyman Paul Tonko of Amsterdam at Monday's event.

<HEADLINE> State attorney takes last swipe at inflated appraisal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A federal government appraiser's calculations of
damages in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim are riddled with self-serving
mistakes, questionable methods and arbitrary data, says a state attorney.
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General David Roberts spent nearly four hours Monday
assailing the testimony of Arvel Hale, the federal government's expert property
appraiser, as he laid out the state's final arguments in the groundbreaking
damages trial in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale has said the Cayugas should receive $335 million for their lost
ancestral lands in Cayuga and Seneca counties.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Monday, Robert's co-counsel, John Pickett, took the nine-member U.S.
District Court jury back over the testimony from the state's expert appraiser,
John D. Dorchester, who said the 64,015 acres was worth no more than $51
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Neal McCurn had expected to give his instructions to the jury Monday
afternoon but that timeline was derailed by Roberts' lengthy summation. Closing
arguments will continue today.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn has said his instructions in the complicated case could take up to
two hours. The jury must then decide on a present-day market value as well as
the land's rental worth for its use and occupancy for each year from 1795 to the
present.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayuga's case is the first of several pending Indian land claims against
New York to reach the damages stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Using an overhead projector, Roberts went into a point-by-point attack of
what he called Hale's "flawed analysis." Roberts spent three days during the
11-day trial cross-examining Hale about his appraisal methods.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are layers upon layers upon layers of reasons to reject Mr. Hale's
methods. He has inadequate evidence. There's nothing reliable. His model fails
woefully," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And why is it that none of his mistakes, none of his alterations, ever
seemed to reduce the amount. It always goes up," Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale categorized nearly 5,700 separate parcels and used a best-use formula
to come up with average per-acre prices that he multiplied to reach a "grossly
inflated" total for the claim area, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   An electronic memo from Hale to federal attorneys showed that Hale
understood that the court wanted the claim area appraised as a single, large
tract without consideration of any private development, such as houses,
businesses or other private improvements, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts called the electronic memo a "smoking gun," noting that it was
mistakenly included in deposition materials that were turned over to the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts argued that Hale later changed his approach after receiving
different instructions in a May letter from Justice Department lawyers. That
letter asked Hale for a "summation of the existing value of all the parcels"
based on their current use, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is diametrically opposite of what the court instructed," said Roberts.
"It's so apparent what they did, it screams at you."
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts noted for the jury that the Cayugas' original deed to the land
prevented the tribe from subdividing or leasing to private individuals, another
factor that would have diminished its value over two centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the electronic memo, Roberts said even Hale recognized that the
Cayugas should not benefit from how others had developed the land, even in
200-plus years of trespass.
</P>
<P>
	   "In his own words, he said the Cayugas should not reap benefits based on the
sweat and toil of others who managed the land for over 200 years and turned a
forest into what it is today," Roberts said.

<HEADLINE> State consolidates pheasant breeding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hunters and animals rights activists have each taken
shots at a cost-saving consolidation of New York's pheasant breeding program.
<P>
	   For decades, New York has raised ring-necked pheasants for the benefit of
hunters - most recently at state-run game farms near Batavia and in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Batavia-area John White Game Farm was closed in January to ease the
drain on the state's troubled Conservation Fund, which pays for the program.
Gov. George Pataki is seeking a one-time $700,000 appropriation in his budget
proposal to upgrade Reynolds Game Farm, the remaining Ithaca-based pheasant
raising operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunters and animals rights activists have both criticized the consolidation
moves - for very different reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunters, like those represented by the New York State Conservation Council,
oppose closing the White farm. On the other side of the spectrum, the Fund for
Animals has criticized the plan to use $700,000 in general tax revenue instead
of money from the sports license-financed Conservation Fund to pay for the
Reynolds upgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   "This program uses hand-raised birds as targets for living amusement," said
the fund's Heidi Prescott. The state "should not be serving 'pheasant under
glass' at the public's expense."
</P>
<P>
	   State Department of Environmental Conservation spokeswoman Jennifer Post
said the pheasant program is part of the department's mission of providing and
protecting game species.
</P>
<P>
	   "This provides a type of hunting opportunity that wouldn't otherwise exist,"
she said. Closing the White farm and upgrading facilities at the Reynolds farm
will be more economical, according to Post.
</P>
<P>
	   Reynolds, next to Cornell University, is the last of seven state pheasant
farms. The requested $700,000 would go to roughly doubling the farm's
capacities. Pheasant production is expected to dip for one year during
construction, but rebound after that.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, New York state has raised some 40,000 pheasants annually
for release in areas accessible to hunters. Another 60,000 day-old chicks go to
4-H Clubs and hunters' groups, which raise and release the birds on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   The program costs the Conservation Fund about $700,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki administration is looking to shore up that fund in the face of a
potential deficit, most notably through a proposed increases of up to $5 in
sports license fees. The closing of the White farm is expected to save the fund
$200,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Tone, chairman of the New York State Conservation Council's small game
committee, complained that with all the pheasants raised in one location, they
are more vulnerable to devastation by disease or disaster. And he added that
there are fears pheasant production will dip beyond the year promised by DEC,
meaning fewer birds in the wild.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people go out there and they're not going to find pheasants, they're
going to give up their hunting licenses," Tone said, noting that could crimp the
Conservation Fund even further.
</P>
<P>
	   That might be just fine by the Fund for Animals, which has a long-standing
opposition to hunting and the pheasant program. Prescott notes that few of the
domestically raised pheasants survive the winter. Those that are killed by
hunters often fall victims to other predators or cars.
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials reported 90,774 pheasants hunted in the
1998-99 season based on a telephone survey of hunters. That number is down from
earlier years because of fewer small game hunters and fewer wild birds, Post
said. The Fund For Animals, relying on data from the DEC, said there were
123,743 pheasants hunted in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than fish, pheasants are the only animal the state stocks for the
sporting community, Post said.

<HEADLINE> Bad Weather Hits East, West Coasts  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A combination of snow, heavy rain and thunderstorms slid across the East on
Monday, kicking off killer tornadoes in Georgia while a West Coast storm caused
flooding and mudslides in California.
</P>
<P>
	   A band of thunderstorms stretched from the Nevada line through Wyoming,
bringing high winds that knocked down trees and power lines. A 38-year-old woman
was killed in Bringham City, Utah, when a house awning blew down on her. In
southern Idaho, a 64-year-old woman died when a tree fell onto her car, Canyon
County Sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   An area of low pressure moving through New England spread snow showers from
Illinois across the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes to northern New England.
</P>
<P>
	   Northern New York and northern New England got the heaviest snowfall, with
10 inches at Lake Placid and Champlain, N.Y., and 8 in Eden, Vt. Six inches fell
by midday in parts of Maine and as much as 18 inches of snow was possible by
Tuesday morning. Scores of schools closed in Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   And along the southern edge of the snow belt, rain stretched from the
central Appalachians into southern New England.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain fell in western Pennsylvania, including 1.76 inches near
Pittsburgh, delaying the start of school for one or two hours in some areas.
</P>
<P>
	   A cold front trailing southwestward from the low produced a line of showers
and thunderstorms that reached into the South, where deadly tornadoes destroyed
dozens of homes early in the day in Georgia. Storm damage also was reported in
parts of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   By afternoon, the line of rain and thunderstorms stretched from northern
Florida along the East Coast to New England and was pushing out to sea.
</P>
<P>
	   A potent Pacific storm system moving into California produced rain and
mountain snowfall across sections of Washington and Oregon into northern and
central California.
</P>
<P>
	   Mudslides and flooding closed some northern California highways and Pacific
Gas &AMP; Electric Co. reported that as many as 52,000 customers lost power during
the morning as high wind blew down power lines.
</P>
<P>
	   California's flood-prone Russian River rose to within a foot or so of its
banks before receding. Oakland got a total of 3.8 inches of rain during the
weekend and San Francisco measured 3.1 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco International Airport had two-hour flight delays and wind
warnings were posted on bridges in the area. Crescent City, Calif., reported a
wind gust to 63 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a morning low
of 12 below zero at Rhinelander, Wis., to a midday reading of 82 at Miami. The
lowest wind chill was 30 below zero at Minot, N.D., and the highest midday heat
index was 87 at Key West, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Hancock Renews IOC Sponsorship Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- John Hancock Financial Services, the company that
considered pulling its support of the Olympics, has agreed to a sponsorship deal
worth an estimated $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in town to tour the venues for the 2000
Summer Olympics, announced Tuesday the Boston-based company would renew its deal
until the 2006 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock was the most vocal corporate critic of the Games during the Salt
Lake bribery scandal. Company president David D'Alessandro repeatedly accused
the International Olympic Committee of failing to take decisive action and
ordered the Olympic rings removed from company stationery.
</P>
<P>
	``We made no secret of the fact that in order for the IOC to regain our
confidence as well as that of the public, it had to become a more democratic,
transparent, accountable institution,'' D'Alessandro said in a statement
released by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that with its reform vote in December, the IOC has addressed these
issues. Its members listened to voices for change from inside and outside the
organization. The IOC leadership deserves credit for this progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch described the new contract as ``a testament to the reforms we made
last year.''
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, (John Hancock) had some doubts about whether to renew or not,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	In an internal shakeup following the scandal that engulfed Salt Lake City's
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 10 IOC members were either fired or
forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
	Others received severe warnings for their conduct. The scandal prompted a
wide-scale reforms of the IOC and the bidding process.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 3, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Igor Larionov, Pat Verbeek and Brendan Shanahan scored
during first-period power plays, and the Detroit Red Wings won their third
straight, beating the Phoenix Coyotes 3-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Wregget, spotted an early lead, stayed focused and stopped 28 shots to
extend his unbeaten streak to six games (5-0-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Adams scored during a Phoenix advantage in the second period, but
otherwise the Coyotes had difficulty getting past neutral ice after Detroit
turned defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes won the first three games in the series, but the idea of a
season sweep was dashed early by the Wings' speed and strength on special teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Lapointe had two assists, and Shanahan had one.
</P>
<P>
	   Larionov scored on Detroit's second shot and Verbeek on the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wings are 17-0-4 when Verbeek scores, and when Shanahan made it 3-0 with
his 30th goal with 5:13 remaining in the first period, the suspense went out of
the contest.
</P>
<P>
	   The outburst came within one of Detroit's franchise record of power-play
goals in a period, set against the New York Rangers on Nov. 5, 1942.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix goalie Sean Burke had 19 saves, but only four in the first period,
when the game was decided. Bob Essensa replaced him in goal for 47 seconds in
the second period but didn't face a shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes stopped Detroit's fourth and last power play, but their bad luck
continued.
</P>
<P>
	   Radoslav Suchy beat Wregget 7:21 into the second, but the whistle had
already blown to assess a penalty on Rick Tocchet, and the goal was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes had a 5-on-3 advantage for 41 seconds in the second period,
because Steve Yzerman delayed the game by sprawling on the puck during Phoenix's
original power play.
</P>
<P>
	   As it was ending, Shane Doan took a shot, Jeremy Roenick retrieved the
rebound and sent a cross-ice pass to Adams, who scored into the near side of the
net with 2:20 left, cutting the deficit to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   It took just 16 seconds of the first Red Wings power play for Larionov to
score, just 1:33 in. Shanahan took a shot from the slot, and Larionov poked the
rebound past Burke's stick side.
</P>
<P>
	   Tocchet was called for boarding minutes later, and Verbeek scored at 6:03.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacy Technicians Dispense Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN HENDREN AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) -- Deborah Hoffman wanted to know why the nausea drug
for her 5-year-old came with a special warning about giving it to children.
</P>
<P>
	   Even now, three years later, she remembers the words of the white-coated
woman behind the counter at Walgreens: It's OK "because all children can use
Compazine."
</P>
<P>
	   That was disastrously bad advice. Moreover, the woman in the smock was a
pharmacy technician -- not a pharmacist. She had no pharmacy degree, and she
didn't notice that the bottle contained an adult dosage -- 10 times what the
doctor had prescribed.
</P>
<P>
	   The next morning, Ms. Hoffman found her daughter "all crumpled up," unable
to move or talk. Little Brittany vomited for two days. She couldn't speak a
complete sentence for three.
</P>
<P>
	   Since her overdose, according to court records, Brittany attends school with
children with learning disabilities and for short spells can't think clearly.
"I'll ask for an ash tray, she'll give me the phone," Ms. Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasingly, the person greeting Americans from behind the drugstore
counter is a pharmacy technician. In most states, the job usually requires no
license or training. For $6 to $12 an hour, these assistants shoulder much of
the pharmacist's job. Druggists, who earn $30 to $35 an hour, are then free to
double-check their dispensing work and counsel customers.
</P>
<P>
	   That low-cost help is a mixed blessing: Technicians lack the pharmacist's
expertise, face little regulation, and sometimes -- amid the crush of the
nation's increasingly busy pharmacies -- dispense drugs with little oversight
from pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
	   Techs, as they're known inside the pharmacy, have helped the nation's
drugstores to flourish despite shrinking profit margins. In most states they are
allowed to call the doctor to authorize prescription refills, to pull drugs off
stock shelves, to put pills into prescription bottles, to enter prescriptions
into the computer, to type labels and to ring up sales. In 37 states and the
District of Columbia, they can also mix drugs from raw chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacists are responsible for supervising the technicians' work,dispensing
drugs, checking for dangerous interactions with other drugs and explaining how
to take the medication.
</P>
<P>
	   To ensure that drugstores hire enough pharmacists to safely dispense drugs,
most states limit the number of technicians each pharmacist can supervise. Yet
as technicians reach the legal limits of their tasks, pharmacies are pressuring
state regulators to expand those limits.
</P>
<P>
	   They are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, at least 10 states have increased the so-called
pharmacist-to-technician ratio: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Indiana,
Kansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1998 study by the Virginia Board of Pharmacy found good reason for
pharmacists to supervise technicians closely: Pharmacists were catching an
average of 6 1/2 technician mistakes a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The study questioned pharmacists-in-charge at the state's 1,590 drugstores,
and more than half answered. Of the technician errors found in the study, 55
percent involved the wrong drug; 22 percent, the wrong instructions, and 16
percent, the wrong dose or quantity.
</P>
<P>
	   Druggists elsewhere say they see similar problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I might find in a day five, six, maybe seven errors," said Lowell McNichol,
a pharmacist in Petaluma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Many pharmacists and regulators complain that pharmacists have trouble
monitoring the technicians they have now. The Virginia study was prompted in
part by complaints from Virginia pharmacists such as June Carpenter of
Lynchburg, who said technicians are given responsibilities that should be
reserved for trained druggists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have lost control of our profession," she wrote to the board in 1996.
"We must rely on technicians to do the work because the pharmacist only has time
to quickly check behind them."
</P>
<P>
	   The pharmacist, not the technician, is legally liable for mistakes in every
state. But often, according to dozens of pharmacists interviewed, they don't
check the tech's work. Druggists complain that because they dispense nearly
twice as many drugs as they did in 1989, they simply don't have time.
</P>
<P>
	   One nonprofit group, U.S. Pharmacopeia of Rockville, Md., collects voluntary
reports from health care practitioners. The group's Medication Errors Reporting
Program received 314 reports of pharmacy errors in the year ended Oct. 31. Half
were made by technicians and left undetected by pharmacists (the other half were
presumed to have been made by pharmacists).
</P>
<P>
	   Not only pharmacists are concerned about oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes the pharmacist gets so comfortable that they get lax and don't
check it," Houston tech Kelly Fash said. "I had that happen, and I said, 'Don't
do that. I'm human. I err."'
</P>
<P>
	   Texas regulators have increased oversight. Fash started working in
pharmacies 21 years ago, when techs were simply called support staff. Now she
has passed a certification test, as most Texas technicians will be required to
do under state law by next year. It's made a difference, she said: Certified
techs are, by and large, more qualified.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the majority of the technicians that are hired off the street,
certification is needed, because they're taking anybody and letting them work in
the pharmacy department," she said. "You have the photo department and you have
makeup. If a technician didn't show up, pharmacy managers would pull someone
from another department and let them work in the pharmacy."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet techs are still allowed to do tasks best left to the pharmacist, Fash
said, such as putting the label on the prescription bottle -- a final step that
requires a pharmacist's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
	   In most states, technicians face little regulation. Only four states --
Alaska, Utah, Washington, Wyoming -- license technicians, according to the
National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Two states -- Louisiana and Wyoming
-- require a certification test, and 19 simply register their names. Many states
set no requirements at all.
</P>
<P>
	   With few prerequisites for the job, most technicians receive only on-the-job
training.
</P>
<P>
	   "You could become a technician today, walk into a pharmacy and start filling
prescriptions," said Ralph Vogel, president of the Guild for Professional
Pharmacists, a California labor union. "That's the problem."
</P>
<P>
	   That's no longer the case in Utah, where wages have risen since regulators
in 1998 required technicians to be licensed. Some employers in the state now pay
starting technicians nearly $10 an hour, compared with as little as $5.75 in
some California pharmacies. Those with more experience can earn as much as $13
an hour. Utah requires technicians to pass an exam on drugs and state pharmacy
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those technicians come in with a little more perspective than someone who
doesn't know anything about pharmacy," said Ryan Lee, a member of the Utah Board
of Pharmacy who said he is the only technician to sit on a state board.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1998, some Utah companies offered their own tests, as many outside
the state still do. But those tests aren't always a good measure of a
technician's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was too simple," said Lee, who took a test administered by a
mail-order pharmacy. "It took me 20 minutes and I was done with a 100-question
exam. ... They were so desperate. If you had a pulse, they'd hire you."
</P>
<P>
	   Utah began licensing technicians largely because the board had no authority
to discipline unlicensed workers, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   In states that don't even record the names of technicians, regulators can do
little to stop technicians who violate pharmacy regulations from taking jobs
elsewhere, across the street or across the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   In its 1998 study, the Virginia board noted that technicians there can
continue to work "even if they have diverted or abused drugs, have been
convicted of a felony or have willfully acted negligent while working in a
pharmacy in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite that concern, a Virginia task force studying the issue made no
recommendation, and the board of pharmacy declined to regulate technicians.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-six states limit the number of technicians each pharmacist can
supervise. Eleven of those states allow no more than one technician per
pharmacist, but some have ratios of 4-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising those limits is a priority of the National Association of Chain Drug
Stores, an industry trade group that claims 1-to-1 ratios are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why should pharmacy, unlike other health care settings, be limited in its
staffing decisions? Hospitals aren't limited in the number of nurses they have
assisting a surgeon," said NACDS chairman Frank A. Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, many pharmacies have had helpers. But it's unclear how many,
because support staffers of the past were only recently dubbed technicians.
Technicians are now so popular that the majority of drugstores and hospitals use
them. The journal Occupational Outlook Quarterly reported some 130,000 pharmacy
technicians in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Keepers of state statistics predict the number will grow. The Kansas Board
of Pharmacy expects a 40 percent increase between 1993 and 2005 -- as Americans
increase their prescription drug buying.
</P>
<P>
	   "The rising cost of health care, the increasing complexity of insurance
programs and the growing number of patients make it necessary for pharmacies to
try to become more efficient," Eckerd officials stated in writing.
</P>
<P>
	   As the number of technicians increases, so do their responsibilities. Eighty
percent of the 600 pharmacists surveyed in the November edition of Drug Topics
magazine reported that techs' duties had increased in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Cozzone, business manager of a union representing 750 Walgreens
pharmacists, agreed. In a recent malpractice suit against the retailer, she
testified that Walgreens in the early 1990s had "a different staffing philosophy
... where they start substituting pharmacists' help with technician help."
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacy chains say they are working to improve technicians' training. Some
55,000 techs -- two of every five -- have passed a voluntary certification exam
designed by a nonprofit trade group. Walgreens, for example, gives its certified
techs a $1,000 annual raise. That program, said Walgreens spokesman Michael
Polzin, has encouraged 60 percent of its technicians to pass the exam.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet problems remain. The Associated Press analyzed disciplinary records for
all 50 states in 1998, the most recent year for which data were available. Those
reports show that state pharmacy boards disciplined druggists and drugstores
more than 75 times for letting techs do jobs reserved for pharmacists. Limits on
techs' duties vary by state, but nowhere can a technician dispense a drug
without the pharmacist's approval.
</P>
<P>
	   In Illinois, the pharmacy board found that a Wal-Mart technician dispensed
drugs for 1 1/2 hours, unsupervised. A Washington state pharmacist repeatedly
allowed technicians to fill prescriptions. In Arkansas, four Fred's Pharmacy
locations were fined a total of $10,000 in 1998 for allowing technicians to
exceed their duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes it's unclear whether a technician or a pharmacist dispensed a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
	   Pharmacist Randal Prince's name was on the bottle of Carolyn See's
antidepressant prescription -- with 10 times the correct dose inside. But at the
time the prescription was filled, Prince was nowhere near his base in
Parkersburg, W Va. He was visiting the Ohio headquarters of the Phar-Mor chain,
nearly 200 miles away. As Prince explained in a deposition, "a tech logged my
initials in."
</P>
<P>
	   Jack See found his wife on the kitchen floor, unable to move. Because
pharmacists remain legally liable for any errors, a druggist in the store at the
time took the blame. In 1996, the drugstore settled the case for $272,750. Seven
years later, Carolyn See remains disoriented, unable even to dress herself.
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Hoffman had never thought about whether special training was
required for those working behind Florida drug counters in January 1997, when
she picked up the prescription that allegedly led to Brittany's seizure.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Ms. Hoffman is suing Walgreens and waiting for her daughter to
recover. The technician's words, she said, still haunt her: '"There are a lot of
medicines that say you can't give them to children, but they do anyway."'
</P>
<P>
	   With regret, Hoffman added: "I assumed that she knew what she was talking
about."

<HEADLINE> Crawford Said Linked to Foundation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Suspended Michigan basketball player Jamal Crawford
received money to promote an academic foundation run by a Seattle businessman,
the Detroit Free Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The unsigned agreement -- dated July 13, 1998, and obtained by the newspaper
-- bears the name of Crawford and Barry Henthorn, the businessman who
established the Academic Assistance Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA is investigating Henthorn's relationship with Crawford, who had
starred at Seattle's Rainier Beach High School.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA suspended Crawford, a 6-foot-6 freshman guard and Michigan's
leading scorer, for six games for violating its rules concerning amateurism,
based on his relationship with Henthorn.
</P>
<P>
	   With his mother's permission, Crawford lived with Henthorn for three years
while in high school, the NCAA said. Crawford is practicing with the team and
attending classes but cannot play until Feb. 24, when the Wolverines (12-9, 3-7
Big Ten) play Purdue.
</P>
<P>
	   Henthorn has played down the significance of the foundation, which lists its
address as the same building as Henthorn's Seattle corporate offices for
Innovative Communications Technologies, a long-distance telephone company.
</P>
<P>
	   Henthorn said he never has tried to benefit from his relationship with
Crawford and that he has not attempted to act as his agent. Henthorn said that
as Crawford's non-legal guardian, he provided cash, clothing, cars, tutorial
help, and room and board to Crawford during high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The NCAA has ordered Crawford to repay Henthorn about $15,000 for the
benefits before completing his college eligibility. Henthorn has said he doesn't
want to be repaid, doesn't know how the NCAA expects Crawford to come up with
the money, and that any reimbursement would go to charity.

<HEADLINE> House Democrats roll out reform package  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - House Democrats are proposing a publicly funded
campaign finance system that would create a "citizens election fund" filled with
volunteer donations made through a checkoff on the state income tax return.
<P>
	   The House majority leaders also made their pitch Monday for scrapping the
sheriffs system and retooling the state treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the campaign reform plan, single filers would be able to earmark $5 in
tax money for the fund, and joint filers could contribute $10. Campaign money
would also come from limited fund raising, corporate checkoffs and state and
town political committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the House Democrats' plan, candidates for governor could spend up to
$3.95 million for an election, and people running for constitutional offices
such as attorney general or treasurer could spend as much as $523,000.
Legislative races would not be publicly financed.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Alex Knopp, D-Norwalk, said that breaks down to about $1.75 from every
voter.
</P>
<P>
	   "For $1.75 per voter, we would be able to elect a governor in the state
without a single dollar of PAC money, without a single dollar of lobbyist money
... and without a single dollar of any other kind of special interest funds,"
Knopp said. "We think the public will agree that the small sum of $1.75 per
voter is a worthy price."
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democrats are also calling for publicly financed campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Republican leader Robert Ward, R-Northfield, said publicly funded
campaigns are not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're making an assumption that that everyone will check off," he said.
"I'm not planning to, so their numbers are already off. I'm not giving everyone
money so they can campaign. I'll give money to candidates I believe in."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John G. Rowland has not taken a position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "He thinks everything should be on the table and open for discussion,"
Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic and Republican lawmakers also disagree on how to reform the state
treasurer's office in the wake of the Paul Silvester scandal. The former
treasurer pleaded guilty to money laundering and embezzlement charges. Among
other things, he admitted taking kickbacks from "finder's fees" paid by
corporations to individuals who helped set up investment deals with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides of the aisle want to do away with the informal fees and close
loopholes that may allow treasurers to benefit from pension investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans want an oversight board to control pension investments. But
Democrats and current Treasurer Denise Nappier oppose that.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative leaders are close to agreeing how to scrap the sheriffs system.
Both Democrats and Republicans want a constitutional amendment abolishing the
office of high sheriff. They also agree that the state's Judicial Branch should
oversee the work done by the special deputies who guard courthouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats say the special deputies who transport prisoners should also be
under the purview of the Judicial Branch, while Republicans want that job
controlled by the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone agrees something needs to be done soon," said Rep. Michael Lawlor,
D-East Haven.

<HEADLINE> House pushes for ATM fee ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Legislation that would make it illegal for banks
to charge fees to non-customers who use their automated teller machines does not
have the support of several key state senators.
<P>
	   But House leaders on Monday said they will make a bipartisan push to outlaw
the so-called "convenience fees."
</P>
<P>
	   A similar bill passed the House last year but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a free-market issue and it's about consumer choice," said Sen. Brian
McDermott, D-Wallingford, co-chairman of the Legislature's Banks Committee.
"It's not up to us to regulate fees."
</P>
<P>
	   McDermott said he won't try to kill the bill in committee, but said he won't
try to pass it from his committee to the General Assembly unless there's
widespread support for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to force a vote for something people don't want," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford, said the Legislature would
be wise to wait and see whether courts rule that states can prohibit
federally-chartered banks from charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Such cases are pending in California.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be unfair if we were left with one set of rules to regulate state
banks, but not federal banks," Jepsen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court ruled in December that Connecticut's banking
commissioner did not have the authority to ban the fees, which are levied when
customers use an ATM owned by a bank where they do not have an account.
</P>
<P>
	   The fees, typically ranging from $1 to $2, are in addition to the costs
often charged by the customer's own bank for using another bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the court decision, banks in the state had been banned from
charging the second fee. After the ruling, large banks such as First Union,
Fleet and BankBoston began charging non-customers the convenience fees. Other
smaller, state-chartered banks are not charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation would deal only with the convenience fees.
</P>
<P>
	   "This bill ensures that Connecticut's consumers will be fairly treated by
financial institutions by permitting only one, identified fee per bank
transaction," said Rep. Robert Landino, D-Westbrook, the other co-chairman of
the Banks Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "This allows banks to be reasonably compensated for the cost of operating
ATMs and still gives banks the ability to earn a profit on each transaction,"
Landino said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, a leading critic of convenience
fees, said the charges are anti-competetive and unfair to customers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a fundamental principal of fairness that argues in favor of this
ban to double charges," Blumenthal said. "People deserve and need access to
their own money without being charged twice for it."
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-Northfield, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is bad policy to encourage customers to depend on ATMs and then start
charging fees," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Schepker, a spokesman for Fleet, said his company is gearing up to fight
the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe choice is important to consumers," he said. "Price controls
restrict choice and hurt competition. And that's bad for consumers."

22 Killed by Tornadoes in Rural Georgia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 were
hurt after tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday, ripping people
from their beds and piling up mobile homes. Dozens of houses and mobile homes in
the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened, their metal and siding
mangled and strewn across yards and streets. The tornadoes struck shortly after
midnight as a line of thunderstorms rumbled through the Southeast, scarring
property from Arkansas to Georgia. President Clinton asked Americans to pray for
the tornado victims and said the loss of life "is unusual and terrible."

Blacks, Glaucoma Surgery Studied
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of Medicare claims found that blacks were only half
as likely as whites to undergo surgery for glaucoma, the most common cause of
blindness in black Americans. The researchers, whose study appears in the
February issue of Archives of Ophthalmology, said the reasons could include lack
of health-care access, inadequate education about the disease, overtreatment of
whites and racial bias. An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, the
nation's second-leading cause of irreversible vision loss. The researchers noted
that more than $1 billion is spent on federal aid yearly to about 120,000 blind
glaucoma patients.

<HEADLINE> For better or for worse, real-life divorces find niche in court TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In two earlier incarnations, the TV show "Divorce Court"
used actors to play the separating spouses. Viewers now get the real thing,
complete with whining, tears and taunts.
<P>
	   The new "Divorce Court," a syndicated success midway through its first
season, provides a forum for ex-partners to lash out at each other publicly in
ways that might not be allowed during divorce proceedings in a real court.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are lots and lots of people who divorce amicably. They don't need to
be on a TV show," said the producer, Jill Blackstone. "Our show is about people
whose marriages have ended badly."
</P>
<P>
	   Presiding over the studio courtroom is Mablean Ephriam, not a real judge but
a savvy, quick-witted lawyer with more than 20 years experience in the family
courts of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam doesn't actually grant divorces; that happens elsewhere. But after
scolding, lecturing and sometimes comforting the participants, she rules on some
dispute - usually over money or property - that the couple mutually agreed would
be resolved on the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you hear the stories, you have trouble holding back the laughter, or
the tears, or the anger," Ephriam said in a telephone interview. "Some of the
stuff is just utterly ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
	   The prevalence of no-fault divorce in America means many couples split up
without a chance to go on public record with their gripes against their ex.
</P>
<P>
	   "The emotions, the hurt are still there, but no one listens in court
anymore," Ephriam said. "Our show is cathartic. ... It's good to let go of
emotions."
</P>
<P>
	   Blackstone said the show's appearance fee of $500 per guest is not a primary
motive for those volunteering. Some do so out of vanity or vengefulness, but
most simply want their day in court.
</P>
<P>
	   "They want to be heard - 'He did me wrong,' 'She did me wrong,"' Blackstone
said. "There's a drama in a failed relationship, a passion, and a pain, and
often a humor. It's something everyone can relate to."
</P>
<P>
	   Though they risk moments of nationally televised humiliation, the feuding
couples get a practical benefit - Ephriam's end-of-show ruling serves as a
binding settlement of a dispute that otherwise might have entailed legal costs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a crowded field of court shows, "Divorce Court" has done well for a
newcomer, trailing only "Judge Judy" and "Judge Joe Brown" in the latest ratings
of the genre. It is produced in Los Angeles by Twentieth Television, a division
of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   The original "Divorce Court" aired in the 1950s, with then-obscure actors
such as Alan Alda and Jack Nicholson among the performers. A revival appeared in
the 1980s, again using actors as spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam hopes her audience benefits from watching real-life marital woes.
</P>
<P>
	   "One advantage of the show, for those who are married and going through some
difficulty, is that they may see themselves," she said. "When you hear it from
somebody else, you think, 'Do I say that? Is that what I sound like?'
</P>
<P>
	   "People who are thinking of marriage might rethink constructively. Even
teen-agers - I hope they're learning you should check people out."
</P>
<P>
	   One couple from Virginia told Ephriam they watched the show together and
found it helped them appreciate each other more.
</P>
<P>
	   She herself is divorced but doesn't rule out another try.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe very strongly in the institution of marriage," said Ephriam. "It
saddens me to see how people enter into a marital relationship without any
thought about what it is."
</P>
<P>
	   From the outset, "Divorce Court" has steered clear of alimony and child
custody cases. But Blackstone recalls a memorable custody dispute of a different
sort.
</P>
<P>
	   A couple came on the show hoping to resolve a complex financial dispute, but
the woman soon revealed her biggest concern: Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ephriam ruled that a prized collection of the beanbag animals should be
split, the woman started whining that half a collection was worthless. In a
flash, the judge ruled that the whole collection would go to the man, and the
studio audience roared approval.
</P>
<P>
	   There are sadder cases. One woman contended her husband had cheated on her,
given her gonorrhea and run up big debts on her credit card by patronizing
phone-sex services. She was devastated when Ephriam ruled that those debts had
to be split 50-50.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam fought back tears during another show. A couple was quarreling over
how to divide items they bought for their first child, who had died within an
hour of birth.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you people doing to yourselves?" the judge asked, reacting more
like a mother.
</P>
<P>
	   They stepped back for a moment, she recalled. Then both started conceding.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt much better," she said.

<HEADLINE> Woman who lost house is getting it back, legislator says  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Rockland County Legislator Ryan Karben says the
circumstance involving a woman who lost her home over a $58 tax bill has a
positive ending.
<P>
	   The woman has her home back, and Rockland County has shown itself to be a
giving community, and finally, it's led Karben to take action to ensure a
similar incident does not happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   "This settlement is testament to the neighborly spirit of Rockland," Karben
said during a press conference Monday. "Common sense and compassion triumphed
over bureaucratic indifference."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would introduce Mirielle's Law, a series of resolutions designed
to prevent another such foreclosure like that endured by Mirielle Leroy. Under
the plan, delinquent taxpayers would have to be notified by certified mail, and
a personal visit from the Finance Department would be required before any
owner-occupied home could be foreclosed on.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, who claimed she first heard about the foreclosure and auction of her
Spring Valley home when she received an eviction notice last month from the new
owner, said she was relieved.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one should ever have to go through what I went through," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, a 38-year-old nurse with a 14-year-old daughter, emigrated from Haiti
17 years ago and bought the townhouse on Sharon Drive in 1996 for $114,000.
</P>
<P>
	   She never missed a mortgage payment, and her mortgage company paid the tax
bills from an escrow account - except one, a bill for $58.67 sent out in 1997 by
the Town of Ramapo. It represented what Leroy owed for receiving a few months'
worth of a veterans' tax exemption that applied to the previous owner but not to
her.
</P>
<P>
	   Town and county officials say at least four notices were sent to Leroy by
first-class mail, but she says she didn't receive them and assumed all taxes
were being paid by the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the low amount of the unpaid bill - even with penalties, it grew to
only $270 - the county Legislature approved the foreclosure last year, and the
county went ahead with the auction in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlo Jean Pierre, of Wesley Hills, won the house with a $60,000 bid, took
title Jan. 11 and ordered Leroy, his tenant, to leave. He delayed the eviction
when he heard her explanation but insisted that if he just gave her the house
back, he would lose his anticipated profit.
</P>
<P>
	   Karben said he had arranged a complicated agreement:
</P>
<P>
	   -A state court will be asked to nullify the sale to Pierre, which Karben
said would happen quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   -The county will refund Pierre's $60,000 plus an estimated $2,000 in closing
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   -The mortgage company, Norwest, will pay Pierre $15,000, representing the
profit he could have made on the house.
</P>
<P>
	   -Community groups will pay Leroy's legal bills, amounting to nearly $2,000.

<HEADLINE> Letterman back from heart surgery on Feb. 21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - David Letterman is returning to television next week,
just over a month after undergoing emergency heart surgery.
<P>
	   The late-night host, who had a quintuple bypass on Jan. 14, will ease back
into work by sharing some of his duties with guest hosts.
</P>
<P>
	   His first "Late Show" guest will be Regis Philbin, his on-air conversation
partner when he revealed his medical problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I imagine Dave, as usual, will have a lot to say," executive producer Rob
Burnett said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman will tape his first show on Friday, then work once more next week,
on Feb. 23. Bill Cosby will be a guest host of the CBS show on Feb. 22, and
Philbin will fill in for Letterman on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Some subsequent weeks will also likely be a combination of Letterman and
guest hosts. That's a first for Letterman, who hasn't used guest hosts since he
began in late-night television for NBC in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "As early as two weeks ago, I think he was ready and raring to go," Burnett
said. "Dave, I think, got a rare opportunity to experience what it would be like
not to do this. ... The experience has absolutely made him miss the job
completely."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's return is likely to draw a big audience, and the timing, in the
midst of a ratings sweeps month, couldn't be better for CBS. His ratings have
been up this season, and competitor Jay Leno's are down, but Leno's average
audience each night on NBC is still 35 percent bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still don't think he's going to beat the 'Tonight' show regularly, but he
will get a boost," said Marc Berman, a television analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, when a series of celebrities was interviewed reminiscing about
appearances with Letterman for "Late Show Backstage" specials, it was the third
highest-rated week of the year for "Late Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Backstage" continues this week with Kathie Lee Gifford, Robin Williams and
Mike Myers among the guests. Tom Snyder comes out of retirement Wednesday to
interview Don Rickles and Norm McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said he hadn't talked with Letterman about ways to cut back his
workload. One possibility is working four shows a week with one guest host, as
Johnny Carson did on his later years on the "Tonight" show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Dave will ultimately be able to do five nights a week again,"
Burnett said. "It's just a question of whether he wants to do it."

<HEADLINE> Trial begins for mother and son charged with murder of missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As she laid out a path for the trial of a mother and son
charged with murdering an 82-year-old widow so they could steal her home, a
prosecutor told jurors the evidence would take them to several corners of the
country.
<P>
	   "Their arrogance and greed overcame their common sense," said Assistant
District Attorney Consuelo Fernandez on Monday during the first day of the
trial. "They left a trail of bread crumbs, so to speak, from California to Las
Vegas, from Las Vegas to Florida, from Florida to New York and to Irene
Silverman's home."
</P>
<P>
	   In her opening statement, Fernandez said Sante Kimes, 65, and her son
Kenneth Kimes, 24, used credit cards, signed documents and wrote checks using
more than 30 aliases, some of them invented but others belonging to people who
were linked to the Kimeses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses would sometimes cultivate strangers they thought they could use
later, Fernandez told the jury of eight women and four men. She added that Sante
Kimes promised them jobs, money and, in at least three cases, trips to the
Bahamas in return for favors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses' paper and electronic trail tracked over several states - along
with information from some of the strangers - will help prove the pair schemed
to get rid of Silverman and steal her home, Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Irene Silverman is dead," Fernandez said. "She is dead because these two
people sitting in this courtroom killed her, murdered her."
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses moved into a first-floor apartment in Silverman's six-story
townhouse on the Upper East Side on June 14, 1998, paying $6,000 cash for a
month's rent. Less than a month later, Fernandez said, Silverman vanished.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses were jailed July 5, 1998, the last day Silverman was seen alive,
on charges of using a bogus check to pay $14,000 for a Lincoln Town Car bought
from a Utah dealer. It was another two days before police connected them to
Silverman's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
	   The two are charged in an 84-count indictment with second-degree murder,
conspiracy, robbery, forgery and other charges connected to the presumed death
of Silverman, whose body has not been found.
</P>
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller had told the jury that the murder
case against the Kimeses was largely circumstantial, lacking witnesses,
scientific evidence or even a body.
</P>
<P>
	   Fernandez reminded the jury of this, saying, "Irene Silverman's body has
never been found. There will be no hair, blood or DNA evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   "But there will be overwhelming evidence that will prove to you beyond a
reasonable doubt that they killed her out of simple, ordinary greed," said
Fernandez. "They wanted Irene Silverman's townhouse."
</P>
<P>
	   Silverman's mansion on East 65th Street between Madison and Fifth avenues
was worth at least $4 million. The former dancer had lived there with her late
husband, Sam Silverman, a wealthy businessman.
</P>
<P>
	   One piece of evidence, Fernandez said, was a forged deed, recovered by
police from the Kimeses, purporting to transfer ownership of Silverman's house
to the Kimeses for $395,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kimeses also kept notebooks, Fernandez said. One contained a to-do list
that suggests a suspicious interest in Silverman's home.
</P>
<P>
	   "Get her signature in some way. Check out all exits and entrances. Who works
there? Who is Sam S? (a reference to Silverman's late husband)," were some of
the notes Fernandez cited from Sante Kimes's notebook.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also recovered a bag from Sante Kimes that contained $10,000 and
several of Silverman's personal documents. Sante Kimes told police that the
papers belonged to a friend but the cash was her own.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Lincoln, police found loaded 9-mm and .22-caliber pistols, brass
knuckles, a knife, several wigs and masks, plastic handcuffs, $30,000 in cash, a
stun gun, pepper spray and a pink liquid similar to a known date rape drug.
</P>
<P>
	   They also found cassettes of Silverman's telephone conversations, apparently
from wiretaps, and they found equipment that would be used to tap telephone
lines and record conversations.

<HEADLINE> First lady picks up Irish award, raises cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton was recognized for her work on
the peace process in Ireland and helped raise cash for an Irish Democratic group
that supports her U.S. Senate bid.
<P>
	   The $500-a-head fund-raiser at the tony Georgetown home of Elizabeth Frawley
Bagley, former U.S. ambassador to Portugal, benefited the Irish American
Democrats, a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's director, Stella O'Leary, said she expected to spend the maximum
allowable $10,000 on the first lady's Senate bid and would also spend money on
Al Gore's presidential effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "This tonight will benefit Hillary's campaign," Bagley said to about 100
guests Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The event was billed as an official White House function, and at least one
White House staffer attended with the first lady. Candidates are barred from
using official staff for campaign-related events like fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton's campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson maintained that the
fund-raiser was to benefit the Irish American Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no control over how they spend their money," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Leary said the Irish American Democrats would hold another fund-raiser for
the first lady on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The award Monday night comes after the first lady waded into trouble in the
Irish community by agreeing to march in New York City's St. Patrick's Day
Parade. Many Democrats avoid the parade because it excludes the Irish Lesbian
and Gay Organization. Clinton's likely U.S. Senate race rival, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, regularly marches in the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   It also comes as the peace process itself threatens to tear apart. Last
week, the 10-week-old Cabinet of Protestants and Catholics in Belfast was
suspended after the Irish Republican Army refused to disarm. The power-sharing
cabinet was the centerpiece of the 1998 Good Friday Peace Accord. The British
and Irish governments are working to salvage the joint administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Monday night she was optimistic the setback was "a bump in the
road, but it's going to be resolved."
</P>
<P>
	   "We have brought this to an extraordinary point, and we must finish it
together," Clinton said. "I was pleased to play a role in trying to bring peace
in a tangible way to people and try to bring it from the headlines to the
breadlines and the work lines."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has visited Ireland several times and spoken out for the
peace process. The Irish community is a powerful voting block in New York.

<HEADLINE> Congressman pushes for gay partners immigration bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Ben Googins and his boyfriend, Elias Rodrigues
Martins, traded a telephone call for Valentine's Day, a short one at that. With
Googins living in Manhattan and Martins in Brazil, phone bills average $650 a
month.
<P>
	   And they have three months to wait until they see each other again.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just want to be together and build a life together like any other
couple," Googins said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   That is more difficult than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. immigration laws allow heterosexual married couples to sponsor
their partners for citizenship, the laws don't permit gays and lesbians to do
the same for their partners because there is no legally recognized marriage for
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-Manhattan, introduced a bill on Monday that would
change that, although even supporters admit it stands little chance of passing
in the current Republican-led Congress. Nadler's Permanent Partner Immigration
Act of 2000 would allow a U.S. citizen in a permanent relationship to sponsor
his or her partner for immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Nadler called the bill "simply a matter of common sense and fairness."
</P>
<P>
	   "Why do we allow the government to tear apart committed and loving couples
just because of who they love?" Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has been talked about for years in the gay and lesbian community,
but Nadler's bill is the first to deal with the topic, said Lavi Soloway,
chairman of the New York City-based Lesbian and Gay Immigration Rights Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look at it as the very beginning of an important dialogue in Congress,"
Soloway said. "We're hoping to attract a core of support and to begin building a
broader coalition. But we're realistic to know that this bill isn't going to
pass right away."
</P>
<P>
	   A telephone call placed to Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who is
chairman of the House subcommittee on immigration, was not immediately returned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nadler's bill would introduce the term "permanent partner" into sections of
immigration law dealing with legally married couples. Permanent partners would
have to demonstrate that they were in an intimate, committed relationship. Each
partner must be over 18 years old. Certain other restrictions would apply.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen other countries currently provide immigration rights to same-sex
partners, including England, France, Canada and South Africa, Soloway said.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Googins and Martins, both 25, keep in contact as best they can and
try to save money to be together. Googins waits tables in midtown Manhattan.
Martins is a student. He'd like to work, but with unemployment in Brazil
hovering around 30 percent, finding work is difficult.

<HEADLINE> Hancock Renews IOC Sponsorship Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- John Hancock Financial Services, the company that
considered pulling its support of the Olympics, has agreed to a new sponsorship
deal worth an estimated $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in town to tour the venues for the 2000
Summer Olympics, announced Tuesday the Boston-based company would renew its deal
for 2001-2004. The period covers the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City and the
2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock was the most vocal corporate critic of the Games during the Salt
Lake bribery scandal. Company president David D'Alessandro repeatedly accused
the International Olympic Committee of failing to take decisive action and
ordered the Olympic rings removed from company stationery.
</P>
<P>
	``We made no secret of the fact that in order for the IOC to regain our
confidence as well as that of the public, it had to become a more democratic,
transparent, accountable institution,'' D'Alessandro said in a statement
released by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that with its reform vote in December, the IOC has addressed these
issues. Its members listened to voices for change from inside and outside the
organization. The IOC leadership deserves credit for this progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch described the new contract as ``a testament to the reforms we made
last year.''
</P>
<P>
	``As you know, (John Hancock) had some doubts about whether to renew or not,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	In an internal shakeup following the scandal that engulfed Salt Lake City's
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, 10 IOC members were either fired or
forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
	Others received severe warnings for their conduct. The scandal prompted a
wide-scale reforms of the IOC and the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
	John Hancock is the fifth company to sign up for the IOC's 2001-2004 worldwide
sponsorship program. The others are Coca Cola, Visa, Time/Sports Illustrated and
European computer systems company Sema.
</P>
<P>
	IOC marketing director Michael Payne said deals had been reached with other
sponsors and would be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said its target is to have at least 10 sponsors in the 2001-2004
program.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Tax Faces Ballot Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE LOCKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- First, Meathead vanquished the Marlboro Man in a
cliffhanger finish. Now, in the best Hollywood tradition, comes the sequel.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen months after he persuaded California voters to raise cigarette
taxes by 50 cents a pack to create new funds for early childhood development,
actor-director Rob Reiner is back on the campaign trail. This time he's fighting
Proposition 28, a March 7 ballot measure that would repeal the new taxes he
championed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never underestimate tobacco interests, what they will be willing to do,
the lengths they will be willing to go to,'' says Reiner. ``It's certainly
unbelievably annoying that I'm having to do this, but I can't say I'm
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
	   His opponent is cigarette retailer Ned Roscoe, who says the taxes are bad
fiscal and social policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To take money from smokers and to waste it and to use it in a way that is
actually bad for society -- that's a bad thing to do. What you see here is the
politics of division,'' says Roscoe, vice chair of the Benicia-based chain
Cigarettes Cheaper! that has 229 stores in California.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent Field Poll indicated the repeal effort has yet to catch on with
voters. Twenty nine percent of those surveyed were in favor of Proposition 28,
while 57 percent were against it and 14 percent were undecided. The poll,
conducted between Feb. 2 and Feb. 6 among 1,186 registered voters, had a margin
of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco taxes were created through Proposition 10, which narrowly passed
in November 1998. They generate an estimated $700 million a year by raising
state tobacco taxes, including a 50-cents-a-pack hike for cigarettes that
brought total state cigarette taxes to 87 cents a pack. The money goes to
programs for children under five, creating the I Am Your Child Foundation and
addressing the importance of early childhood development.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the money goes to locally appointed county commissions, based on
birthrates. The first payments, totaling $362 million, were distributed in
October.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Proposition 10 fight, Reiner was up against a battalion of
big-moneyed tobacco interests. He had an enthusiastic campaign style and name
recognition as Michael ``Meathead'' Stivic from TV's ``All in the Family'' and
as a director whose credits include ``When Harry Met Sally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reiner's forces spent $10 million to Big Tobacco's $30 million but squeaked
out a victory by about 80,000 votes out of 8 million, a finish so tight it took
days before victory was officially declared.
</P>
<P>
	   This time around, it's not clear what role, if any, the tobacco giants will
play. Campaign finance reports filed so far don't indicate any major tobacco
donations, but it is not unusual for money to flow in late in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Roscoe says he's gotten no indication the big companies will help him.
</P>
<P>
	   Reiner says Roscoe is no small independent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a guy that's got 550 stores around the country,'' he says. ``He
can characterize himself anyway he wants to, but ultimately it's the tobacco
interests that are trying to take this money away from children.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the repeal effort does get a last-minute influx of cash, Reiner is
prepared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a way we're even fighting harder this time than last time. We won by
such a thin margin last time I want to send a message to tobacco ... 'The voters
of California really do care about young children. You should stop and go away
and stop trying to fight us on this.'''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students Return to Class  </HEADLINE>
   By AMPARO TREJO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A young engineering student stood by the notice board,
waiting to find out exactly when he has to attend class again after a strike at
Latin America's largest university forced him to take a 10-month break.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Arturo Gomez, who spent the break studying English, had just one
semester left before graduation when the strike began. On Monday, his enthusiasm
tinged with bitterness, he entered the campus for the first time since then.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was ridiculous to spend 10 months on strike doing nothing. It was
outrageous,'' said Gomez, 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of other students also returned to the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, or UNAM, on Monday, eight days after a police raid ousted
2,500 strikers who had taken control of the campus. Some 600 were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   A clash threatened to break out Monday as 2,500 sympathizers of the strike
demanded the suspension of classes until the authorities renewed negotiations
with the strikers and freed those still in detention.
</P>
<P>
	   A small group of strikers retook parts of the science school after a student
assembly narrowly voted in favor of blocking the return to school, university
spokesman Alberto Perez Blas said on TV Azteca evening news. He said he hoped
the strikers would leave the building on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the university's 270,000 students were divided by the strike,
things were generally calm as academic activity resumed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The future of the university depends on the students, and we must strive
to regain the prestige lost,'' Gomez said. ``Some people may feel resentment
toward certain people. I feel that resentment.''
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began in April and was triggered by a plan to raise annual
tuition from a token few cents to the equivalent of $140.
</P>
<P>
	   University authorities quickly backed down on the tuition increase. But the
students made other demands, ranging from guarantees protecting the existing
practice of automatic entrance into the university for students of affiliated
high schools, to the end of global free-market economic policies they claimed
would exclude the poor from education.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations broke down repeatedly, but the government feared that ordering
a raid on the occupied campus would rekindle memories of a massacre of students
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   The police finally went in -- unarmed -- on Feb. 6, a few days after violent
clashes between students and university workers.
</P>
<P>
	   For accounting professor Hector Ortiz Reyes, 24 years teaching at the
university has taught him one lesson. ``The university is crying out for serious
structural reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I entered as a high school student in 1965, studying a curriculum from
1963 that is still taught today, 40 years later!'' Ortiz Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
	   He earns the equivalent of $2 for an hour's class, and depends primarily on
a job in an accounting firm and at a private university.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, piles of garbage, bottles, pamphlets with anti-government slogans
and shreds of the red and black cloth that symbolized the protest litter the
huge campus -- reminders of the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the buildings, however, survived without serious damage.
</P>
<P>
	   And around the campus, students chat or start up ball games. The majority
were ready for the university to reopen.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Gutierrez spent much of the last 10 months in a bus, traveling
around the city to attend temporary classes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very happy to be back,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez, Former Coup Leaders Feud  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- They were brothers-in-arms, four junior military
officers who conspired for 10 years to overthrow Venezuela's government. One,
Hugo Chavez, eventually became president.
</P>
<P>
	   But now the former coup leaders are feuding, and their anger at Chavez's
alleged betrayal of the revolution they risked their lives for is threatening to
rupture the president's governing coalition just a year after he took office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the beginning of the breakdown of the government of Chavez,'' said
retired Vice Adm. Mario Ivan Carratu Molina, who whisked then-President Carlos
Andres Perez to safety the night the military rebels stormed Miraflores
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's fellow coup leaders say the president is surrounding himself with
members of the corrupt oligarchy that their revolt was aimed at overthrowing --
the same people they blame for squandering the country's vast wealth oil,
leaving most Venezuelans impoverished.
</P>
<P>
	   They also claim Chavez is stifling democratic debate and that his
administration is becoming corrupt. The charges come from Chavez's former
intelligence chief -- the man who knew all the secrets and now is talking -- the
highly popular governor of powerful Zulia state in the heart of Venezuela's huge
oil industry, and the former head of Chavez's political party.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations could be particularly damaging to Chavez because he rode a
wave of public disgust over rampant corruption to win the presidential race in
December 1998 and has made the fight against corruption a pillar of his
government.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nationally broadcast address Friday night, Chavez said a full
investigation into the corruption charges will be conducted and that he has
nothing to hide. His supporters say the other three coup leaders are attacking
him because they are jealous of his political success and want a bigger share of
power.
</P>
<P>
	   The three coup leaders used the eighth anniversary of the Feb. 4, 1992,
military rebellion to issue a warning that Chavez's ``peaceful revolution'' was
losing direction. They've called on him to fire his two closest political
allies, Congressional President Luis Miquilena and Foreign Minister Jose Vicente
Rangel, saying they are part of Venezuela's corrupt oligarchy and that they
don't stand up to Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is surrounded by a group of servants who simply bow their
heads and say, 'Yes, master,' '' retired Lt. Col. Yoel Acosta Chirinos, the
former head of Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement political party, was quoted as
saying in Sunday's edition of El Nacional newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Thursday, retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, who resigned two weeks ago
as Chavez's intelligence chief after clashing with Rangel, handed over to the
national prosecutor evidence of 46 cases of alleged corruption in the Chavez
administration, including charges against Miquilena and Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   Miquilena dismissed the allegations as groundless, and his supporters argue
that it is absurd to label him part of the country's corrupt oligarchy because
he spent seven years in prison during the 1950s dictatorship of Marcos Perez
Jimenez and is generally viewed as honest.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the three former coup leaders met in Zulia to plot their next
move. Zulia's governor, retired Lt. Col. Francisco Arias Cardenas, is considered
the intellectual author of the 1992 coup and now says he has presidential
ambitions himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Chavez met in the presidential residence in Caracas with
Miquilena and Fifth Republic leaders. Emerging from the meeting, Miquilena
insisted that the government is ``on solid ground'' and that the rebellion of
Chavez's former comrades-in-arms presents little threat to the president's
enormous popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez may be hard-pressed to give his former comrades a bigger role in his
government because he already was under fire from critics for appointing
soldiers to many top posts. To try to counteract worries that he wants to
install a military regime, he brought in high-profile, generally respected
civilians such as Miquilena and Rangel -- the very ones whose heads the former
coup leaders are clamoring for.
</P>
<P>
	   One newspaper columnist wrote that Chavez now has two choices: Cutting off
his left hand or his right.
</P>
<P>
	   Angela Zago, a university professor with close ties to all the coup leaders,
is worried they might take more extreme actions. If they believe their
revolutionary project has been permanently betrayed, she said, they could turn
to their allies in the military to stage another revolt.

<HEADLINE> Letterman To Return to TV Feb. 21  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman is returning to work, but he'll be taking
it slowly at first.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Late Show" host is scheduled to return to CBS on Feb. 21 after a one
month absence due to heart surgery. He'll also work next Wednesday, but Bill
Cosby and Regis Philbin will also be guest hosts next week -- the first time
Letterman has let someone else take over.
</P>
<P>
	   "He feels great," said executive producer Rob Burnett on Monday. "He's
exercising. What he doesn't know is how he'll feel after he hosts a network
television show."
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin will also be Letterman's guest on his first night back. The
hard-working emcee of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" was Letterman's on-air
conversation partner when he revealed his health problems. Letterman underwent
an emergency quintuple bypass operation on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman tapes his first show on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "As early as two weeks ago, I think he was ready and raring to go," Burnett
said. "Dave, I think, got a rare opportunity to experience what it would be like
not to do this ... The experience has absolutely made him miss the job
completely."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's return is likely to draw a big audience and the timing, in the
midst of a ratings sweeps month, couldn't be better for CBS. His ratings have
been up this season and late-night competitor Jay Leno is down, but Leno's
average audience each night on NBC is still 35 percent bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still don't think he's going to beat the 'Tonight' show regularly, but he
will get a boost," said Marc Berman, a television analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, when a series of celebrities were interviewed reminiscing about
their appearances with Letterman for "Late Show Backstage" specials, it was the
third highest-rated week of the year for "Late Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Backstage" continues this week with Kathie Lee Gifford, Robin Williams and
Mike Myers among the guests. Tom Snyder comes out of retirement Wednesday to
interview Don Rickles and Norm McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Subsequent weeks will likely be a combination of guest hosts and Letterman
appearances. Ever since he began his late-night show in 1982, Letterman hasn't
brought in guest hosts.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said he hadn't talked with Letterman about ways to cut back his
workload. One possibility is working four shows a week with one guest host, as
Johnny Carson did on his later years on the "Tonight" show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Dave will ultimately be able to do five nights a week again," he
said. "It's just a question of whether he wants to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said there was "no shortage of volunteers" to be Letterman's guest
on the first show back, but that Philbin seemed to make the most sense.
Letterman disclosed his heart problems after asking Philbin about his own
successful emergency angioplasty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a friend and he's tied to this experience for us," Burnett said.

<HEADLINE> Officer claims he thought Diallo wore bulletproof vest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Inside Amadou Diallo's vestibule, there was a din
"like cannon shots." There were flashes. And wood splintering. Chaos.
<P>
	   The description by one of the four officers accused of murdering Diallo with
a barrage of 41 bullets also includes a scary sight: Diallo standing up to the
gunfire and holding a black object that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendant Sean Carroll testified at the officers' trial Monday that he was
sure the West African immigrant was "wearing a bulletproof vest and the only way
to take him out was to shoot at his legs."
</P>
<P>
	   But when Diallo fell, Carroll said, he was shocked to look down and discover
the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36 - at times sobbing - and Officer Edward McMellon, 27 - in
monotone - became the first of the four defendants to give public accounts of
how they shot Diallo while patrolling his block at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, are expected to take the
stand.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Carroll and McMellon both told jurors they had experience
identifying dangerous street criminals and were trained to quickly move in - or
"close the gap" - to disarm them. Both testified they had been involved in
non-fatal shootings that were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   On the morning Diallo died, the four plainclothes officers were cruising in
an unmarked car. Carroll said he became suspicious as they drove past Diallo's
apartment building and saw him on the front doorsteps "looking up and down the
block, peeking his head out ... like he didn't want to be seen."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll claimed Diallo, 22, a street vendor, fit the description of a wanted
rapist. He also said he suspected that Diallo might be committing a robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers got out of the car, McMellon testified, he held out his
badge and said, "Police department. ... Can we have a word with you?" Instead of
stopping, Diallo retreated to the rear of a vestibule and started digging in his
right pocket, both officers testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants described rushing Diallo, ordering him to "Stop!" and "Show
your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   "We said it clear," Carroll said. "He just didn't want to listen."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers said Diallo turned toward them and began pulling out a square
black object that looked like the top of a semi-automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   "My prior arrests dictated to me that this person was pulling a gun,"
Carroll said. "I just said, 'Gun. He's got a gun."'
</P>
<P>
	   Said McMellon: "I screamed 'What are you doing?' (at Diallo) ... I didn't
want to die."
</P>
<P>
	   Both officers said they had one foot in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule when
they fired the first shots. As they retreated, McMellon fell down a stoop and
unto his back but kept firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon repeated defense claims that they fired all 16 shots
from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go down.
Carroll denied he shot Diallo while he was flat on his back, despite evidence
that one of his bullets tunneled up the victim's leg.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, both officers said they didn't know which one of them
fired the first shot. Prosecutor Donald Levin demanded Carroll explain what was
so suspicious about a man standing on his front stoop.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking up and down the block is not a crime, is it officer?" Levin asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, it is not," Carroll responded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delegation Visits Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A huge boost in U.S. military aid to fight
Colombia's drug-financed rebels won't draw the United States into a ``terrible
quagmire,'' President Clinton's top envoy to the South American country
insisted.
</P>
<P>
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering, in Bogota to discuss a $1.6
billion anti-narcotics package currently before the U.S. Congress, said Monday
that Washington's role will be limited to providing equipment and training for
Colombia's army.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States has no intention of sending troops to Colombia to
fight,'' the envoy heading a high-level delegation said after meeting with
President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
	   Pickering is a former ambassador to El Salvador, where a limited U.S.
presence ballooned into a major involvement in the country's brutal civil war
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeing parallels to that era and even to Vietnam, U.S. human rights
organizations and some Democratic lawmakers oppose the Colombia aid plan. They
say it will inflame a nearly 36-year conflict and could draw the United States
into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   About three-fourths of the aid package would pay for 63 attack helicopters
and training for two new army counter-drug battalions. The units will be tasked
with retaking rebel-held southern jungles where cocaine production is rapidly
expanding.
</P>
<P>
	   While dismissing the ``terrible quagmire issue,'' Pickering recognized that
leftist rebel units involved in the drug trade would be legitimate
``objectives'' of Colombian troops receiving U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the guerrillas would get out of the drug trade, they would have nothing
to fear from the United States,'' the envoy added.
</P>
<P>
	   New intelligence estimates provided to The Associated Press on Monday show
that cocaine production increased by 20 percent last year in Colombia -- already
the world's principal supplier.
</P>
<P>
	   Land used for coca, the crop used to make cocaine, totaled 465 square miles
-- up from 393 square miles in 1998, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca cultivation, meanwhile, is dropping in neighboring South American
countries whose political environments are not as fertile to drug trafficking as
Colombia's.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug traffickers began moving their planting operations into Colombia in the
mid-1990s, taking advantage of the lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
	   Leftist rebels and their rightist paramilitary foes control nearly half of
the Colombian countryside, and both make huge profits by taxing peasant growers
and protecting drug laboratories and clandestine airstrips.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1998 to 1999, the new CIA estimates show, acreage devoted to coca bush
dropped from 197 square miles to 150 square miles in Peru and from 147 square
miles to 85 square miles in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, cocaine production in the Andean region was down 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But Colombia's coca crop is expanding -- most rapidly in the southern
Putumayo state, where the U.S.-trained army battalions will provide ground and
air protection while crop-dusting planes spray deadly herbicides on the crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed resistance is expected from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
-- the 15,000-strong rebel group that dominates the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia's defense minister says he also expects violent protests from tens
of thousands of peasants who depend on coca production for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana has said his government expects thousands of those peasants to be
displaced once the cocaine fields are eradicated.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed U.S. aid package includes $176 million for resettling uprooted
peasants and helping them find a legal way to make a living.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2 million Colombians have already fled their homes during the past
decade to escape fighting between rebels, paramilitary groups and the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Several international humanitarian organizations, including Catholic Relief
Services and the U.S. Committee for Refugees, are urging Congress to devote a
higher share of the U.S. aid package to assistance for those already displaced
by the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Mans Said Threat to Sharks' Future  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA MENDOZA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Marine researchers say the scariest thing
about sharks isn't that they might be lurking in the murky depths. It's that
they might not.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling for an ``International Action Plan for Sharks,'' shark experts who
gathered at the world's largest pelagic shark conference said the deep sea
creatures are in serious decline, threatened by overfishing for their fins and
meat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a sense of urgency here,'' said David Wilmot of the Islip,
N.Y.-based Ocean Wildlife Campaign. ``We really don't think sharks can wait any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 million sharks are caught each year by crews from 125
countries. Of those, only four -- Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. --
have implemented management plans for the shark fisheries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Beyond national boundaries, shark fishing is a free for all,'' said Merry
Camhi of the National Audubon Society's Living Oceans Program.
</P>
<P>
	   Pelagic sharks, the massive species that live in the deep sea rather than in
coastal waters, are particularly at risk of being fished out of existence as
demand for their fins increases, experts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Populations of several species, including the dusky and sandbar, have
dropped 80 percent in just 10 years, according to the Ocean Wildlife Campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Off the Hawaiian Islands, shark finning -- the practice of cutting off a
shark's fin and throwing its carcass back into the ocean -- increased 2000
percent between 1991 and 1998, said the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks are fished for their meat, fins, cartilage, leather, teeth and jaws
by commercial and recreational fisheries. Their nurseries, where sharks return
each year to hatch their young, have also been damaged by pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, they are killed accidentally by people using huge drifting nets
or long lines to catch tuna.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharks account for just one percent of all the species fished in the world.
But they are slow to reproduce and take up to 14 years to mature. Therefore, the
experts said that if current practices continue, species could go extinct.
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of environmental groups are pushing for the adoption of domestic
and international recovery plans which they say will rebuild pelagic shark
populations in about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One challenge conservationists said they face is that sharks have a bad
reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until recently, the public perception has been that the only good shark is
a dead shark,'' said Penny Dalton, assistant administrator of the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
	   She said movies like ``Jaws,'' which featured a massive killer shark, make
it tough to convince the public that the species is threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, however, researchers at the conference said Jaws' ominous
slogan, ``Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...'' may
apply more to the sharks than to humans.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It seemed fitting that Valentine's Day would be soggy
for "Come in From the Rain" songwriter Carole Bayer Sager.
</P>
<P>
	   With about 300 fans looking on, including best friend and neighbor Elizabeth
Taylor, the Grammy winner unveiled her Hollywood Walk of Fame star during a
Monday rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carol is a poet of the soul," Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan and Johnny Mathis are among the
artists who have recorded her songs. Bayer Sager's memorable credits include
"That's What Friends Are For," "Don't Cry Out Loud," "On My Own," and "It's My

</P>
<P>
	   "I want to thank you all for coming in this rain. I don't know that I would
have. But now that you have, call me anytime, even when it's raining," she told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   Other celebrities on hand for the soggy ceremony included Dustin Hoffman,
Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds and Neil Simon.

<TEXT>
<P>
    HOLLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Doodles by Rosie O'Donnell and Ewan McGregor could
soon draw enough money to help elementary school kids.
</P>
<P>
	   A parents group at Lincoln Elementary School is sponsoring an auction of
some 60 celebrity doodles with proceeds to benefit school arts programs in this
western Michigan city.
</P>
<P>
	   The first item up for bids will be a doodle of tools by TV handyman Bob
Vila, which was scheduled to appear on eBay beginning Sunday. Forty other pieces
will follow in coming weeks and a live auction of 20 of the most prized works go
on the block March 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have absolutely no idea how much we might raise," parent Angela Morris,
who came up with the fund-raising idea, told The Grand Rapids Press in a
Monday's editions. "We just figured it would be more fun than selling cookie
dough."
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, students drew pictures of 250 celebrities and parents mailed
them out asking for a signed doodle in return.
</P>
<P>
	   The first doodled reply, not surprisingly, came from kid-friendly Rosie
O'Donnell. She scribbled faces of five students standing behind a sign that
said: "LINCOLN ROCKS!"
</P>
<P>
	   Ewan McGregor of "Star Wars" also tried to equal second-grader Alan Hanko's
doodle of a light saber in action, while Fred Rogers jotted some musical notes
and signed it "Mister Rogers."

<HEADLINE> Muppets Moving to Chaplin Studio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Muppets are moving into Charlie Chaplin's old digs.
</P>
<P>
	   The five children of late "Muppets" creator Jim Henson said Monday they have
bought Chaplin's historic studio for $12.5 million and are leasing it to the Jim
Henson Co., their late father's company.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-acre Hollywood site, which includes Chaplin's 10,000-square-foot
sound stage, was declared a historical monument by the Los Angeles Cultural
Heritage Board in 1969, protecting some of its buildings from alteration.
</P>
<P>
	   "The buildings are a lovable hodgepodge of quirky, unusual spaces," said
Lisa Henson, who works with the film division of her father's company. "It's not
your typical corporate space, but it's ideal for the Muppets."
</P>
<P>
	   Chaplin began construction on his studio in 1917 and he filmed large parts
of "The Kid," "The Gold Rush," "Modern Times" and "The Great Dictator" there.

<HEADLINE> Defense asks judge to bar government witnesses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Defense lawyers in the second Abner Louima trial asked a
judge to bar testimony that Justin Volpe promised a lawyer he would keep silent
about another police officer's role in the bathroom attack.
<P>
	   Calling the proposed testimony "hearsay within hearsay," attorney Stuart
London said Monday it would subject his client, Officer Thomas Bruder, to
"unfair prejudice" by linking him to a crime in which he had no role.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruder, 34, fellow Officer Thomas Wiese, 37, and ex-cop Charles Schwarz, 34,
are on trial for conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the Aug. 9, 1997,
assault on Louima in a police station lavatory.
</P>
<P>
	   The illness of a juror Monday forced a one-day recess in the trial, now in
its second week. U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson said the female juror
reported an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe pleaded guilty last May 25 to sodomizing Louima with a broom handle at
Brooklyn's 70th Precinct. The jury in that trial subsequently convicted Schwarz
as an accomplice who held the victim down.
</P>
<P>
	   At sentencing, where he drew 30 years, Volpe said the jury had erred in
convicting Schwarz. He said only Wiese had entered the bathroom during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days before his guilty plea, Volpe pledged his silence to Stephen Worth
- then Schwarz's lawyer - in a courthouse hallway, prosecutors told the judge in
a letter last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'.' Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the letter, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad did not name the
witnesses but said, "Volpe would have had no reason to indicate to Schwarz's
attorney his intent to 'say nothing' if Schwarz had not participated in the
sexual assault of Mr. Louima."
</P>
<P>
	   London said the government's claim was "nothing more than speculation and
wishful thinking" because it did not include the question that prompted Volpe's
vow to "say nothin"' or precisely what he meant.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's current attorney, Ronald Fischetti, did not comment. He has said
he will subpoena Volpe from prison to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Worth, a law partner of London, is defending another officer in the Amadou
Diallo murder trial in Albany. He said he would testify if subpoenaed.

<HEADLINE> Oscars Present Uncertain Field  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- This year's Oscar nominations are all about
democracy. Everything from blockbusters to tiny arthouse films are in the mix
for Hollywood's top prizes.
</P>
<P>
	   While a few films were considered locks for certain categories when
nominations are announced today, the field of contenders for the 72nd annual
Academy Awards was more wide open than any year in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
	   In many years, veteran Oscar watchers say they generally can pick four of
the five best-picture nominees with reasonable certainty. This year, though,
only "American Beauty" appears to have a lock on a nomination, with "The
Insider" and "The Hurricane" as solid bets.
</P>
<P>
	   A diverse slate of films, including the ghostly mega-hit "The Sixth Sense,"
the comically macabre "Being John Malkovich" and the high-society murder yarn
"The Talented Mr. Ripley," also are among the frontrunners.
</P>
<P>
	   Other leading prospects include "The Cider House Rules," "The Green Mile,"
and two highbrow longshots, "The End of the Affair" and "Topsy-Turvy."
</P>
<P>
	   Top acting possibilities include superstars Tom Cruise for supporting actor
in "Magnolia" and Jim Carrey -- who was snubbed by the Oscars last year for "The
Truman Show" -- for lead actor in "Man on the Moon."
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscar list for acting categories also may include "American Beauty's"
Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Chris Cooper; "The Hurricane's" Denzel
Washington; "The Insider's" Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer; "Being John
Malkovich's" Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz and John Malkovich; and "The Sixth
Sense's" Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
	   The stars of two relatively obscure arthouse movies, Golden Globe winners
Hilary Swank of "Boys Don't Cry" and Janet McTeer of "Tumbleweeds," are
considered good bets for best-actress nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees in most of the 23 categories were chosen by specific branches of
the Academy's 5,300 members, such as actors, directors and film editors. Some
nominations, including documentaries and foreign-language films, were selected
by special screening committees, while all Academy members were allowed to cast
votes for best-picture nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   The full Academy membership is eligible to vote in all categories for the
awards themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscars will be presented March 26 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles and broadcast on ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Billy Crystal, who has been emcee for six past Oscar shows, will return as
host after turning the job over to Whoopi Goldberg last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Actor, director and producer Warren Beatty will receive the Academy's Irving
G. Thalberg award, which is presented to producers whose work represents a
"consistently high quality of motion picture production."

<HEADLINE> Farm Raises Yaks, Camels for Wool  </HEADLINE>
    By TRUDY TYNAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAWLEY, Mass. (AP) -- For fancy yarns, it takes some fancy animals. That's
why passersby in these parts see a trio of shaggy, two-humped camels stepping
nonchalantly around a snow-covered New England hillside.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tregellys Fiber Farm in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts is raising
Bactrian camels and yaks, as well as more common critters such as llamas,
Icelandic sheep and Angora goats, for their wool.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a real market niche for our products," said Jody Cothey, who owns
the farm with her husband, Ed. "It provides us with a way to reclaim this old
farm."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cotheys' place on Hawk Mountain is an eye-catching evolution in a state
where colonial woolen mills launched the nation's textile industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the yarns spun from the exotic wools are colored with organic dyes
in the basement of the farmhouse by their business partner. They then go to the
fashion designer market or folks handy enough to knit their own versions of a
designer sweater.
</P>
<P>
	   Jody Cothey says she envisioned a place in the country with room for their
dogs and cats when they first bought the overgrown former potato farm. The
farm's name is Cornish for "Hidden Homestead."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband added to their assortment of animals when he traded a wood
chipper for two milk goats. Then he came home from a local fair with some Angora
goats and discovered he had a knack for weaving wool as well as fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
	   And then they expanded from llamas to alpacas, yaks and camels.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were middle-agers basically starting over with a new life," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Native to the frigid Mongolian desert and equipped with a fuzzy undercoat of
insulating wool, the Bactrian camels aren't at all bothered by the cold, said
Ed, who was a commercial fisherman. It is the soft undercoat, shed during warmer
weather, that is spun into yarn, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like furry Jell-O," his wife said, reaching up to pat a hump as the
camels -- Bob, Billy and Belinda -- pressed close to the fence.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cotheys' nine Royal Pinto yaks -- bred from Himalayan stock for the
prized white wool in their mixed brown and white coats -- seemed more at home
munching hay against a backdrop of hills rolling north into Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   As with the camels, it is the fine undercoat shed in spring that is spun
into wool. Unspun wool is used for high-end clown wigs.
</P>
<P>
	   Their herd also includes tiny brown and white polka-dotted Jacob's sheep;
Icelandic sheep, which look like barrels of fuzz topped by quotation mark horns;
yellow-eyed, four-horned Navaho-Churro sheep; alpacas and llamas in every hue,
and White Galloway cattle, raised for their meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 1,000 pounds of wool the Cotheys' animals produce annually comes
from their 110 curly-haired Angora goats, whose fleece is spun into mohair and
mohair blends.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the 130-acre farm, which they eventually hope to open to the public,
hasn't been cheap to establish. And after seven years, they have yet to recoup
their $1.5 million investment in barns, corrals and animals. Yaks sell for
$5,000 and up, Ed Cothey said, while camels cost about $12,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "For my whole life I've been financially secure," said Jody. "But, I've
always felt a responsibility to give something back. Reclaiming this old farm
provides me with that opportunity."

<HEADLINE> Virginia family sues Beth Israel for relative's autopsy, pauper's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - When someone from Beth Israel Hospital called a Virginia
man and asked him to rate the facility's care of his dead son, there was one
major problem.
<P>
	   The hospital had failed to tell the father that his son was hospitalized,
let alone dead, according to documents filed last week in Manhattan State
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was obviously an extremely shocking and horrible way for the family to
discover that their close relative had died," the Bowman family said in the
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bowmans have filed a $13 million lawsuit charging that Beth Israel
conducted an unauthorized autopsy on Lewis Bowman Jr., buried him in a pauper's
grave and failed to tell them he was dead even though he had identified his
father as his next of kin.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman, who was a 47-year-old brick layer, died in the hospital of pulmonary
embolism, a blood clot in a lung, on Aug. 14, 1998. But his father didn't
receive the call until Feb. 9, 1999, court papers say.
</P>
<P>
	   Will Shewmake, the family's lawyer in Richmond, Va., said Beth Israel failed
to contact the family even though Bowman had given his father's name as the
relative to be notified in case of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   When the family received Bowman's body, it had been mutilated in an autopsy,
to which the family objects on religious grounds, and had decomposed so badly
that the family could not have an open-casket funeral.
</P>
<P>
	   Beth Israel spokesman Jim Mandler issued a statement:
</P>
<P>
	   "The medical center is deeply sorry that the family members in Virginia were
not notified of the death of our patient Lewis Bowman Jr. Our sympathy is
extended to the Bowman family for their loss."
</P>
<P>
	   The statement added: "Upon learning of this situation, we worked with the
family to make appropriate reburial arrangements, for which the medical center
assumed full financial responsibility."
</P>
<P>
	   Shewmake said Bowman had come to New York City to look for work. His family
last heard from him when he told them he was staying with a friend, Shewmake
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowman's father, Lewis Bowman Sr., who had cancer, died July 31, 1999,
before the family got his son's body back for burial in the family plot near
Richmond, Shewmake said.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's court papers accuse Beth Israel of violating the law by
performing an autopsy on Lewis Bowman Jr.'s body without notifying the next of
kin.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, which names seven family members as plaintiffs, asks $3 million
in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages for negligence and
for the unauthorized performance of an autopsy.

<HEADLINE> Mummy portraits at once Greek, Roman and Egyptian at New York's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In an ancient and most cosmopolitan world, Egyptian,
Roman and Greek mingled in a rich cultural and artistic tapestry long overlooked
by Western scholars.
<P>
	   But this is changing with the opening today of "Ancient Faces: Mummy
Portraits of Roman Egypt," the first major U.S. exhibit devoted to the mummy art
of Roman Egypt, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we want to show you is something perhaps a bit unusual. We show you
the meeting of two cultures: Greek culture, which then goes into the Roman, and
the ancient Egyptian culture," said Dorothea Arnold, co-curator of the show,
which covers the first through the third centuries A.D.
</P>
<P>
	   The mix produces faces that look almost modern European, but they were
painted to decorate caskets for mummies. In some cases, the figures wear Roman
dress but are set among ancient Egyptian gods.
</P>
<P>
	   "These paintings, which belong in this amazing time when the cultures blend,
have for a long time not really been recognized as the important art they are,"
Arnold said. "It was difficult to understand and people didn't put together the
different sides of this mixed multicultural society."
</P>
<P>
	   A single empire stretched from Aswan, Egypt, in the south, as far north as
Britain, and from Morocco east to Syria and the easternmost shores of the Black
Sea. In Egypt, it was a prosperous time when people of Greek origin adopted
Egyptian traditions, and many Egyptians adopted Greek and Roman ways.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Greek influence was really gaining ground ... especially artistically,
but the Pharaonic culture was there, and this was still Egypt," Arnold, the
museum's curator of Egyptian Art, said. "The ideas of the afterlife really
continued inside the new style, taken over from the Greek and Roman."
</P>
<P>
	   The unique art form of mummy portraiture flourished in Roman Egypt.
Stylistically related to Greco-Roman painting, it was created for a typically
Egyptian purpose: Inclusion in the funerary trappings of mummies.
</P>
<P>
	   The paintings, many on limewood or on linen shrouds, use both Egyptian and
Greco-Roman techniques - and often a combination of the two. And the strongly
naturalistic images show complexions ranging from dark with African features to
the palest of white, reflecting the melting pot that was the Egypt of that
period.
</P>
<P>
	   While the clothing, hair and jewelry imitate the fashions of imperial Rome,
the mummification and accompanying views of the afterlife are Egyptian - and
there are repeated references to Egyptian gods.
</P>
<P>
	   A sculpture of the falcon-headed god Horus, featuring an Egyptian-looking
face with a beak and Egyptian eyes, is dressed in Roman garb. Realistic
feathered-looking armor melds gently into the feathers of a surrealistic bird
head.
</P>
<P>
	   "At work people would speak in Greek, they would use Egyptian at home with
their families and if there was some sort of political event, the language would
be Latin," said Susan Walker, of the British Museum's Department of Greek and
Roman Antiquities, who edited the show's catalog.
</P>
<P>
	   The naturalism of the faces, in which personalities come through clearly,
combines eerily with the exhibit's daily household items - a toy horse, dice,
bright green-blue vases, simple wood furniture and paintings from homes, one
even in its original frame - to bring the period to life.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's works, which include 70 of the finest mummy portraits from
European and North American collections, will be on view through May 7. Because
many of the panels are so delicate, the show will not travel beyond New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But luckily for museum visitors, the exhibit is a taste of things to come.
It is the first step toward the opening in two years of a large new gallery at
the museum devoted exclusively to Roman Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope we will be able to show the paintings as you see them now," Arnold
said.

<HEADLINE> High Stakes for McCain, Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The first face-to-face meeting since the New
Hampshire primary is also the last before South Carolina votes, and John McCain
and George W. Bush have different challenges in their debate tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   For McCain, it's to regain the high ground as a reformer after being pounded
on his record by Bush and running a negative ad against him.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bush, it's to maintain the pressure on McCain without appearing too
negative himself and alienating groups such as women and independents in
Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the Texas governor said he planned to dig into McCain's record on
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Los Angeles Times poll found the race between the two Republican
presidential contenders to be a statistical dead heat among likely voters. Bush
leads McCain by more than 2-to-1 among conservative Republicans, while McCain
leads Bush by the same margin among moderate independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute debate, sponsored by the South Carolina Business and Industry
Political Education Committee, also includes the third candidate left in the
race, radio talk show host Alan Keyes. It is being broadcast live on CNN with
Larry King as moderator.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, a Bush backer, said despite
the stakes, he didn't expect the debate to change many minds -- unless one of
the candidates makes a major gaffe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lot of McCain mania after New Hampshire,'' Condon said.
``What's happened since then is people have done something I knew they would do:
They are looking at the people and the issues from what some call a Republican
point of view but what I call a conservative base.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush and McCain campaigns tried to strengthen weak spots Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bush focused on education as an issue that could appeal to moderates,
particularly women. Advisers were fretting over internal polling indicating that
Bush's sharp attacks on McCain may be hurting him with women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   --McCain began rebroadcasting two TV commercials that tout his conservative
credentials, including one that notes his anti-abortion voting record and
efforts to take pornography off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week he stopped showing an ad that challenged Bush's truthfulness after
it was panned by several top Republicans. The senator also said he would not use
negative ads for the rest of the primary battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has criticized McCain for inconsistency on public financing of
congressional campaigns, which McCain says he opposes but has voted for as part
of reform packages.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has been trying to brand Bush as a negative campaigner, said of
his opponent's criticism: ``This kind of savagery is not necessary in an
American political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about McCain's complaint during a news conference in Saluda, Bush
said: ``How can you call it savagery if the man made five votes, legitimate
votes on the floor of the Senate? It's not savagery; it's what we call full
exposure, full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had his own complaints about McCain's campaigning, especially his
appeals to independents and even Democrats to vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are welcome to come into the party, that's fine with me,'' Bush
said. ``I just don't want Democrats coming in to vote against me because they
think my opponent will be easier to beat in November. We're trying to get rid of
the Clinton era, not reinforce it.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain hopes a win Saturday will boost him into the Feb. 22 Arizona and
Michigan primaries, and then into the March 7 ``Super Tuesday'' contests.
</P>
<P>
	   On that day, voting in heavily populated states like California and New York
will award almost 60 percent of the total needed for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No matter what happens we're both going on to Michigan, Arizona and March
7,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bush, South Carolina represents his line of defense, his ``firewall,''
to stop McCain's march. The governor has already won the Iowa caucuses and
Delaware primary; McCain routed him in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Rights Group Endorses Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is being endorsed by the nation's
top abortion-rights group, which has abandoned its neutrality in the Democratic
presidential contest in hopes of ending questions about Gore's mixed record on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League, was appearing with Gore this afternoon at a Washington hotel to
deliver the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   The backing will give Gore a boost on what's been one of his most vulnerable
issues in the battle with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have been courting core Democratic voters, including
blacks and women, where Gore holds a strong lead over Bradley, according to
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from the NARAL endorsement, Gore also was discussing his education
plans at a Baltimore college, his second straight day on the issue. He promoted
his ideas for tuition tax credits and savings accounts in a speech Monday at the
University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, was pursuing another core Democratic constituency --
organized labor -- with an address to the Teamsters conference in Atlantic City,
N.J. While most national unions have endorsed Gore, the Teamsters have stayed
neutral.
</P>
<P>
	   The endorsement for Gore was the second time in a week that he picked up
support from a group that had planned to stay neutral in the Democratic race.
Gore wrung a similar nod last week from the Human Rights Campaign, a large gay
rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   NARAL's endorsement came after a weekend of discussion, said spokeswoman
Julie Piscitelli. ``After two days of thoughtful discussion and deliberation by
our board, they voted unanimously to endorse Gore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Michelman has said both Gore and Bradley are reliable
supporters of abortion rights. ``American women can count on either one of
them,'' she said last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also has expressed confidence in Gore's support for abortion rights now,
even though he cast a series of anti-abortion votes when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign was disappointed by the news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It really sends a very bad message to officeholders about what they can
expect to get from NARAL,'' said Rep. Diane DeGette, D-Colo., a Bradley
supporter. ``The message is, 'We're going to do whatever's politically expedient
for us at the time.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion often is an issue in Republican presidential primaries, with
candidates trying to prove they are sufficiently against it. But rarely has the
issue so sharply divided Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has said he's always believed abortion should be legal, saying he only
had reservations in the past about government paying for abortions for poor
women in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   But as details of his record emerged, he was forced to admit that his
position has changed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, he said in a letter to a constituent that abortion was ``arguably
the taking of a human life.'' And in 1984, he voted to define the word
``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include ``unborn children
from the moment of conception.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has tried to capitalize on the issue. He ran a TV ad in New
Hampshire calling himself the only presidential candidate who ``has been
pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has responded with a slew of endorsements from feminist leaders and
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bradley was on the offensive again on health care, accusing Gore
of employing ``scare tactics'' to discredit his health care plan. Gore had told
a San Francisco newspaper that Bradley's plan would leave people with diseases
such as AIDS without coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``should be ashamed,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also said the vice president's leadership on the environment -- one
of Gore's signature issues -- has been little more than ``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said his organization will
not endorse during the primaries. Bradley and Gore have similar plans for the
environment, he said, and neither has offered the sweeping blueprint that would
earn the club's support.

22 Killed by Tornadoes in Georgia

<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 were
hurt after tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday, ripping people
from their beds and piling up mobile homes. Dozens of houses and mobile homes in
the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened, their metal and siding
mangled and strewn across yards and streets. The tornadoes struck shortly after
midnight as a line of thunderstorms rumbled through the Southeast, scarring
property from Arkansas to Georgia. President Clinton asked Americans to pray for
the tornado victims and said the loss of life "is unusual and terrible."

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The first face-to-face meeting since the New

and George W. Bush have different challenges in their debate Tuesday. For
McCain, it's to regain the high ground as a reformer after being pounded on his
record by Bush and running a negative ad against him. For Bush, it's to maintain
the pressure on McCain without appearing too negative himself and alienating
groups such as women and independents in Saturday's vote. Aides to the Texas

Blacks, Glaucoma Surgery Studied

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of Medicare claims found that blacks were only half
as likely as whites to undergo surgery for glaucoma, the most common cause of
blindness in black Americans. The researchers, whose study appears in the
February issue of Archives of Ophthalmology, said the reasons could include lack
of health-care access, inadequate education about the disease, overtreatment of
whites and racial bias. An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, the
nation's second-leading cause of irreversible vision loss. The researchers noted
that more than $1 billion is spent on federal aid yearly to about 120,000 blind
glaucoma patients.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Files Lawsuit Against Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge is gathering evidence in a $100 million
lawsuit filed by former hostage Terry Anderson against the Iranian government.
Anderson's case is being heard as an effort builds in Congress to make it easier
for victims of state-sponsored terrorism to collect such judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press
and the longest-held American hostage in Lebanon, accuses Iran of financing and
directing the Beirut terrorists who kept him shackled and blindfolded for nearly
seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   He will testify at a two-day hearing before U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson that begins today.
</P>
<P>
	   His captors were members of Hezbollah, or Party of God, ``a
politico-paramilitary terrorist organization operating in Lebanon'' sponsored
and directed by Iran, Anderson's lawsuit asserts.
</P>
<P>
	   It was filed last March under a 1996 law that allows claims by American
citizens and their families against assets of foreign countries that sponsor
terrorism -- if the actions resulted in personal injury or death.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, no money has been collected under that act. That's because the
Clinton administration, while initially supporting the law, has declined to help
successful U.S. plaintiffs collect.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson hopes that may soon change.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Clinton administration is supposed to assist in finding Iranian
assets,'' he said. ``In general, they've said they're willing to do this. But
there's still a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's case follows an August 1998 federal court order for Iran to pay
$65 million in damages to fellow American hostages David Jacobsen, Joseph
Cicippio and Frank Reed, and the wives of Cicippio and Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, they have not collected a cent.
</P>
<P>
	   Others have also been frustrated under the 1996 law, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The families of four men who were killed in 1996 when Cuban military jets
shot down two unarmed civilian planes.
</P>
<P>
	   --The family of Alisa Flatow, 20, of West Orange, N.J., a student at a
seminary in Jerusalem killed April 9, 1995 in an attack on a bus in the Gaza
Strip. Seven Israeli soldiers also died in the attack for which Islamic Jihad
claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Two senators are pushing bipartisan legislation that would establish a
better mechanism for tapping into frozen assets to help satisfy such claims
while still seeking to meet the administration's principal objection: that
diplomatic properties -- such as former embassies -- not be among the assets
tapped.
</P>
<P>
	   The senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, and Republican Connie
Mack of Florida, also sponsored similar legislation last year but it was
withdrawn in last-minute budget pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, sponsors say they are better organized and getting an earlier start.
``We have strong bipartisan support. We think we can move it,'' said Mack's
spokeswoman Nancy Segerdehal.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson has been lending his support to the effort on behalf of the Beirut
hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Anderson has met Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart
Eizenstat, who oversees compensation programs, in search of common ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the administration previously opposed the Lautenberg-Mack
legislation, Eizenstat seemed receptive to finding ``alternate ways'' to help
terrorism victims and their families, said Anderson's lawyer, Karen Hastie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to see if there are frozen commercial assets that Iran has
that could be tapped for compensation,'' Williams said. Eizenstat declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, his wife Madeleine Bassil, and their daughter Sulome Anderson were
to testify on how the hostage ordeal affected their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   To testify Wednesday on the role of overseas journalists are CBS Evening
News anchor Dan Rather and Gene Roberts, former managing editor of The New York
Times and chairman of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, former diplomat Robert B. Oakley was to testify about the Iranian
government's support of Hezbollah and its role in the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States froze Iranian assets valued at $12 billion in 1979. Most
of the funds, however, are controlled by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal
in The Hague, Netherlands, which decides claims against both Iran and the United
States. The United States itself has jurisdiction over only a small fraction of
the assets, mostly real estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, now 52 and teaching journalism at Ohio University, was taken
captive in Beirut on March 16, 1985. Held longer than any other American in
Lebanon, he was freed 2,454 days later, on Dec. 4, 1991.

<HEADLINE> Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a dozen suspect parts from MD-80 series
airplanes are heading for a federal aviation safety lab in Washington for study
aiming to prevent another crash like that of Alaska Airlines Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines were ordered to inspect the stabilizer control mechanism in almost
1,100 planes after problems were found in that part of the Alaska Airlines MD-83
that crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew lost control of that plane while trying to fix a problem with the
stabilizer, a tail part that controls the plane's up-and-down motion. The
control is similar in MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, the types of
planes inspected under Federal Aviation Administration orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines were given 72 hours Friday to inspect the planes, which meant the
work was to have been completed Monday. Final reports may not be completed for a
day or so.
</P>
<P>
	   In Southern California, the Ventura County medical examiner reported Monday
that 47 bodies from the downed plane had been positively identified, and
families were being notified.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Monday, the FAA said 13 suspect jackscrews had been removed from
planes and sent to Washington, where the FAA was to turn them over to the
National Transportation Safety Board for analysis.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB spokesman Terry Williams said agency technicians are studying the parts
for wear and signs of damage to determine if recommendations are needed for more
frequent maintenance and parts inspection.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrew is a long, threaded piece of metal that turns to move a nut up
and down. The movement raises and lowers the stabilizer, moving the plane's nose
up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   The replaced jackscrews were found to have grit or metal shavings in their
lubricant, FAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others were being evaluated to determine if replacement was needed, and
three merely needed to be relubricated, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB also is studying maintenance records of this type of plane. The
agency noted that two years ago the jackscrew on the crashed plane was scheduled
for replacement during an inspection, but a recheck determined it operated
within allowable limits. It was left in service and had been rechecked several
times since and passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of this information is continuing to be evaluated by the
NTSB. No determination has been made as to whether this information has any
bearing on the accident,'' the safety board said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to ordering the urgent inspections, the FAA increased the
frequency of regular jackscrew inspections from every eight months to about
every three months.
</P>
<P>
	   The exact number of planes subject to inspection was not clear. The FAA
initially said Monday that 1,027 planes were involved, but later the figure rose
to 1,098.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has also been checking its C-9 planes, the military version of
the DC-9. No problems have been found during inspections of the 29 C-9 aircraft
operated by the Navy and Marine Corps, said Navy spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force spokesman Capt. Brad Jessmer said all of his service's operational
C-9s had passed inspection, while the planes currently down for maintenance
still have to be checked.

<HEADLINE> Tester Says Pentagon Moves Too Fast  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is rushing too rapidly toward recommending
to President Clinton whether a national defense against long-range missile
attack should be deployed, the Defense Department's chief weapons tester said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report Monday to Congress and Defense Secretary William Cohen, Philip
E. Coyle questioned Cohen's plan to review the readiness of the missile defense
project in June. On the basis of that review, Cohen is to recommend to the
president whether to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   The schedule for a June review puts ``unrealistic pressure'' on the
project's managers, Coyle wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   As envisioned by the Pentagon, the system would use a network of radars and
silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and shoot down long-range
ballistic missiles outside Earth's atmosphere. Congress has required the
administration to deploy such a system as soon as technology allows.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Cohen so far has said he intends to stick to the June timetable,
Coyle wrote that ``undue pressure has been placed on the program to meet an
artificial decision point in the development process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading critic of
national missile defense, said of Coyle's conclusion: ``He's exactly right.''
Collina credited Coyle with ``very interesting honesty'' in telling Congress and
Cohen that the timetable for decisions on missile defense has become too
compressed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far two tests have been staged of the system's ability to intercept a
target missile in space. The first, last fall, succeeded. The second, in
January, failed.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test -- scheduled as the last before the June readiness review --
is unlikely to take place before mid-May, although no firm date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the failure of the January test, Coyle said, more time should be
allowed for analyzing results of the next test before Cohen determines what to
recommend to the president. He did not specify how much more time was needed,
but normal analysis takes two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus if the next test were in May, the review in preparation for a
recommendation to Clinton would not be done before July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would provide a clear technical understanding of the results and
avoid forcing the (readiness review) before the analysis is complete,'' Coyle
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has budgeted $12.7 billion for the national missile defense
project over the next five years. Coyle's report says that if the system is
deployed in 2005, as specified in the current schedule, the total cost --
development, production, construction and operating it for 20 years -- would be
$26.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Social Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton shifted course on Social Security
reform, promising to sign a separate Republican bill to do away with an earnings
limit affecting hundreds of thousands of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said Monday. ``Let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's support gives powerful momentum to an election-year drive to
eliminate the earnings penalty, which takes $1 in Social Security benefits from
older Americans for every $3 they earn over a prescribed limit, currently
$17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans already were introducing a repeal bill and promised to put
it on a fast track for a vote, likely in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm thrilled by this. I hope this is just the beginning of a signal from
them that they're willing to work on this whole Social Security area,'' Clinton
said during an interview with CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has advocated eliminating the earnings limit before, but only
as part of a comprehensive plan dealing with the threat of Social Security
insolvency as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the Social Security earnings limit is an issue dear to the hearts
of older Americans, an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in
their struggle for control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 seniors lose part or all of their benefits because of the
earnings limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. The
earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost roughly $22.7 billion over 10 years,
according to GOP estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --said he thinks ``the United States can do business'' with acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't agree with him on everything, but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --said the United States has to strike ``a delicate balance'' in dealing
with Austria, voicing disapproval of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party
without doing ``anything that builds his support even further.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the
United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive
rhetoric,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --said he is optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle East. He
acknowledged, however, that ``we're in a little tough patch right now'' with a
freeze in talks between Israel and Syria, a missed deadline for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace framework and fresh violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're down to the hard decisions,'' the president said. He added: ``We're
so close on the substance that I am optimistic.''

unsuccessfully tried to shut the facility down.

Processors Inc. plant in Dallas Nov. 30, effectively closing the facility, but
was forced to send them back when a judge granted a temporary restraining order.
The plant had failed a series of salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef will be allowed to resume sales of ground beef to the federal
school lunch program. Supreme Beef was one of the program's largest suppliers
until USDA cut off purchases at the same time it tried to close the facility.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA officials said Monday that the plant has modified its pathogen control
plan to prevent salmonella contamination. Inspectors ``will closely monitor the
implementation'' and conduct another round of salmonella testing, said Thomas
Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef says that it was not responsible for the salmonella and that
the government had no right to shut it down. The company has no plans to drop a
lawsuit against USDA that is scheduled to go to trial in May, said the firm's
president, Steven F. Spiritas.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef had agreed to make the changes it is making before USDA tried
to shut the plant down, he said.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Tied To Gulf Coast Lightning  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of lightning more than doubled along the U.S.
Gulf coast during the 1997-98 El Nino, a discovery that could help planners
looking ahead to the next such event.
</P>
<P>
	   The area with heavy lightning increased sharply during December 1997 through
February 1998, and the number of days with lightning in the region more than
doubled, according to a paper appearing in today's edition of Geophysical
Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the amount of wintertime lightning along the Gulf coast in that
period was comparable to summer in such spots as the Amazon basin and central
Africa, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding the impacts of phenomena like El Nino can help improve
forecasting and assist people and businesses in coping with weather, said Steven
J. Goodman of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, many airline routes cross the northern Gulf and an airline
knowing there is an increased threat of storms may choose to fly further inland
for a few months, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anything involving transportation in the Gulf is going to be impacted,
helicopters going to oil wells, ships,'' said Goodman, lead author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers found that there were 33 days with lightning recorded during
the 1997-98 winter in the northern Gulf, compared with 15 days in other winters.
</P>
<P>
	   The 33 days is comparable to the number of summertime thunderstorm days in
localized regions of the world's most active thunderstorm hotspots in the Amazon
basin, central Africa and northwest Australia, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
	   During those 33 days, the network of ground sensors and satellites counted
138 hours of lightning, compared with 50 hours in other recent winters.
</P>
<P>
	   Dividing the study region into 30-by-30 nautical mile squares, the
scientists recorded as many as 5,000 lightning strikes per box in the most
intense region, he said. A nautical mile is 1.15 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   The area of heaviest lightning ranged from eastern Texas near Houston,
across the northern Gulf nearly to Tampa, Fla., Goodman explained in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   By comparison, in other years only a small area near the
Louisiana-Mississippi border managed that many strikes and in some years no area
recorded that many, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   El Nino, a periodic warming of the surface waters of the eastern Pacific
Ocean, can affect the weather worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   In this case, the researchers said, it altered the high-level jet stream
that directs the movement of storms making that wind stronger than usual and
directing it to the south toward the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
	   From a typical speed of around 90 mph the jet stream increased to more than
130 mph that winter.
</P>
<P>
	   And Goodman said the branch of the jet stream which normally moves west to
east at about the latitude of northern Virginia in winter was even farther south
than in other El Nino years, when it has dipped to northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   It resulted in a sharp increase in the number of storms in the Gulf region
where land-sea differences in warmth and moisture breed instability in the air.
The 20 winter cyclones and cold frontal passages identified within the Gulf
between Dec. 1997 and Feb. 1998 was the highest number of such systems since
1987, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That winter it seemed like every few days another storm went through and
it struck me as being unusual,'' Goodman said. ``But it wasn't until we looked
at the data that we found it was pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the U.S. Gulf Coast states had the sharpest jump in lightning days,
the team found smaller increases in other areas, including southeast China
through the Taiwan Straight and in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   That three-month period was summer in the southern hemisphere. Some
increases in lightning were also noted there, including northeast Argentina and
southern Brazil, the southern coast of Indonesia, Papua-New Guinea and northern
Australia.

<HEADLINE> Plan OKs Unlimited Crop Subsidies  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new program that will let farmers skirt restrictions on
crop subsidies could mean millions of dollars going to as many as 2,600 of the
nation's biggest producers.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers who have reached the payment limit will be allowed to take crop
subsidies in certificates, instead of cash, which they can redeem for
government-held commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   The program effectively abolishes the current $150,000-per-farmer limit on
crop subsidies, which already was doubled from $75,000 last year, critics say.
The subsidy program pays farmers the difference between the market price of
major commodities and government-set minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What it comes down to again is that we're going to subsidize some of the
biggest farmers in the country to drive others out of business,'' said Chuck
Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   Among operations that stand to benefit most, according to Agriculture
Department officials, is cotton giant J.G. Boswell Co., which controls an
estimated 160,000 acres in California's San Joaquin Valley. At current subsidy
rates, a cotton farm can reach the $150,000 payment limit with fewer than 1,000
acres. All major commodities would be eligible for the certificate program.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress authorized the program last fall, and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said Monday that he agreed to implement it under pressure from
lawmakers. ``The certificate program is one that the Congress is very clear they
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's advisers said he had little choice but to approve the program,
given the bipartisan congressional support for it and the possibility that
farmers facing the payment limit would otherwise forfeit up to a million bales
of cotton to the government this year.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA rules allow farmers to put crops under short-term federal loans and
forfeit the commodity to the government instead of repaying the loan. Farmers
would make a profit off the forfeiture -- which doesn't count toward the
$150,000 subsidy limit -- because the market value of the crop is less than the
value of the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cotton Council, which led lobbying for the certificate program,
argued that it would provide for a more orderly marketing of the cotton than
dumping it on the government, which would have sold it later, possibly
depressing prices. The government also would save on storage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From our perspective the best bet for all producers is to get the cotton
out into the market,'' said Bill Gillon, a spokesman for the cotton group.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of agreeing to issue the certificates, Glickman should have
tightened the loan program to make it less advantageous for farmers to forfeit
their crops, Hassebrook said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's decision comes when he is pushing Congress to put more
restrictions on government farm payments and target assistance to small and
medium-sized aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Collins, USDA's chief economist, acknowledged that the certificate
program would do just the opposite. ``There's no doubt it's a concern. Here the
secretary has been advocating a tight payment limit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA estimates that 2,600 farms nationwide will reach the $150,000 cap this
year.

<HEADLINE> ABA OKs Political Contribution Rule  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- The American Bar Association, spurred by a federal regulator,
has adopted an ethics rule forbidding lawyers from making political
contributions as a way to get government work.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents said the new rule, targeting a practice known as ``pay to play,''
will chill free-speech rights and prove unenforceable. But Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, contended that investor
confidence was at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By voting to end pay to play, America' lawyers today demonstrated bold and
inspired leadership on a pressing ethical issue,'' Levitt said Monday after the
ABA's policy-making House of Delegates voted 266-157 to adopt the model rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This vote reaffirms the belief that competence, not connections, should be
the rule when awarding government contracts,'' Levitt added, calling on state
bar associations to also approve the provision.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Levitt has warned against letting money managers make campaign
donations to state and local officials who oversee public employee pension funds
that hold more than $2 trillion in assets nationwide. Such funds should be
managed by those most qualified, and not those with the strongest political
ties, he has said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new ABA rule, which state regulators will be asked to adopt, does not
prohibit all political contributions by lawyers. It states: ``A lawyer or law
firm shall not accept a government legal engagement or an appointment by a judge
if the lawyer or law firm makes a political contribution or solicits political
contributions for the purpose of obtaining or being considered for that type of
legal engagement or appointment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville lawyer Barbara Mayden, a prime supporter of the rule, said
government officials, including elected judges, have imposed ``a black eye on
the profession'' by requiring lawyers to make contributions ``just to get in the
ballgame'' and have a chance of securing government business.
</P>
<P>
	   It is short of bribery, she said, but unseemly nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Fox called the rule ``bad public policy,''
and noted the ABA already had condemned pay to play.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The world will know that lawyers looked at this rule and saw it was deeply
flawed,'' he said. ``The chilling effect of this rule on lawyers will be
profound ... every time one considers making a political contribution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo, N.Y., lawyer Sharon Gerstman, another opponent, called the rule
``overbroad,'' and said it would call legitimate contributions into question.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABA's 530-member House of Delegates had rejected the same rule last
August, by a 164-146 vote.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Sam Sheppard's Trial Resumes  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The guilt or innocence of Dr. Sam Sheppard is once again
the subject of a courtroom drama.
</P>
<P>
	   But this time, Sheppard, whose case was the inspiration for television
series and movie ``The Fugitive,'' is not on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, his son, Sam Reese Sheppard, has sued the state of Ohio, alleging
his late father unjustly spent 10 years in prison before his conviction for the
beating death of his pregnant wife was overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   Opening statements and testimony began on Monday. The first witness was
famed defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, who recounted his efforts to clear the
doctor's name in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Marilyn Sheppard was killed on July 4, 1954, at the family home on Lake
Erie.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor initially was convicted of murder. But the U.S. Supreme Court,
after hearing arguments from Bailey, overturned the verdict because of the
affects of pretrial publicity on jurors and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966 and died four years later.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took Sheppard's case in 1961, Bailey said, he was angry about the
injustices done to the doctor and wanted to ``take a chip out of the seal of the
great state of Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Bailey, under cross-examination that is expected to continue today, also
said he disagrees with Sheppard's son about who the real killer is.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert said in opening statements that recent DNA
will show that someone other than the Sheppards bled in the bedroom where she
was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are here to prove once and for all that Dr. Sheppard was innocent of
the murder of his wife,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert also said he will try to show that Richard Eberling, a former window
washer for the Sheppards, is the most likely suspect. Eberling died in 1998
while serving a life sentence for another murder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes things go very, very wrong and lives are ruined. When the state
makes a mistake it should be held accountable,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   County prosecutors, who are representing the state, said the Sheppards'
marriage was strained badly by the doctor's repeated and widely known
extramarital affairs. The weekend of her murder, Mrs. Sheppard was angry with
her husband because a house guest had been speaking openly about one of the
doctor's lovers, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors argued that the nature of Mrs. Sheppard's death -- she was
hit 27 times on the head and face with a blunt object -- indicate the actions of
someone in a rage, not a sexual assailant or a burglar.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor William Mason made his point by pounding some rolled-up paper
into his hand and counting the blows up to 27.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know what lit the match, but something caused the powder keg of
marital conflict to blow early on the morning of July 4,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert said the Sheppards' marriage was basically happy and said the couple
was ``ecstatic'' over the Mrs. Sheppard's second pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey, the Sheppard team's opening witness, recounted how he took over the
doctor's case in 1961 and was able to establish that Sheppard's chances for a
fair trial were destroyed in 1954 by newspaper articles and broadcast reports
demanding his arrest and conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Cross-examination from Assistant County Prosecutor Steve Dever focused on
Bailey's theory that the Sheppards' neighbors, Spencer and Esther Houk, were
responsible for Mrs. Sheppard's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey suggested in 1966 that Mrs. Houk might have delivered the fatal blows
to Mrs. Sheppard after catching Houk having sex with her. Bailey said he knew of
Eberling but did not consider him a likely suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not then, or at any time since, form a belief that Richard Eberling
killed Marilyn Sheppard,'' Bailey said.

<HEADLINE> Sweeney Defends Gore Endorsement  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Brushing aside indications that Republican John McCain
has some backing within labor's rank-and-file, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney
has reasserted staunch support for Al Gore's Democratic presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters at the opening of this week's meeting of the AFL-CIO's
governing body, Sweeney said, ``We're confident that the endorsement was the way
that a significant majority of our members wanted to go.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not long before Sweeney's remarks, the head of the Service Employees
International Union had said enough of his union's members have been interested
in McCain that the union considered officially recommending him as an
alternative to the vice president for its Republican and independent members.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Stern, president of the SEIU, noted that the union ultimately did not
take that step and that it has endorsed only Gore. McCain did however, meet with
the union's members in New Hampshire, where he won the Republican presidential
primary last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And we'll still do that'' in other states, said Stern. ``Our members
aren't monolithic. They vote on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney still hasn't brought two key affiliates into line behind the labor
federation's endorsement of Gore. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and
the United Auto Workers have so far remained neutral.
</P>
<P>
	   They are expected to get on board eventually. But in the meantime, some of
their members have campaigned for Gore's challenger for the Democratic
nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, in the nation's earliest
primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney disputed the existence of any significant labor movement support for
McCain -- something that McCain's Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
has alleged in recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think John McCain has been anti-worker, anti-working families' agenda,
throughout his whole career in the United States Senate,'' Sweeney said. As an
example, Sweeney said McCain has opposed increases in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the Democratic side, we have two good people. We think Al Gore is the
better of the two,'' said the AFL-CIO president. ``We believe that we're going
to be able to mobilize rank-and-file workers and activists across the country to
be engaged in their communities and their workplaces around the election of Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO council has scheduled a closed-door meeting with Gore on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to politics, the labor leaders who sit on the executive council
are devoting much of this week's discussions to organizing priorities for the
new year. This includes a campaign to unionize hospitality workers here, where
hotel profits swell around this time each year as Mardi Gras nears.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hotel workers in New Orleans ... are at the heart of challenges facing
unions. While New Orleans hotels are among the most profitable in America, the
city's hospitality workers are among the worst paid in the nation,'' Sweeney
said.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO organizing director Kirk Adams said unions are trying to top last
year's net gain of 265,000 cardholders -- 600,000 total new members minus union
jobs lost and retirements.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a 20-year record, but Adams said it's not good enough if labor
wants to improve the proportion of union to nonunion workers. About 13.9 percent
of workers are unionized.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to do about a million a year to gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Orleans, just one of the city's many hotels bustling with carnival
gawkers is unionized -- the Fairmont, where AFL-CIO leaders are meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracy Lawson, earning $5.95 an hour as a room service waitress at the posh
Windsor Court a few blocks away, said of hotel visitors: ``They don't know
what's going on inside the building, how we are being mistreated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, ongoing union organizing battles include flight attendants at
Delta Air Lines, health care workers at Catholic hospitals in California and New
York, and construction workers who are more often working for temporary agencies
without benefits because of the recent building boom.
</P>
<P>
	   AFL-CIO treasurer Richard Trumka said the federation is also considering
ways of using the clout of union pension funds as major corporate stockholders
to influence contract talks and organizing drives at companies including Boeing,
Sprint and General Electric.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Test Delays Draw Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of moderate Democrats is unhappy with the
Education Department's decision to give colleges an extra year to issue report
cards on the performance of graduates in state teacher-licensing exams.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporting of exam scores was to have begun in April under a 1998 student
aid law. The law additionally requires states to identify colleges that
consistently produce poor teaching candidates and allows the department to
withhold aid from programs that don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Education Department needs more time to create a single reporting
system covering the varying state examinations, said Lee Fritschler, Education
Secretary Richard Riley's deputy for higher education deputy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, 32 Democrats, members of a centrist coalition, wrote to Riley
seeking an explanation for the delay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The report card doesn't create any new tests or impose any new mandates on
schools,'' said Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., speaking for the coalition. He said he
wants the scores published by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other critics have accused the administration of buckling to pressure from
college interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   But Fritschler said the department is working with a variety of groups that
have different rules. For example, some states allow a teaching candidate to
take an exam more than once, and report the best score. Others give graduates of
teaching programs a single shot at passing the state boards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many states don't keep the information we want or need; those who do, keep
it in many different categories and formats,'' he said, adding that the
department issued an interim report earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports would make more than 1,300 colleges that educate teachers more
accountable, say lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Brennan, a spokeswoman for Education Trust, a Washington-based
advocacy group for poor minority students, applauded the Democrats' criticism:
``It is sheer folly to expect that schools will be able to get students to
higher levels of achievement unless institutions of higher education take their
responsibility to prepare teachers more seriously.''

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijani Leader Seeks U.S. Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev is seeking more help
from President Clinton in settling his country's dispute over Nagorno-Karabkh.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in a speech Monday night that the countries that are supposed to
be leading the group of nations seeking a settlement of the long-running
conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia need to do more.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton was scheduled to meet Aliev later today.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the United States, Russia and France all need to be more engaged
in seeking a solution, Aliev told the Paul H. Nitze School of International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   As Aliev spoke, about a dozen demonstrators stood across the street,
chanting and waving signs protesting his visit. They accused Aliev, a former
Soviet leader, of a 40-year record of human rights abuse, censorship and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in his speech that he is committed to democracy and free markets.
</P>
<P>
	   While a five-year cease-fire has held, the two southern Caucuses nations of
Azerbaijan and Armenia have failed to resolve the dispute over independence
claims by the Nagorno-Karabkh region now controlled by Armenians but nestled
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
	   Central to U.S. concern with the region is a planned pipeline to carry
Caspian sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and European oil companies, across
Azerbaijan to the Black Sea at Supsa, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Western nations are concerned that any escalation of conflict in the region
will stall the pipeline the way the Chechen conflict has hindered the flow of
oil through another pipeline across Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev praised President Clinton's support for making the Azerbaijan-Georgia
pipeline possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will start construction of the Baku-Supsa main export pipeline very
soon,'' Aliev said. He said Azerbaijan also seeks construction of a gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev pledged to continue a dialogue with Armenian President Robert
Kocharian, while criticizing Russia for maintaining a military presence in
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conflict needs to be settled peacefully,'' Aliev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said he supports giving Nagorno-Karabkh ``the highest degree of
status'' within Azerbaijan, but he said Armenian forces must be withdrawn from
the region and 1 million Azerbaijanis that were driven from the area must be
allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagorno-Karabkh cannot become a second Armenia, he said, adding, ``The
Armenian people already have a nation.''

	   Aliev said his main goal in carrying on a dialogue with Kocharian is to
achieve peace. He said both he and the Armenian leader have indicated a
willingness to compromise but have not been able to reach a comprehensive
settlement.
</P>

scheduled another round of talks in Vienna under the joint supervision of the
United States, Russia and France.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebel Leader Wages Struggle  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- During his first year in prison, Abdullah Ocalan
shaved his bushy Stalin-style mustache, lost nearly 40 pounds and worked to
reshape his guerrilla movement into a political force.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan, who was captured by Turkish commandos a year ago today, has changed
from the leader of a guerrilla movement that was facing defeat on the
battlefield into a significant political figure. Some say the rebel leader is
stronger in prison than he was as a free man.
</P>
<P>
	   From his prison cell on death row on Imrali Island, Ocalan sends messages to
his guerrillas through his lawyers, who also feed the rebel leader's statements
to the Turkish and international media. That spotlight is largely new for
Ocalan, who lived in obscurity in Syria before he was captured in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan's fate -- he was sentenced to death for treason in June -- has become
a key issue in Turkey's relations with the European Union. The EU has demanded
that Turkey not hang Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   On the dusty streets of southeastern Turkey, Kurds who never agreed with
Ocalan's violent tactics now say they will never forgive Turkey if the rebel is
executed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One year ago, he came as a murderer from Kenya,'' the Turkish magazine
Cuma said in the headline to a cover story. ``Now he is a'' political leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has said that it will never negotiate with Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers
Party, or PKK, dismissing the group as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   But Turkey does permit Ocalan's lawyers to release his statements, leading
many to speculate that Turkey is encouraging or at least not objecting to the
guerrilla leader's new conciliatory path.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan's transformation, they say, benefits Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Since arriving in prison, Ocalan shaved the bushy mustache that he and many
Turkish leftists wore as a badge of their identity. He shed 37 pounds and now
has the same menu as the elite commandos who guard him.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after shaving, a move that some say symbolized his changes, Ocalan
ordered his fighters to declare a unilateral cease-fire and retreat to bases in
Iraq and Iran. He also instructed a handful of rebels to surrender to Turkey, a
move he said demonstrated his sincerity toward peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Since those orders, the number of clashes between militants and rebels have
fallen to a trickle. In August, for example, rebel attacks were down 86 percent
from the same time a year earlier, the Turkish military said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ocalan has considerably increased his powers within the group despite
being in prison,'' said Nihat Ali Ozcan, an analyst with Ankara's Eurasia
Strategic Research Center. ``The PKK would not find its'' political path easily
without Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
	   The PKK re-elected Ocalan as its leader in its January meeting in the
mountains of Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A life without our leader is not worth living,'' the group said in a
statement released to coincide with the anniversary of Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is dissent within the organization, and some Kurds in the
overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast consider Ocalan a traitor for retreating from
his demands for autonomy and insisting only on cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurds are not recognized as a minority in Turkey, and it is illegal to
broadcast or teach in Kurdish. Ocalan's rebels have battled Turkish soldiers for
the past 15 years, a fight that has killed 37,000 people -- mostly Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been reports that some senior commanders have left the
organization, objecting to Ocalan's calls to lay down arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is growing division and confusion within the group,'' said Michael
Radu of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. ``There is still
a struggle for succession, and the number of defections are likely to
increase.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some say Ocalan is only making concessions to avoid the gallows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are concessions inextricably linked with'' his imprisonment, said
Philip Robins, a lecturer at Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan's lawyers have appealed his sentence to the European Court of Human
Rights, a process that could take up to two years.
</P>
<P>
	   And Turkey has started talking tough, recently warning journalists that they
could face heavy fines or even prison sentences if they continue printing the
rebel leader's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ocalan's noose is in our hands,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Devlet
Bahceli, leader of the far-right Nationalist Movement Party.

<HEADLINE> Libertarian Seeks Presidency Again  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS KIKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harry Browne is no fan of government. In fact, it would
be fair to say he even hates it. So what is an anti-government Libertarian to
do?
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Browne announced his second long-shot bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The 66-year-old former investment adviser from Franklin, Tenn., thinks
government has failed. He has proposed a 12-step program that would eliminate
income taxes, Social Security, the war on drugs, federal welfare and a lot of
other things Washington does.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne received less than 1 percent of the vote in the 1996 election, but
contends the climate is ripe for his message of a drastically scaled-back
government.
</P>
<P>
	   His transition from investment adviser to presidential candidate was an odd
one. Not only was he not politically active or connected -- he had not voted
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1992, watching Democrat Al Gore on TV, Browne found himself yelling
at the tube and his wife suggested he might make a good president. The idea
excited him, and two years later he sought the Libertarian Party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I dropped out (of politics) in the 1960s, you were hard-pressed to
ever find anybody who didn't think government could do anything it set out to
do,'' Browne said in an interview. ``If they said we are going to provide health
care for the elderly, then most people said, 'Well, we're going to have health
care for the elderly.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Today a candidate who doesn't talk about reforming Social Security and other
social programs is ``doomed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne finished fifth in 1996, behind Reform Party candidate Ross Perot and
the Green Party's Ralph Nader. This time, his campaign has about $1 million and
he won't take the federal matching funds for which he now qualifies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't believe in government welfare for individuals, and I certainly
don't believe in it for politicians,'' said Browne.
</P>
<P>
	   He sees the Reform Party's infighting as a boost for Libertarians. The
Libertarian Party, he said, at least has a set of core principles all members
believe in.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Reform Party is just an organization with a vague principle, a vague
objective, and the result is that it lends itself to anyone who can get hold of
the microphone,'' Browne said, referring to last weekend's contentious Reform
meeting and its leadership battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Libertarians meet in Anaheim, Calif., in early July to nominate their
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Browne is confident he will be able to rally the party, which includes about
30,000 dues-paying members. He has produced a 30-minute television show about
his candidacy to debut on a small national cable network, but is not unrealistic
about his prospects in November.
</P>
<P>
	   His goal is to win 5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would lay the groundwork for somebody to run for president in 2004, and
maybe win the presidency,'' Browne said. ``And it would certainly lay the
groundwork to elect some Libertarian candidates to Congress in 2002.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Pushes for Stability  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Reform Party's weekend of ``wrestlemania'' is turning
to talk of nominating a Republican, Sen. John McCain, in the presidential race
as leaders of Ross Perot's organization search for instant stability -- and
credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He sounds more like a Reform Party candidate than anyone else running,''
Rhode Island chairman Victor Moffitt said of McCain. ``He would be a perfect
candidate for our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in South Carolina, McCain said he would accept the Reform
nomination, but only after he had won the GOP's nod.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sure I would, as long as they know I'm the nominee of the Republican
Party,'' McCain said. ``I wouldn't seek their nomination if I were not the
Republican nominee.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said, however, that the Reform Party's nationally televised melee
over the weekend in Nashville, Tenn., left unclear whether the party had one
base or two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reach out to everybody, although from watching 'Headline News,' I'm not
sure who you'd be reaching out to,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's newly installed leaders insisted the free-for-all meeting had
been ``cathartic,'' a rightful uprising against figureheads hostile to Perot's
vision of reform.
</P>
<P>
	   With Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, his hand-picked national party chairman
Jack Gargan and potential presidential candidate Donald Trump suddenly out, the
organization was returned overnight to stability, Perot's allies said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The party's under control,'' declared newly installed National Chairman
Pat Choate. ``The sideshow is over.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others said the nationally televised melee had dealt a major blow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are laughing at us,'' Alabama chairman Jim Turpin, who
attended the meeting, said by telephone from his home near Birmingham. ``I'm
having second thoughts; I'm thinking about going with another party, an
independent party.''
</P>
<P>
	   But no other political organization outside the Republican and Democratic
parties will have $12.6 million in federal matching funds to give a presidential
candidate, nor such potential to influence the election this year, Reform
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
	   News shows were still airing footage Monday of red-faced party members
shouting each other in Nashville while police officers separated them. The
pictures, some critics said, dealt major damage to the Reform Party's
credibility in national politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those images are not particularly helpful to the prestige of the party or
an institution,'' said Stephen Wayne, an expert on political parties who teaches
at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadership shakeup also prompted new speculation over what's next for
the party.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has yet to rule out running for a third time. And Buchanan has been
campaigning for months in a cross-country marathon to qualify for the ballots in
29 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said Monday that the dispute won't hurt his candidacy, but will
help the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the internal warfare inside the party is now over. Two weeks from
now, a month from now, that's going to be ancient history,'' he said during a
campaign stop in West Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan added that he was pleased that Ventura and Trump were out of the
way, but said the possibility of a third White House run by Perot would not
deter him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, he would be a formidable challenger for the nomination. There's
no question about it,'' he said of Perot. ``But we would go right ahead with our
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about a place in the socially moderate party for Buchanan, the
staunchly conservative former Republican who opposes abortion, Choate said
Buchanan would fit because he agrees with the rest of the party platform on such
issues as trade and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has a personal belief on the issue of abortion. We understand where he
is, he understands where we are and we accept his position,'' said Choate, who
was Perot's running mate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, fireworks continued flying between Ventura's and Perot's
supporters, with Trump announcing he would not seek the party's presidential
nomination in part because ``the Reform Party is a total mess.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also remaining was the question of where more than $2 million intended for
the August nominating convention had gone. Choate said his attorneys were ``on
the case.'' Legal action was still pending over the location of the party's
financial books, which ousted national treasurer Ronn Young had sued to recover.

<HEADLINE> Focus on Impact of Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The resignation of the U.N. humanitarian coordinator
for Iraq has again focused attention on how sanctions are affecting ordinary
Iraqis and renewed questions about the effectiveness of U.N. relief programs in
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The departure of Hans von Sponeck, who called for an end to U.N. sanctions,
came at a time when the U.N. humanitarian program was supposed to be improving
following the decision by the Security Council in December to try to get more
aid to Iraqis faster.
</P>
<P>
	   While the United States has supported the new Iraq policy, it is wary of
implementing the changes before weapons inspections resume in Iraq. Washington
has held up contracts -- mostly to rebuild Iraq's oil industry and power plants
-- fearing such equipment could be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck, a German diplomat, hasn't commented since he announced his
resignation Sunday. But diplomats in Baghdad and U.N. officials in New York said
the career U.N. civil servant found it too difficult to work under the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait barred Baghdad
from selling oil, its most precious commodity, on the open market. Under U.N.
resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors determine that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council created the oil-for-food program in 1996 to enable
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other essential
goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, however, has been unable to meet all of the Iraqis' needs.
</P>
<P>
	   A UNICEF report last August found that the death rate for children under 5
years of age had doubled during the 1990s, due to two wars, sanctions, a
decimated economy and the government's inability to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck's call for the sanctions to be lifted earned him the wrath of
the United States and Britain. He also wanted the Security Council to separate
the issues of humanitarian aid and disarmament in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   He is the second humanitarian coordinator to quit. Denis Halliday resigned
in 1998 after deciding he didn't want to be associated with the sanctions any
longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck's announcement came as protesters mounted a second day of
demonstrations Monday in New York to demand an end to the sanctions. More than
100 people demonstrated on the front steps of the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations and 86 were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after they
refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this is the worst case of child abuse today,'' said Bert Sacks,
58, a protester from Seattle who said he had traveled to Iraq a half-dozen times
bringing medicine to Iraqis in violation of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Such sentiments have caught the attention of lawmakers in Washington, 70 of
whom wrote to President Clinton last month urging that sanctions be lifted. Some
of the lawmakers scheduled a news conference on Wednesday to highlight the
cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They need clean water and sewage treatment. Without that, food and
medicine are useless,'' said protester Chris Allen-Doucot as he was being
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, warned this weekend that
Baghdad will consider cutting back its oil output even further unless the
``holds'' on oil spare parts are lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   With world oil prices rising and supplies tight, a substantial cut in Iraqi
exports could push prices higher if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries continues to restrict its production.

<HEADLINE> McCain a 'Conservative Reformer'  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Con-ser-va-tive (n): resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
	   Re-form (v): to make better by removing faults and defects.
</P>
<P>
	   The words convey very different concepts in the dictionary, but an ad now
airing by Republican presidential candidate John McCain pushes them together
twice in the space of 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad begins: ``John's McCain's agenda is a South Carolina agenda:
conservative reform for America.'' Near the end it concludes: ``Like Ronald
Reagan, John McCain is a conservative reformer.''
</P>
<P>
	   There's nothing particularly conservative about the reforms McCain is
pushing. But the idea is to take two popular concepts and put them together --
to straddle what can be opposing forces. It's a glance to the conservative, then
a wave to the reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tension between conservative and reform is very real,'' said Wayne
Fields, who studies political rhetoric at Washington University in St. Louis.
``Just as the tension between conservative and compassion is real.''
</P>
<P>
	   He's referring, of course, to GOP presidential front-runner Gov. George W.
Bush, who bills himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' telegraphing concern
for the poor and downtrodden while holding onto the conservative mantle. No
matter that in Reagan's heyday, conservative meant undoing the liberal reforms
intended to help the same poor and the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, for good measure, Bush has added ``reformer with results'' to his
sloganeering.
</P>
<P>
	   But how does one proclaim himself both conservative and reformer, all in one
breath?
</P>
<P>
	   Today's use of ``conservative'' is more likely to invoke notions of family
values than anything else, Fields said. The idea is to return to a time before
the wrong sort of change came along.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A conservative doesn't have to leave everything the same,'' said Henry
Graff of Columbia University. ``To save the system you reform it.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's what Reagan -- the ultimate modern conservative -- did. More than
anything, Fields said, he undid the Great Society doings of Lyndon B. Johnson
and his like-minded successors. ``Reagan was trying to undo a liberal
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for the McCain campaign, spokesman Howard Opinsky says it makes perfect
sense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that South Carolinians and most Americans want a conservative
governing philosophy, coupled with an active reform agenda, that will move us
toward our conservative philosophy,'' he said. ``It may not be in the dictionary
... but that's what John McCain wants.''

<HEADLINE> State's tourism dollars up 50 percent in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Tourists poured a record $100 million into
Connecticut attractions and related businesses in 1999, an increase of 46
percent from the year before, a new study shows.
<P>
	   The state tourism office of the Department of Economic and Community
Development attributes the increase to a 7-year marketing campaign aimed at
greater metropolitan New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourists spent $66 million in Connecticut in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study showed that travelers to Connecticut last year spent $136
apiece on lodging, up 24 percent over 1998. They also shelled out $136 in
restaurants, an increase of 6.5 percent. And they spent about $142 on shopping
trips around the state, almost 50 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people who called the state tourism office's information
number, 1-800-CT-BOUND, rose 24 percent to 286,471.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the people that called, almost 58 percent visited the state - a rate that
matched a record set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was conducted through a telephone poll of 700 people from metro
New York who had called the state tourism office.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, the state tourism office launched an intensive marketing campaign
aimed at greater metro New York that includes TV spots, newspaper inserts and
magazine ads. Of a $5 million annual budget, the office spends a little over $2
million on ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Mystic continues to be the number one destination for travelers from New
York. Ninety percent of New York travelers were repeat visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   The study showed that visitors were pleased with their Connecticut
vacations. Some 88 percent of travelers to the state said they plan to come back
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also showed that more than half, or some 58 percent, of all
visitors are couples, while a third said they come with children.

Tornadoes Descend on Georgia, Killing 22
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 were
hurt after tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday. Dozens of houses
and mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened, their
metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and streets. The tornadoes
struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms rumbled through the
Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia. President Clinton asked
Americans to pray for the tornado victims and said the loss of life "is unusual
and terrible."

Clinton Taking Up Web Security

security on the World Wide Web. The initial idea of the session was to address
the problem of terrorists using cyberspace. But Clinton says last week's attacks
underscore a need for the government to focus on protecting the Internet itself.
Among the participants in today's meeting is Mudge, nickname for a member of a
"think tank" of hackers who perform security consulting under the name AtStake.

1,100 planes after problems were found in that part of the Alaska Airlines MD-83

while trying to fix a problem with the stabilizer, a tail part that controls the

High Stakes for McCain, Bush in Debate

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The first face-to-face meeting since the New
Hampshire primary is also the last before South Carolina votes, and John McCain
and George W. Bush have different challenges in their debate Tuesday. For
McCain, it's to regain the high ground as a reformer after being pounded on his
record by Bush and running a negative ad against him. For Bush, it's to maintain
the pressure on McCain without appearing too negative himself and alienating
groups such as women and independents in Saturday's vote. Aides to the Texas
governor said he planned to dig into McCain's record on Social Security.

Blacks, Glaucoma Surgery Studied

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of Medicare claims found that blacks were only half
as likely as whites to undergo surgery for glaucoma, the most common cause of
blindness in black Americans. The researchers, whose study appears in the
February issue of Archives of Ophthalmology, said the reasons could include lack
of health-care access, inadequate education about the disease, overtreatment of
whites and racial bias. An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, the
nation's second-leading cause of irreversible vision loss. The researchers noted
that more than $1 billion is spent on federal aid yearly to about 120,000 blind
glaucoma patients.

<HEADLINE> Car Booster Seats Urged for Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is launching a campaign to encourage the
use of booster seats for youngsters who have outgrown child safety seats but
aren't big enough to rely solely on adult restraints.
</P>
<P>
	   Kids can't fit safely into adult belts when they weigh 40 to 80 pounds and
are about 4 to 8 years old, officials say. But less than 5 percent of those
children use booster seats, according to an ongoing study of more than 20,000
children by the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
and State Farm Insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Booster seats, properly used, can help prevent injury to older children by
making adult-sized seat belts fit effectively,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said in announcing a campaign that includes distribution of 50,000
brochures and $7.5 million in grant money to states to promote child passenger
safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies show about 70 percent of children 3 and younger are properly
restrained but that number drops to as low as 20 percent for children 4 to 9,
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Booster seats allow children who have outgrown child seats to properly
position lap belts around their hips and shoulder belts across their chests.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the seats, the shoulder belts can tangle around a child's neck and
the lap portion of the belt rides up over the abdomen. That lap belt position
places children at risk of liver, spleen, intestinal and spinal cord injuries
during a crash.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, 495 children 5 to 9 were killed and 86,000 were injured in crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co. announced Monday it would provide free dealer
installation of tether strap anchors in all its vehicles from 1989 through 2000
models. The strap, already required in Canada, more securely fastens the top of
child seats to give children better protection from forward head movement in
crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government is requiring top tether anchors in all vehicles
beginning with the 2001 model year. The strap usually is connected to the back
of a vehicle's package shelf.

<HEADLINE> SBC Application Denial Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bid by SBC Communications to provide long-distance
service to its local customers is facing a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the Justice Department recommended that the Federal
Communications Commission reject SBC's application to get into the long-distance
business in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional Bell company failed to show it was providing equal access to
competing companies seeking to lease its local phone lines, the department said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 law mandated that before a Bell company can offer long-distance
within its service area, it first must show in detail that it has opened its
local monopoly to give rivals a chance to compete. Bell Atlantic convinced
regulators it had done so in New York, and in December it became the first Bell
company to offer long distance service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio-based SBC filed an application with the FCC in January arguing
that its Texas market also is fully open to competition.
</P>
<P>
	   But Justice Department officials said the company had not demonstrated it
was giving the required access to competitors seeking to lease lines so they
could offer high-speed Internet and phone services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nondiscriminatory access is required for us to find that the market is
open to competition,'' said Joel Klein, in charge of the department's antitrust
division.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the FCC has the final say, it must give substantial weight to the
assessment provided by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC previously turned down requests by SBC to provide long-distance
service in Oklahoma and by Ameritech Corp., now owned by SBC, to provide
long-distance service in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's new evaluation comes despite a glowing endorsement
from the Public Utility Commission in Texas, which lent its unanimous support to
the application late last month. The FCC must take that evaluation by state
regulators into account as well before issuing its final decision no later than
the second week of April.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC said Monday it was confident the FCC would eventually approve the
application. The company has already created a separate subsidiary to handle its
high-speed Internet service, ensuring nondiscriminatory access for rivals, SBC
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also cited a precedent established when Bell
Atlantic's New York long-distance application was approved. The department said
SBC's performance in providing rivals with pieces of its network was below the
level the FCC described as ``minimally acceptable'' when it gave Bell Atlantic
the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC responded that its performance for moving local customers to competitors
without an interruption of phone service meets or exceeds the standards set by
Bell Atlantic when it received FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic did not receive a full-force endorsement from the Justice
Department, either, but ultimately the FCC gave it approval in late December to
offer long-distance in New York.

<HEADLINE> Officer claims he thought Diallo wore bulletproof vest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Inside Amadou Diallo's vestibule, there was a din
"like cannon shots." There were flashes. And wood splintering. Chaos.
<P>
	   The description by one of the four officers accused of murdering Diallo with
a barrage of 41 bullets also includes a scary sight: Diallo standing up to the
gunfire and holding a black object that appeared to be a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendant Sean Carroll testified at the officers' trial Monday that he was
sure the West African immigrant was "wearing a bulletproof vest and the only way
to take him out was to shoot at his legs."
</P>
<P>
	   But when Diallo fell, Carroll said, he was shocked to look down and discover
the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36 - at times sobbing - and Officer Edward McMellon, 27 - in
monotone - became the first of the four defendants to give public accounts of
how they shot Diallo while patrolling his block at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
Officers Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were expected to take the
stand as early as today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't die! Don't die!" Carroll said he yelled as Diallo lay bleeding in the
vestibule. "Keep breathing!"
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Carroll and McMellon both told jurors they had experience
identifying dangerous street criminals and were trained to quickly move in - or
"close the gap" - to disarm them. Both testified they had been involved in
non-fatal shootings that were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   On the morning Diallo died, the four plainclothes officers were cruising in
an unmarked car. Carroll said he became suspicious as they drove past Diallo's
apartment building and saw him on the front doorsteps "looking up and down the
block, peeking his head out ... like he didn't want to be seen."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll claimed Diallo, 22, a street vendor, fit the description of a wanted
rapist. He also said he suspected that Diallo might be committing a robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers got out of the car, McMellon testified, he held out his
badge and said, "Police department. ... Can we have a word with you?" Instead of
stopping, Diallo retreated to the rear of a vestibule and started digging in his
right pocket, both officers testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants described rushing Diallo, ordering him to "Stop!" and "Show
your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   "We said it clear," Carroll said. "He just didn't want to listen."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers said Diallo turned toward them and began pulling out a square
black object that looked like the top of a semi-automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   "My prior arrests dictated to me that this person was pulling a gun,"
Carroll said. "I just said, 'Gun. He's got a gun."'
</P>
<P>
	   Said McMellon: "I screamed 'What are you doing?' (at Diallo) ... I didn't
want to die."
</P>
<P>
	   Both officers said they had one foot in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule when
they fired the first shots. As they retreated, McMellon fell down a stoop and
unto his back but kept firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon repeated defense claims that they fired all 16 shots
from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go down.
Carroll denied he shot Diallo while he was flat on his back, despite evidence
that one of his bullets tunneled up the victim's leg.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, both officers said they didn't know which one of them
fired the first shot. Prosecutor Donald Levin demanded Carroll explain what was
so suspicious about a man standing on his front stoop.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking up and down the block is not a crime, is it officer?" Levin asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, it is not," Carroll responded.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Social Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton shifted course on Social Security
reform, promising to sign a separate Republican bill to do away with an earnings
limit affecting hundreds of thousands of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said Monday. ``Let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's support gives powerful momentum to an election-year drive to
eliminate the earnings penalty, which takes $1 in Social Security benefits from
Americans 65 through 69 for every $3 they earn over a prescribed limit,
currently $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans already were introducing a repeal bill and promised to put
it on a fast track for a vote, likely in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm thrilled by this. I hope this is just the beginning of a signal from
them that they're willing to work on this whole Social Security area,'' Clinton
said during an interview with CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 10,000 people took part in the 25-minute online ``chat'' with
Clinton, said CNN spokesman Paul Schur. He said one of them slipped past CNN's
filtering system and wrote -- under Clinton's name -- that he would like to see
more pornography on the Internet. Schur said he did not know how the impostor
eluded the filter but that the computer system was not hacked.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has advocated eliminating the earnings limit before, but only
as part of a comprehensive plan dealing with the threat of Social Security
insolvency as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the Social Security earnings limit is an issue dear to the hearts
of older Americans, an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in
their struggle for control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 seniors lose part or all of their benefits because of the
earnings limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. The
earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost roughly $22.7 billion over 10 years,
according to GOP estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
	   --He thinks ``the United States can do business'' with acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't agree with him on everything, but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The United States has to strike ``a delicate balance'' in dealing with
Austria, voicing disapproval of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party without
doing ``anything that builds his support even further.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the
United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive
rhetoric,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --He is optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle East. He
acknowledged, however, that ``we're in a little tough patch right now'' with a
freeze in talks between Israel and Syria, a missed deadline for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace framework and fresh violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're down to the hard decisions,'' the president said. He added: ``We're
so close on the substance that I am optimistic.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- "American Beauty," the dark comedy about
family mayhem in suburbia, led a diverse slate of Oscar contenders with eight
nominations today. "The Cider House Rules" and "The Insider" were right behind
with seven each.
</P>
<P>
	   The three received nominations for best picture along with the death row
saga "The Green Mile" and "The Sixth Sense," a tale of a child who can see
ghosts.
</P>
<P>
	   A notable omission among the acting Oscar contenders: Jim Carrey, who gave a
dead-on impersonation of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon."
Carrey received back-to-back Golden Globes for that role and 1998's "The Truman
Show" but was not nominated for an Oscar for either role.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" also was nominated for best actor and actress for Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening, director Sam Mendes, screenwriter Alan Ball for best
original screenplay, as well as for cinematography, film editing and original
score.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides best picture, "The Cider House Rules," a story of coming of age in a
New England orphanage, received nominations for supporting actor Michael Caine,
director Lasse Hallstrom, adapted screenplay by John Irving, who wrote the
novel, as well as for score, editing and art direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Insider," a portrait of a tobacco-industry whistleblower, also received
nominations for lead actor Russell Crowe, director Michael Mann, adapted
screenplay, cinematography, editing and sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The ghost story "The Sixth Sense," last year's biggest box-office surprise
with $278 million, received six nominations including one for 11-year-old Haley
Joel Osment for supporting actor, and two for M. Night Shyamalan for directing
and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Crowe and Spacey, the best actor nominees were Richard Farnsworth in
"The Straight Story," Sean Penn in "Sweet and Lowdown" and Denzel Washington in
"The Hurricane."

<P>
	   The other lead actress nominees were Janet McTeer in "Tumbleweeds," Julianne
Moore in "The End of the Affair," Meryl Streep in "Music of the Heart" and
Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry." It was Streep's 12th career nomination, tying
Katharine Hepburn for the most acting nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   The other supporting actor nominees were Tom Cruise in "Magnolia," Michael
Clarke Duncan in "The Green Mile," Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and
Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense."

	   The supporting actress nominees: Toni Collette in "The Sixth Sense,"
Angelina Jolie in "Girl, Interrupted," Catherine Keener in "Being John

</P>
<P>
	   The other director nominee was Spike Jonze for "Being John Malkovich."
</P>
<P>
	   Other notable omissions: Oscar favorite Tom Hanks for "The Green Mile,"
Emily Watson for "Angela's Ashes," and Stanley Kubrick's last movie, "Eyes Wide
Shut."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which had been a strong contender for best
picture, lead actor Matt Damon and director Anthony Minghella, was shut out of
those categories. Besides Law, the movie received nominations for adapted
screenplay, original score and two technical awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being John Malkovich," a favorite among critics, received just three
nominations while another critics' favorite, "Topsy-Turvy," got four bids
including original screenplay by director Mike Leigh.
</P>
<P>
	   The year's biggest blockbuster, "Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom
Menace," received three nominations for sound, sound effects editing and visual
effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The foreign language film nominees were "All About My Mother" from Spain,
"Caravan" from Nepal, "East-West" from France, "Solomon and Gaenor" from the
United Kingdom, and "Under the Sun" from Sweden.

<HEADLINE> No Oscar Nominations for Jim Carrey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rubberfaced comedian Jim Carrey may be scrunching his
mug in disgust after Oscar again snubbed one of his Golden Globe-winning
performances.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrey claimed best actor in a musical or comedy this year at the Globe
ceremony for his uncanny impersonation of the late gonzo comic Andy Kaufman in
"Man on the Moon."
</P>
<P>
	   But his name was missing from the list of actors nominated today for an
Oscar -- again.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrey publicly joked about his desire for an Oscar after winning a best
dramatic actor Globe last year for "The Truman Show," in which he played a man
who unwittingly lives his entire life on television.
</P>
<P>
	   In his acceptance speech for "Truman," Carrey thanked the "Academy" for his
Globe award, which actually was selected by the Hollywood Foreign Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   After the press group rewarded him again this year for portraying Kaufman,
Carrey quipped: "I'm the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes."
</P>
<P>
	   However, Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner and frequent nominee, also failed to
grab an Oscar nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanks' current film, "The Green Mile," received several nominations today,
including best picture. "Man on the Moon" got none.

<HEADLINE> Tester Says Pentagon Moves Too Fast  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is rushing too rapidly toward recommending
to President Clinton whether a national defense against long-range missile
attack should be deployed, the Defense Department's chief weapons tester said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report Monday to Congress and Defense Secretary William Cohen, Philip
E. Coyle questioned Cohen's plan to review the readiness of the missile defense
project in June. On the basis of that review, Cohen is to recommend to the
president whether to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   The schedule for a June review puts ``unrealistic pressure'' on the
project's managers, Coyle wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Coyle's report, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said today, ``We do consider it rushing,'' but he stressed that
the hard push is justified by the threat of a missile attack on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm comfortable with the June deadline,'' Shelton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   As envisioned by the Pentagon, the system would use a network of radars and
silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and shoot down long-range
ballistic missiles outside Earth's atmosphere. Congress has required the
administration to deploy such a system as soon as technology allows.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Cohen so far has said he intends to stick to the June timetable,
Coyle wrote that ``undue pressure has been placed on the program to meet an
artificial decision point in the development process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading critic of
national missile defense, said of Coyle's conclusion: ``He's exactly right.''
Collina credited Coyle with ``very interesting honesty'' in telling Congress and
Cohen that the timetable for decisions on missile defense has become too
compressed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far two tests have been staged of the system's ability to intercept a
target missile in space. The first, last fall, succeeded. The second, in
January, failed.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test -- scheduled as the last before the June readiness review --
is unlikely to take place before mid-May, although no firm date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the failure of the January test, Coyle said, more time should be
allowed for analyzing results of the next test before Cohen determines what to
recommend to the president. He did not specify how much more time was needed,
but normal analysis takes two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus if the next test were in May, the review in preparation for a
recommendation to Clinton would not be done before July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would provide a clear technical understanding of the results and
avoid forcing the (readiness review) before the analysis is complete,'' Coyle
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has budgeted $12.7 billion for the national missile defense
project over the next five years. Coyle's report says that if the system is
deployed in 2005, as specified in the current schedule, the total cost --
development, production, construction and operating it for 20 years -- would be
$26.6 billion.

	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

down 4.28 at 1,385.66, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 47.75 at
4,370.80.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's gains came largely from Exxon Mobil, which rose 3 to 79 7/16 as
the price of crude oil rose in London trading. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel
Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War in Jan. 1991.

	   Texaco rose 1 5/16 to 50 3/16 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors
out of the broader market today.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors are worried that the Federal Reserve will continue raising
interest rates this year as it works to keep inflation from accelerating. The
Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and has seen little sign that
the economy's growth has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits.

<P>
	   Intel fell 1 to 108 7/8, and Cisco Systems fell 2 5/8 to 127 7/8.

Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.15 million shares, ahead of Monday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.98 to 537.96.

	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Farnsworth, a 79-year-old former stuntman,
became the oldest actor to get an Academy Award nomination today, for his role
in "The Straight Story."
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," the actor said in an interview from his longhorn cattle
ranch in Lincoln, N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   His best actor nomination gives the field a generation gap. Another nominee,
11-year-old Haley Joel Osment, is the third-youngest nominated. ("Titanic" star
Gloria Stewart was the oldest actress to get a nomination at 87.)
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second nomination for Farnsworth, who was nominated for the 1977
film "Comes a Horseman."
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles native was a stuntman for more than 30 years who moved into
acting, appearing in "The Grey Fox," "The Natural," "Tom Horn," "Resurrection,"
"Rhinestone Cowboy" and "Anne of Green Gables."
</P>
<P>
	   If he wins the Oscar, he said, "I've got a good spot for it here."

<HEADLINE> State's tourism dollars up 50 percent in 1999  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Tourists from the New York area poured $100
million into Connecticut attractions and related businesses in 1999, an increase
of 46 percent from the year before, a new study shows.
<P>
	   The state tourism office of the Department of Economic and Community
Development attributes the increase to a 7-year marketing campaign aimed at
greater metropolitan New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourists from New York spent $66 million in Connecticut in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study showed that travelers from New York to Connecticut last year
spent $136 apiece on lodging, up 24 percent over 1998. They also shelled out
$136 in restaurants, an increase of 6.5 percent. And they spent about $142 on
shopping trips around the state, almost 50 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people who called the state tourism office's information
number, 1-800-CT-BOUND, rose 24 percent to 286,471.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the people that called, almost 58 percent visited the state - a rate that
matched a record set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was conducted through a telephone poll of 700 people from metro
New York who had called the state tourism office.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, the state tourism office launched an intensive marketing campaign
aimed at greater metro New York that includes TV spots, newspaper inserts and
magazine ads. Of a $5 million annual budget, the office spends a little over $2
million on ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Mystic continues to be the number one destination for travelers from New
York. Ninety percent of New York travelers were repeat visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   The study showed that visitors were pleased with their Connecticut
vacations. Some 88 percent of travelers to the state said they plan to come back
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also showed that more than half, or some 58 percent, of all
visitors are couples, while a third said they come with children.

<HEADLINE> Third officer testifies at Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A third police officer charged in the Diallo
shooting testified today he was certain his partner had been shot when he got
out of his unmarked patrol car.
<P>
	   "Ed was shot. That's all I could see," testified Officer Kenneth Boss as he
recounted seeing Officer Ed McMellon on the ground outside the building where
they encountered Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss said he saw Diallo in the rear of the vestibule. "I see a gun and I
say, 'My God, I'm gonna die,"' Boss recalled. "I fired my weapon."
</P>
<P>
	   The object Diallo was holding - which the officers believed was a gun -
turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   When the gunfire ended, Boss ran over to McMellon. "I grabbed him and I
started feeling his chest going, 'Where are you hit, where are you hit?' ... He
said, 'I'm not hit."' McMellon was lying on his back after falling down the
stoop.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss, 28, then went into the vestibule and saw Diallo lying there. "Where
there should have been a gun, there was a wallet," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss then went back to the car and called for an ambulance and police
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how he felt as he made the call, he said: "I was distraught."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Donald Levin asked Boss whether he had considered the possibility
that the West African immigrant didn't speak English or was emotionally
disturbed or even frightened of the plainsclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the time what went through my mind was that we had a fleeing suspect,"
Boss responded. "It didn't occur to me if he spoke English or not, or whether he
was running because he was trying to get away from police or whether he was
afraid of the police."
</P>
<P>
	   Boss' unemotional testimony was similar to that given Monday by Officer Sean
Carroll, who was the first of the four cops to testify at their trial. Carroll
told jurors that he was certain Diallo was "wearing a bulletproof vest and the
only way to take him out was to shoot at his legs."
</P>
<P>
	   But when Diallo fell, Carroll said, he was shocked to look down and discover
the black object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36 - at times sobbing - and Officer Edward McMellon, 27 - in
monotone - became the first of the four defendants to give public accounts of
how they shot Diallo while patrolling his block at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999.
Officer Richard Murphy, 27, also was expected to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't die! Don't die!" Carroll said he yelled as Diallo lay bleeding in the
vestibule. "Keep breathing!"
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. If convicted,
they face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Carroll and McMellon both told jurors they had experience
identifying dangerous street criminals and were trained to quickly move in - or
"close the gap" - to disarm them. Both testified they had been involved in
non-fatal shootings that were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   On the morning Diallo died, the four plainclothes officers were cruising in
an unmarked car. Carroll said he became suspicious as they drove past Diallo's
apartment building and saw him on the front doorsteps "looking up and down the
block, peeking his head out ... like he didn't want to be seen."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll claimed Diallo, 22, a street vendor, fit the general description of
a wanted rapist. He also said he suspected that Diallo might be committing a
robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   As the officers got out of the car, McMellon testified, he held out his
badge and said, "Police department. ... Can we have a word with you?" Instead of
stopping, Diallo retreated to the rear of a vestibule and started digging in his
right pocket, both officers testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants described rushing Diallo, ordering him to "Stop!" and "Show
your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   "We said it clear," Carroll said. "He just didn't want to listen."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers said Diallo turned toward them and began pulling out a square
black object that looked like the top of a semi-automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
	   "My prior arrests dictated to me that this person was pulling a gun,"
Carroll said. "I just said, 'Gun. He's got a gun."'
</P>
<P>
	   Said McMellon: "I screamed (at Diallo) 'What are you doing?' ... I didn't
want to die."
</P>
<P>
	   Both officers said they had one foot in the 5-foot-by-7-foot vestibule when
they fired the first shots. As they retreated, McMellon fell down the stoop and
onto his back but kept firing.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon repeated defense claims that they fired all 16 shots
from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go down.
Carroll denied he shot Diallo while he was flat on his back, despite evidence
that one of his bullets tunneled up the victim's leg.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, both officers said they didn't know which one of them
fired the first shot. Prosecutor Donald Levin demanded Carroll explain what was
so suspicious about a man standing on his front stoop.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking up and down the block is not a crime, is it officer?" Levin asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, it is not," Carroll responded.

<HEADLINE> IRS Revises Notice Language  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is taking a less
confrontational approach when it sends letters to taxpayers to notify them that
employers, banks and friends could be contacted as part of a tax audit.
</P>
<P>
	   The notices were required as ``fair warning'' by the 1998 IRS overhaul
passed by Congress, but the original versions drew immediate criticism last year
for heavy-handed wording. IRS Comissioner Charles Rossotti acknowledged that the
original letters ``needlessly alarmed taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the notices were unnecessarily sent to all taxpayers who
were audited and not just those from whom the IRS had tried and failed to get
the needed information. Rossotti promised last year that a rewrite was in the
works.
</P>
<P>
	   The new notices being announced today will reflect longstanding IRS policy
of resorting to these ``third-party'' contacts only when all else fails. The
form of the new letters was first reported by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS will begin using 15 notices designed for specific tax situations and
will clearly spell out that the information will first be sought from the
taxpayer before the agency contacts a bank, employer or friend. Some notices
will include a blank space for the agency to detail exactly what information is
being sought.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8 million taxpayers will likely receive a notice at some point this
year, Rossotti said.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Leads Oscar Nods  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- "American Beauty," the dark comedy about
family mayhem in suburbia, led a diverse slate of Oscar contenders with eight
nominations today. "The Cider House Rules" and "The Insider" were right behind
with seven each.
</P>
<P>
	   The three received nominations for best picture along with the supernatural
death-row saga "The Green Mile" and the ghost story "The Sixth Sense."
</P>
<P>
	   A notable omission among the acting contenders: Jim Carrey, who gave a
dead-on impersonation of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon."
Carrey received back-to-back Golden Globes for that role and 1998's "The Truman
Show" but was not nominated for an Academy Award for either role.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" also was nominated for best actor and actress for Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening, director Sam Mendes, screenwriter Alan Ball for best
original screenplay, as well as for cinematography, film editing and original
score.
</P>
<P>
	   Bening said the nominations were especially gratifying for a movie that
deals with difficult personal issues, blending wild humor with horrific action.
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie has so many contradictions," Bening said. "Its heart is really in
some very difficult truths. To see it recognized this way really is a surprise."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides best picture, "The Cider House Rules," a story of coming of age in a
New England orphanage, got nominations for supporting actor Michael Caine,
director Lasse Hallstrom, adapted screenplay by John Irving, who wrote the
novel, as well as score, editing and art direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Insider," a portrait of a tobacco-industry whistleblower, also received
nominations for lead actor Russell Crowe, director Michael Mann, adapted
screenplay, cinematography, editing and best sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The ghost story "The Sixth Sense," last year's biggest box-office surprise
with $278 million, received six nominations including one for 11-year-old Haley
Joel Osment for supporting actor, and two for M. Night Shyamalan for directing
and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Crowe and Spacey, the best actor nominees were Richard Farnsworth in
"The Straight Story," Sean Penn in "Sweet and Lowdown" and Denzel Washington in
"The Hurricane."
</P>
<P>
	   At 79, Farnsworth was the oldest lead actor nominee ever. Farnsworth
previously was nominated for "Comes a Horseman" in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," Farnsworth said. To celebrate, Farnsworth said he plans to
go out for a taco and a martini with an onion tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   The other lead actress nominees were Janet McTeer in "Tumbleweeds," Julianne
Moore in "The End of the Affair," Meryl Streep in "Music of the Heart" and
Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry." It was Streep's 12th career nomination, tying
Katharine Hepburn for the most acting nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   The other supporting actor nominees were Tom Cruise in "Magnolia," Michael
Clarke Duncan in "The Green Mile," Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and
Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense."
</P>
<P>
	   The supporting actress nominees were Toni Collette in "The Sixth Sense,"
Angelina Jolie in "Girl, Interrupted," Catherine Keener in "Being John
Malkovich," Samantha Morton in "Sweet and Lowdown" and Chloe Sevigny in "Boys
Don't Cry."
</P>
<P>
	   The other director nominee was Spike Jonze for "Being John Malkovich."
</P>
<P>
	   Other omissions included perennial Oscar favorite Tom Hanks for "The Green
Mile," Emily Watson for "Angela's Ashes," and Stanley Kubrick's last movie,
"Eyes Wide Shut."
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's acting nomination was the only one for "The Hurricane," which
had been a leading contender for best picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which had been a strong contender for best
picture, lead actor Matt Damon and director Anthony Minghella, was shut out of
those categories. Besides Law, the movie got nominations for adapted screenplay,
original score and two technical awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being John Malkovich," a favorite among critics, received just three
nominations while another critics' favorite, "Topsy-Turvy," got four bids,
including original screenplay by director Mike Leigh.
</P>
<P>
	   The year's biggest blockbuster, "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom
Menace," received three nominations for sound, sound effects editing and visual
effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The foreign film nominees were "All About My Mother" from Spain, "Caravan"
from Nepal, "East-West" from France, "Solomon and Gaenor" from the United
Kingdom, and "Under the Sun" from Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The nominations were announced in an early morning ceremony by actor Dustin
Hoffman at the academy headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Nominees in most of the 23 categories were chosen by specific branches of
the academy's 5,300 members, such as actors, directors and film editors. Some
nominations, including documentaries and foreign-language films, were selected
by special screening committees, while all academy members were allowed to cast
votes for best-picture nominees. The full membership is eligible to vote in all
categories for the awards themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscars will be presented March 26 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles and broadcast on ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   Billy Crystal, who has been master of ceremonies for six Oscar shows, will
return as host after turning the job over to Whoopi Goldberg last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Actor-director-producer Warren Beatty will receive the Irving G. Thalberg
award, which is presented to producers whose work represents a "consistently
high quality of motion picture production."

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 110.21; Dow Up 30.71  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell sharply today as investors collected
profits from a recent run to record levels. A rally in oil stocks helped lift
the Dow Jones industrials, but investors found little reason to explore other
sectors of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was down 110.21
at 4,308.34, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up 30.71 at 10,550.55.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 8.31 at 1,381.63.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks fell in the latest show of nervousness from investors who
are worried that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this
year as it works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates
four times since last June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth
has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 3 to 106 7/8, and Cisco Systems fell 4 1/8 to 126 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq, but its gains came largely from Exxon Mobil, which rose 2 13/16 to 79
1/4 as the price of crude oil rose in London trading. Crude prices topped $30 a
barrel Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War in Jan.
1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose 1 1/16 to 49 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors
out of the broader market today.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: China Deal Can Boost Exports  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The November trade agreement the Clinton administration
reached with China appears to have achieved America's major negotiating
objectives and should offer significant opportunities for U.S. farmers and
manufacturers, a congressional study said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said ``most of the
commitments China reportedly made in April 1999 appear to have been included in
the November 1999 agreement.'' U.S. negotiators won significant additional trade
concessions in such areas as banking, securities, films and music, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If and when fully implemented, China's WTO (World Trade Organization)
commitments could result in substantial new opportunities for U.S. exports to
and investment in China,'' the CRS study concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   It did not put a specific figure on the gains but cited a forecast made by
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman that U.S. farm exports could be increased by
$2 billion annually once the Chinese start removing barriers cited in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. agriculture exports to China totaled $1 billion last year, making China
the eighth-largest market for American farm products. Farm groups are expected
to be one of the major groups working to win passage of legislation that would
give China permanent normal trading status with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders released the new study as they sought to rally support
for the China legislation. Congress must eliminate the annual review of China's
trading status before U.S. exporters get the benefits of reduced trade barriers
that China has agreed to make in order to gain membership in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This study is further proof that continued trade with China will help
farmers and workers here at home through more jobs and better-paying jobs,''
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``American farmers and workers have so much to gain from normal trade with
China,'' said Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill. ``Admitting China to the international
trading community will force them to play by the rules of free and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky finally reached agreement on a
market-opening trade package with China last November after President Clinton
rejected similar offers made by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji during his visit to
the United States in April.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has tapped Commerce Secretary William Daley to
head up its lobbying efforts on the China issue but administration officials
conceded they have a tough fight, given that organized labor and many Democrats
in the House are opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House is pushing for a vote on the measure before midsummer in
order to keep the debate from spilling over into the fall congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Those opposed ending the annual review of China's trading status argue that
it will give the United States less leverage to win improvements in China's
performance on human rights and other nontrade issues.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Paine Webber raised its rating on the stock, saying that recent rumors about
Warren Buffett's health were false and that growth prospects remain strong. On
Monday, Berkshire revealed holdings in Citigroup, Liz Claiborne and Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral,"
saying the share price should hit 65 within 12 months. Texaco also benefited

<HEADLINE> Divorces Find Niche in Court TV  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID CRARY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- In two earlier incarnations, the TV show "Divorce Court"
used actors to play the separating spouses. Viewers now get the real thing,
complete with whining, tears and taunts.
</P>
<P>
	   The new "Divorce Court" -- a syndicated success midway through its first
season -- provides a forum for ex-partners to lash out at each other publicly in
ways that might not be allowed during divorce proceedings in a real court.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are lots and lots of people who divorce amicably. They don't need to
be on a TV show," said the producer, Jill Blackstone. "Our show is about people
whose marriages have ended badly."(Check local listings for time and channel.)
</P>
<P>
	   Presiding over the studio courtroom is Mablean Ephriam, not a real judge but
a savvy, quick-witted lawyer with more than 20 years experience in the family
courts of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam doesn't actually grant divorces; that happens elsewhere. But after
scolding, lecturing and sometimes comforting the participants, she rules on some
dispute -- usually over money or property -- that the couple mutually agreed
would be resolved on the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you hear the stories, you have trouble holding back the laughter, or
the tears, or the anger," Ephriam said in a telephone interview. "Some of the
stuff is just utterly ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
	   The prevalence of no-fault divorce in America means many couples split up
without a chance to go on public record with their gripes against their ex.
</P>
<P>
	   "The emotions, the hurt are still there, but no one listens in court
anymore," Ephriam said. "Our show is cathartic... It's good to let go of
emotions."
</P>
<P>
	   Blackstone said the show's appearance fee of $500 per guest is not a primary
motive for those volunteering. Some do so out of vanity or vengefulness, but
most simply want their day in court.
</P>
<P>
	   "They want to be heard -- 'He did me wrong,' 'She did me wrong,"' Blackstone
said. "There's a drama in a failed relationship, a passion, and a pain, and
often a humor. It's something everyone can relate to."
</P>
<P>
	   Though they risk moments of nationally televised humiliation, the feuding
couples get a practical benefit -- Ephriam's end-of-show ruling serves as a
binding settlement of a dispute that otherwise might have entailed legal costs.
</P>
<P>
	   In a crowded field of court shows, "Divorce Court" has done well for a
newcomer, trailing only "Judge Judy" and "Judge Joe Brown" in the latest ratings
of the genre. It is produced in Los Angeles by Twentieth Television, a division
of Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   The original "Divorce Court" aired in the 1950s, with then-obscure actors
such as Alan Alda and Jack Nicholson among the performers. A revival appeared in
the 1980s, again using actors as spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam hopes her audience benefits from watching real-life marital woes.
</P>
<P>
	   "One advantage of the show, for those who are married and going through some
difficulty, is that they may see themselves," she said. "When you hear it from
somebody else, you think, 'Do I say that? Is that what I sound like?'
</P>
<P>
	   "People who are thinking of marriage might rethink constructively. Even
teenagers -- I hope they're learning you should check people out."
</P>
<P>
	   One couple from Virginia told Ephriam they watched the show together, and
found it helped them appreciate each other more.
</P>
<P>
	   She herself is divorced but doesn't rule out another try.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe very strongly in the institution of marriage," said Ephriam. "It
saddens me to see how people enter into a marital relationship without any
thought about what it is."
</P>
<P>
	   From the outset, "Divorce Court" has steered clear of alimony and child
custody cases. But Blackstone recalls a memorable custody dispute of a different
sort.
</P>
<P>
	   A couple came on the show hoping to resolve a complex financial dispute, but
the woman soon revealed her biggest concern: Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ephriam ruled that a prized collection of the beanbag animals should be
split, the woman started whining that half a collection was worthless. In a
flash, the "judge" ruled that the whole collection would go to the man, and the
studio audience roared approval.
</P>
<P>
	   There are sadder cases. One woman contended her husband had cheated on her,
given her gonorrhea, and run up big debts on her credit card by patronizing
phone-sex services. She was devastated when Ephriam ruled that those debts had
to be split 50-50.
</P>
<P>
	   Ephriam fought back tears during another show. A couple was quarreling over
how to divide items they bought for their first child, who had died within an
hour of birth.
</P>
<P>
	   "What are you people doing to yourselves?" the judge asked, reacting more
like a mother.
</P>
<P>
	   They stepped back for a moment, she recalled. Then both started conceding.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt much better."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Worried on Heating Oil Costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the rising cost of home
heating oil was ``deeply troubling'' for low-income families and that the
federal government may release more money to help them warm their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have not closed off any options,'' the president said. ``I'm monitoring
this on a daily basis.'' He spoke briefly with reporters in the Cabinet Room
after crude oil prices climbed above $30 for the first time since the eve of the
Persian Gulf War nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the government has released $2 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. ``We can release more,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said there would be some important meetings among oil-producing
countries within the next few days, ``We will know more about this in a week or
10 days about what the trends are going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the American people are handling the price increase pretty well in
terms of every aspect of our lives because of increased energy efficiency,
except for home heating oil,'' he said. He said many people in New England and
the Mid-Atlantic states ``are still dependent upon a source of heating which the
rest of the country left long ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they are unbelievably burdened by this,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the government's heating oil assistance eases the burden of the
poorest families. ``But there are a lot of working people on modest incomes that
are just getting killed by this, because of their reliance on home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   He said middle- and lower-income Americans ``have no option to heat their
home but home heating oil. They're the people that are really getting hurt.''

<HEADLINE> States' Health Care Varies Widely  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Access to health insurance, Medicaid payments and health
care costs vary widely from state to state, says a new report that suggests
where people live might affect their longevity, especially for low-income
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Poor people in Arizona, Texas and New Mexico are more likely to lack health
insurance than low-income people in Connecticut and Wisconsin, according to a
state-by-state analysis by AARP, the nation's largest organization of older
adults.
</P>
<P>
	   One-quarter of Arizona residents didn't see a doctor because of costs,
compared to just 6 percent of people in Wisconsin who didn't go to the doctor
for the same reason, said the AARP report, released today.
</P>
<P>
	   Health coverage costs vary widely. Workers in Florida fork out over $2,000
for family health coverage, while employees in Michigan pay just $757.
</P>
<P>
	   Even in Medicaid, a nationwide health program for low-income Americans,
coverage and payments vary widely state by state. In the District of Columbia,
61 percent of people at or below the poverty level are on Medicaid and recieve
an average of $7,548. Medicaid reaches only 29 percent of poor people in South
Dakota, where payments average $3,737, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   While many factors affect health care, including economic conditions, the
scope of health plan benefits and income levels, AARP officials said that the
report highlights the fact that people in some states, especially those with low
incomes, face more obstacles to health care than people in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of cause for concern in the data that we present,'' said
John Rother, AARP director of legislation and public policy. ``Where you live
might affect how many years you have left.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group used recent data from federal, state and private sources to come
up with 95 key health indicators for states. Other findings included:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mississippi had the highest heart disease rate, with 188 deaths per 1,000
people, and Minnesota had the lowest, with 93 deaths per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   --Washington, D.C., had the highest cancer rate, with 155.8 deaths per 1,000
people, and Utah had the lowest, with 84.9 cancer deaths per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   --Alaska had the highest nursing home costs, with a median cost per day of
$212.94. Oklahoma ranked among the lowest in nursing home costs, with a median
daily rate of $47.58.

    SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- William Oliver Swofford, a singer who under the
stage name Oliver had late-'60s hits with the songs "Good Morning, Starshine"

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz was remembered today as
a genius who touched the lives of millions of Americans as the House adopted a
resolution to award him a Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old cartoonist died in his sleep Saturday at his Santa Rosa,
Calif., home, a day before Schulz's last strip featuring Snoopy and the gang was
published. He had announced in November he would retire after being diagnosed
with colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On Saturday night, millions of Americans lost their security blanket,''
said Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif. ``Life won't be the same without Charles
Schulz. We let `Peanuts' into our lives on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   The House measure passed 410-1. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the lone
dissenter. An identical bill is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., said Americans will ``never forget Snoopy's
imagination, Lucy's cynicism, Linus' gentle innocence, Woodstock's loyalty or
Charlie Brown's vulnerabilities, hopes and dreams.''

those simple fleeting moments that bind us together, bind together our adulthood
and our childhood,'' Thompson said.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Honor NYC Cardinal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to award an ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor the Congressional Gold Medal, the body's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, the longtime spiritual leader of New York City's 2.3 million Roman
Catholics, recently turned 80 and had surgery last fall to remove a brain tumor.
He is expected to retire as soon as Pope John Paul II appoints a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The House voted 413-1 to give the award to O'Connor. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
was the lone opponent. The Senate is expected to approve the honor next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's vote, lawmakers extolled O'Connor's work on behalf of the
needy, children, AIDS victims and others. They also spoke of his leadership in
establishing diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cardinal O'Connor has spent a lifetime using one simple tool -- love. Love
for his country, his church and his fellow human beings,'' said Rep. Vito
Fossella, R-N.Y., who first nominated O'Connor for the medal.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor, the oldest active U.S. bishop in the United States, is a close
ally of the pope. The cardinal has drawn criticism over the years for denouncing
homosexuality, premarital sex and birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor served in the Navy for 27 years and saw combat in Korea. He was a
career military chaplain before being named bishop in Scranton, Pa. He has led
the Archdiocese of New York since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Social Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton shifted course on Social Security
reform, promising to sign a separate Republican bill to do away with an earnings
limit affecting hundreds of thousands of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said Monday. ``Let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's support gives powerful momentum to an election-year drive to
eliminate the earnings penalty, which takes $1 in Social Security benefits from
Americans 65 through 69 for every $3 they earn over a prescribed limit,
currently $17,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans already were introducing a repeal bill and promised to put
it on a fast track for a vote, likely in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm thrilled by this. I hope this is just the beginning of a signal from
them that they're willing to work on this whole Social Security area,'' Clinton
said during an interview with CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 10,000 people took part in the 25-minute online ``chat'' with
Clinton, said CNN spokesman Paul Schur. He said one of them slipped past CNN's
filtering system and wrote -- under Clinton's name -- that he would like to see
more pornography on the Internet. Schur said he did not know how the impostor
eluded the filter but that the computer system was not hacked.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has advocated eliminating the earnings limit before, but only
as part of a comprehensive plan dealing with the threat of Social Security
insolvency as the baby boom generation retires.
</P>
<P>
	   Removing the Social Security earnings limit is an issue dear to the hearts
of older Americans, an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in
their struggle for control of the White House and Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800,000 seniors lose part or all of their benefits because of the
earnings limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. The
earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost roughly $22.7 billion over 10 years,
according to GOP estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
	   --He thinks ``the United States can do business'' with acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't agree with him on everything, but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --The United States has to strike ``a delicate balance'' in dealing with
Austria, voicing disapproval of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party without
doing ``anything that builds his support even further.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the
United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive
rhetoric,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   --He is optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle East. He
acknowledged, however, that ``we're in a little tough patch right now'' with a
freeze in talks between Israel and Syria, a missed deadline for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace framework and fresh violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're down to the hard decisions,'' the president said. He added: ``We're
so close on the substance that I am optimistic.''

home states. Like their 20-something neighbors, they enjoy the camaraderie and
cheap rent the arrangement provides. And they avoid Washington's infamous
traffic by walking to work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's great. We've all become very close friends,'' said Rep. Bart Stupak,
D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   The bipartisan living arrangement -- the house holds four Republicans and
three Democrats -- makes the congressmen better lawmakers, according to Rep.
Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who helped organize the housing arrangement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It leads to civility, that leads to tolerance, that leads to good
governance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other congressmen in the house are Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.; Steve Largent,
R-Okla.; Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; Mike Doyle, D-Pa.; and John Baldacci, D-Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressmen living together has a long history. Former presidents Abraham
Lincoln, Millard Fillmore and James Buchanan were some of the many politicians
who stayed in Capitol Hill boarding houses while serving in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Americans see today's members of Congress as privileged and wealthy,
living in the lap of luxury in or around Washington, but the reality is that a
fairly large number live rather frugally, sharing homes, living in efficiency
apartments -- even sleeping in their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven congressmen live in tight quarters. Renovations had to be made so
they wouldn't have to share bedrooms. Wamp said they don't have maid service,
and everyone is expected to help with household chores.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it's worth the hassle because of the good times the roommates and
their friends enjoy. He said the house is the most popular place on the Hill to
watch the NCAA college basketball tournament and to eat take-out Chinese food
late at night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all like sports,'' said Stupak, noting as many as four TVs can be tuned
in to games at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   Policy discussions are frequent. The only ground rule is everyone has to
show respect for each other, Wamp said. There have been times when the rule has
been tested, particularly during President Clinton's impeachment, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those were the most difficult days we had,'' Wamp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Living with roommates who also are colleagues and understand the pressures
of Congress makes the arrangement work, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all agree that being a public figure is one of the most lonely places a
man or woman can find themselves in,'' said Wamp.
</P>
<P>
	   That lonely lifestyle once prompted Rep. Anne Northup, R-Ky., to seek
shelter at the Young Women's Christian Association. ``I did not get in when they
found out how old I was,'' said the mother of six grown children.
</P>
<P>
	   She ended up in an efficiency apartment. ``There's no furniture in it,''
Northup said, explaining the small apartment is just a place to sleep when she
gets home from the office. Her real home remains in Louisville, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., lived in his office when he first arrived in
Washington in 1995, then bought a townhouse with Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
Hilleary said they often talk about congressional business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were both part of the attempted Newt Gingrich coup,'' he said,
referring to the 1997 push by some GOP House members to topple the former House
speaker. Asked if that action was plotted at the sparse townhouse, Hilleary
responded coyly, ``We talked about it quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though Hilleary and Graham own the townhouse, located not far from the house
shared by the seven congressmen, the Tennessean is quick to say buying the home
``was not indicative of `going Washington''' and losing touch with his roots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To my knowledge, we've never used the oven, and that's after five years,''
he said. ``I don't really live here. I exist here.''

<HEADLINE> Spotlight on Fertility Fraud Trial  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Infertile couples and doctors across the country are
closely watching the federal trial of a Park Avenue specialist accused of
tricking insurance companies into paying for fertility treatments most are loath
to cover.
</P>
<P>
	   Some experts say that what Dr. Neils Lauersen is accused of doing is a
common, unspoken practice among many doctors. What makes the case extraordinary
is that Lauersen has been charged by prosecutors with fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, 63, is accused of getting insurers to pay millions of dollars in
coverage for hundreds of patients over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   According to prosecutors, he helped couples get pregnant by providing
fertility treatments not covered by insurance. Then, he allegedly submitted
bills for various covered treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sort of thing is unfortunately very widespread," said Michael Diegel,
spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Lauersen's trial should be a warning to all doctors tempted to bend
the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen could get up to 10 years in prison on the most serious of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Diegel's coalition -- made up of consumers, government agencies, public
interest groups and insurers -- estimated that health insurance fraud cost
insurers $53.9 billion in 1997. Much of that cost, he said, must be passed onto
the consumer as higher rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "One trial like this is helpful, but it's a long hard slog to convince
people to change their attitudes," Diegel said. "As many as 40 percent of the
people in this country think insurance fraud is OK."
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen's lawyer, Theodore D. Wells, has said that his client did nothing
wrong and that the doctor merely billed insurers for treating the underlying
problems that cause infertility rather than for the infertility treatments
themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Lauersen's patients have been holding a vigil at the doctor's trial
and have said he was unfairly targeted, in part because he speaks out against
insurance companies that deny infertility coverage. Many of his patients
consider him a hero for making it possible for them to conceive.
</P>
<P>
	   Paulina Vizgan, 32, of Brooklyn, sitting in the courtroom Monday, said she
named one of her quadruplet boys Neils in honor of the doctor. "He is not a
criminal," Vizgan said. Infertility is "a major disability that impairs people's
lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Cardillo, 28, of West Hampstead, said it is "not fair that they
cover Viagra and stuff for men and not this, which is for life." She said
Lauersen was "very caring, loving, dedicated and he makes every patient his
life."
</P>
<P>
	   Diegel estimated that half of all U.S. doctors are willing to bend the rules
to get insurers to pay for patient treatments. But doctors groups disagreed that
abuse is widespread.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our members follow the law," said Debra Crawford, spokeswoman for the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. But she added that society members
would be pleased if more insurers covered infertility treatments, which often
run into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've seen insurance companies getting a little greedier as time goes on
and covering less and less," Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
	   A single attempt to produce a child through in vitro fertilization or other
methods that rely on the processing of sperm and eggs in the laboratory can cost
as much as $7,500.
</P>
<P>
	   About 46,000 doctors nationwide provide infertility treatment to about 6.1
million couples, but insurance companies have been reluctant to cover
infertility.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis Jay, executive director of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud,
said insurance companies are an easy target because they now wield so much more
power than they did in the days when doctors "had it their own way, like an
American Express card, an unlimited amount they could charge."
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of them did not abuse that, but a large enough number did and that
burned a lot of insurance companies," he said. "Now the pendulum has swung back
the other way."
</P>
<P>
	   Linda Lyons, 38, another of Lauersen's patients, had bitter words for the
managed care system: "They're giving insurance companies more and more power as
to whether we live and die or whether we have children."
</P>
<P>
	   Three states -- Arkansas, Hawaii and Maryland -- require insurance companies
to cover, with some limits, in-vitro fertilization, in which sperm and eggs are
processed in a laboratory and inserted in a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   California, Connecticut and Texas require insurance companies to offer
coverage for infertility diagnosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven others -- Illinois, Massachusetts, Montana, New York, Ohio, Rhode
Island and West Virginia -- require some type of infertility coverage, though in
New York it is limited to the "diagnosis and treatment of correctable medical
conditions."
</P>
<P>
	   That often means the treatment of physical problems causing infertility,
such as fibroids, scarring, tubal damage from infection and ovulatory problems.
It does not mean, say, implantation of an embryo.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijani Leader, Clinton Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev met with President
Clinton on Tuesday to seek assistance in settling his country's territorial
dispute with Armenia and discuss construction of an oil pipeline in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev noted that the United States signed an agreement last year to begin
building an oil pipeline from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku across the Black
Sea. ``We had a detailed exchange of views on how to implement that agreement,''
Aliev said.
</P>
<P>
	   A five-year cease-fire between Azerbaijan and Armeni has held. But the two
southern Caucasus nations have yet to resolve a dispute over independence claims
by the Nagorno-Karabakh region now controlled by Armenians but nestled within
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said his chat with Clinton would give ``additional impetus to a final
settlement,'' and called for a repeal of language in the ``Freedom Support Act''
passed by Congress in 1992, which Aliev said laid blame for the conflict on his
nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over 1 million citizens of Azerbaijan have been ousted forcefully from the
occupied lands,'' Aliev asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in a speech Monday night that the countries that are supposed to
lead the group of nations seeking a settlement of the long-running conflict need
to do more.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the United States, Russia and France all need to be more engaged
in seeking a solution, Aliev told the Paul H. Nitze School of International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   As Aliev spoke, about a dozen demonstrators stood across the street,
chanting and waving signs protesting his visit. They accused Aliev, a former
Soviet leader, of a 40-year record of human rights abuse, censorship and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in his speech that he is committed to democracy and free markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Central to U.S. concern with the region is a planned pipeline to carry
Caspian sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and European oil companies, across
Azerbaijan to the Black Sea at Supsa, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Western nations are concerned that any escalation of conflict in the region
will stall the pipeline the way the Chechen conflict has hindered the flow of
oil through another pipeline across Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev praised President Clinton's support for making the Azerbaijan-Georgia
pipeline possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will start construction of the Baku-Supsa main export pipeline very
soon,'' Aliev said. He said Azerbaijan also seeks construction of a gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said he supports giving Nagorno-Karabakh ``the highest degree of
status'' within Azerbaijan, but he said Armenian forces must be withdrawn from
the region and 1 million Azerbaijanis that were driven from the area must be
allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagorno-Karabakh cannot become a second Armenia, he said. ``The Armenian
people already have a nation.''

<HEADLINE> Glickman: Change Crop Subsidies  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farmers are going to be embarrassed by a new program that
will allow giant agricultural operations to get unlimited crop subsidies and
Congress should change it, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said today.
</P>
<P>
	   In a question-and-answer session with farm commodity groups, Glickman said
the program would result in ``some mighty big payments.''
</P>
<P>
	   The program will allow as many as 2,600 farms nationwide to get around the
current $150,000-per-producer limit on crop subsidies. Under the program,
farmers who have reached the payment limit will be allowed to take crop
subsidies in certificates, instead of cash, which they can redeem for
government-held commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   The program effectively abolishes the existing limit on crop subsidies,
which already was doubled from $75,000 last year, critics say. The subsidy
program pays farmers the difference between the market price of major
commodities and government-set minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What it comes down to again is that we're going to subsidize some of the
biggest farmers in the country to drive others out of business,'' said Chuck
Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   Among operations that stand to benefit most, according to Agriculture
Department officials, is cotton giant J.G. Boswell Co., which controls an
estimated 160,000 acres in California's San Joaquin Valley. At current subsidy
rates, a cotton farm can reach the $150,000 payment limit with fewer than 1,000
acres. All major commodities would be eligible for the certificate program.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress authorized the program last fall, and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said today that he agreed to implement it because of pressure from
lawmakers. ``Quite frankly, I didn't like it. I think Congress should change the
law,'' Glickman said, adding that he thinks the program ``will be embarrassing
to American agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's advisers said he had little choice but to approve the program,
given the bipartisan congressional support for it and the possibility that
farmers facing the payment limit would otherwise forfeit up to a million bales
of cotton to the government this year.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA rules allow farmers to put crops under short-term federal loans and
forfeit the commodity to the government instead of repaying the loan. Farmers
would make a profit off the forfeiture -- which doesn't count toward the
$150,000 subsidy limit -- because the market value of the crop is less than the
value of the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cotton Council, which led lobbying for the certificate program,
argued that it would provide for a more orderly marketing of the cotton than
dumping it on the government, which would have sold it later, possibly
depressing prices. The government also would save on storage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From our perspective the best bet for all producers is to get the cotton
out into the market,'' said Bill Gillon, a spokesman for the cotton group.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of agreeing to issue the certificates, Glickman should have
tightened the loan program to make it less advantageous for farmers to forfeit
their crops, Hassebrook said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's decision comes when he is pushing Congress to put more
restrictions on government farm payments and target assistance to small and
medium-sized aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Collins, USDA's chief economist, acknowledged that the certificate
program would do just the opposite. ``There's no doubt it's a concern. Here the
secretary has been advocating a tight payment limit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA estimates that 2,600 farms nationwide will reach the $150,000 cap this
year.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 92.06; Dow Up 99.28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock market measures diverged today, with technology
stocks falling sharply as investors collected profits from a recent run to
record levels. A rally in oil stocks and some bargain-hunting helped lift the
Dow Jones industrials, however.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was down
92.06 at 4,326.49, while the Dow Jones industrial average was up 99.28 at
10,619.12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.26 at 1,386.68.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks fell in the latest show of nervousness from investors who
are worried that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this
year as it works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates
four times since last June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth
has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel fell 3 5/8 to 106 1/4, and Cisco Systems fell 4 23/64 to 126 9/64.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq. Consumer products company 3M rose 5 11/16 to 88 9/16, leading the index.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Exxon Mobil rose 2 13/16 to 79 1/4 as crude oil futures remained above
$30 a barrel. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel Monday for the first time since
the eve of the Persian Gulf War in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose 1 1/16 to 49 15/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman
Brothers analyst raised his rating on Texaco stock today, estimating that shares
will reach 65 within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors
out of the broader market today.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 710.42 million shares at midafternoon,
compared with 615.45 million at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.48 to 535.46.

<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Smashing Pumpkins bassist D'Arcy Wretzky has agreed
to take drug prevention classes in exchange for the dismissal of cocaine
possession charges.
</P>
<P>
	   She appeared in court Monday, accused of buying crack cocaine on Jan. 25 at

<HEADLINE> Branagh: Bold Twist on Shakespeare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- Kenneth Branagh says his latest twist on Shakespeare was a
bold step, especially for his backers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very courageous of them to do an obscure Shakespeare comedy as a
film musical," he said Tuesday after "Love's Labor's Lost" was screened at the
Berlin Film Festival. Branagh directed and stars in the film.
</P>
<P>
	   The original text of the play is interwoven with music from Irving Berlin,
George Gershwin and Cole Porter. Branagh said the film is a "fluffy,
boy-meets-girl story," updated to the 1930s and emulating the screwball
Hollywood comedies of the era.
</P>
<P>
	   Branagh's co-stars include Alicia Silverstone and Nathan Lane, the only one
with musical theater experience.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tried not to let them drag me down," Lane joked at a news conference. "No
actually, I thought everyone did a terrific job. I didn't feel embarrassed at
all."

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Leads Oscar Nods  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- "American Beauty," the dark comedy about
family mayhem in suburbia, led a diverse slate of Oscar contenders with eight
nominations today. "The Cider House Rules" and "The Insider" were right behind
with seven each.
</P>
<P>
	   The three received nominations for best picture along with the supernatural
death-row saga "The Green Mile" and the ghost story "The Sixth Sense."
</P>
<P>
	   A notable omission among the acting contenders: Jim Carrey, who gave a
dead-on impersonation of the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon."
Carrey received back-to-back Golden Globes for that role and 1998's "The Truman
Show" but was not nominated for an Academy Award for either role.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty" also was nominated for best actor and actress for Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening, director Sam Mendes, screenwriter Alan Ball for best
original screenplay, as well as for cinematography, film editing and original
score.
</P>
<P>
	   Bening said the nominations were especially gratifying for a movie that
deals with difficult personal issues, blending wild humor with horrific action.
</P>
<P>
	   "The movie has so many contradictions," Bening said. "Its heart is really in
some very difficult truths. To see it recognized this way really is a surprise."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides best picture, "The Cider House Rules," a story of coming of age in a
New England orphanage, got nominations for supporting actor Michael Caine,
director Lasse Hallstrom, adapted screenplay by John Irving, who wrote the
novel, as well as score, editing and art direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Insider," a portrait of a tobacco-industry whistleblower, also received
nominations for lead actor Russell Crowe, director Michael Mann, adapted
screenplay, cinematography, editing and best sound.
</P>
<P>
	   The ghost story "The Sixth Sense," last year's biggest box-office surprise
with $278 million, received six nominations including one for 11-year-old Haley
Joel Osment for supporting actor, and two for M. Night Shyamalan for directing
and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Crowe and Spacey, the best actor nominees were Richard Farnsworth in
"The Straight Story," Sean Penn in "Sweet and Lowdown" and Denzel Washington in

<P>
	   At 79, Farnsworth was the oldest lead actor nominee ever. Farnsworth
previously was nominated for "Comes a Horseman" in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," Farnsworth said. To celebrate, Farnsworth said he plans to
go out for a taco and a martini with an onion tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   The other lead actress nominees were Janet McTeer in "Tumbleweeds," Julianne
Moore in "The End of the Affair," Meryl Streep in "Music of the Heart" and

Mile," Emily Watson for "Angela's Ashes," and Stanley Kubrick's last movie,
"Eyes Wide Shut."
</P>
<P>
	   Washington's acting nomination was the only one for "The Hurricane," which
had been a leading contender for best picture.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Talented Mr. Ripley," which had been a strong contender for best
picture, lead actor Matt Damon and director Anthony Minghella, was shut out of
those categories. Besides Law, the movie got nominations for adapted screenplay,
original score and two technical awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being John Malkovich," a favorite among critics, received just three
nominations while another critics' favorite, "Topsy-Turvy," got four bids,
including original screenplay by director Mike Leigh.

<P>
	   Nominees in most of the 23 categories were chosen by specific branches of
the academy's 5,300 members, such as actors, directors and film editors. Some
nominations, including documentaries and foreign-language films, were selected

votes for best-picture nominees. The full membership is eligible to vote in all
categories for the awards themselves.

<P>
	   The Oscars will be presented March 26 from the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles and broadcast on ABC.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Tops GOP Trade Agenda  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cementing trade relations with China, opening markets to
Africa and the Caribbean and confirming America's leadership role in world
organizations are the main trade objectives of Congress this year, House
Republican leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In outlining their agenda, Republicans also released a congressional study
finding that the November trade agreement the Clinton administration reached
with China offers real opportunities for U.S. farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   That agreement, committing China to major market-opening measures, sets the
stage for China's accession to the World Trade Organization and requires
Congress to end the annual review of China's trade status and put trade
relations with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The China vote expected this summer, said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., may
be the most important Congress casts this year to maintain the nation's economic
prosperity and leadership in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., described the GOP's three goals
as the ``trade expansion Contract with America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before April, he said, Congress will try to complete legislation to promote
freer trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. The House last year
passed a bill that would allow most products from sub-Saharan Africa to enter
the country with no quotas or duties. The Senate passed a more limited Africa
trade bill and tacked on another measure to promote trade with the Caribbean.
The two chambers have yet to reach a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Second, he said, the House will work to ``soundly defeat'' expected
legislation that would withdraw U.S. support from the WTO. ``The WTO is not the
villain the Seattle radicals and their Washington allies would have us
believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally is the vote on permanent trade status for China, which supporters
say will turn China into a more free and open society and be a significant
benefit to American exporters and investors. Opponents argue it would reward a
despotic, hostile country and take away an important tool to influence China's
human rights and weapons proliferation policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report issued by the
Republicans cited a forecast by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman that U.S.
farm exports could increase by $2 billion annually once the Chinese start
removing barriers cited in the November agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said open trade with China is crucial
in his home state where corn prices are at their lowest in recent history and
Caterpillar tractors are not selling because of the lack of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said he planned to work with President Clinton on the trade agenda
and several Republicans praised the president for his commitment to winning
Democratic support. Dreier said he and other Republicans met Clinton Tuesday
night and ``I believe he is going to do everything he can'' to win the China
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has assigned Commerce Secretary William Daley to lead its
lobbying efforts on the China issue. Permanent trade status is opposed by labor,
human rights and environmental groups, among the Democrats' most important
constituents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on Capitol
Hill,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told farm groups last week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Worried on Heating Oil Costs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the rising cost of home
heating oil was ``deeply troubling'' for low-income families and that the
federal government may release more money to help them warm their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have not closed off any options,'' the president said. ``I'm monitoring
this on a daily basis.'' He spoke briefly with reporters in the Cabinet Room
after crude oil prices climbed above $30 for the first time since the eve of the
Persian Gulf War nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the government has released $200 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. ``We can release more,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said there would be some important meetings among oil-producing
countries within the next few days, ``We will know more about this in a week or
10 days about what the trends are going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the American people are handling the price increase pretty well in
terms of every aspect of our lives because of increased energy efficiency,
except for home heating oil,'' he said. He said many people in New England and
the Mid-Atlantic states ``are still dependent upon a source of heating which the
rest of the country left long ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they are unbelievably burdened by this,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the government's heating oil assistance eases the burden of the
poorest families. ``But there are a lot of working people on modest incomes that
are just getting killed by this, because of their reliance on home heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   He said middle- and lower-income Americans ``have no option to heat their
home but home heating oil. They're the people that are really getting hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Albright To Visit Croatia, Albania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will visit Croatia
on Friday to attend the inauguration of President-elect Stipe Mesic, and then
will travel to Albania for talks with top officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright visited Zagreb on Feb. 2 to endorse the democratic trends in the
country. U.S. officials believe the results of the national elections in Croatia
in January put the country much closer to the European mainstream.
</P>
<P>
	   They also believe the election could serve as a model for opposition groups
in Yugoslavia seeking to dislodge President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip to Albania on Saturday will be Albright's first since the end of
the air war over Yugoslavia in June. She had been prevented from going to Tirana
before now because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Albright will recognize the
role played by the people of Albania during the Kosovo crisis, particularly in
dealing with the hordes Kosovo Albanian refugees who fled to Albania at the
time.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Uses American Accent for Oscars  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT WOLF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- "Being John Malkovich" isn't the half of it. The key to
landing an Oscar nomination Tuesday seemed to rest in being American -- no
matter where you're really from.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's Academy Award crop included senior Britons Sir Ian McKellen and
Dame Judi Dench at their oh-so-most English, while best picture winner
"Shakespeare In Love" paid tribute to Britain's most famous writer.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, however, the prevailing accent was the American one uniting
British nominees Janet McTeer ("Tumbleweeds"), Jude Law ("The Talented Mr.
Ripley") and Michael Caine ("The Cider House Rules"), as well as such Australian
Oscar first-timers as Russell Crowe ("The Insider") and Toni Collette ("The
Sixth Sense").
</P>
<P>
	   Blame it on Gwyneth? That was the theory of veteran nominee Caine, who
received his fifth Oscar nod for playing a pro-abortionist New England doctor in
"The Cider House Rules."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Gwyneth Paltrow playing English gave us all the confidence to play
American," said Caine, 66, referring to her Oscar-winning turn in "Shakespeare
in Love."
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope it's just coincidence," said McTeer, 38, the theater-trained actress
who made a splash playing a blowsy American mom in "Tumbleweeds." "It would be a
shame to think all the British actors are migrating to America to play
Americans."
</P>
<P>
	   In a category all her own was supporting actress nominee Samantha Morton, a
Brit whose performance as the mute laundress in Woody Allen's "Sweet and
Lowdown" required her to play an American -- without speaking a word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're all actors, all international actors," said Morton, 22,
breaking off from feeding her 9-day-old daughter, Esme, to field a reporter's
call.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're a competent actor," she added, "you can play someone from
anywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, this year it seemed to help if the character and/or setting involved
the good ol' U.S. of A.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider first-time nominee Sam Mendes, whose film directing debut on
"American Beauty" puts the country of choice in its title.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to bring an objectivity and an alien eye to bear on a world where
I only sensed what it was," explained Mendes, 34, a Brit whose dark comedy led
the Oscar race with eight nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   America also allowed "a sense of scale that is sometimes very difficult with
a contemporary English film," Mendes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other films -- and filmmakers -- seemed to stray from the United States at
their peril.
</P>
<P>
	   That may explain the relatively short shrift given to Anthony Minghella's
"The Talented Mr. Ripley," which is set mostly in Europe and was passed over for
best picture, actor and director.
</P>
<P>
	   Or critics' darling "Topsy-Turvy," Mike Leigh's biographical film about
those most English of music-makers, Gilbert and Sullivan. Despite winning best
picture and best director from two of four leading American critics'
organizations, the film was nominated only for Leigh's screenplay and a few
technical awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's actually Anglophobia or anything," said Leigh, whose
quintessentially English "Secrets and Lies" was a major Oscar contender three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "American movies, on the whole, are the ones people over there naturally
vote for," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one Briton, meanwhile, was exulting in geographical difference.
</P>
<P>
	   First-time filmmaker Paul Morrison's Welsh-language "Solomon and Gaenor,"
nominated for best foreign film, is set in 1911 and examines an illicit love
affair between a young Jewish man, Solomon, and a Welsh girl, Gaenor. Some of
the dialogue is in Yiddish as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Morrison: "We're very Welsh, very Jewish, very un-American."

<HEADLINE> Navy: New Fighter Plane Is Ready  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A series of flight tests confirmed that the F/A-18 Super
Hornet meets the Navy's needs for a new carrier-based strike fighter and is
ready to enter full-scale production, Navy officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy hopes to receive the go-ahead this spring to begin full-rate
production of the aircraft; it plans to buy 548 planes over the next 10 years.
The total cost, including development, is estimated at $47 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got the best grade possible'' in the flight testing, Capt. James B.
Godwin III, told a news conference. Godwin manages the F/A-18 Super Hornet
program, which is one of the Defense Department's most expensive weapons
projects along with the Air Force's F-22 fighter and the multi-service Joint
Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Hornet is to replace today's older-model F/A-18s as well as the
Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of flight tests from May to November 1999, a Navy test squadron
flew the plane for 1,233 hours in 850 missions and dropped more than 400,000
pounds of bombs. Details of the results are classified secret, but the Navy said
it proved to be ``operationally effective and operationally suitable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Aeronautic Association has called the testing program ``the
most thorough and challenging operational evaluation in the history of naval
aviation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The project has its critics, though. Some in Congress argue that the plane
does not add enough naval strike power to justify the $47 billion cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the Navy's assertion that the plane performed up to expectations
in flight testing, with no new flaws discovered, a spokesman for Defense
Secretary William Cohen said Cohen would review the results before certifying to
Congress that the aircraft is ready to enter full-scale production.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're encouraged by what we've seen so far,'' spokesman Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley said. But there will be ``no short cuts taken'' in certifying the Navy's
own evaluation of the plane's effectiveness and suitability, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy hopes to put the first Super Hornet squadron aboard a carrier, the
USS Abraham Lincoln, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Hornet is an upgraded version of the existing F/A-18 C and D
models. The new E model is a single-seater, and the F model is a two-seater. The
new planes are longer, have greater range, can carry more weapons and
incorporate radar-evading stealth technologies that the older models do not
have.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Hornet is manufactured by a defense industry team led by Boeing
Co.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines surged in January to its highest
level since August 1998. The Federal Reserve reported today that

bargain-hunting helped lift the Dow Jones industrials, however.
Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
138.06 at 10,657.90 while the Nasdaq composite index was down 51.20

nervousness from investors who are worried that the Federal Reserve
will continue raising interest rates this year as it works to keep
inflation under control. Intel fell 3 5/8 to 106 1/4, and Cisco Systems
fell 4 23/64 to 126 9/64. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil rose 2 13/16 to

people will turn to them -- rather than to their governments -- for
solutions to problems, said Juan Somavia, director-general of the

	   French Workweek Law Revision Sought

<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy has improved modestly for the last
five months but recession-weary consumers remain hesitant to spend,
the government said today. The assessment came in a monthly report
by the Economic Planning Agency. Its pronouncements are closely
watched by businesses and analysts as key indicators of the
government's thinking on the state of the world's second-largest
economy. The cautiously optimistic verdict delivered in the
February report was identical to the agency's four previous monthly

<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Even though the minimum price for vodka is about
to go up because of a tax increase, acting President Vladimir Putin
denied Tuesday that the government had decided to raise the price.
The government sets a minimum price for vodka and determines excise
taxes. The price increase that is to take effect Feb. 25 results
from a 40 percent rise in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages.

<HEADLINE> Online Investors Direct Mutual Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street professionals generally dismiss amateur online
stock pickers as an unavoidable upshot of the Internet revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Witz, the 28-year-old founder and chief executive of an innovative
mutual fund Web site called StockJungle.com, sees the cacophony and chaos of the
online investment world in a different light, however.
</P>
<P>
	   StockJungle.com runs the only mutual fund whose stock portfolio is
determined entirely by amateur investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "While there is a lot of clutter on the Internet, there are also a lot of
diamonds, and I felt this resource wasn't being properly recognized," Witz said
in telephone interview from his office in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone can log on to StockJungle.com's Web site and submit their picks for
inclusion in the site's flagship product, the Community Intelligence Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Obviously, not all of the stocks submitted are selected for investments.
And, similar to a traditional mutual fund, all final investment decisions are
made by a professional fund manager.
</P>
<P>
	   But the stocks included in the fund are all selected from picks contributed
by amateurs.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we've seen in a few short months is that the hypothesis that a
community could run a mutual fund is true," Witz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witz, whose background includes stints as a financial analyst and a Web
designer, has coined the term "naked funds" to describe his investment
philosophy. The idea is that the entire process of investing in a mutual fund
can be open to both participation and unfettered scrutiny by the shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutual funds have traditionally been a decidedly passive method of
investing. Witz feels the Internet is the perfect engine for changing that
tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're pulling back the curtain on how a mutual fund works," Witz said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund, which currently has about $500,000 in assets, has risen 41 percent
since it was launched Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   While dismissed by many critics as a gimmick, some professional investors
can't help but admire the innovative concept.
</P>
<P>
	   "Opening up the architecture of mutual funds is an innovative and
interesting idea. It's another step in the democratization of investing," said
Steven Pomeranz, an independent investment adviser in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutual funds have historically been "closed vehicles that act as packaged
products," Pomeranz said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't get to participate. You give your money to a fund manager and you
cross your fingers. Here, you're actually a democratic participant," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Pomeranz said he wouldn't recommend the Community Intelligence
Fund to his clients because the concept is still unproven.
</P>
<P>
	   "The things I recommend are pretty much tried and true," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The StockJungle.com site doesn't lack for ploys to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, amateur stock pickers -- dubbed "Hot Hands" -- who garner top
ratings via the site's proprietary scoring system can earn $50 a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Witz said 2,000 Web surfers have contributed selections to the site.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to being a participatory experience, Witz said online investing
junkies can also drop by the site just to see what their peers are recommending.
</P>
<P>
	   "Individual investors are finding it a great resource for finding new stock
ideas," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the real winners, according to Witz, are those who actually invest in
the fund because they stand to benefit "from the collective wisdom of all the
participants."
</P>
<P>
	   Witz touts StockJungle.com as an investment portal of sorts, not merely a
mutual fund company, a description that undoubtedly helped to attract investment
dollars when the company was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
	   StockJungle.com also offers three other funds, which are more traditional in
nature. The actively managed Pure Play Internet fund tracks companies that earn
at least 50 percent of their revenues from Internet operations. The Market
Leaders Fund is for long-term investors who want exposure to proven industry
leaders. And the S&AMP;P 500 Index fund tracks the performance of the widely
followed index.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' endorsement unofficial - but welcomed by Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - It was a sudden show of support, a standing
ovation followed by an impromptu endorsement from the floor packed with
Teamsters representing locals from South Carolina to Maine.
<P>
	   The backing was unofficial for Bill Bradley, who has walked picket lines in
his campaign for union support. The national Teamsters organization remains
neutral in the Democratic presidential race, and front-runner Al Gore carries
most Big Labor support, including an AFL-CIO endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   But searching for a crack in Gore's wall of labor backing, Bradley basked in
the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   He had just addressed about 400 union leaders attending the 13-state Eastern
regional meeting of the Teamsters at a casino hotel here.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that the AFL-CIO has endorsed Al Gore," Bradley told the delegates.
"But that doesn't decrease my commitment to working people in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "My position on labor law reform, my position on health care, my position on
the minimum wage, my position on all of these issues is not related to whether I
got an endorsement or not from the leadership of the AFL-CIO. It's related to my
commitment to what a just society should be and to the working people of the
country."
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley shook hands and prepared to leave, Teamsters vice president
Thomas O'Donnell entertained a motion to endorse the former New Jersey senator.
It passed by acclamation, although many in the audience were talking or crowding
around Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did not know it was coming, and I think it's pretty significant," said
Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chip Roth, a spokesman for the Teamsters attending the conference, said
the "spontaneous expression of support" carried no official weight.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty obvious that this entire body would like to endorse Bill
Bradley," O'Donnell declared, promising to communicate the group's support to
his fellow national leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth agreed that the group's sentiments would be expressed to national
headquarters, but he added that the union was still studying Gore and
Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan, an outspoken critic of free-trade
deals that Gore and Bradley both support, is another option. "He's the best of
the candidates on trade," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicate that Gore's strong support from organized labor has
played a role in his success in the primaries to date.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Gore and Bradley split the votes of non-union families,
while Gore got almost two-thirds from those with a union member. In Iowa and
Delaware, Gore got two-thirds of the vote from voters in union households.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to win labor support, Bradley has rallied with strikers,
pledged to ease rules on picketing and touted his own days as a shop steward for
the professional basketball players' union.
</P>
<P>
	   He is hoping to keep the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers - which
together represent 2 million of the 13 million AFL-CIO members - from signing on
to the Gore endorsement issued by the overall union in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is actively helping Gore, but its leaders admit the unions would
be better off with a united front.
</P>
<P>
	   "Really, in some ways, we're hamstrung by not having every union on board,"
AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told the conference of growing up in Crystal City, Mo., around
neighbors who had good wages and good benefits because the local glass factory
was unionized. His uncle, by contrast, worked in a lead factory without a union
and, after decades of work, ended up with a pension of $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   For nine of his 10 years in professional basketball, Bradley was shop
steward on the New York Knicks. He recalled that the union made a deal with a
basketball card manufacturer but owners responded by saying the team names could
not appear on the cards.	   "I said OK, everybody on the team, turn your shirt
around," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bradley finished his speech, a member of the audience showed him a
souvenir he had brought - a 1971 basketball card of Bradley, his shirt on
backwards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the only presidential candidate, the only presidential candidate, who
has a union pension," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He held his hand at a 45-degree angle while saying the playing field is
slanted against union organizing. He proposed increasing the damages to be paid
by companies found to have fired an employee illegally for organizing a union.
And he said firms that break labor laws should not get contracts from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has rallied with striking Teamsters in Iowa and in New Jersey. Gore
has also visited picketers, bringing coffee to one group of strikers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 190.49; Nasdaq Down 20.16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock market measures diverged today, with a rally in oil
stocks and some bargain-hunting buoying the Dow Jones industrials. In a major
turnaround from recent weeks, the strength in blue-chips helped pull technology
stocks out of a slump.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 190.49 at 10,710.33 while the Nasdaq composite index
was down 20.16 at 4,398.39. In earlier trading, the Nasdaq had been down as much
as 127 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.15 at 1,400.09.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq. Consumer products company 3M rose 5 11/16 to 88 9/16, leading the index.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Exxon Mobil rose 3 9/16 to 80 as crude oil futures remained above $30
a barrel. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel Monday for the first time since the
eve of the Persian Gulf War in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose 1 1/4 to 50 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman
Brothers analyst raised his rating on Texaco stock today, estimating that shares
will reach 65 within the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors
out on edge today.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks fell in the latest show of nervousness from investors who
are worried that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this
year as it works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates
four times since June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth has
slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems fell 2 7/16 to 128 1/16, and MCI WorldCom fell 1 25/32 to 48
9/32.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, however, some massive gains from a handful of technology
stocks were powering the index higher. Rambus rose 52 9/16 to 164 on the
expectation that Intel will use its technology to manufacture high-speed
computer chips.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 849.54 million shares at late afternoon,
compared with 734.72 million at the same time Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.68 to 538.26.

<HEADLINE> Religious Rights, Stock Market Eyed  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new government commission seeking to foster religious
freedom opened its first hearing Tuesday at odds with the Treasury Department
over whether to stop abusive governments from raising money on U.S. stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing focused immediately on the link between a Chinese government oil
company, building a pipeline in Sudan, and that country's radical government,
which is accused of killing 14 children and a teacher in a bombing raid on a
Roman Catholic school last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sudanese government has said if its plane killed children, it was an
accident of war because rebel fighters were massed near the school.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, an exiled Sudanese Catholic bishop said the Feb. 8 bombing
was intentional and accused the government of trying to kill off the country's
Roman Catholic minority. ``If you destroy the fruit, you will have no more trees
tomorrow,'' Bishop Macram Max Gassis said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which is to take up
abuses of religion in Russia and China later in the year, has appealed to
President Clinton to prohibit the Chinese company and others from using U.S.
capital markets to finance the Sudanese pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department insists that existing sanctions against Sudan cannot
apply to capital markets. The United States contends Sudan exports terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Treasury's position, the commission has appointed a task force to
monitor plans by China National Oil Co. to raise money through a listing on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   PetroChina is expected to proceed with an initial public offering in excess
of $5 billion in the next several weeks, said Roger Robinson Jr., a former
National Security Council director who is now chairman of the William J. Casey
Institute of the Center for Security Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese investment in the 940-mile pipeline from Heglid in southern Sudan to
Port Sudan on the Red Sea, completed in September, is part of PetroChina's
largest overseas venture. The Chinese oil company also helped build a refinery
in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the commission needs to evaluate whether the Chinese offering can
ensure that money raised in U.S. markets are not diverted to the oil company's
project in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   The school bombing in central Sudan was associated with the government's
17-year civil war with southern rebels, which has led to an estimated 2 million
deaths from fighting or war-induced famine.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels seek autonomy for Christian and animist southern Sudanese from
the government dominated by ethnically Arab Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   Commission members have said they plan to meet with experts and market
managers to explore ``voluntary adoption of human rights and religious-freedom
criteria'' for entry into U.S. stock markets, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said going after entry into U.S. markets by rights abusers may be more
effective than sanctions, which tend to hurt U.S. exporters and investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-member religious freedom commission appointed by the president and
congressional leaders was set up to advise the State Department and the White
House on protection of religious freedom around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized under a 1998 law that arose partly out of rising congressional
unease about alleged persecution of Christians abroad, it is headed by a rabbi
and a law school dean and includes people of the Christian, Muslim and Baha'i
faiths.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the law that created the panel, the State Department designated China,
Iran, Iraq, Burma and Sudan as ``countries of particular concern'' for religious
freedom. That designation subjects them to diplomatic and economic sanctions.
The department also lists Serbia and the Taliban movement that rules most of
Afghanistan as ``particularly severe violators of religious freedom.''

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Reclaims Nielsens Top Spot  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With two of their favorite characters in danger, viewers
returned to NBC's "ER" last week and enabled the drama to reclaim the top spot
in the ratings from "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   "ER" ended its ratings sweeps month episode in a cliffhanger after both Noah
Wyle's and Kellie Martin's characters were stabbed and left clinging to life.
Since Martin has already announced that she's leaving the series, it's wise not
to place bets on her survival.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode drew 31 million viewers, well above the "ER" season average of
24 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that there's anything wrong with "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." The
game show kept humming along, drawing more than 30 million viewers twice last
week and nearly 28 million the other time. It led ABC to another weekly win in
the ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS's "60 Minutes" had its best ratings of the year, after it reran a
profile of "Peanuts" creator Charles Schulz on Sunday night, less than 24 hours
after he died.
</P>
<P>
	   Two movies performed well last week: ABC's "Mary and Rhoda" reunion drew 17
million viewers, and CBS's re-enactment of Thomas Jefferson's romance with Sally
Hemings had 19 million people watching.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's "The Practice" continued the ratings momentum it generated with its
episode after the Super Bowl, but the news wasn't as good for another
long-running ABC drama. "NYPD Blue" lost in its time slot to CBS's "Judging Amy"
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week, ABC had 14.9 million viewers (9.9 rating, 16 share). NBC was
second with 13.5 million viewers (9.3 rating, 15 share), and beat ABC among
18-to-49-year-olds. CBS had 12.9 million (8.9, 14), Fox had 9.7 million (6.4,
10), UPN had 4.3 million (2.9, 5), the WB had 3.9 million (2.8, 4), and Pax TV
had 1 million (0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" led the evening news competition with 11.2 million
viewers (8.3 rating, 16 share), ABC's "World News Tonight" had 10.9 million
viewers (8.0, 16) and the "CBS Evening News" had 9.8 million viewers (7.2, 14).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Feb. 7-13, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were:
</P>
<P>
	   "ER," NBC, 20.9; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 19.2; "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday), ABC, 17.8; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
(Thursday), ABC, 17.7; "Friends," NBC, 15.4; "60 Minutes," CBS, 14.9; "Frasier,"
NBC, 14.1; "CBS Sunday Movie: Sally Hemings: American Scandal," CBS, 13.5; "ABC
Monday Night Movie: Mary and Rhoda," ABC, 13.3; "The Practice," ABC, 12.9;
"Touched By an Angel," CBS, 12.9.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Tops GOP Trade Agenda  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cementing trade relations with China, opening markets to
Africa and the Caribbean and confirming America's leadership role in world
organizations are the main trade objectives of Congress this year, House
Republican leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In outlining their agenda, Republicans also released a congressional study
finding that the November trade agreement the Clinton administration reached
with China offers real opportunities for U.S. farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   That agreement, committing China to major market-opening measures, sets the
stage for China's accession to the World Trade Organization and requires
Congress to end the annual review of China's trade status and put trade
relations with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The China vote expected this summer, said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., may
be the most important Congress casts this year to maintain the nation's economic
prosperity and leadership in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., described the GOP's three goals
as the ``trade expansion Contract with America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before April, he said, Congress will try to complete legislation to promote
freer trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. The House last year
passed a bill that would allow most products from sub-Saharan Africa to enter
the country with no quotas or duties. The Senate passed a more limited Africa
trade bill and tacked on another measure to promote trade with the Caribbean.
The two chambers have yet to reach a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Second, he said, the House will work to ``soundly defeat'' expected
legislation that would withdraw U.S. support from the WTO. ``The WTO is not the
villain the Seattle radicals and their Washington allies would have us
believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally is the vote on permanent trade status for China, which supporters
say will turn China into a more free and open society and be a significant
benefit to American exporters and investors. Opponents argue it would reward a
despotic, hostile country and take away an important tool to influence China's
human rights and weapons proliferation policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report issued by the
Republicans cited a forecast by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman that U.S.
farm exports could increase by $2 billion annually once the Chinese start
removing barriers cited in the November agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department repeated on Tuesday that sales of farm products
to China could triple to $3 billion annually and tariffs on beef alone could
drop from 45 percent to 12 percent if China enters the WTO. Glickman told farm
lobbyists they have to be ``intent and focused'' on the matter and urged them to
organize pressure from farmers and other constituents on members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said open trade with China is crucial
in his home state where corn prices are at their lowest in recent history and
Caterpillar tractors are not selling because of the lack of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said he planned to work with President Clinton on the trade agenda
and several Republicans praised the president for his commitment to winning
Democratic support. Dreier said he and other Republicans met Clinton Tuesday
night and ``I believe he is going to do everything he can'' to win the China
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has assigned Commerce Secretary William Daley to lead its
lobbying efforts on the China issue. Permanent trade status is opposed by labor,
human rights and environmental groups, among the Democrats' most important
constituents.

<HEADLINE> New York state's highest court hears commuter tax case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York City lawyers will argue Tuesday before the
state's highest court that legislators, preoccupied with winning a special
election in the state Senate, improperly rescinded a lucrative local tax on
commuters.
<P>
	   The only way the state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki could legally have
eliminated the city's tax was if the New York City Council had first passed a
"home rule" message requesting that it do so, the city's lawyers will contend.
No such home rule message was ever passed.
</P>
<P>
	   Also before the Court of Appeals Tuesday will be lawyers for Pennsylvania
and Connecticut. They will argue that if the elimination of the commuter tax is
upheld for New York state residents who work in the city but live outside the
five boroughs, then it is unconstitutional for the city to continue taxing
commuters living in their states.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven-member Court of Appeals is expected to hear more than an hour of
arguments in the case and to hand down a written ruling within six weeks. The
judges have promised to handle the case - various earlier legal actions against
the commuter tax were consolidated into one case for reasons of the appeal - in
an expedited fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both friends and foes of rescinding the commuter tax agree that its demise
was precipitated by local politics.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a tough special election race to fill a vacant state Senate seat
in New York City's northern suburbs, the Democratic candidate stated that if
elected, he would not vote to extend the commuter tax. Republican candidate
Thomas Morahan - the eventual winner - said he would go one better and work to
repeal the tax altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   To the dismay of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Legislature and
Pataki quickly did away with the tax, even before the special election was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he and the Legislature did the right thing and it's time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the commuter tax is gone," Pataki said Tuesday at an appearance at
a high-tech research center in Albany. "I think it's a good thing that will help
the state's economy and certainly help the city's economy. People will no longer
have a reason to avoid working or having their office located in New York City."
</P>
<P>
	   The case puts Giuliani, who is expected to run for Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton this November, in the somewhat uncomfortable position of pursuing
a court case to make hundreds of thousands of commuters - and potential voters -
pay a tax to the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have the advantage and disadvantage of holding a public office that is
one of the most difficult in the country," he said Monday when asked about the
case. "The things that I did as mayor of New York City to protect the people of
New York City I would equally as strongly and equally as well do to protect the
people of the state of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Some 300,000 commuters from surrounding states work in New York City daily.
About 500,000 others come in from New York counties outside the five boroughs.
The city's 0.45 percent income tax totals $450 on an income of $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   A complete repeal could cost the city as much as $360 million a year;
repealing the tax only for New York residents would cost $210 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Settlement means tobacco deal money can begin flowing into New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey will soon see the first installment
of its multibillion-dollar share of the national tobacco settlement after a
legal settlement reached Tuesday removed the last roadblock to disbursing the
money.
<P>
	   The first installment of over $180 million had been delayed for about two
months because two lawyers representing 12 smokers objected to the state's
settlement with big tobacco, saying more antismoking measures should have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   The money, currently being held in an interest-bearing escrow account, could
be available in several weeks, said Michael A. Ferrara Jr., a lawyer on the
six-firm group hired by New Jersey to pursue the state case against cigarette
makers, which focused on reimbursement for Medicaid expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a handful of states have not yet begun receiving tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's deal, reached after late-night talks, was concluded in the morning
outside a courtroom where an appellate panel was about to hear arguments on
efforts by the smokers' lawyers to intervene in the state settlement. The state
opposed that effort.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal requires Gov. Christie Whitman to recommend in her remaining
budgets that $30 million from the tobacco settlement go toward stop-smoking
programs each year.
</P>
<P>
	   She has already made that suggestion in the first of those budgets,
proposing that $8.7 million of the $30 million be spent on programs for addicted
adults and youth; $7 million for community tobacco control programs; $6.3
million for a youth anti-smoking awareness media campaign; $5 million for youth
antismoking programs, and $3 million for administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Through our efforts, the people of the state of New Jersey will have the
benefit of smoking cessation programs that they might not otherwise have had,"
said Terry Paul Bottinelli, one of the lawyers for the 12 smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he hoped that such programs would ultimately garner $750 million
from the state's $7.6 billion share of the national tobacco settlement, which is
to be received over 25 years. The state stood to lose all the money if the
intervention case had not concluded by Dec. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the state's $300 million tobacco money infusion in the next fiscal year,
Whitman proposed spending one-third to provide health insurance for low- and
middle-income workers and one-third on new school construction, part of a $10
billion building program.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the deal, programs that had been suspended can now resume,
the governor said Tuesday, noting that antismoking billboards that came down
will be replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bottinelli's clients, Bruce S. Shortino of Clifton, works as a
security guard in the Morris County Courthouse where the appellate hearing was
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortino, 53, a smoker for 35 years, said he has been unable to quit "cold
turkey." Since the private agency he works for provides no benefits, and he
cannot afford treatment, Shortino said he was happy that money may be available
to help smokers stop.
</P>
<P>
	   "If funds are put aside, I'll be the first one in line. I desperately want
to quit smoking," Shortino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Bottinelli and his co-counsel, Marc C. Saperstein, did not get any
fees as part of Tuesday's deal, they still hope to get compensation from an
alliance of 60 law firms that represents individuals who have sued the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   They negotiated a mention in the state attorney general's news release that
announced the settlement and will present that to the alliance, of which they
are a part, Bottinelli said.

<HEADLINE> Feds probe $200,000 missing church grant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Federal prosecutors are investigating the
handling of a $200,000 grant given to a Bridgeport church to help homeless
veterans.
<P>
	   The findings of the U.S. attorney's investigation will be presented to a
grand jury, according to Kerri Childress, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs. Childress said it would be up to the grand jury to decide
whether an indictment should be issued.
</P>
<P>
	   The VA gave the $200,000 to the Shiloh Baptist Church in Bridgeport in
January 1997, as the first part of a $500,000 award, Childress said. The money
is unaccounted for, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money was to be used to develop the Bridgeport Living Skills Center - a
live-in facility for homeless veterans to be built at the former Park City
Hospital administration building.
</P>
<P>
	   "The VA carefully monitors grant money. It is disbursed incrementally to
ensure work is being done, and the VA receives verification on an ongoing
basis," Childress said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned whenever money isn't used for its intended purpose," she
said. "Results of the investigation are pending."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Carl McCluster, pastor of Shiloh Baptist, would not discuss the
matter and referred questions to his two lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his attorneys, Hugh F. Keefe, said it is too early to discuss the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one has indicated to me that he has been charged, or will be charged,
with any crime," Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCluster's other attorney, William J. Egan, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Calvin Kurimai, whose office Childress said is
handling the investigation, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Living Skills Center was to house homeless veterans while they learned
to manage money, become substance-free and search for long-term housing.
</P>
<P>
	   A new, nonprofit organization plans to apply for a grant to open a new
facility to serve homeless veterans in Bridgeport. Applied Behavioral
Rehabilitation Institute, a group based in New Haven, expects to apply for a new
VA grant next month, said John Wygmans, the institute's president.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart's 4Q Profits Up 23 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s fourth-quarter profits rose 23
percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales growth at its U.S. superstores
and operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While the results reported Thursday by the world's largest retailer were
slightly above expectations, its stock fell nearly 3 percent on concerns that
its growth may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart earned $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Jan. 31, compared with $1.56 billion, up from 35 cents a share a year ago.
That's above the 42 cents a share that analysts' had forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly sales totaled $51.39 billion, an increase of 26 percent over the
$40.79 billion in the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a
year, an industry gauge of performance, rose 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at its Wal-Mart stores rose 12.6 percent in the quarter, boosted by
gains at its SuperCenters, which combine discount and grocery stores. Sales at
its Sam's Club warehouse stores increased 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   International sales gained about 164 percent, fueled by strength in its
Mexican, Canadian, British and Puerto Rican division.
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, Wal-Mart named Lee Scott as president and chief
executive officer, replacing David Glass who will remain at the company for a
year as chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who was Wal-Mart's chief operating officer and vice chairman, had
been tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also took some significant steps during the quarter to beef up
its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Wal-Mart teamed up with America Online Inc. to develop an
Internet service provider and offer discounted Web access to people who
currently may not have an affordable phone hookup in towns near its 2,500
stores. The name and price of the ISP have not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the company relaunched www.Walmart.com, which now stocks more
than 600,000 items and offers a wide array of services, such as travel
reservations. It also formed a new Internet company with venture-capital firm
Accel Partners, which will work to enhance the giant retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wal-Mart continues to outpace most of its rivals with its sharp
growth, there were fears that its pace may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times in the last year to
fend off inflationary pressure -- and may raise rates further. That has raised
concerns that consumer spending may slow in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the real issue affecting all retailers right now," said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart also said that it will continue aggressively cutting prices, which
the company calls "rollbacks." But such promotions will be more difficult in the
coming year because of high raw material prices, increased labor costs and
strengthening of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The "rollbacks" have been one of Wal-Mart's key marketing strategies to woo
shoppers into its stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart's shares were down $1.68 3/4 at $57.18 3/4 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer's stock was
down as low as $55 in early trading.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Wal-Mart earned $5.58 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with
$4.43 billion, or 99 cents a share, in 1998. Sales for the year were $165
billion, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Its annual results do not include a 4-cent reduction due to a change in
rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission in how Wal-Mart accounts for
membership revenues at its Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart operated 1,801 Wal-Mart stores, 721 Supercenters,
and 463 Sam's Clubs in the United States. Internationally, the company operated
13 units in Argentina, 14 in Brazil, 166 in Canada, six in China, 95 in Germany,
five in Korea, 462 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico and 232 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart employs more than 885,000 people in the United States and 255,000
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Dad Asks Reno for Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP ) -- Increasingly frustrated by his son's extended stay in the
United States, Elian Gonzalez's father has sent Attorney General Janet Reno a
letter demanding the boy be returned to him right away.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in as many weeks was published
in Cuba on Tuesday. In the letter, Gonzalez says he does not recognize the
jurisdiction of the U.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt by
6-year-old Elian's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are
arbitrarily retaining Elian,'' Gonzalez said in the letter, dated Monday and
published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle since he was
rescued from an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy's mother
and 10 other people died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is
fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States. with Cuban exiles in
Miami say the boy's mother died to give him freedom in the United States and the
Cuban government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday
arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba
without holding a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives' suit,
arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled last
month that only Elian's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first letter earlier this month, Gonzalez pressed Reno to return the
boy to him. He said that in the meantime, his son should be placed with Manolo
Gonzalez, another great-uncle in Miami. Manolo has said he supports the child's
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' the father wrote in his first letter. ``Elian has been
under constant harassment and pressure from politicians, journalists, lawyers,
publicity agents and others unrelated to his family.''

<HEADLINE> Vatican Joins Palestinian Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By VICTOR L. SIMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican joined the Palestinians on Tuesday in
condemning Israel's hold over all of Jerusalem as ``morally and legally
unacceptable,'' aggravating the Israelis just a month before the pope's visit to
the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   An agreement signed by the Vatican and Palestinian officials called for an
internationally guaranteed statute to preserve ``the proper identity and sacred
character'' of the city, which is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   The text did not mention Israel by name, but the Jewish state has
consistently considered Jerusalem its indivisible capital since it annexed the
eastern section following the 1967 Mideast War. It has repeatedly ignored
previous Vatican calls for such a statute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican, like many states, has never recognized Israel's occupation of
eastern Jerusalem. The final status of the city is to be decided in talks
between Israelis and the Palestinians, acknowledged as one of the most difficult
points in the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong wording in Tuesday's bilateral agreement appeared to take the
Israelis by surprise. The Foreign Ministry said the Vatican's representative in
Israel has been asked to come to an ``urgent meeting'' Wednesday to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel flatly rejects the references to Jerusalem in the aforementioned
document,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``Jerusalem, was,
is, and shall remain the capital of the State of Israel, and no agreement or
declaration by these or any other parties will change this fact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zvi Tal, spokesman for Israel's embassy to the Holy See, said that while the
Vatican's stance was known, Tuesday's action amounted to interference in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. He also said the Palestinians appeared
to have breached an agreement with Israel limiting the types of further
agreements they could make.

<P>
	   The accord signed Tuesday covers the Vatican's relations with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and the status of churches and freedom of worship in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   It was signed on the same day that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with
Pope John Paul II and offered a last-minute invitation -- accepted by the pope
-- to add another Palestinian city, Jericho, to his Holy Land itinerary. The
pope is also scheduled to visit Bethlehem and a Palestinian refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's stance underscored difficulties the pope may face on his March
20-26 tour of Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories. During a 1998
visit to Israel, the Vatican's foreign minister caused a stir when he called the
Israeli presence in east Jerusalem an ``illegal occupation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Worried on Heating Oil Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday the federal government is
willing to give more help to families ``that are really getting hurt'' by the
soaring cost of home heating oil in New England and the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the government has released $200 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. ``We can release more,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will travel to Boston on Wednesday to meet
with leaders of industry and consumer groups about fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising cost of heating oil has become an issue in the Senate race
between the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and her likely Republican
rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The mayor has urged the president to
release oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve to offset oil price
increases that have put the price above $30 for the first time since the eve of
the Persian Gulf War nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   That war marked the only time the reserve was tapped since its establishment
a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have not closed off any options,'' the president said, talking with
reporters in the Cabinet Room during a meeting with high technology officials.
``I'm monitoring this on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has refused to dip into the petroleum reserve, created to
deal with national emergencies. White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said
Clinton ``does not believe it's appropriate to draw down'' the reserve now.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Lockhart said, ``This situation is one that involves watching
further, and that context may change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said important meetings are scheduled among oil-producing countries
within the next few days. ``We will know more about this in a week or 10 days,
about what the trends are going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the American people are handling the price increase pretty well in
terms of every aspect of our lives because of increased energy efficiency,
except for home heating oil,'' he said. He said many people in New England and
Middle Atlantic states ``are still dependent upon a source of heating which the
rest of the country left long ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they are unbelievably burdened by this,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the government's heating oil assistance eases the burden of the
poorest families, ``but there are a lot of working people on modest incomes that
are just getting killed by this, because of their reliance on home heating
oil.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said middle- and lower-income Americans ``have no option to heat their
home but home heating oil. They're the people that are really getting hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Two Tobacco Cos. Discussed Pricing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The world's two largest tobacco companies discussed pricing
and ways to share markets in Guatemala and Costa Rica, the Financial Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives from Philip Morris Cos. and British American Tobacco Co. Ltd.
talked about policies to avoid "destabilization" of one of the markets during a
1992 meeting at a hotel outside London, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The document came to light since the U.S. Justice Department filed a
class-action lawsuit last week that accuses major American cigarette
manufacturers of meeting secretly to illegally fix prices they charge
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
	   The six pages of notes, marked "secret," are among some 8 million pages of
documents that have been displayed publicly at a depository that British
American Tobacco set up in Guildford, Surrey, near London. The company put the
documents on display after major tobacco companies settled lawsuits filed
against them by all 50 U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
	   Under that 1998 settlement, the companies agreed to pay states $246 billion
for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris acknowledged that it has discussed pricing "on a few
occasions" with BAT representatives in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   "These discussions took place only where permitted by law and often at the
request of local governments," spokeswoman Elizabeth Cho said from the company's
New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   BAT spokeswoman Jody Humble called the report "an old story" about a
document that first surfaced in late 1998, during litigation brought against the
company by the Washington state attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   "These issues were looked at the time, and the review indicated that we
didn't have a problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting notes helped trigger an antitrust investigation in Venezuela,
but BAT was cleared last April of any wrongdoing, she added.
</P>
<P>
	   The notes say Philip Morris complained that BAT's subsidiary in Guatemala
had lowered the price of Lucky Strike cigarettes in a supermarket chain to less
than that of Philip Morris' Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
	   BAT ascertained that the price reduction was a short-term promotion and
added that it came after a similar move by Philip Morris, the Financial Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris also complained about promotions in Costa Rica, and BAT
responded that it needed to recover market share and eliminate differences in
pricing there, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Election Rally Signals Change  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- In a rare show of public gaiety in Islamic Iran,
thousands of young Iranians clasped hands and danced to Westernized music on
Tuesday at an election rally for a reformist candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Dancing in public places, even in sexually segregated groups as occurred
Tuesday, is virtually unheard of in Iran. The event showed how many young
Iranians yearn for public freedom in a country where nearly every aspect of life
is dictated by Islamic laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Social freedoms form the bedrock of the campaign by reformist candidates in
Friday's elections for the 290-member parliament, or Majlis. Pitted against the
reformists, who are backed by moderate President Mohammad Khatami, are
conservatives who want to maintain the strict Islamic rule imposed after the
1979 Islamic revolution brought the clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
	   During Tuesday's election rally, a band began playing Farsi-language pop
songs after a brief speech by Faezeh Hashemi, a female reformist candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   As the tempo got faster, about 5,000 young people -- in separate groups of
males and females -- swayed to the music, held hands, raised their arms in the
air and waved them to and fro.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conservative voters who turned up for the rally at the Shiroudi
basketball arena in central Tehran were shocked by the singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not proper according to our Islamic culture. It is un-Islamic for
young girls and boys to be dancing together. I am afraid taboos will be broken
if this liberal type of campaign continues,'' said Taqi Alizadeh, a hard-line
supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing the music would invite a crackdown by police, who are under the
control of hard-liners, the organizers of Tuesday's rally asked the musicians to
leave after about 30 minutes. Although public concerts are not banned, dancing
is.
</P>
<P>
	   If it were up to the reformists, Iranian women would be able to ride
bicycles freely in the streets and venture outdoors without the obligatory
head-to-toe covering, or hijab -- activities conservatives condemn as
un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters after the rally, Hashemi said women ``have to break
this taboo and start riding bicycles in public.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hashemi, the daughter of Iran's former president Hashemi Rafsanjani, even
went so far as to say the Islamic hijab should not be obligatory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I personally like the hijab, but I don't see the logic in obliging people
to wear the hijab. Women should decide whether or not to wear it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake in Friday's election are issues beyond women's wardrobes and their
mode of transport.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners have proposed a law that would allow the arrest of
journalists who write articles deemed critical of the ruling clerics. Currently
only newspaper managers have been arrested and jailed for publishing offending
articles. Several newspapers also have been closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed law will be voted on by the new parliament, which convenes in
June.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists have vowed to defeat the bill and scrap special clerical courts
they contend favor clerics in their disputes with ordinary Iranians. The courts
have also been used to quell criticism of the ruling clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I get elected I will vote against the proposed press restrictions and
for greater freedom of the press,'' reformist candidate Jamileh Kadivar said.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with a clear majority, reformists will not be able to make all the
changes they are promising.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has the final say on all
matters. He can veto the president, and controls the army, judiciary, and the
state-run radio and television.
</P>
<P>
	   But the hard-liners are also worried by the popularity of Khatami, who since
his landslide election in 1997, has allowed greater press and social freedoms.

<HEADLINE> Senate Republicans want bigger Tuition Assistance Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state Senate proposal would almost double Tuition
Assistance Program grants, make more families eligible for the college aid, and
make tuition tax deductible.
<P>
	   Senate Republicans proposed Tuesday to make the TAP available in households
with income up to $80,000 a year, up from $50,500 after deductions. Tuition
would be tax deductible and the amount the state provides for each tuition grant
would be increased - the current minimum of $275 would be changed to $500 after
two years - under the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel this doesn't represent spending, this is an investment," Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said during a press conference when asked how he
could justify the $65 million his plan would cost the state in the first year
and the $365 million it would cost over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki had a lukewarm response to the proposal, saying he would
look at it. His budget office said New York State's Tuition Assistance Program
is already far more generous than programs in all other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's camp said they have their own plans for
higher education spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said the income requirements should be relaxed because the economy has
improved so much that many earn too much to qualify. Bruno gave Sen. Kenneth
LaValle, chairman of the Senate's Higher Education Committee, credit for
developing the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   -Changes over four years in both tuition assistance and tax deductions. In
the first year, the minimum grant award would be $400 for all classes and the
maximum would go to $5,000 for freshman. After four years, the maximum award
would be $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -Tax savings according to income levels. For a two-parent family that earns
$20,000 annually and has one of two children attending a private college, the
savings would be $200. For the same-sized family with an income of $75,000, the
tax savings would be $1,130. The tax deductions would be implemented gradually
over a four-year period - 25 percent of tuition expenses in the first year, 50
percent in the second year, and so on up to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   -Tuition awards of $170 for juniors and seniors who maintain a 3.5 grade
point average. That's in addition to a $170 award already in place for students
who perform community service.
</P>
<P>
	   -The plan offers lesser savings for families with students who attend the
State University of New York and City University of New York because tuition at
these schools costs less on average than private colleges. A two-income family
with an annual income of $75,000 with one child attending either of the public
colleges would be eligible for a grant of $840 and $199 in tax savings. The
grant amounts are greater for those with lesser incomes and the tax savings
amounts are less for those with lesser incomes. Families could only deduct their
out-of-pocket expenses, not the amounts that come from TAP grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno denied that the election-year proposal was an attempted affront to
Pataki, who was counting on saving money on the Tuition Assistance Program
because less people will be eligible this year. Pataki last year tried to cut
the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and Bruno have lately disagreed over health insurance spending and
other issues, which may have led to the firing of some Bruno-backed state
employees. The two appeared together on Valentine's Day and suggested they were
getting along fine. Bruno continued that theme Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's especially easy and a pleasure to follow the governor, most of the
time," Bruno said as he followed the governor to the podium at an event at the
state University at Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, asked by reporters after the event about his relationship with
Bruno, appeared perturbed at the continuing interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's yesterday's question. Play back your tapes from yesterday," the
governor said.

<HEADLINE> Paris Launches Graffiti Offensive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The mayor of Paris on Tuesday announced an ambitious program to
wipe out the graffiti now staining the City of Light, offering free cleaning for
all buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Jean Tiberi said cleaners will work throughout Paris to eliminate
graffiti -- usually consisting of squiggly black spray paint. The city estimates
that graffiti covers 2.7 million square feet and is found on about 40 percent of
the city's 90,000 buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-year program will cost $72 million, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, building owners had to foot the bill to remove graffiti. Now the
city will cover the cost, even on privately-owned apartment buildings, the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Building owners who reject the free service will have to pay to keep their
properties clean.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think we will correct the problem for 90 percent of the situations
within a year,'' Tiberi told reporters, explaining that a five-year maintenance
program would follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of the cleanup is small compared to the benefits, Tiberi said. He
said that clean walls would help curb ``feelings of insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The city will start cleaning all buildings this April. After the initial
cleaning, building owners will have 12 days to contact the city to get any new
graffiti wiped away.

<HEADLINE> TV, Radio Ads Drive Gains at CBS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. narrowly beat analysts' expectations for
fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday as advertising gains in its television and radio
operations surged ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS reported net income of $251 million, or 34 cents per share, for the
three months ended Dec. 31 compared to a net loss of $1 million in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The reported figures included a one-time gain of $232 million related to the
sale of the company's former industrial businesses. Without the gain, CBS earned
$19 million, or 3 cents per share, edging the 2 cents per share estimated by
analysts surveyed by First Call /Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues jumped 24 percent to $2.22 billion from $1.79 billion in the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   A robust environment for advertising spending lifted results across CBS'
business segments, which include the TV network, 16 TV stations, cable and a
majority stake in Infinity Broadcasting, a major radio broadcaster and outdoor
advertising company.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' newly formed Internet subsidiary lost $30 million, mainly as a result
of its investment in iWon.com, a new portal site which launched a major ad
campaign during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Not counting the Internet loss, depreciation or amortization costs, the
company's after-tax cash flow rose 81 percent to $279 million from $154 million
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   During the fourth quarter CBS also completed its acquisition of King World,
a major syndicator of TV programs such as "Wheel of Fortune." Its Infinity
subsidiary also closed its deal to acquire Outdoor Systems, a major billboard
and out-of-home advertising company.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS was reporting in what may be its last quarter as a stand-alone company
before its merger with MTV owner Viacom Inc., which was recently approved by the
shareholders of both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, CBS reported net income of $780 million, or $1.08 per
share, compared to a loss of $21 million or 3 cents per share in 1998. Revenues
rose 8 percent to $7.37 billion from $6.81 billion.

<HEADLINE> IRS Revises Notice Language  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service announced Tuesday it will be
less confrontational when it sends letters to taxpayers notifying them that
employers, banks and associates may be contacted during a tax audit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a common-sense approach that gets clearly-worded information out
to taxpayers without needlessly alarming them,'' IRS Commissioner Charles
Rossotti said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti added that the number of such letters would be cut from 25 million
to 8 million because ``in the vast majority of cases, we've determined there's
no need for a letter at all because we won't be contacting third parties.''
</P>
<P>
	   The notices are required as ``fair warning'' by the 1998 IRS overhaul passed
by Congress that placed new emphasis on taxpayer rights, but the original
versions drew immediate criticism last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, the notices were unnecessarily sent to all taxpayers who
were audited and not just those from whom the IRS had tried and failed to get
the needed information. They also contained heavy-handed wording, bluntly
informing these taxpayers that ``neighbors, employers, employees and banks''
could be contacted during an audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti promised last year that a rewrite was in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   The new notices will reflect longstanding IRS policy of resorting to these
``third-party'' contacts only when all else fails. They also move away from the
blanket approach of the initial letters.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS will begin using 13 letters and two notices designed for specific
tax situations and will clearly spell out that the information will first be
sought from the taxpayer before the agency contacts a bank, employer or friend.
Some notices will include a blank space for the agency to detail exactly what
information is being sought.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the new notice for taxpayers with long-overdue tax bills reads:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Generally, our practice is to deal directly with a taxpayer or a
taxpayer's duly authorized representative. However, we sometimes talk to other
persons, for example, when we need information that the taxpayer has been unable
to provide or to verify information we have received. This notice is provided to
tell you that we may contact other persons.''

percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales growth at its U.S. superstores

	   Wal-Mart earned $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Jan. 31, compared with $1.56 billion, up from 35 cents a share a year ago.
That's above the 42 cents a share that analysts' had forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly sales totaled $51.39 billion, an increase of 26 percent over the
$40.79 billion in the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a
year, an industry gauge of performance, rose 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at its Wal-Mart stores rose 12.6 percent in the quarter, boosted by
gains at its Supercenters, which combine discount and grocery stores. Sales at
its Sam's Club warehouse stores increased 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   International sales gained about 164 percent, fueled by strength in its
Mexican, Canadian, British and Puerto Rican division.
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, Wal-Mart named Lee Scott as president and chief
executive officer, replacing David Glass who will remain at the company for a
year as chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who was Wal-Mart's chief operating officer and vice chairman, had
been tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also took some significant steps during the quarter to beef up
its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Wal-Mart teamed up with America Online Inc. to develop an
Internet service provider and offer discounted Web access to people who
currently may not have an affordable phone hookup in towns near its 2,500
stores. The name and price of the ISP have not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the company relaunched www.Walmart.com, which now stocks more
than 600,000 items and offers a wide array of services, such as travel
reservations. It also formed a new Internet company with venture-capital firm
Accel Partners, which will work to enhance the giant retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wal-Mart continues to outpace most of its rivals with its sharp
growth, there were fears that its pace may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times in the last year to
fend off inflationary pressures -- and may raise rates further. That has raised
concerns that consumer spending may slow in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the real issue affecting all retailers right now," said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart also said that it will continue aggressively cutting prices, which
the company calls "rollbacks." But such promotions will be more difficult in the
coming year because of high raw material prices, increased labor costs and
strengthening of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The "rollbacks" have been one of Wal-Mart's key marketing strategies to woo
shoppers into its stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart's shares were down $1.81 1/2 at $57.06 1/4 at 4 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer's stock was down as
low as $55 in early trading.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Wal-Mart earned $5.58 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with
$4.43 billion, or 99 cents a share, in 1998. Sales for the year were $165
billion, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Its annual results do not include a 4-cent reduction due to a change in
rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission in how Wal-Mart accounts for
membership revenues at its Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart operated 1,801 Wal-Mart stores, 721 Supercenters,
and 463 Sam's Clubs in the United States. Internationally, the company operated
13 units in Argentina, 14 in Brazil, 166 in Canada, six in China, 95 in Germany,
five in Korea, 462 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico and 232 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart employs more than 885,000 people in the United States and 255,000
internationally.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews Renee Fleming Concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    AN AP ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Renee Fleming, the reigning soprano of the Metropolitan
Opera, spent her 41st birthday producing some of the most beautiful singing to
be heard currently, in the role of Lucrezia Borgia in a concert version at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Donizetti's opera, in which Lucrezia Borgia poisons six people in the last
scene, was Monday's Valentine's Day gift from the Opera Orchestra of New York,
conducted by Eve Queler. The hall was long sold out.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming, a lyric soprano, alternated between a wild, rip-roaring,
passionate, Maria Callas-style interpretation and the more delicately spun lines
she generally chose. The words and music could be interpreted either way.
</P>
<P>
	   At the opera's end, for instance, when she realizes her son is among the
young noblemen she has poisoned, Fleming had a vocal outburst -- then sang like
she was dreaming, soft and lovely. She tore briefly into dramatic coloratura,
then returned to the contemplative singing of a breaking heart.
</P>
<P>
	   In the prologue, in which Lucrezia first encounters her grown son from a
previous marriage, Fleming's voice was ravishingly beautiful throughout. In Act
1, Lucrezia becomes angry when her family crest is defaced and her singing was
more fiery. The contrast was good and probably helpful for surviving a long role
with voice intact.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lucrezia Borgia" is the opera in which Fleming was booed at La Scala in
1998. In rehearsal there, she had disagreed with conductor Gianluigi Gelmetti
about her ornamentation of the vocal line. At the first performance, on July 6,
she was booed from the first note she sang by some people, believed to be an
anti-American group. Gelmetti fainted in the pit, which interrupted the
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming shared the stage Monday with another exceptional singer, Stephanie
Blythe, a dramatic mezzo-soprano who sang Orsini, one of the young noblemen who
have had relatives killed by Lucrezia. Blythe's voice, clear and shining on top,
gutsy on the low notes, contained excitement in every note.
</P>
<P>
	   Blythe, who won the 1999 Richard Tucker Award, made her Metropolitan Opera
debut in 1995. She was making her debut with the Opera Orchestra of New York.
Fleming was singing with the organization for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcello Giordani from Sicily sang Gennaro, Lucrezia's son, as he had at La
Scala in 1998. He was making his debut with the Opera Orchestra and at Carnegie
Hall. His is a good, solid Italian tenor. Bass-baritone Dean Peterson was
notable as Lucrezia's husband, Duke Alfonso. He made his Met Opera debut this
season. Ars Musica Chorale was the chorus; they and the orchestra were
excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the 29th season of the Opera Orchestra of New York, which
specializes in one-night performances of seldom-heard operas in concert version.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Member Talks With Six  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The 15-nation European Union took another step
towards expanding Tuesday, opening membership talks with six more candidate
nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta constitute the
second wave of mostly eastern European nations to start negotiations with the EU
on future membership.
</P>
<P>
	   They join Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Estonia,
which started talks two years ago and hope to be allowed into the union within
the next two or three years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After being for almost half a century on the bad side of history ... this
historic moment means Romania is now on the right side,'' Romanian Foreign
Minister Petre Roman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the six new candidate countries are ambitiously aiming to enter the
EU around 2004, when they hope they will meet difficult economic and political
criteria, including the acceptance of free market policies and adherence to
democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations also must tackle a vast range of complex technical issues,
including agricultural and industrial subsidies, environmental standards and
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The process that lies ahead of us will be very difficult,'' EU Enlargement
Commissioner Gunter Verheugen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The widening of enlargement talks comes at an awkward time for the EU, which
is struggling with an internal crisis sparked by the entry of Austria's
far-right Freedom Party into that country's coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party has expressed opposition to the EU expansion, fearing an
influx of immigrants from Austria's poorer eastern neighbors and a loss of jobs
as investors move to low-wage former Eastern bloc nations. Concern over Austria
has put it at odds with the union's other members.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria's new foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, insisted her
government was committed to the EU's shift eastward. She is a member of the
mainstream People's Party, the Freedom Party's coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria is in favor of the enlargement ... all the other comments who say
we are opposed are wrong,'' she said. But she added that Austria had special
concerns over the expansion since it is the EU country with the longest frontier
with the eastern candidate nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 nations now in talks with the EU are not the end of the expansion
list. Turkey has also been recognized as a candidate, while Croatia, Macedonia,
Albania and Bosnia have expressed long-term hopes of joining.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Joining the European Union is a very important guarantor of independence
and prosperity,'' said Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who chaired
Tuesday's meeting.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ex-French Premier Immunity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's executive body on Tuesday
lifted the immunity of former French Premier Edith Cresson, clearing the way for
Belgian authorities to question her about a scandal that brought down the
previous EU executive team.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials want to question Cresson about her hiring of a dentist friend,
Rene Berthelot, to work at the EU's headquarters when she was the EU's research
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   Revelations that Berthelot received $135,000 for scientific consultancy work
for which he was subsequently judged unqualified were a major factor in forcing
the resignation of Cresson and the whole EU Commission in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation, which began a year ago, centers around allegations of
fraud, forgery and abuse of trust, judicial officials said. It was too early to
say if Cresson would be charged with any offense.
</P>
<P>
	   The Belgian public prosecutors office said eight people, including Cresson
and Berthelot, were included in the investigation, with others likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresson was an EU commissioner from 1995 to 1999 and French prime minister
for 10 months ending in 1992. She has denied allegations Berthelot was given a
fictitious job and said that although not a scientific expert, he had sound
managerial experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Cresson also has been accused of mismanaging programs she was responsible
for overseeing.
</P>
<P>
	   EU commissioners and former commissioners have diplomatic immunity for
events that occurred while they were working for the union. But the 20-member EU
Commission can suspend the immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   The new EU Commission, which took office in September under Romano Prodi,
has pledged to root out corruption and nepotism in the EU civil service.

<HEADLINE> Cities seek consolidation of services for survival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Upstate New York's largest cities that helped drive
a young America must be redesigned quickly into a compact model, or else.
<P>
	   The mayors of Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany argued that point at
the Capitol Tuesday. They said the cities need $85 million now, but more
importantly require long-term, fundamental changes like sharing the cost of
services with other governments.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York state has got to modernize its ability to provide services," said
Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. If not, "Upstate New York is going to collapse,
I'll tell you right now."
</P>
<P>
	   They said the need is as stark as a tax bill.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, a typical family in Rochester with a median household income
of $23,000 a year pays about $700 in city taxes. If the state doesn't come
across with the aid and changes pushed by the mayors, that bill would be $1,200,
or almost three weeks full paychecks before taxes, according to figures provided
by the city.
</P>
<P>
	   As for business, increasing local tax bills are partly to blame for the loss
of a couple hundred Rochester jobs - 40 percent of the work force - at the
Genesee brewery, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors' pitch for fundamental changes include consolidating services
with counties and other municipalities and reducing the size of city governments
that now operate as entities separate of their counties and the towns they
border. The mayors who serve nearly 800,000 residents told the state Senate
Committee on Cities that the "revolutionary" changes should be intiated and
pressured by the state over two to four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we continue to go in the direction we are going we will displace our
troubles," said Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings. He said the rising costs of
services while urban populations and tax bases dwindle is compounding Albany's
deficit of about $9.5 million, where three-quarters of property is tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't cut anymore," said Syracuse Mayor Roy Bernardi. "If we have to cut
it's in police, fire and schools."
</P>
<P>
	   In a time of state government surpluses, windfalls from settlements with
tobacco companies, a new $9 billion Health Care Reform program, and growing
suburbs boasting no town taxes, the four upstate cities face a combined deficit
of more than $73 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state has left us scrounging around for crumbs," said Rochester Mayor
William Johnson Jr. "You can't revitalize upstate if you don't revitalize the
cities."
</P>
<P>
	   Tax credits to help businesses locate in upstate cities is part of Gov.
George Pataki's Upstate Economic Agenda. Pataki announced the $700 million
package of tax cuts and incentives aimed at attracting jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Private sector employment in upstate New York is at an all-time high and
unemployment remains at or below the national average," Pataki said at a
Binghamton high-tech firm. "But we must do more to ensure every upstate
community shares in our strong economy and our record employment levels."
</P>
<P>
	   The fundamental changes of regionalization pushed by the mayors have been
promoted for years, yet rarely implemented. They benefits, however, would ripple
beyond city lines into the relatively prosperous suburbs, the mayors argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question, if the cities are strong, the regions will be," said
Marvin LeRoy, a former supervisor of one of those prosperous suburbs, in a
separate interview. "The lion's share of businesses are still in the cities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our affluence and wealth is from the cities," said LeRoy, a Republican who
stepped down in December after eight years of running the town of 35,000 people,
new housing development, new businesses and no town tax. He served on a state
regionalization commission that "died on the vine" from a lack of action.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's worked in Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., and other cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the long-term changes, the mayors called for about $85
million in funding in the state budget now being written. That, they said, would
help offset huge property tax increases that would erode the confidence in
upstate New York businesses seek.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors also seek:
</P>
<P>
	   -Unfettered and free use of schools after 3 p.m. for civic and recreation
programs in part to deter juvenile crime that peaks from 3:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   -Allowing more city projects to be exempt from paying government-set
'prevailing" wages to contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   -An official role on local school boards from which they could affect labor
negotiations and policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need New York state to initiate structural changes," Masiello said.
"We're in the battle for our lives."

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijani Leader, Clinton Meet  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev met with President
Clinton today to seek more help in settling his country's territorial dispute
with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said their discussion would give ``additional impetus to a final
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two also discussed developing deals to exploit energy resources,
particularly Western efforts to build an oil pipeline from the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku across Turkey to the Mediterranean. ``We had a detailed exchange
of views on how to implement that agreement,'' Aliev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in a speech Monday night that the countries that are supposed to
be leading the group of nations seeking a settlement of the long-running
conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia need to do more.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the United States, Russia and France all need to be more engaged
in seeking a solution, Aliev told the Paul H. Nitze School of International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   As Aliev spoke, about a dozen demonstrators stood across the street,
chanting and waving signs protesting his visit. They accused Aliev, a former
Soviet leader, of a 40-year record of human rights abuse, censorship and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in his speech that he is committed to democracy and free markets.
</P>
<P>
	   While a five-year cease-fire has held, the two southern Caucasus nations of
Azerbaijan and Armenia have failed to resolve the dispute over independence
claims by the Nagorno-Karabakh region now controlled by Armenians but nestled
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
	   Central to U.S. concern with the region is a planned pipeline to carry
Caspian sea oil, being extracted by U.S. and European oil companies, across
Azerbaijan to the Mediterranean at Ceyhan, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Western nations are concerned that any escalation of conflict in the region
will stall the pipeline the way the Chechen conflict has hindered the flow of
oil through another pipeline across Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev praised President Clinton's support for making the Azerbaijan-Turkey
pipeline possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will start construction of the Baku-Ceyhan main export pipeline very
soon,'' Aliev said. He said Azerbaijan also seeks construction of a gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev pledged to continue a dialogue with Armenian President Robert
Kocharian, while criticizing Russia for maintaining a military presence in
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conflict needs to be settled peacefully,'' Aliev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said he supports giving Nagorno-Karabakh ``the highest degree of
status'' within Azerbaijan, but he said Armenian forces must be withdrawn from
the region and 1 million Azerbaijanis that were driven from the area must be
allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagorno-Karabakh cannot become a second Armenia, he said, adding, ``The
Armenian people already have a nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said his main goal in carrying on a dialogue with Kocharian is to
achieve peace. He said both he and the Armenian leader have indicated a
willingness to compromise but have not been able to reach a comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Kocharian and Aliev last met in Davos, Switzerland, in January and have
scheduled another round of talks in Vienna under the joint supervision of the
United States, Russia and France.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 198.25; Nasdaq Up 1.70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in oil stocks and some bargain-hunting buoyed the
Dow Jones industrials today. In a major turnaround from recent weeks, the
strength in blue-chips helped pull technology stocks out of a severe slump.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
198.25 to close at 10,718.09. The Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled as much
as 127 points in earlier trading, closed up 1.70 at 4,420.25.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were modestly higher, but overall, the number of
declining issues outpaced advancers.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq. Consumer products company 3M led the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Dow was poised for a comeback after its 538.59-point drop
last week, which knocked the index 11 percent below its January peak, within
market watchers' traditional definition of a correction. With big gains Monday
and today, the Dow is now 8.5 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of really good names had been beaten down badly," said Joseph T.
Keating, chief investment officer of the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich. "It
was time for some of those stocks to start attracting cash again."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow got a lift from a surge in oil-related stocks. Exxon Mobil rose as
crude oil futures remained above $30 a barrel. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel
Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman Brothers analyst raised
his rating on Texaco stock today, estimating that shares will reach 65 within
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil services companies like Schlumberger also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors on
edge today, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks were particularly rattled by investors who are worried
that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this year as it
works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates four times
since June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits from a big run in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems and MCI WorldCom slipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, however, some massive gains from a handful of technology
stocks powered the index higher. Rambus rose on the expectation that Intel will
use its technology to manufacture high-speed computer chips.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, investors are correct to place their money on the promise of
technology, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are two kinds of companies you've got to own: the techs and the
companies that can most successfully implement technology to stay ahead of the
pack as interest rates go higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Seeks 'Big Dig' Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By CAREN BENJAMIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House subcommittee demanded an
investigation Tuesday into whether officials overseeing Boston's massive ``Big
Dig'' highway project withheld information about cost overruns to ensure federal
funding would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., head of the House Appropriations transportation
panel, also wants an independent audit of Big Dig finances and suggested
subpoenas may be necessary to ensure everything comes out.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said it was unacceptable that project
officials were not more forthcoming about costs but told Wolf's panel he must
complete a review of a report released Monday by the inspector general before
deciding whether to take action.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, Kenneth Mead documented cost construction overruns of at
least $942 million and chastised state and federal transportation officials for
``an alarming lapse in oversight.''

	   The three-mile Big Dig project, officially called the Central Artery-Third
Harbor Tunnel, goes through downtown Boston. It was started in 1993 and was
supposed to be finished next year, but delays have pushed back the completion
date to perhaps as late as 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Three months ago, the Federal Highway Administration and Big Dig officials
objected to a draft version of the inspector general's report, claiming the cost
estimates were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   But last week, Big Dig officials revealed the project would cost more than
$13.2 billion, about $1.4 billion more than previously estimated. That admission
came only hours after the FHA, charged with overseeing the project, had signed
off on the Big Dig's yearly finance plan. It did not mention the overruns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf, a longtime critic of the project, said protestations about the draft
report look like ``deliberate deceit.'' He asked whether there might be a
``civil or criminal penalty for not telling the truth'' in this situation.
</P>
<P>
	   He said neither Big Dig officials nor the FHA could be trusted to provide
information about costs and that an independent agency with subpoena power
should conduct an audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Big Dig spokesman Jeremy Crockford denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been working very closely with Federal Highway since the
beginning. We reject any notion that we left them in the dark about the
project,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Report Ordered Released  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The High Court on Tuesday ordered Britain to release a
medical report assessing Gen. Augusto Pinochet's fitness for trial, saying the
rights of countries seeking his extradition outweighed the former dictator's
right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge panel said Britain's top law enforcement official erred in
not allowing Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland to review the medical
findings and show them to their own medical experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said he would turn over the report immediately.
The nations, which must adhere to ``strict conditions of confidentiality,'' now
have until Feb. 22 to offer their assessments of the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw will issue his final ruling shortly after that, but already has said
he believes the medical report shows Pinochet is not mentally fit to stand
trial. He says he is inclined to let Pinochet return to Chile rather than face
extradition to Spain on charges of torture.
</P>
<P>
	   The High Court decision came in response to an appeal by Belgium to see the
report, supported by six human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw and lawyers for Pinochet had argued that the report should remain
sealed to protect the general's right to privacy, but the court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ever there was a case in which the integrity of the international
criminal justice system needed to be demonstrated, a case calling for the
highest standards of fairness and transparency, this is it,'' said Lord Justice
Simon Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
after Pinochet ousted elected Marxist president Salvador Allende in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old general was arrested in October 1998 on a Spanish warrant
while recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital. He has diabetes and
suffered two small strokes last fall, and remains under police guard at a rented
mansion outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish government, which has made it clear that it does not support
Magistrate Baltasar Garzon's bid to bring Pinochet to trial in Madrid, welcomed
the release of the medical reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon, whom the judges specifically named as entitled to see the findings,
was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chilean plane is waiting to take Pinochet home, but even Straw's final
extradition ruling can be appealed by the parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain reiterated Tuesday that it would not contest any decision to release
the general. The other nations have not yet indicated what they would do.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaction to Tuesday's ruling was mixed in Chile, with Pinochet opponents
calling it a step toward justice and angry supporters blasting the decision amid
calls to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's elder son, also named Augusto, told a local television station
that his father ``is ill, and I think it is not for lawyers to judge a report by
professional doctors.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq U.N. Resolution Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi civilians will continue to suffer under the
latest U.N. Security Council resolution, the top U.N. official in Iraq said
Wednesday in explaining why he quit.
</P>
<P>
	   Hans Von Sponeck said the new Iraq policy was flawed and did not make a
clear distinction between civilian needs and disarmament obligations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not think this resolution has a chance to come to fruition very
quickly ... even if that happens I do not think that this is enough,'' Von
Sponeck told The Associated Press in an interview. His resignation became
official Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Von Sponeck's example, Jutta Burghardt, the head of the U.N. World
Food Program in Iraq, resigned Tuesday. European diplomats in Baghdad said she
was also protesting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   But a spokesman for the Rome-based WFP denied Burghardt's resignation was
related to the sanctions and said she quit to return to work for the German
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignations come at a time when the U.N. Security Council is striving
to persuade Iraq to accept its December resolution that will partially suspend
sanctions in return for full cooperation with a new weapons inspection
commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions can only be permanently lifted if U.N. arms inspectors can
verify that Iraq's long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction are
completely dismantled.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck said the U.N. oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell
oil to buy food and other essential items, was barely meeting what he called the
``survival requirements'' for Iraq's 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck's outspoken remarks have earned him the wrath of the United
States and Britain, the main advocates of the policy that sanctions should
remain in place until the Baghdad government rids itself of all banned weapons
and the means to produce them.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has been supported by Iraq's allies, including France.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His evaluation of the humanitarian situation in Iraq corresponds to the
reality,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said Tuesday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   James P. Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman, sought to play down the
impact of the resignations, saying that the U.N. oil-for-food program would
continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When these well-intentioned individuals are concerned about the fate of
the Iraqi people, it is our view that they should direct their concern and their
blame-casting at the Iraqi regime which refuses ... to spend its hard currency
helping its own people,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Sponeck is the second U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq to quit over
the sanctions. His predecessor, Denis Halliday of Ireland, quit in 1998, saying
he did not want to be associated with the suffering of the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's state-run media praised Von Sponeck's decision. A front-page
editorial in al-Iraq newspaper described him as an honest and courageous man who
refused to bend to U.S. dictates.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in New York, Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said: ``People are
resigning because they could no more be silent on the genocide which is taking
place in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Von Sponeck said the government in Iraq also shares the blame for the
suffering of the Iraqi people. Iraq's civilian population, he said, is
victimized by the wrangling between the Baghdad government and the Security
Council over disarmament and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not think it is fair to make the civilian population subject to
bargaining ... (by) the government of Iraq on the one hand and the others in the
Security Council,'' he said. ``The real victims are those who walk the streets
of Baghdad, Basra and Mosul.''

<HEADLINE> Moscow Welcomes Clinton Remarks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday it welcomed
President Clinton's remarks in an interview on U.S.-Russian relations, which
have been in a period of tension, the news agency Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian leadership shares the desire expressed by the U.S. president
to intensify the bilateral dialogue, primarily in the spheres of security and
disarmament, and to overcome the trend there for a dangerous impasse,'' the
ministry said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in an interview with CNN that was broadcast on the Internet, said
good things about acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Based on what I have seen so far, I think that the United States can do
business with this man. I think he's obviously highly intelligent; he's highly
motivated; he has strong views,'' Clinton said in response to a question sent in
from a viewer using e-mail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't agree with him on everything, but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between Washington and Moscow have been troubled in the past year
over the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, U.S. criticism of the war in Chechnya and
Russia's concerns about the eastward expansion of NATO, among other issues.

<HEADLINE> NATO Said 'Marking Time' in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight months after NATO forced the Serb army's withdrawal
from Kosovo, the top U.S. military officer said Tuesday that international
peacekeepers are ``marking time'' while waiting for U.N. and other civilian
authorities to assume police and civil reconstruction duties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hurting. We need more police'' to fill the law-enforcement vacuum
that U.S. and other peacekeepers are forced to deal with in Kosovo, said Army
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
	   While noting that much of Kosovo has been stabilized, Shelton said the
eruption of ethnic violence last weekend in Mitrovica, in a section of northern
Kosovo controlled mainly by French peacekeepers, showed that tensions remain
high and illegal arms are readily available to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am concerned that the violence was so great'' during the Serbs' forced
expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Albanians last year, ``and the animosity
and the desire for retribution is so great that it will take a long time for
that to ever go away,'' Shelton said in an interview with defense reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelton sounded pessimistic about the prospect of achieving the United
Nations' stated goal of rebuilding a multiethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would have to stop short of saying whether or not I think we can get
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The main problem, Shelton said, is that the United Nations, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and other
international civilian organizations have not lived up to their commitments to
provide tools needed to rebuild Kosovo's political, judicial and economic
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All those (groups) have got to come to bear on this problem (and) get it
moving at a faster pace than it is going now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the peacekeepers are being asked to do things, such as law
enforcement work, that civilians should be doing, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're kind of marking time, waiting for them to do that,'' he said.
``Ultimately you've got to have a government put back in, you've got to have
police and rule of law -- those things that our soldiers, our KFOR troops, do
not do.'' KFOR is the Kosovo Force of international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The long-term solution is not to keep KFOR there forever.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shelton said it was not clear what triggered the burst of ethnic violence in
Mitrovica in recent days. He declined to fault the French peacekeepers in that
area for failing to stop the flow of illegal arms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you know, this is somewhat analogous to the Old West in terms of where
the bows and arrows might be or where the weapons are being kept,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon, meanwhile, said that 20 to 25 American soldiers moved Tuesday
from the U.S.-controlled southeastern sector of Kosovo to the French-controlled
area where snipers on Sunday wounded two French peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans -- mainly communications and language specialists -- are
supporting a group of about 100 Greek infantry soldiers who will help patrol the
Mitrovica area for the next few days, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley
said. The Greeks also moved from the U.S.-controlled sector.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These forces are very visible when they move into various sectors, by
design, to show NATO's presence, to show solidarity and the cross-national
solidarity of the NATO alliance as well,'' Quigley said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico University Building Occupied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Supporters of the 9 1/2-month strike at Latin America's
largest university continued to occupy the campus science building Tuesday, one
day after classes resumed in most of the university.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the science school of the National Autonomous University voted
Monday to block the return of classes there. About 300 people occupied the
building Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers had occupied the entire campus until Feb. 6, when unarmed police
entered the main campus and arrested hundreds of students, including strike
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the university administration retook control of the whole campus in
the days after the raid, the council that led the occupation insists that the
strike isn't over. The council is pressing its demands for changes in university
policies and administration. It is also calling for the release of the
approximately 250 strikers still in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began as a protest to university plans to raise tuition, which
had been a few cents, to the equivalent of $140. It continued even after the
administration backed down on the tuition increase.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 198.25; Nasdaq Up 1.70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in oil stocks and some bargain-hunting buoyed the
Dow Jones industrials today. In a major turnaround from recent weeks, the
strength in blue-chips helped pull technology stocks out of a severe slump.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.25 to close at 10,718.09. The
Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled as much as 127 points in earlier trading,
closed up 1.70 at 4,420.25.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were modestly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 12.11 to 1,402.05.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,551 up, 1,490 down and 498 unchanged. On the Nasdaq, five
stocks fell for every four that rose.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares as of 4 p.m., compared with 923.69
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.30 to 540.24.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq. Consumer products company 3M led the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Dow was poised for a comeback after its 538.59-point drop
last week, which knocked the index 11 percent below its January peak, within
market watchers' traditional definition of a correction. With big gains Monday
and today, the Dow is now 8.5 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of really good names had been beaten down badly," said Joseph T.
Keating, chief investment officer of the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich. "It
was time for some of those stocks to start attracting cash again."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow got a lift from a surge in oil-related stocks. Exxon Mobil rose as
crude oil futures remained above $30 a barrel. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel
Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman Brothers analyst raised
his rating on Texaco stock today, estimating that shares will reach 65 within
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil services companies like Schlumberger also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors on
edge today, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks were particularly rattled by investors who are worried
that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this year as it
works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates four times
since June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites were lower today as investors
sold shares to lock in profits from a big run in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems and MCI WorldCom slipped.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, however, some massive gains from a handful of technology
stocks powered the index higher. Rambus rose on the expectation that Intel will
use its technology to manufacture high-speed computer chips.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, investors are correct to place their money on the promise of
technology, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are two kinds of companies you've got to own: the techs and the
companies that can most successfully implement technology to stay ahead of the
pack as interest rates go higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Leads Oscar Nods  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The Oscars embraced dysfunction and darkness
Tuesday, bestowing a leading eight nominations on the suburban burlesque
"American Beauty" and honoring movies about abortion, death row and the
tormented souls of the dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The top nominees included "The Cider House Rules," set in a combination
orphanage and abortion mill; "The Sixth Sense," about a boy from a broken home
who can see ghosts; and "The Green Mile," about the bonds between prison guards
and condemned men.
</P>
<P>
	   Those four movies, along with "The Insider," a film about a tobacco industry
whistle-blower, were nominated for best picture.
</P>
<P>
	   The top acting categories also were heavy on family dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The best-actor candidates included Kevin Spacey in "American Beauty" as a
dad who blackmails his boss, smokes pot with a neighbor kid and flirts with his
daughter's cheerleading friend.
</P>
<P>
	   The other nominees were Sean Penn as a womanizing jazz guitarist in Woody
Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown"; Denzel Washington in "The Hurricane" as boxer Rubin
Carter, unfairly convicted of murder; Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower in
"The Insider"; and Richard Farnsworth as an irascible old man who takes a road
trip on his lawn mower in "The Straight Story."
</P>
<P>
	   Snubbed for the second straight year was Jim Carrey, who did an uncanny take
on the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon." Carrey received
back-to-back Golden Globes for that movie and "The Truman Show" in 1998 but
failed to get an Oscar nomination for either role.
</P>
<P>
	   The best-actress nominees included two adulterous wives (Annette Bening in
"American Beauty" and Julianne Moore in "The End of the Affair"), two struggling
single moms (Meryl Streep in "Music of the Heart" and Janet McTeer in
"Tumbleweeds") and a woman with a sexual identity crisis who poses as a man
(Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry").
</P>
<P>
	   For Streep, it was her 12th acting nomination, tying the record held by
Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cider House" and "Insider" had seven nominations each, while "Sixth Sense"
had six.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards will be presented March 26 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscars have taken some dark departures in the past with such
best-picture winners as "Midnight Cowboy," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and
"Ordinary People." Over the last 15 years or so, though, the awards have tended
to favor epics or costume pieces such as "Amadeus," "Dances With Wolves,"
"Titanic" and "Shakespeare in Love."
</P>
<P>
	   Another superstar, Tom Cruise, got a supporting-actor nomination for his
role as a misogynist sex guru in "Magnolia."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane" got only one nomination, for Washington. It had been viewed
as a leading contender for a best-picture nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   At 79, Farnsworth is the oldest man ever nominated for best actor. A former
stuntman previously nominated for "Comes a Horseman" in 1977, he said he planned
to celebrate with a taco and martini with an olive.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Swank played the real-life Teena Brandon, who was murdered after
acquaintances discovered the young man they knew as Brandon Teena was actually a
woman. The movie has been in very narrow release, but Fox Searchlight plans to
get it in more theaters this Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to help the movie get seen," Swank said. "It's an important
story, and this way Brandon's legacy lives on."

<HEADLINE> Senate Republicans want bigger Tuition Assistance Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state Senate proposal would almost double Tuition
Assistance Program grants, make more families eligible for the college aid, and
make tuition tax deductible.
<P>
	   Senate Republicans proposed Tuesday to make the TAP available in households
with income up to $80,000 a year, up from $50,500 after deductions. Tuition
would be tax deductible and the amount the state provides for each tuition grant
would be increased - the current minimum of $275 would be changed to $500 after
two years - under the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel this doesn't represent spending, this is an investment," Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said during a press conference when asked how he
could justify the $65 million his plan would cost the state in the first year
and the $365 million it would cost over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki had a lukewarm response to the proposal, saying he would
look at it. His budget office said New York State's Tuition Assistance Program
is already far more generous than programs in all other states.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's camp said they have their own plans for
higher education spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said the income requirements should be relaxed because the economy has
improved so much that many earn too much to qualify. Bruno gave Sen. Kenneth
LaValle, chairman of the Senate's Higher Education Committee, credit for
developing the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Details of the plan include:
</P>
<P>
	   -Changes over four years in both tuition assistance and tax deductions. In
the first year, the minimum grant award would be $400 for all classes and the
maximum would go to $5,000 for freshman. After four years, the maximum award
would be $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   -Tax savings according to income levels. For a two-parent family that earns
$20,000 annually and has one of two children attending a private college, the
savings would be $200. For the same-sized family with an income of $75,000, the
tax savings would be $1,130. The tax deductions would be implemented gradually
over a four-year period - 25 percent of tuition expenses in the first year, 50
percent in the second year, and so on up to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   -Tuition awards of $170 for juniors and seniors who maintain a 3.5 grade
point average. That's in addition to a proposed $170 award for students who
perform community service.
</P>
<P>
	   -The plan offers lesser savings for families with students who attend the
State University of New York and City University of New York because tuition at
these schools costs less on average than private colleges. A two-income family
with an annual income of $75,000 with one child attending either of the public
colleges would be eligible for a grant of $840 and $199 in tax savings. The
grant amounts are greater for those with lesser incomes and the tax savings
amounts are less for those with lesser incomes. Families could only deduct their
out-of-pocket expenses, not the amounts that come from TAP grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno denied that the election-year proposal was an attempted affront to
Pataki, who was counting on saving money on the Tuition Assistance Program
because less people will be eligible this year. Pataki last year tried to cut
the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and Bruno have lately disagreed over health insurance spending and
other issues, which may have led to the firing of some Bruno-backed state
employees. The two appeared together on Valentine's Day and suggested they were
getting along fine. Bruno continued that theme Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's especially easy and a pleasure to follow the governor, most of the
time," Bruno said as he followed the governor to the podium at an event at the
state University at Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, asked by reporters after the event about his relationship with
Bruno, appeared perturbed at the continuing interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's yesterday's question. Play back your tapes from yesterday," the
governor said.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Award Cardinal Medal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to award an ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor the Congressional Gold Medal, the body's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
	   The longtime leader of the New York Archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman
Catholics recently turned 80 and had surgery last fall to remove a brain tumor.
He is expected to retire as soon as Pope John Paul II appoints a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The House voted 413-1 to give the award to O'Connor. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
was the lone opponent. Paul said he has great respect for the cardinal but
opposed the $30,000 it would cost to mint the medal.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the House voted 410-1 to give a Congressional Gold Medal to
``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz, who died in his sleep Saturday. The
77-year-old cartoonist's last strip featuring Snoopy and the gang was published
in Sunday's papers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate is expected to approve both honors next month.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters that O'Connor was
being ``justifiably honored'' and insisted the award was not an attempt to
appease Catholics upset by a flap over the appointment of a new House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   House GOP leaders nominated the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, for the $138,000-a-year position even though the Rev. Timothy O'Brien,
a Catholic priest, was the top choice of a bipartisan committee of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Democrats have accused GOP leaders of being anti-Catholic, a charge
they deny. A vote on the nomination is pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Tuesday's vote, lawmakers extolled O'Connor's work on behalf of the
needy, inner-city children, AIDS patients and others. They also spoke of his
leadership in establishing diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Israel and
his years of service as a military chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Cardinal O'Connor is a great man,'' said Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y.,
who nominated O'Connor for the medal. ``Soldiers, priests and parishioners know
in their hearts that the cardinal has always been a man of the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, O'Connor, the oldest active bishop in the United States
and a close ally of the pope, has drawn criticism over the years for denouncing
homosexuality, premarital sex and birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has had many critics,'' acknowledged Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``But
from the beginning of life to the very cessation of life, Cardinal O'Connor was
consistent in his belief that all deserved justice under the law and as much
human love as mankind was capable of.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor served as a chaplain in the Navy and Marines for 27 years and saw
combat in Korea. He was named bishop in Scranton, Pa., in 1983 and has led the
Archdiocese of New York since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor offered his resignation on his 75th birthday, as the church
requires, but the pope did not accept it. Cardinals lose their power to vote for
a new pope when they turn 80.
</P>
<P>
	   After an absence last year due to surgery and radiation treatments, O'Connor
is back celebrating Sunday Mass at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. His frail
condition has made it hard for him to stand and he delivers the homily from a
chair.

<HEADLINE> Two more officers claim Diallo threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Toeing the defense line, two more officers on trial
for killing Amadou Diallo with a barrage of 41 bullets testified Tuesday he
appeared to draw a gun and take a "combat stance" as shots flew.
<P>
	   Both Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy also described a futile search inside
the vestibule of Diallo's Bronx apartment building for a gun he never had. Boss
told jurors at the murder trial he was "destroyed" to learn the black object
found in the West African immigrant's right hand was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kept praying the weapon would be in there, that it was somewhere," said
Boss, who fired five of the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the gunfire, Diallo stood at the rear of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule with
his right arm extended, Boss said. The victim, he added, "was crouched like in a
combat stance. ... The same one I was taught in the police academy."
</P>
<P>
	   Boss also testified that he saw Officer Edward McMellon "fly off" of
Diallo's doorstep. When the gunfire ended, he grabbed McMellon and "started
feeling his chest, going 'Where are you hit, where are you hit?' ... He said,
'I'm not hit."' McMellon actually had fallen while retreating.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Murphy: "There was not a doubt in my mind that (Diallo) had a gun. I
had a sick feeling in my stomach that I was going to be hit at any second.
That's why I fired." He shot four times.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury heard a recording of a radio call in which a frantic-sounding Boss
says, "I need a bus forthwith, and a boss" - police parlance for an ambulance
and a supervisor. He said he had to find a street sign before giving the
dispatcher a location because "I didn't know what street I was on."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys never questioned Boss about shooting and killing a man armed with
a shotgun in Brooklyn in October 1997. A grand jury found no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   In the courtroom were several of the officers' family members and supporters
wearing "Free the Bronx 4" buttons. Diallo's Guinean parents, dressed in
colorful robes, sat across the aisle; scores of their supporters rallied
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony of Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, echoed that of codefendants Sean
Carroll, 37, and McMellon, 27, who took the stand Monday to explain why they
each fired 16 shots. Diallo was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the shooting - at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999 - the
plainclothes officers wore blue jeans and sneakers and bulletproof vests under
sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were patrolling Diallo's neighborhood in an unmarked car in
search of armed criminals. Only Carroll had more than one year of experience in
the roving Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers' testimony emphasized similar points: that it was dark; that
Diallo ignored orders to halt for questioning; that the gunfire lasted only a
few seconds and was continuous; and that the victim remained on his feet
throughout. Each officer denied ever shooting him after he was already down.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
trapping the unarmed victim in the vestibule with a "wall of lead." Backed by
autopsy findings, prosecutors also say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he
was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers resulted in
enough pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread police abuse of
minorities that an appeals decided to move the case to Albany. Testimony was
expected to continue through the end of this week, with summations early next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi and attorneys were to meet Tuesday to
discuss how the jury will be instructed before deliberating.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional murder,
depraved indifference and reckless endangerment. If convicted, they face a
maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney say the jury probably will be allowed to consider lesser charges
against the officers - like manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide -
which carry lighter penalties.

<HEADLINE> Gillette May Sell Stationery Units  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co. shares gained 4 percent Tuesday after the
company said it may dispose of its struggling stationery products business to
concentrate on its better-performing razors and batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it has well-known brands, the Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman pen
lines have been a drag on Gillette's earnings, with profit from the stationery
business dropping 89 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the stationery business just didn't fit well with Gillette's
shaving products and Duracell batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It strikes at core competencies. What businesses are you in?" said Ira R.
Weiss, dean of the College of Business Administration at Northeastern
University. "It seems to me that pens are a business to get out of."
</P>
<P>
	   Pens and related products accounted for about 7.5 percent of Gillette's $10
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette got into the business in 1955 when it bought the Paper Mate brand.
Liquid Paper correction fluid was added in 1979, and the company bought the
Waterman pen maker in 1987 and the Parker pen brand in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   But the sector has stumbled. In addition to the dismal fourth-quarter
profits, quarterly stationery sales fell 17 percent. For all of last year
stationery sales were down 13 percent and profits were off 83 percent from 1998
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Gillette confirmed that it has retained Merrill Lynch to
assist in a review of its alternatives for the stationery business. The company
will only say a decision will be made "early this year."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at several options. Divestiture is one of those options,
spinning it off is an option, as is retaining it," said Eric A. Kraus, the
company's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette also makes lines of toiletries, and it owns the Oral-B brand of
dental care products and Duracell batteries. The company makes Braun household
products which have also been faltering of late, and some followers of the
company have suggested that line should be disposed of as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The battery business is currently one of the strongest elements in
Gillette's portfolio, while the personal hygiene products at least have some
marketing and distribution similarities with Gillette's market-dominating razors
and blades.
</P>
<P>
	   But pens -- especially the deluxe Waterman and Parker brands -- have a hard
time fitting in with such a stable of products, said Fredric E. Russell, head of
Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co., a Tulsa, Okla., money management
firm that has stock in Gillette.
</P>
<P>
	   "When people think of consuming blades, they also think of consuming on the
same shopping trips toothpaste and things like that, but not pens," Russell
said. "These are very good, smart strategic moves to sell off the stationery."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell said it was not clear how much of a premium the stationery business
would fetch.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may not get a fire sale price, but they're not going to get a price
driven by euphoria either," he said. "They're not selling at the peak, but they
are making a good decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette's stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, gained $1.50
Tuesday to $38.25 a share as of 4:30 p.m. EST. The stock has fallen sharply from
its March 1999 52-week high of $64.37 1/2, but Weiss thought selling off the
stationery business would put Gillette on the road to reconciliation with Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly the stockholders on Wall Street are not looking favorably on them,
although Gillette has been the star for ages for ongoing continued growth,"
Weiss said. "The street is going to look kindly at getting rid of those pens.
You're getting rid of a drag on profits."

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Carrey may be the Tom Hanks of the Golden Globes,
but he's not the Tom Hanks of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrey's portrayal of comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon" failed to gain
a nomination for a best actor Academy Award on Tuesday even though the role
earned him a Golden Globe for best actor from the Hollywood Foreign Press

</P>

<HEADLINE> Thruway Authority will reconsider toll hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Its toll increase plan encountering strong
opposition from Gov. George Pataki, the state Legislature and business groups,
the state Thruway Authority said Tuesday it is reconsidering the proposal.
<P>
	   Pataki said leaders at the authority "are going to take another look" at
whether the Thruway can fund $1 billion in improvements to transportation
facilities over the next five years in some other way than a toll increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway's board, with all three members selected by Pataki, approved a
previously unannounced plan on Jan. 27 to let tolls increase by up to 3 percent
each year. The increases would be tied to a 20-city building expense standard
called the Construction Cost Index and the Thruway's first toll increase would
be 1.8 percent starting June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
threatened to block the toll increase legislatively if the Thruway Authority
didn't withdraw the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's statements Tuesday, made after an appearance at the State
University of New York at Albany, were his strongest and most negative to date
on the toll hike.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm opposed to any toll increases," Pataki said. "We've had five years and
two months without any toll increases since I've been governor, and I hope they
can avoid this one as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki in 1996 made the Thruway Authority back down from a planned toll
increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's hand-picked chairman on the Thruway Board, Lou Tomson, issued a
statement later Tuesday acknowledging that the board was actively searching for
alternatives to a toll hike.
</P>
<P>
	   "We look forward to working with the governor and the Legislature on ideas
that will allow us to make the important investments necessary to keep the
Thruway safe and efficient without the need for a toll increase," Tomson, once a
top figure in Pataki's executive chamber, said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday morning, state Assembly Republicans said the Thruway toll
increases can be avoided by relieving the Thruway Authority of the
responsibility of running the state barge canal system.
</P>
<P>
	   Handing the canal system to the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation would save the Thruway Authority $55 million a year, Assembly
Minority Leader John Faso said. If that happens, the authority would be left
with enough money at current toll levels to operate the superhighway and to make
what Thruway officials say are crucial improvements to the system.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway tolls have been propping up operations of the state canal system
since its transfer from the state Department of Transportation to the Thruway
Authority in 1992, amid a deep state financial trough.
</P>
<P>
	   Faso said that including the canal as a responsibility of the Thruway
Authority was a fiscal "contrivance" and a "gimmick" by former Gov. Mario Cuomo
who wanted to fund the historic system with the reliable revenue of Thruway
tolls. The authority was also able to borrow money for canal improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's up to the Legislature to remedy the Cuomo-era mistake that was made,"
Faso said. "It's not up to the Thruway Authority to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Shifting the canal system to the Parks office would put the onus on state
taxpayers to pay for the canals' maintenance and operations, offset by the
relatively small amount raised on the waterways through fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Tomson on Tuesday called the idea of shifting oversight for the canal system
to a different agency "one potential alternative that merits serious
consideration."
</P>
<P>
	   The previously unannounced plan to hike tolls angered Democratic and
Republican legislators, who said a toll increase would harm upstate, where the
economy remains sluggish compared to the rest of the state and nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said even he did not know the toll hike plan was going to be voted
on.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'd be amazed about what I read in the newspapers," Pataki said. "I did
not know they were going to be passing this resolution."
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Republicans said they were not advocating that the Thruway
Authority divest itself of maintenance responsibilities for Interstate 287 and
Interstate 84 north of New York City. Both of those have connections to the
Thruway and are also highway systems, Faso said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, two Democratic committees will continue hearings in Albany on
the proposed Thruway toll increase.

<HEADLINE> Police union delegate denies cops met to coordinate their stories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A police union official admitted Tuesday he told cops at
Brooklyn's 70th Precinct to keep silent about the bathroom assault on Abner
Louima, but denied that four officers agreed in a secret meeting to coordinate
their versions of the brutal incident.
<P>
	   Called as a reluctant government witness, Michael Immitt, a trustee of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, seethed with palpable anger as he testified
about his involvement with three officers now on trial for conspiring to
obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Several times, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad pounced on answers that
evaded or contradicted what Immitt had said previously about the meeting and the
PBA's role in trying to keep the racially charged affair under control.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, Immitt claimed that at the time of the closed-door
stationhouse meeting on Aug. 13, 1997 - four days after the attack - he didn't
know the Louima sexual assault story was already on newsstands under the banner
headline, "Tortured By Cops."
</P>
<P>
	   "This meeting did not occur until after the story was on the front page of
the Daily News?" Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Immitt snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Vinegrad then showed him the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what it says. That's the case," the witness conceded. "If I met with
them that afternoon, then the story was already out."
</P>
<P>
	   Officer Justin Volpe pleaded guilty last May and is serving 30 years for
sodomizing Louima, a Haitian immigrant, with a broom handle. Officer Charles
Schwarz was convicted of holding the victim down and faces a possible life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current trial, Schwarz, 34, Thomas Bruder, 34 and Thomas Wiese, 37,
are accused of conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role by claiming Schwarz was
never in the bathroom when Louima was sodomized.
</P>
<P>
	   At sentencing, Volpe said Wiese was the only other cop in the room during
the incident, and did not take part. Volpe is expected to testify for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   All four were present at the meeting with Immitt and a PBA lawyer four days
later.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Vinegrad's hostile questioning, Immitt denied coaching the four
officers on what to tell investigators from the police Internal Affairs Bureau,
or that he urged other cops at the beleaguered Brooklyn stationhouse to shut up
about the Louima affair.
</P>
<P>
	   He insisted he went to the meeting not knowing what to expect and learned
little about the case from the discussion itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Isn't it a fact that the meeting's purpose was to figure out ... a way that
the IAB investigation would not succeed?" Vinegrad asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," said Immitt. "I had no idea what was going on. ... I walked out
knowing only that Abner Louima had been assaulted in some fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   "But you didn't know that Abner Louima had an object shoved up his rectum?"
Vinegrad asked. "No, I did not," snarled Immitt.
</P>
<P>
	   After Vinegrad reminded him of previous testimony to a federal grand jury,
Immitt admitted that he had visited 70th Precinct roll calls on each of the
three daily shifts to urge officers not to discuss the case - but not for
purposes of interfering with investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want anyone else involved who wasn't involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson indicated he would rule Wednesday on
whether prosecutors may call unnamed witnesses who allegedly overheard Volpe say
he would "say nothin"' to implicate Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on the ruling, the government could wrap up its case by the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Volpe made the remark to Stephen Worth - then Schwarz's
lawyer - in a courthouse hallway last May 20, just days before his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to Worth's apparent inquiry, Volpe responded in substance:
'Don't worry, man. I'm not going to say nothin'." Worth thanked Volpe. Volpe and
Worth then parted," Vinegrad said in a letter to Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter did not name the witnesses but said, "Volpe would have had no
reason to indicate to Schwarz's attorney his intent to say nothing if Schwarz
had not participated in the sexual assault of Mr. Louima."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruder attorney Stuart London argued that the report was only "speculation
and wishful thinking" because it didn't include Worth's question.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors said Worth had asked Volpe, "What are you going to
say? What are you going to do?"

    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp., maker of the F-16 fighter and
other military aircraft and weapons, ranked first in the amount of business
among defense contractors last year with $12.7 billion worth, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In second place was Boeing Co., at $10.9 billion. Boeing makes a wide
variety of weapons, including the F-15 fighter. It is collaborating with
Lockheed on the next-generation Air Force fighter, the F-22 Raptor.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the top six defense contractors in 1999 held the same position the
year before. No. 3 was Raytheon Corp, followed by General Dynamics Corp,
Northrop Grumman Corp. and United Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Litton Industries Inc., a maker of Navy warships and provider of advanced
electronic systems to the U.S. military, moved up to No. 7 on the 1999 list with
$2.1 billion in contract awards. In 1998 it was No. 8 with $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight-largest defense contractor in 1999 was General Electric Co., with
$1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Tied for 9th were TRW Inc. and Textron Inc., each with $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The total value of defense contracts issued by the Pentagon in 1999 was $125
billion, or $6.9 billion more than the year before.

<HEADLINE> Doubts Over US-Colombia Policy  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials told Congress Tuesday coca
production in Colombia is up sharply but Democrats expressed skepticism about
the administration's drug war strategy. Republicans wondered whether the
administration's heart is really in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the head of the White House drug control office, said
that while overall Andean cocaine production was down, the crop in Colombia
reached 520 tons last year compared with 435 tons in 1998 and 230 tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a drug emergency in Colombia,'' McCaffrey told a hearing of a
House Government Reform subcommittee which focuses on drug issues. The new data
illustrates the urgency for congressional action in support of the
administration's $1.6 billion aid package to Colombia, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without additional U.S. assistance, Colombia is unlikely to experience the
dramatic progress in the drug fight experienced by its Andean neighbors,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
	   But some Democrats clearly were left uneasy by the emphasis on military aid
in the package, and their comments recalled those of the 1960's when the United
States was increasing its involvement in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, said she was worried about the United States
being drawn ``deeper and deeper'' into Colombia's civil war, in which guerrillas
are using proceeds from drug sales to finance their struggle for power.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., said the sizable increase in coca production
despite eradication efforts demonstrates ``the failure of the militaristic
approach'' to the drug issue.
</P>
<P>
	   One problem with the deeper U.S. involvement in Colombia is the absence of
an ``exit strategy,'' she said. Rather than devoting U.S. assistance to military
hardware, including 63 helicopters, the money would be better spent on weaning
Colombian farmers away from coca production and on treatment of addicts in the
United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Treatment is 10 times more effective than drug interdiction schemes,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration rejects the notion of the United States becoming trapped
in a bloody conflict in Colombia. In Bogota on Monday, Under Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering said Washington's role will be limited to providing equipment
and training for Colombia's army. The United States won't be drawn into a
``terrible quagmire,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   About three-fourths of the aid package would pay for the helicopters and for
training for two new army counter-drug battalions. The units will be tasked with
retaking rebel-held southern jungles where cocaine production is rapidly
expanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans generally have been more supportive of the administration's
request than Democrats but at times that support has been grudging.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., a subcommittee member and also chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, said signs that the administration is
taking the issue seriously are a welcome change from its first seven years in
office.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the ``endless series of failures'' in getting sorely needed
equipment to Colombia over the years is not reassuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the full Government Reform Committee,
said there have been long delays in sending Blackhawk helicopters to Colombia.
And once the choppers arrived, they could not be utilized because they lacked
the proper armor, he said. There also have been delays in the delivery of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have had screwup after screwup after screwup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said the normally outspoken Burton was understating
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A better word than screwup is sabotage,'' he said, suggesting the mishaps
were not the result of inadvertent errors but deliberate foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton expressed admiration for the ``You fly, you die'' approach of
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to the drug problem -- a reference to Peru's
policy of shooting down planes carrying coca out of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Peruvian drug kingpins have responded by shifting their operations across
the country's northern border into Colombia, resulting in a steady decline in
coca production in Peru. An aggressive campaign in Bolivia against drug lords
has had similar results.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the aid money has been ticketed for Colombia, and Bolivian
officials are worried that their successes could be reversed if they are cut
back too far.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolivian Vice President Jorge Quiroga was in Washington last week telling
legislators that the $48 million proposed by the administration for his country
will meet less than half of Bolivia's needs.

	   Dow Ends Up 198.25; Nasdaq Up 2.22
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in oil stocks and some bargain-hunting
buoyed the Dow Jones industrials today. In a major turnaround from
recent weeks, the strength in blue-chips helped pull technology
stocks out of a severe slump. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
198.25 to close at 10,718.09. The Nasdaq composite index, which
tumbled as much as 127 points in earlier trading, closed up 2.22 at
4,420.77. Broader market indicators were modestly higher. For a
second session, the Dow held up better than the
technology-dominated Nasdaq. Consumer products company 3M led the
blue-chip index. Analysts said the Dow was poised for a comeback
after its 538.59-point drop last week, which knocked the index 11
percent below its January peak.

	   Oil Prices Fuel BP Amoco Profits
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Sharply higher crude oil prices more than offset
pinched margins in the refining industry to help boost BP Amoco
PLC's fourth-quarter operating profit by 145 percent. BP Amoco
announced a quarterly profit for the period ending Dec. 31 of $2.12
billion, excluding one-time charges of $439 million. In the
fourth-quarter a year ago, BP Amoco earned $866 million. The result
was a striking turnaround from a year ago, when the Anglo-American
company's profit plunged due to a 12-year low in oil prices and the
costs of BP's buyout of Chicago-based Amoco Corp. in 1998.

	   Clinton Concerned at Heating Oil
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the rising cost
of home heating oil was ``deeply troubling'' for low-income
families and that the federal government may release more money to
help them warm their homes. ``I have not closed off any options,''
the president said. ``I'm monitoring this on a daily basis.'' He
spoke briefly with reporters in the Cabinet Room after crude oil
prices climbed above $30 for the first time since the eve of the
Persian Gulf War nine years ago. Clinton said there would be some
important meetings among oil-producing countries within the next
few days, and price trends may be more apparent after that.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Chevron has agreed to pay Louisiana $9.6
million in a settlement the state hopes will serve as a model for
its other lawsuits involving alleged severance tax underpayments.
Oil companies must pay a state tax on all oil produced, or severed,
within Louisiana. Under the settlement, Chevron will pay Louisiana
$8.7 million to resolve the claims, plus $865,000 to cover
attorneys' fees for the case. Chevron did not acknowledge violating

years in the post. Koch-Weser is known as a consensus-builder who

	   Industrial Production Soars in January
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines surged in January to its highest
level since August 1998. The Federal Reserve reported today that
production rose by 1 percent last month, twice the 0.5 percent gain
many analysts expected. The gain covered just about all sectors.
Plants were operating at about 81.6 percent of capacity.

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s fourth-quarter profits
rose 23 percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales growth at
its U.S. superstores and operations abroad. While the results
reported today by the world's largest retailer were slightly above
expectations, its stock fell on concerns that its growth may slow
in the coming year. Wal-Mart earned $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a
share, up from 35 cents a share a year ago. Analysts' had forecast
42 cents. Quarterly sales totaled $51.39 billion, an increase of 26
percent over the $40.79 billion in the same period a year ago.

1998. Some photographers also will withhold credits until Feb. 25,
according to their union, the Newspaper Guild of New York. ``This

<HEADLINE> Antismoking Ads Pulled Over Taste  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The organization created to mount the biggest U.S.
antismoking campaign ever has pulled two of its first four edgy commercials
after complaints arose from the world's biggest cigarette maker, a TV network
and some state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the pulled ads showed young people stacking "body bags" on the
sidewalk outside a tobacco company building, while the other showed teens
equipped with a lie detector trying to get into a tobacco company's offices to
quiz sales executives about smoking's addictiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   The building was not specifically identified in either ad but the
commercials were filmed inside and outside the Philip Morris Cos. headquarters
in Manhattan. In addition to complaints from Philip Morris and several state
attorneys general, the CBS television network refused to run the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads are part of a $1.5 billion antismoking campaign being financed with
proceeds from the industry's huge 1998 settlement with the states over claims
for reimbursement for treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   An organization called the American Legacy Foundation was created to oversee
antismoking advertising and educational efforts, and last week it began running
the first commercials in the campaign developed by a team of agencies led by
Arnold Communications of Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The two remaining ads in the initial series of four parodied soft drink and
sneaker commercials, showing one of three product users being unexpectedly
vaporized. The message: "Only one product actually kills a third of the people
who use it. Tobacco."
</P>
<P>
	   But it was the other two ads that drew fire. The 1,200 "body bags" stuffed
with paper and stacked near the tobacco offices in one ad run on the USA Network
this past weekend was supposed to stand for people who die each day from
tobacco-related illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The teenage interrogators in the "Lie Detector" ad that ran on the cable
network Comedy Central late last week wound up being escorted to the door by a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Healton, the president and chief executive of the foundation, said
Tuesday the foundation's board held a teleconference meeting Monday and voted
without objection to take the ads temporarily out of the rotation. She said
efforts would be made to see if the ads could be reworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is obvious we pushed a number of buttons and we are going to keep
pushing buttons," Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said "concerns were raised from a variety of sectors" about the two
ads and addressing the controversy was starting to take too much of her time.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, the maker of the top-selling brand Marlboro, had said last
week that it was disappointed with the "Lie Detector" commercial and the Web
site created for the antismoking campaign and said it was weighing its options.
</P>
<P>
	   It noted that the settlement agreement creating the antismoking campaign
specified that the fund wouldn't be used for personal attacks on an individual
or company, and said Tuesday it was pleased the ads had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS television network refused to run the "Lie Detector" and "Body Bag"
ads because "we feel they crossed the line," CBS spokesman Dana McLintock said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation remains in negotiations with CBS and other networks about
taking its other ads, Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, who led the states in the
1998 negotiations with the tobacco industry and chairs the American Legacy
Foundation, said through a spokesman that several attorneys general she did not
name had also raised objections about the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a distraction from the goal: to stop 3,000 kids a day from becoming
addicted to tobacco," she said. "It was not worth being distracted by one or two
ads with others in the arsenal."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the attorneys general who objected to the ads was Michael F. Easley
of North Carolina, who was among the state negotiators during the tobacco talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter distributed last week to the attorneys general who signed the
agreement, Easley said "there is little question that they can be fairly viewed
as personally attacking or vilifying the tobacco companies, something that all
of us who sat around the negotiating table in New York agreed we would not do."
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the states that signed the agreement rightly expect the tobacco
companies to live up to the commitments they made to us. If we hope to have this
agreement honored, we must do likewise," he wrote in the letter obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company continues to
consider its options on the Web site, which is at www.thetruth.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco critic Matthew Myers, head of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids,
said even after the withdrawal of the ads, the Legacy antismoking campaign still
"is hard-hitting" and the foundation will continue in that direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully this is a one-time incident in which the tobacco companies
demonstrate that they haven't really changed by threatening the foundation
whenever it produces hard-hitting ads that put the tobacco industry in a bad
light," he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge approves $8 million settlement for inmates in 1971 Attica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A judge put his stamp of approval Tuesday on an
offer by New York state to pay $8 million to inmates caught up in the 1971
Attica riot, virtually settling a 25-year-old lawsuit over the nation's
deadliest prison uprising.
<P>
	   The proposed settlement "is determined to be fair, reasonable and in the
best interest ... of all parties concerned and is, therefore, preliminarily
approved," U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca said in a 27-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Final approval will be withheld, he said, until claims have been filed by
all surviving inmates who claimed they were tortured, beaten and denied medical
treatment in the aftermath of the revolt and the bloody efforts by authorities
to put it down.
</P>
<P>
	   State police launched an all-out assault on the maximum-security Attica
Correctional Facility near Buffalo on Sept. 13, 1971, the fifth day of the
uprising. More than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were fired over six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 correction officers died, most of them killed
during the raid. Hundreds more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to settle, the state admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to pay
the inmates' lawyers $4 million in legal fees and costs. The original
class-action lawsuit in 1974 sought $100 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 1,281 inmates who were in prison yard "D" when police stormed the
prison, hundreds have since died and no more than 500 were expected to file
claims. By year's end, the judge will divide up the money between them - most of
them former inmates in their 50s or older.
</P>
<P>
	   With one exception, more than a dozen former inmates spoke in favor of the
deal at a hearing held Monday to give claimants a chance to object to the terms
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph McKee of Rochester, who testified that he was repeatedly beaten and
had four teeth knocked out, said it was time to "get it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Attica's lesson could turn out to be that "even though you are in prison, at
least you can be treated like a human being," said one of the revolt's leaders,
Frank Smith, 66.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, a convicted robber who was freed in 1973, was forced to lie on a
table while officers beat and burned him. He was also ordered to hold a football
under his chin and threatened with death if he allowed it to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the prison was recaptured, inmates were forced to run naked
through a gantlet of law enforcement officers who hit them with clubs and
nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, a federal jury awarded $4 million to Smith and $75,000 to David
Brosig, another inmate who was injured. Telesca was brought into the case in
August when an appeals court reversed those verdicts.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Boost Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Analysts expect OPEC ministers to boost oil production next
month, easing a world shortage. But any increase is unlikely to push down
gasoline prices -- now averaging $1.41 a gallon in the United States -- in time
for the summer travel season.
</P>
<P>
	   There just isn't enough time to supply refineries with enough oil to bring
prices down quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Unhappy with what they're paying at the pump, Americans are already talking
about curtailing their driving just as resorts and other vacation spots are
starting to gear up for summer.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston on Tuesday, homemaker Lydia Gamos filled up her Honda with gas at
$1.45 a gallon and complained, "It certainly does hit you in the pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was holding her driving to "just the minimum ... at least until
it gets a little cheaper."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Fox, 33, manager of a non-profit agency in New York, was filling up at
a midtown Manhattan Amoco station.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous at this point," he said. "I do as little driving as
possible because it's so expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices have been rising steadily since last March, when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil production by 7.5
percent, or more than 2 million barrels a day, to try to boost prices that had
fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that gas prices will go even higher were raised Monday when the price
of crude oil futures closed at $30.25 a barrel -- topping $30 for the first time
in nine years. The price of crude for delivery in March rose further in early
trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but eased later and settled
down at $30.06 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe that OPEC will come under increasing pressure -- especially
from industrialized nations such as the United States -- to raise production at
its next meeting in late March.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Diwan, managing director for global oil markets at The Petroleum
Finance Co. in Washington, expects OPEC will increase oil production 1.5 million
to 1.7 million barrels a day. But because inventories at refineries already are
low, "that won't be enough to bring prices down dramatically and change the gas
outlook in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggests "people better get ready" for national gas prices averaging
$1.60 a gallon before they begin easing.
</P>
<P>
	   Julian Lee, a senior analyst at the London-based Center for Global Energy
Studies, also expects an OPEC production increase, arguing that the cartel
realizes oil has become too dear.
</P>
<P>
	   He points out that oil at $30 a barrel could cause inflation -- and
ultimately economic slowdowns -- in oil-consuming countries. This, in turn, will
dampen oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   "OPEC countries do not want to see economic growth slow," Lee said. "They
are looking to produce oil for those countries into the distant future. They
want a balance."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael C. Young, an oil analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown investment
bank in Boston, also expects OPEC ministers to raise production to a level that
would reduce crude oil prices to about $25 a barrel this summer. Still, he
believes gasoline could hit $1.50 before then.
</P>
<P>
	   If OPEC doesn't move, "it's conceivable gasoline prices could go to $1.70,"
Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is that U.S. refineries normally increase production of
gasoline during the first three months of the year in anticipation of higher
demand in the summer. That's not happening this year because the high crude
prices and short supplies have prompted many refiners to cut back operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the OPEC meeting next month, the Clinton administration is starting
to lobby oil producers to boost their output.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson travels to Mexico to
discuss oil prices. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two big
OPEC producers, next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico, though not an OPEC member, has cut back production in sympathy with
the oil cartel. Analysts point out that it is one of the few non-OPEC
oil-producing countries that could quickly raise crude oil output.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise in crude has also pushed up heating oil prices this winter,
prompting the U.S. government to make $200 million in aid available to
low-income families. The average retail price for heating oil has nearly doubled
over the last year to $1.66 per gallon, up from 86 cents in January 1999,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Association.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the Clinton administration has resisted tapping the 580 million
barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help increase the supply and bring down
prices. However, asked about that Tuesday, President Clinton said: "I have not
closed off any options."

<HEADLINE> Cities seek consolidation of services for survival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Upstate New York's largest cities that helped drive
a young America must be redesigned quickly into a compact model, or else.
<P>
	   The mayors of Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany argued that point at
the Capitol Tuesday. They said the cities need $85 million now, but more
importantly require long-term, fundamental changes like sharing the cost of
services with other governments.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York state has got to modernize its ability to provide services," said
Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello. If not, "Upstate New York is going to collapse,
I'll tell you right now."
</P>
<P>
	   They said the need is as stark as a tax bill.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, a typical family with a median household income of $23,000 a
year pays about $700 in city taxes. If the state doesn't come across with the
aid and changes pushed by the mayors, that bill would be $1,200, or almost three
weeks full paychecks before taxes, according to figures provided by the city.
</P>
<P>
	   As for business, increasing local tax bills are partly to blame for the loss
of a couple hundred Rochester jobs - 40 percent of the work force - at the
Genesee brewery, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors' pitch for fundamental changes include consolidating services
with counties and other municipalities and reducing the size of city governments
that now operate as entities separate of their counties and the towns they
border. The mayors who serve nearly 800,000 residents told the state Senate
Committee on Cities that the "revolutionary" changes should be intiated and
pressured by the state over two to four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we continue to go in the direction we are going we will displace our
troubles," said Albany Mayor Gerald Jennings. He said the rising costs of
services while urban populations and tax bases dwindle is compounding Albany's
deficit of about $9.5 million, where three-quarters of property is tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't cut anymore," said Syracuse Mayor Roy Bernardi. "If we have to cut
it's in police, fire and schools."
</P>
<P>
	   In a time of state government surpluses, windfalls from settlements with
tobacco companies, a new $9 billion Health Care Reform program, and growing
suburbs boasting no town taxes, the four upstate cities face a combined deficit
of more than $73 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state has left us scrounging around for crumbs," said Rochester Mayor
William Johnson Jr. "You can't revitalize upstate if you don't revitalize the
cities."
</P>
<P>
	   Tax credits to help businesses locate in upstate cities is part of Gov.
George Pataki's Upstate Economic Agenda. Pataki announced the $700 million
package of tax cuts and incentives aimed at attracting jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Private sector employment in upstate New York is at an all-time high and
unemployment remains at or below the national average," Pataki said at a
Binghamton high-tech firm. "But we must do more to ensure every upstate
community shares in our strong economy and our record employment levels."
</P>
<P>
	   The fundamental changes of regionalization pushed by the mayors have been
promoted for years, yet rarely implemented. The benefits, however, would ripple
beyond city lines into the relatively prosperous suburbs, the mayors argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question, if the cities are strong, the regions will be," said
Marvin LeRoy, a former supervisor of one of those prosperous suburbs, in a
separate interview. "The lion's share of businesses are still in the cities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our affluence and wealth is from the cities," said LeRoy, a Republican who
stepped down in December after eight years of running the the Saratoga County
town of Clifton Park. The town has 35,000 people, new housing development, new
businesses and no town tax. He served on a state regionalization commission that
"died on the vine" from a lack of action.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's worked in Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., and other cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the long-term changes, the mayors called for about $85
million in funding in the state budget now being written. That, they said, would
help offset huge property tax increases that would erode the confidence in
upstate New York businesses seek.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayors also seek:
</P>
<P>
	   -Unfettered and free use of schools after 3 p.m. for civic and recreation
programs in part to deter juvenile crime that peaks from 3:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   -Allowing more city projects to be exempt from paying government-set
"prevailing" wages to contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   -An official role on local school boards from which they could affect labor
negotiations and policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need New York state to initiate structural changes," Masiello said.
"We're in the battle for our lives."

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart's 4Q Profits Up 23 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s fourth-quarter profits rose 23
percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales growth at its U.S. superstores
and operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   While the results reported Tuesday by the world's largest retailer were
slightly above expectations, its stock fell about 3 percent on concerns that its
growth may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart earned $1.92 billion, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Jan. 31, compared with $1.56 billion, up from 35 cents a share a year ago.
That's above the 42 cents a share that analysts' had forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterly sales totaled $51.39 billion, an increase of 26 percent over the
$40.79 billion in the same period a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a
year, an industry gauge of performance, rose 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales at its Wal-Mart stores rose 12.6 percent in the quarter, boosted by
gains at its Supercenters, which combine discount and grocery stores. Sales at
its Sam's Club warehouse stores increased 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   International sales gained about 164 percent, fueled by strength in its
Mexican, Canadian, British and Puerto Rican division.
</P>
<P>
	   During the quarter, Wal-Mart named Lee Scott as president and chief
executive officer, replacing David Glass who will remain at the company for a
year as chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who was Wal-Mart's chief operating officer and vice chairman, had
been tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also took some significant steps during the quarter to beef up
its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Wal-Mart teamed up with America Online Inc. to develop an
Internet service provider and offer discounted Web access to people who
currently may not have an affordable phone hookup in towns near its 2,500
stores. The name and price of the ISP have not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the company relaunched www.Walmart.com, which now stocks more
than 600,000 items and offers a wide array of services, such as travel
reservations. It also formed a new Internet company with venture-capital firm
Accel Partners, which will work to enhance the giant retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   While Wal-Mart continues to outpace most of its rivals with its sharp
growth, there were fears that its pace may slow in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates four times in the last year to
fend off inflationary pressures -- and may raise rates further. That has raised
concerns that consumer spending may slow in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the real issue affecting all retailers right now," said Jeffrey
Feiner, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart also said that it will continue aggressively cutting prices, which
the company calls "rollbacks." But such promotions will be more difficult in the
coming year because of high raw material prices, increased labor costs and
strengthening of Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The "rollbacks" have been one of Wal-Mart's key marketing strategies to woo
shoppers into its stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart's shares fell 68 3/4 cents to $57.18 3/4 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer's stock was
down as low as $55 in early trading.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Wal-Mart earned $5.58 billion, or $1.25 a share, compared with
$4.43 billion, or 99 cents a share, in 1998. Sales for the year were $165
billion, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Its annual results do not include a 4-cent reduction due to a change in
rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission in how Wal-Mart accounts for
membership revenues at its Sam's Club.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart operated 1,801 Wal-Mart stores, 721 Supercenters,
and 463 Sam's Clubs in the United States. Internationally, the company operated
13 units in Argentina, 14 in Brazil, 166 in Canada, six in China, 95 in Germany,
five in Korea, 462 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico and 232 in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart employs more than 885,000 people in the United States and 255,000
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Thomson Newspapers Put Up for Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Thomson Corp. is selling its U.S. newspapers business,
comprised mainly of 49 local and regional dailies, in order to concentrate on
the professional information services that make up the vast majority of the
Canadian company's operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson is keeping its flagship newspaper The Globe and Mail. Published out
of Thomson's home base of Toronto, it serves as a major national daily for
Canada, going up against the year-old newspaper launched by Conrad Black, The
National Post.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest divestiture for Thomson, following the sale of a British
travel business in 1998 and an oil and gas business in 1989. Thomson has also
sold several of its smaller newspapers over the past few years as part of an
effort to increase the consolidation of papers in regional clusters.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors welcomed the announcement, pushing Thomson's shares up 12.5
percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The dailies being sold are small; most have circulations of less than
50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and more than
75 nondaily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Altogether the newspapers being sold account for less than 15 percent of the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Harrington, president and CEO of Thomson, said the company reached the
decision to put the papers up for sale after deciding to concentrate on business
and professional information services that could be delivered electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   "After we sold the travel business in 1998, we were really an information
company that had an interest in newspapers," Harrington said in an interview.
"Now we're going after the business-to-business and business professional market
that's global in scope and electronic in nature."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson's main business is selling specialized legal, professional and
educational materials, about half of which is delivered electronically. It has a
major legal and regulatory research arm, West Group, and a large business
providing scientific and health care research to academics and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasingly, Thomson has focused on products that can be delivered
electronically instead of in print, such as textbooks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson also operates a financial information service that includes First
Call, a service widely used by Wall Street analysts to disseminate research
about companies to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Garner, president of Thomson Newspapers, said several parties had
already expressed interest on Tuesday after the announcement was made. Lee
Westerfield, a publishing analyst at PaineWebber, said he expected the
newspapers could fetch a price of about 10 times cash flow, which would be more
than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Garner said the company hoped to complete the sale in as few transactions as
possible, adding that the company was not inclined to break up the geographic
concentrations around which the newspapers had been grouped.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana. The titles being sold include the
Connecticut Post, The Tribune of Mesa, Arizona and The Post-Crescent, Appleton,
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Soars; Pork Falls  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Speculation that China will buy more U.S. soybeans -- perhaps more than
200,000 metric tons -- boosted soybean futures prices on the Chicago Board of
Trade Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On other markets, pork prices continued to fall, while palladium
skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, soybean futures had fallen on news that several inches
of rain drenched key growing regions in Brazil on Monday. Traders expected the
rain would boost the supply and drive prices lower once crops are harvested.
</P>
<P>
	   But soybean prices rebounded later in the day on news of a potential deal
with China -- giving a smaller boost to corn futures prices, which also had
fallen earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   China has already bought smaller amounts of U.S. soybeans but has yet to
reveal further import plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "The thought is that China may be interested in buying more," said Don
Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat, however, did not benefit from the rally, with futures finishing the
day mostly lower. Analysts say forecasts for rain in the Plains states played a
role in pressuring prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.66 a bushel; March corn
broke even at $2.22 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell  1/2 cent to $1.08 3/4 a
bushel; and March soybeans jumped 3 3/4 cents to $5.08 3/4 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hog and pork belly futures
continued to fall Tuesday. Analysts say the downward trend is a sign that
generally healthy futures prices are not in line with consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
	   That's particularly true of pork belly prices, which are high for this time
of year, said Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst for Chicago-based Alaron
Trading Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of it has to be wrung out," Levitt said, predicting that the pork
market will continue to be somewhat volatile in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of trading Tuesday, April lean hogs fell 1.38 cents to 56.02
cents a pound; and March pork bellies fell 1.93 cents to 83.32 cents a pound;
April live cattle remained unchanged at 70.62 cents a pound; and March feeder
cattle fell .35 cent to 82.87 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
	   Continued concern over supplies caused March palladium to jump nearly 9
percent. Russia is the leading producer of the metal used to make catalytic
converters for cars but has been lagging in exports.
</P>
<P>
	   March palladium rose $52.85 to $658.35 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange -- a third consecutive all-time high.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move certain to annoy Russia, U.S. diplomats held a
meeting in the State Department with a leader of the breakaway Chechen
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin confirmed that the Deputy Chairman
of the Chechen Parliament, Seilam Bechaev, met Monday with working level

</P>

it regards as essentially terrorist.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Community wants officer tried in court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Citing their own private investigation, leaders
of Hartford's North End community on Tuesday again called for the indictment of
a city police officer in April's fatal shooting of a 14-year-old mugging
suspect.
<P>
	   A special prosecutor's report, and his decision on whether to charge Officer
Robert Allan is expected this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Black community leaders gathered in Mount Olive Church to urge that the
decision be greeted with calm. But they also reaffirmed their strong desire to
see Allan tried in court, be it state or federal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The case should be put before a court and jury and they should be allowed
to decide in accordance with the laws under which we are all governed," said
minister Wadell Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan, who is white, has said he thought he heard gunshots and believed the
boy was reaching for a weapon when he shot him in the early morning hours of
April 13 as the teen and others were fleeing police.
</P>
<P>
	   Muhammad said the group's own investigation turned up several witnesses
whose names were forwarded to New London State's Attorney Kevin Kane, the
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have reason to believe that all of these witnesses in this incident have
not been interviewed by the State's Attorney's Office," said Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   One witness saw Aquan had his hands in the air and was not reaching for
anything, Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group would not discuss the specifics of their findings. They said they
were waiting to see Kane's report, to compare the two. Calls to Kane's office
were not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not judging anything to date. They may have something we don't have.
We want to have an opportunity to review what they found, evaluate it, discuss
it as a group and community and come up with a decision of what action we need
to take at that point," said Larry Charles, executive director of ONE/CHANE a
neighborhood improvement group.
</P>
<P>
	   He said should Kane fail to indict Allan, the group could bring the case to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles said leaders also want to send a strong message specifically to the
community's youth, that regardless of the outcome of Kane's report, they must
not react with violence.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not over. There are still options available to us," said Charles.
</P>
<P>
	   Community leaders also strongly criticized the irregular use of a grand jury
system in Connecticut. Most decisions to bring charges rest solely with a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   "This places an undue burden on a prosecutor because he or she relies on the
testimony of police officers in order to do their job every day," said Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1985, fewer than 10 cases have gone before a grand jury, including the
high-profile Martha Moxley murder case in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Under state law, prosecutors must file an application with a panel of judges
to request a grand jury and demonstrate that other investigative procedures have
failed. The single-person grand jury used in Connecticut doesn't technically
indict a suspect but can recommend whether there is enough evidence to warrant
an arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   City councilwoman Elizabeth Horton Sheff said regardless of the special
prosecutor's ruling she will urge that Allan be dismissed from the Hartford
police department.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is, not prepared, in my opinion, to serve as a sworn peace officer in
this city," she said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Computer Research Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed a $6.9 billion measure Tuesday aimed at
expanding the government's role in computer and scientific research and
maintaining the nation's role as a technology leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which passed by voice vote, would almost double the amount spent
on technology research last year. Over the next five years, it would funnel
millions more into research projects that include ways to speed up the Internet
and how to integrate computing and medical research.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maintaining the nation's global leadership in information technology is
not a given,'' said Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., chairman of the
House Science Committee. ``This bipartisan legislation demonstrates a commitment
to upholding our nation's preeminence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., said past successes are not enough to ``keep pace
and ahead of a world that is dedicated to matching us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current boom in information technology is based on the basic research
carried out more than 15 years ago,'' Smith said. ``There is an urgent need to
replenish the knowledge base.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers have noted that the Internet was based largely on technology
developed in the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> TV, Radio Ads Drive Gains at CBS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. narrowly beat analysts' expectations for
fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday as advertising gains in its television and radio
operations surged ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS reported net income of $251 million, or 34 cents per share, for the
three months ended Dec. 31 compared to a net loss of $1 million in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The reported figures included a one-time gain of $232 million related to the
sale of the company's former industrial businesses. Without the gain, CBS earned
$19 million, or 3 cents per share, edging the 2 cents per share estimated by
analysts surveyed by First Call /Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues jumped 24 percent to $2.22 billion from $1.79 billion in the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   A robust environment for advertising spending lifted results across CBS'
business segments, which include the TV network, 16 TV stations, cable and a
majority stake in Infinity Broadcasting, a major radio broadcaster and outdoor
advertising company.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS' newly formed Internet subsidiary lost $30 million, mainly as a result
of its investment in iWon.com, a new portal site which launched a major ad
campaign during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Not counting the Internet loss, depreciation or amortization costs, the
company's after-tax cash flow rose 81 percent to $279 million from $154 million
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   During the fourth quarter CBS also completed its acquisition of King World,
a major syndicator of TV programs such as "Wheel of Fortune." Its Infinity
subsidiary also closed its deal to acquire Outdoor Systems, a major billboard
and out-of-home advertising company.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS was reporting in what may be its last quarter as a stand-alone company
before its merger with MTV owner Viacom Inc., which was recently approved by the
shareholders of both companies.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, CBS reported net income of $780 million, or $1.08 per
share, compared to a loss of $21 million or 3 cents per share in 1998. Revenues
rose 8 percent to $7.37 billion from $6.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS shares fell $1.75 to $38.50 in trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Antismoking Ads Pulled Over Taste  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The organization created to mount the biggest U.S.
antismoking campaign ever has pulled two of its first four edgy commercials
after complaints arose from the world's biggest cigarette maker, a TV network
and some state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the pulled ads showed young people stacking "body bags" on the
sidewalk outside a tobacco company building, while the other showed teens
equipped with a lie detector trying to get into a tobacco company's offices to
quiz sales executives about smoking's addictiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   The building was not specifically identified in either ad but the
commercials were filmed inside and outside the Philip Morris Cos. headquarters
in Manhattan. In addition to complaints from Philip Morris and several state
attorneys general, the CBS television network refused to run the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads are part of a $1.5 billion antismoking campaign being financed with
proceeds from the industry's huge 1998 settlement with the states over claims
for reimbursement for treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   An organization called the American Legacy Foundation was created to oversee
antismoking advertising and educational efforts, and last week it began running
the first commercials in the campaign developed by a team of agencies led by
Arnold Communications of Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The two remaining ads in the initial series of four parodied soft drink and
sneaker commercials, showing one of three product users being unexpectedly
vaporized. The message: "Only one product actually kills a third of the people
who use it. Tobacco."
</P>
<P>
	   But it was the other two ads that drew fire. The 1,200 "body bags" stuffed
with paper and stacked near the tobacco offices in one ad run on the USA Network
this past weekend was supposed to stand for people who die each day from
tobacco-related illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The teenage interrogators in the "Lie Detector" ad that ran on the cable
network Comedy Central late last week wound up being escorted to the door by a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Healton, the president and chief executive of the foundation, said
Tuesday the foundation's board held a teleconference meeting Monday and voted
without objection to take the ads temporarily out of the rotation. She said
efforts would be made to see if the ads could be reworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is obvious we pushed a number of buttons and we are going to keep
pushing buttons," Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said "concerns were raised from a variety of sectors" about the two
ads and addressing the controversy was starting to take too much of her time.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, the maker of the top-selling brand Marlboro, had said last
week that it was disappointed with the "Lie Detector" commercial and the Web
site created for the antismoking campaign and said it was weighing its options.
</P>
<P>
	   It noted that the settlement agreement creating the antismoking campaign
specified that the fund wouldn't be used for personal attacks on an individual
or company, and said Tuesday it was pleased the ads had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS television network refused to run the "Lie Detector" and "Body Bag"
ads because "we feel they crossed the line," CBS spokesman Dana McLintock said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation remains in negotiations with CBS and other networks about
taking its other ads, Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, who led the states in the
1998 negotiations with the tobacco industry and chairs the American Legacy
Foundation, said through a spokesman that several attorneys general she did not
name had also raised objections about the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a distraction from the goal: to stop 3,000 kids a day from becoming
addicted to tobacco," she said. "It was not worth being distracted by one or two
ads with others in the arsenal."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the attorneys general who objected to the ads was Michael F. Easley
of North Carolina, who was among the state negotiators during the tobacco talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter distributed last week to the attorneys general who signed the
agreement, Easley said "there is little question that they can be fairly viewed
as personally attacking or vilifying the tobacco companies, something that all
of us who sat around the negotiating table in New York agreed we would not do."
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the states that signed the agreement rightly expect the tobacco
companies to live up to the commitments they made to us. If we hope to have this
agreement honored, we must do likewise," he wrote in the letter obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company continues to
consider its options on the Web site, which is at www.thetruth.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco critic Matthew Myers, head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
said even after the withdrawal of the ads, the Legacy antismoking campaign still
"is hard-hitting" and it bears watching whether the foundation will continue in
that direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully this is a one-time incident in which the tobacco companies
demonstrate that they haven't really changed by threatening the foundation
whenever it produces hard-hitting ads that put the tobacco industry in a bad
light," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gillette May Sell Stationery Units  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co. shares gained 4 percent Tuesday after the
company said it may dispose of its struggling stationery products business to
concentrate on its better-performing razors and batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it has well-known brands, the Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman pen
lines have been a drag on Gillette's earnings, with profit from the stationery
business dropping 89 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the stationery business just didn't fit well with Gillette's
shaving products and Duracell batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It strikes at core competencies. What businesses are you in?" said Ira R.
Weiss, dean of the College of Business Administration at Northeastern
University. "It seems to me that pens are a business to get out of."
</P>
<P>
	   Pens and related products accounted for about 7.5 percent of Gillette's $10
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette got into the business in 1955 when it bought the Paper Mate brand.
Liquid Paper correction fluid was added in 1979, and the company bought the
Waterman pen maker in 1987 and the Parker pen brand in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   But the sector has stumbled. In addition to the dismal fourth-quarter
profits, quarterly stationery sales fell 17 percent. For all of last year
stationery sales were down 13 percent and profits were off 83 percent from 1998
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Gillette confirmed that it has retained Merrill Lynch to
assist in a review of its alternatives for the stationery business. The company
will only say a decision will be made "early this year."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at several options. Divestiture is one of those options,
spinning it off is an option, as is retaining it," said Eric A. Kraus, the
company's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette also makes lines of toiletries, and it owns the Oral-B brand of
dental care products and Duracell batteries. The company makes Braun household
products which have also been faltering of late, and some followers of the
company have suggested that line should be disposed of as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The battery business is currently one of the strongest elements in
Gillette's portfolio, while the personal hygiene products at least have some
marketing and distribution similarities with Gillette's market-dominating razors
and blades.
</P>
<P>
	   But pens -- especially the deluxe Waterman and Parker brands -- have a hard
time fitting in with such a stable of products, said Fredric E. Russell, head of
Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co., a Tulsa, Okla., money management
firm that has stock in Gillette.
</P>
<P>
	   "When people think of consuming blades, they also think of consuming on the
same shopping trips toothpaste and things like that, but not pens," Russell
said. "These are very good, smart strategic moves to sell off the stationery."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell said it was not clear how much of a premium the stationery business
would fetch.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may not get a fire sale price, but they're not going to get a price
driven by euphoria either," he said. "They're not selling at the peak, but they
are making a good decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette's stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, gained $1.75
Tuesday to $38.50 a share as of 4:30 p.m. EST. The stock has fallen sharply from
its March 1999 52-week high of $64.37 1/2, but Weiss thought selling off the
stationery business would put Gillette on the road to reconciliation with Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly the stockholders on Wall Street are not looking favorably on them,
although Gillette has been the star for ages for ongoing continued growth,"
Weiss said. "The street is going to look kindly at getting rid of those pens.
You're getting rid of a drag on profits."

<HEADLINE> School owner emerges as Skakel's biggest defender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - Michael Skakel once described the Elan School as
a "concentration camp for kids," a place where he claimed he was beaten and
abused.
<P>
	   But now, more than 20 years after Skakel was treated for alcoholism at Elan,
school cofounder Joseph Ricci has emerged as Skakel's biggest defender and
perhaps his best hope for beating charges he killed Greenwich teen-ager Martha
Moxley in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci disputes critical elements of the prosecution's case against Skakel,
the 39-year-old nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci challenges allegations by former Elan students who claim that Skakel -
a student from 1978 to 1980 - confessed to killing Moxley in October 1975, when
they were both 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing took place in the exclusive Belle Haven neighborhood of
Greenwich, where Moxley and Skakel were neighbors. Moxley was beaten with a
6-iron that was matched to a set of golf clubs owned by the Skakels.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci claims that although the Moxley murder was discussed at the school
during Skakel's therapy, no confession was ever made.
</P>
<P>
	   His account finds support among some former Elan students, but conflicts
with what investigators have heard from others.
</P>
<P>
	   One former student recently interviewed by The Hartford Courant said he
never heard that Skakel confessed, either publicly or privately.
</P>
<P>
	   Another student, according to the transcript of a 1996 interview, said he
learned in the early 1990s that Skakel may have confessed privately to his
roommate.
</P>
<P>
	   Still another student, according to investigators, claims to have heard
Skakel privately admit guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci discounts such incriminating statements, attributing them to the lure
of reward money.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to see Martha Moxley's mother get closure because I have two
children of my own, but this is a big lie," Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel was committed to Elan in 1978 at age 17 by his father, Rushton
Skakel, following a drunken driving incident in New York. He spent two years at
Elan, which was licensed to treat teen-agers with substance abuse and behavioral
problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci said Skakel was confronted by peers and counselors about his suspected
involvement in Moxley's murder, but school officials made Skakel aware that
juvenile laws at the time would have resulted in him being imprisoned only until
the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's illogical for him not to have come forward back then," Ricci said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stories that Skakel had publicly confessed to the killing while at Elan were
first alleged by Sutton Associates, an investigative firm hired in 1992 by the
Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaked in 1995, the report revealed that the two brothers had changed their
stories regarding their whereabouts on the night Moxley was killed. A former
Elan student and worker, Dan Benison, claimed Skakel had talked about the murder
during a therapy session, Sutton investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Tuesday, the Greenwich Time reported that some physical evidence
in the murder investigation may be missing, although it may not figure in the
prosecution of Skakel.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing sources knowledgeable of the investigation, the newspaper said a pair
of red-stained dungarees and sneakers that belonged to Skakel are missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Police records indicate that the red stains on the pants and sneakers were
found to be zinc oxide boat paint.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel was arrested Jan. 19, more than 24 years after Moxley's killing. His
arraignment is scheduled for March 14.

<HEADLINE> German Leader Spurs Anger in Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By BARAK BARFI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Germany's president came to Israel Tuesday speaking words
of reconciliation, but the language he used to speak them -- German -- sparked
controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   Johannes Rau, who assumed office last May, chose Israel as his first state
visit. On Wednesday, he is also to be the first person to address the Israeli
parliament, the Knesset, in German -- touching a nerve in a land where once the
mere idea of establishing ties with Germany set off bloody riots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the language in which we were persecuted and murdered and tortured
and slandered and cursed,'' Dov Shilansky, a former Knesset speaker and a
Holocaust survivor, said in a phone interview. ``The very sound causes
(Holocaust survivors) a trauma.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rau was conscious of the burden any German state visitor bears, and was
careful to recall German responsibility for the Holocaust -- the murder of 6
million Jews by the Nazis and their allies in German-occupied Europe from
1939-45.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Soon there will no longer be witnesses of our history, which is fraught
with unspeakable pain,'' he said at a state dinner given by Israeli President
Ezer Weizman. ``Therefore, it is important to pass on our knowledge and our
experience to those who in the future will assume positions of responsibility in
our two countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   In each of his speeches, Rau emphasized strengthening the close ties the two
nations have enjoyed since 1965, when they first exchanged ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to invite Israel's youth to visit Germany to experience our
present-day culture, to meet young Germans, to build friendships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As opposition leader in the 1950s, Menachem Begin led violent protests
against accepting Holocaust reparations from the Germans -- much less
establishing ties. The music of Hitler favorite Richard Wagner was banned from
public broadcast here until the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Shilansky said that while he was speaker, he would walk out of the plenum
when German dignitaries made appearances in the visitors gallery. He once took a
``holiday'' rather than host the speaker of the Bundestag.
</P>
<P>
	   Others, noting Rau's outspoken criticism of the new Austrian government that
includes a far-right party headed by Joerg Haider, said Israel should extend
greater understanding to the new Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The language that allowed the Nazis to communicate is the mother tongue of
Hell,'' Shevah Weiss, another former Knesset speaker and a Holocaust survivor
told Israel television. But he quickly added that German was also the language
of influential Jews, including Theodor Herzl, the Austrian founder of Zionism.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel, Weiss said, should be the last country ``to cut off languages and
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rau is also scheduled to tour the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial on
Wednesday, and will lunch with Prime Minister Ehud Barak. After Israel, he will
visit the Palestinian Authority and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall in Light Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mostly lower in light trading Tuesday as
investors cashed in on gains made during the two previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors took some profits but essentially traded cautiously
in advance of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony,
scheduled Thursday before the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose
to 6.24 percent from 6.22 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Greenspan's upcoming testimony, bond traders were also
keeping a cautious eye on surging oil prices, which added to inflation worries.
Crude oil climbed above $30 a barrel on Monday for the first time since the eve
of the Persian Gulf War and remained about $30 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to down 1/16 point
Tuesday, while intermediate maturities fell  1/8 point or were unchanged,
according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.73
percent, with the discount rising 0.06 percentage point from Monday's auction to
5.57 percent. Six-month yields were 6.00 percent as the discount fell 0.02
percent from the weekly auction to 5.74 percent. One-year yields finished
unchanged at 6.16 percent, with the discount holding at Monday's late rate of
5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.88 percent from 5.81 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 1/16 point to 92 5/32. The
yield was unchanged at 6.24 percent.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen on Tuesday, but fell
against the euro and the British pound.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 98.12 cents, up from 97.96
cents at the same point on Monday. The dollar, meanwhile, was trading at 109.05
Japanese yen, up from late Monday's quote of 108.83 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The advance against the yen, came amid worries about the strength of the

<P>
	   Currency markets have been quiet this week ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6366 Swiss francs, down from
1.6402 on Friday, and 1.4569 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4576. The British
pound rose to $1.5964 compared with late Monday's quote of $1.5878.
</P>
<P>
	   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer

<HEADLINE> Deadline Looms for Examiner Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The staffs of the city's two daily newspapers
anxiously awaited word Tuesday on whether the Hearst Corp. had found a buyer to
save the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst said it would close the flagship paper of its media empire if a buyer
wasn't found by close of business Tuesday. It said the remnants of the afternoon
Examiner would be merged with the newspaper's morning rival, the San Francisco
Chronicle, which Hearst is buying.
</P>
<P>
	   The Examiner, owned by the Hearst family since 1880, has been up for sale
since August with no apparent bidders.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle and its efforts to dissolve
the papers' 1965 Joint Operating Agreement have been held up pending a Justice
Department investigation into complaints that Hearst will have a monopoly in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst sweetened the terms in January to address those concerns, and then
set a deadline for finding a buyer. If no one emerged, it could then claim the
Examiner is a failing enterprise, merge the dailies and dissolve the agreement,
which guarantees each paper 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst executives weren't saying Tuesday whether a buyer had been found. By
midday, even Examiner Publisher Tim White complained of being stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
	   It is "very frustrating," White told KTVU-TV. "I'm bugging them but I'm
getting nothing. ... We're very frustrated not knowing about our future."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar tensions were being felt by the staffs of both papers, said Doug
Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California Media Workers Guild.
There are 377 guild members at the Chronicle, 203 at the Examiner and 543 at the
agency that runs both papers' business operations. In all, the papers have 2,600
employees, 580 of them in editorial jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers share business operations but maintain separate newsroom staffs.
The Examiner's weekday circulation is about 107,000, the Chronicle's, 457,000.

<HEADLINE> Gillette May Sell Stationery Units  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM KIRCHOFER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette Co. shares gained 4 percent Tuesday after the
company said it may dispose of its struggling stationery products business to
concentrate on its better-performing razors and batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it has well-known brands, the Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman pen
lines have been a drag on Gillette's earnings, with profit from the stationery
business dropping 89 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the stationery business just didn't fit well with Gillette's
shaving products and Duracell batteries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It strikes at core competencies. What businesses are you in?" said Ira R.
Weiss, dean of the College of Business Administration at Northeastern
University. "It seems to me that pens are a business to get out of."
</P>
<P>
	   Pens and related products accounted for about 7.5 percent of Gillette's $10
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette got into the business in 1955 when it bought the Paper Mate brand.
Liquid Paper correction fluid was added in 1979, and the company bought the
Waterman pen maker in 1987 and the Parker pen brand in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   But the sector has stumbled. In addition to the dismal fourth-quarter
profits, quarterly stationery sales fell 17 percent. For all of last year
stationery sales were down 13 percent and profits were off 83 percent from 1998
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Gillette confirmed that it has retained Merrill Lynch to
assist in a review of its alternatives for the stationery business. The company
will only say a decision will be made "early this year."
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at several options. Divestiture is one of those options,
spinning it off is an option, as is retaining it," said Eric A. Kraus, the
company's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette also makes lines of toiletries, and it owns the Oral-B brand of
dental care products and Duracell batteries. The company makes Braun household
products which have also been faltering of late, and some followers of the
company have suggested that line should be disposed of as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The battery business is currently one of the strongest elements in
Gillette's portfolio, while the personal hygiene products at least have some
marketing and distribution similarities with Gillette's market-dominating razors
and blades.
</P>
<P>
	   But pens -- especially the deluxe Waterman and Parker brands -- have a hard
time fitting in with such a stable of products, said Fredric E. Russell, head of
Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co., a Tulsa, Okla., money management
firm that has stock in Gillette.
</P>
<P>
	   "When people think of consuming blades, they also think of consuming on the
same shopping trips toothpaste and things like that, but not pens," Russell
said. "These are very good, smart strategic moves to sell off the stationery."
</P>
<P>
	   Russell said it was not clear how much of a premium the stationery business
would fetch.
</P>
<P>
	   "They may not get a fire sale price, but they're not going to get a price
driven by euphoria either," he said. "They're not selling at the peak, but they
are making a good decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillette's stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, gained $1.50
Tuesday to $38.25 a share as of 4:30 p.m. EST. The stock has fallen sharply from
its March 1999 52-week high of $64.37 1/2, but Weiss thought selling off the
stationery business would put Gillette on the road to reconciliation with Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly the stockholders on Wall Street are not looking favorably on them,
although Gillette has been the star for ages for ongoing continued growth,"
Weiss said. "The street is going to look kindly at getting rid of those pens.
You're getting rid of a drag on profits."

<HEADLINE> New York state's highest court hears commuter tax case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki made a
"sham" of the lawmaking process when they rescinded a lucrative New York City
tax to help candidates in a state Senate election, a lawyer for the city argued
Tuesday.
<P>
	   Elizabeth Freedman, an assistant corporation counsel, told the seven-member
state Court of Appeals that state leaders eliminated the city's "commuter" tax
for "frivolous and truly insignificant reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   The members of the state's highest court would be justified in undoing the
tax rescinder, she argued, because of the political motivation behind passage of
the state law. She also contended that technically, the state did not have the
authority to rescind the tax because it had not been formally asked to do so by
the New York City Counsel in a "home rule" message.
</P>
<P>
	   But Freedman's arguments prompted some sharp questioning from Court of
Appeals judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Howard Levine told her, "You're suggesting that we're going to test
the credibility of the statements by (legislative) sponsors, statements in
debates? We're going to say they're disingenuous?"
</P>
<P>
	   And Judge Joseph Bellacosa said by using such words as "sham" and
"legitimate," Freedman was asking the court to get into "some heady waters"
where the judges were being asked to interpret not only the legality of what
legislators did, but their motivations for doing so, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, lawyers for New Jersey and Connecticut asked the court to find
it unconstitutional for New York to waive the commuter tax for New York state
residents who live outside the five boroughs, but to charge it to residents of
Connecticut, New Jersey or Pennsylvania who work in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dealing with fundamental, profound, significant principles,"
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. "This is precisely the
kind of levy, indeed, that our constitutional framers sought to prevent.
Disparate treatment. Discriminatory burden. Unfair treatment."
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's deputy attorney general, Patrick DeAlmeida, called on the Court
of Appeals to order refunds of the commuter tax to out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state has hundreds of millions of dollars that it's going to keep from
out-of-state residents, interest free," DeAlmeida said. "It has had it for some
time and there is no justification for the state to have an interest-free loan
on the back of out-of-state residents under a clearly unconstitutional statute."
</P>
<P>
	   The Court of Appeals is expected to issue a written ruling within six weeks.
The judges have promised to handle the case - various earlier legal actions
against the commuter tax were consolidated into one case for reasons of the
appeal - in an expedited fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both friends and foes of rescinding the commuter tax agree that its demise
was precipitated by local politics.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a tough special election race to fill a vacant state Senate seat
in New York City's northern suburbs, the Democratic candidate stated that if
elected, he would not vote to extend the commuter tax. Republican candidate
Thomas Morahan - the eventual winner - said he would go one better and work to
repeal the tax altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   To the dismay of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Legislature and
Pataki quickly did away with the tax, even before the special election was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he and the Legislature did the right thing and it's time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the commuter tax is gone," Pataki said Tuesday at an appearance at
a high-tech research center in Albany. "I think it's a good thing that will help
the state's economy and certainly help the city's economy. People will no longer
have a reason to avoid working or having their office located in New York City."
</P>
<P>
	   The case puts Giuliani, who is expected to run for Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton this November, in the somewhat uncomfortable position of pursuing
a court case to make hundreds of thousands of commuters - and potential voters
in a Senate election - pay a tax to the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have the advantage and disadvantage of holding a public office that is
one of the most difficult in the country," he said Monday when asked about the
case. "The things that I did as mayor of New York City to protect the people of
New York City I would equally as strongly and equally as well do to protect the
people of the state of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Some 300,000 commuters from surrounding states work in New York City daily.
About 500,000 others come in from New York counties outside the five boroughs.
The city's 0.45 percent income tax totals $450 on an income of $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   A complete repeal could cost the city as much as $360 million a year;
repealing the tax only for New York residents would cost $210 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Two more officers claim Diallo threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Toeing the defense line, two more officers on trial
for killing Amadou Diallo with a barrage of 41 bullets testified Tuesday he
appeared to draw a gun and take a "combat stance" as shots flew.
<P>
	   Both Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy also described a futile search inside
the vestibule of Diallo's Bronx apartment building for a gun he never had. Boss
told jurors at the murder trial he was "destroyed" to learn the black object
found in the West African immigrant's right hand was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kept praying the weapon would be in there, that it was somewhere," said
Boss, who fired five of the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the gunfire, Diallo stood at the rear of the 5-by-7-foot vestibule with
his right arm extended, Boss said. The victim, he added, "was crouched like in a
combat stance. ... The same one I was taught in the police academy."
</P>
<P>
	   Boss also testified that he saw Officer Edward McMellon "fly off" of
Diallo's doorstep. When the gunfire ended, he grabbed McMellon and "started
feeling his chest, going 'Where are you hit, where are you hit?' ... He said,
'I'm not hit."' McMellon actually had fallen while retreating.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Murphy: "There was not a doubt in my mind that (Diallo) had a gun. I
had a sick feeling in my stomach that I was going to be hit at any second.
That's why I fired." He shot four times.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury heard a recording of a radio call in which a frantic-sounding Boss
says, "I need a bus forthwith, and a boss" - police parlance for an ambulance
and a supervisor. He said he had to find a street sign before giving the
dispatcher a location because "I didn't know what street I was on."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys never questioned Boss about shooting and killing a man armed with
a shotgun in Brooklyn in October 1997. The district attorney found no
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   In the courtroom were several of the officers' family members and supporters
wearing "Free the Bronx 4" buttons. Diallo's Guinean parents, dressed in
colorful robes, sat across the aisle; scores of their supporters rallied
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony of Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, echoed that of codefendants Sean
Carroll, 37, and McMellon, 27, who took the stand Monday to explain why they
each fired 16 shots. Diallo was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the shooting - at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999 - the
plainclothes officers wore blue jeans and sneakers and bulletproof vests under
sweatshirts.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were patrolling Diallo's neighborhood in an unmarked car in
search of armed criminals. Only Carroll had more than one year of experience in
the roving Street Crime Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers' testimony emphasized similar points: that it was dark; that
Diallo ignored orders to halt for questioning; that the gunfire lasted only a
few seconds and was continuous; and that the victim remained on his feet
throughout. Each officer denied ever shooting him after he was already down.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
trapping the unarmed victim in the vestibule with a "wall of lead." Backed by
autopsy findings, prosecutors also say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he
was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers resulted in
enough pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread police abuse of
minorities that an appeals decided to move the case to Albany. Testimony was
expected to continue through the end of this week, with summations early next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi and attorneys were to meet Tuesday to
discuss how the jury will be instructed before deliberating.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional murder,
depraved indifference and reckless endangerment. If convicted, they face a
maximum sentence of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney say the jury probably will be allowed to consider lesser charges
against the officers - like manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide -
which carry lighter penalties.

<HEADLINE> Oil Production Boost Expected  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN ALT POWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Analysts expect OPEC ministers to boost oil production next
month, easing a world shortage. But any increase is unlikely to push down
gasoline prices -- now averaging $1.41 a gallon in the United States -- in time
for the summer travel season.
</P>
<P>
	   There just isn't time to supply refineries with enough crude oil so they can
make more gas quickly and bring down the price.
</P>
<P>
	   Unhappy with what they're paying at the pump, Americans are already talking
about curtailing their driving just as resorts and other vacation spots are
starting to gear up for summer.
</P>
<P>
	   In Houston on Tuesday, homemaker Lydia Gamos filled up her Honda with gas at
$1.45 a gallon and complained, "It certainly does hit you in the pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   She said she was holding her driving to "just the minimum ... at least until
it gets a little cheaper."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Fox, 33, manager of a non-profit agency in New York, was filling up at
a midtown Manhattan Amoco station.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous at this point," he said. "I do as little driving as
possible because it's so expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices have been rising steadily since last March, when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude oil production by 7.5
percent, or more than 2 million barrels a day, to try to boost prices that had
fallen to 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Fears that gas prices will go even higher were raised Monday when the price
of crude oil futures closed at $30.25 a barrel -- topping $30 for the first time
in nine years. The price of crude for delivery in March rose further in early
trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but eased later and settled
down at $30.06 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe that OPEC will come under increasing pressure -- especially
from industrialized nations such as the United States -- to raise production at
its next meeting in late March.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Diwan, managing director for global oil markets at The Petroleum
Finance Co. in Washington, expects OPEC will increase oil production 1.5 million
to 1.7 million barrels a day. But because inventories at refineries already are
low, "that won't be enough to bring prices down dramatically and change the gas
outlook in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggests "people better get ready" for national gas prices averaging
$1.60 a gallon before they begin easing.
</P>
<P>
	   Julian Lee, a senior analyst at the London-based Center for Global Energy
Studies, also expects an OPEC production increase, arguing that the cartel
realizes oil has become too dear.
</P>
<P>
	   He points out that oil at $30 a barrel could cause inflation -- and
ultimately economic slowdowns -- in oil-consuming countries. This, in turn, will
dampen oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   "OPEC countries do not want to see economic growth slow," Lee said. "They
are looking to produce oil for those countries into the distant future. They
want a balance."
</P>
<P>
	   Michael C. Young, an oil analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown investment
bank in Boston, also expects OPEC ministers to raise production to a level that
would reduce crude oil prices to about $25 a barrel this summer. Still, he
believes gasoline could hit $1.50 before then.
</P>
<P>
	   If OPEC doesn't move, "it's conceivable gasoline prices could go to $1.70,"
Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is that U.S. refineries normally increase production of
gasoline during the first three months of the year in anticipation of higher
demand in the summer. That's not happening this year because the high crude
prices and short supplies have prompted many refiners to cut back operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the OPEC meeting next month, the Clinton administration is starting
to lobby oil producers to boost their output.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson travels to Mexico to
discuss oil prices. He is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, two big
OPEC producers, next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico, though not an OPEC member, has cut back production in sympathy with
the oil cartel. Analysts point out that it is one of the few non-OPEC
oil-producing countries that could quickly raise crude oil output.
</P>
<P>
	   The rise in crude has also pushed up heating oil prices this winter,
prompting the U.S. government to make $200 million in aid available to
low-income families. The average retail price for heating oil has nearly doubled
over the last year to $1.66 per gallon, up from 86 cents in January 1999,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Association.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the Clinton administration has resisted tapping the 580 million
barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help increase the supply and bring down
prices. However, asked about that Tuesday, President Clinton said: "I have not
closed off any options."

<HEADLINE> Metal, Cyanide Warning in E. Europe  </HEADLINE>
   By KATARINA KRATOVAC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia warned on Tuesday of dangerous metal
concentrations in an East European river already contaminated by a cyanide
spill.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Ministry said laboratory tests showed considerably increased
iron and copper levels in the Tisza river, where the cyanide spill has wiped out
virtually all life. The cyanide poured into streams from a containment dam at a
gold mine near the Romanian town of Baia Mare on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization earlier had expressed concern that heavy
metals such as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, posing
potentially a far greater health threat.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Predrag Polic, head of the university's Chemistry faculty, said
someone ``may have abused the commotion around the cyanide spill to dump
excessive lead quantities into the Tisza.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lead -- among the world's top three pollutants -- degrades very slowly and
can contaminate food for years. ``This odorless metal is highly toxic and
attacks the nervous system,'' Polic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Australia-based Esmeralda Ltd., co-owner of the Baia Mare gold mine, has
denied responsibility for the cyanide spill, saying the extent of poisoning had
been exaggerated. Romania has also said the damage was overstated and that it
has suffered the most.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary asked the United Nations for an independent team of experts to
assess the spill. Major European donors have been asked to make more experts
available for drawing up an immediate response to the spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia's environment minister, Branislav Blazic, said there are fears that
dead fish are piling up on the bottom of the Tisza, which flows into the Danube.
By Tuesday afternoon, communities along the Serbian section of the river said
they had retrieved and buried tons of poisoned fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Local villages were covered with signs warning people not to eat fish from
the Tisza. Farms along the riverbank were cautioned not to use well water since
the cyanide is likely to have seeped into groundwater.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunters and rangers reported seeing the first dead land animals, presumably
poisoned after drinking from the river, the independent Beta news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Hungary and Serbia have demanded compensation from Romania, and the
Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban said Tuesday: ``We are planning to initiate
court action against the Romanian company and will also initiate one in
Australia, against the parent company. And we are seriously considering one
against the Romanian state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry issued a protest note to the
Romanian Embassy in Belgrade. The note cited ``serious damage caused by the
destruction of fish in the Tisza and the hazard to the riverside.''
</P>
<P>
	   One environmental expert has expressed optimism that the river will rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an accumulative toxin,'' Donald Macalady, director of the Center
for Environmental Risk Assessment at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden,
Colo., said Monday ``It will take a while, but the river will recover.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private
environmental group in Washington, D.C., that monitors mining, said the cyanide
spill is comparable to a 1992 cyanide spill in Colorado. That spill cost $170
million to clean up.

<HEADLINE> Anti-smoking Ads Pulled Over Taste  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The organization created to mount the biggest U.S.
anti-smoking campaign ever has pulled two of its first four edgy commercials
after complaints arose from the world's biggest cigarette maker, a TV network
and some state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the pulled ads showed young people stacking "body bags" on the
sidewalk outside a tobacco company building, while the other showed teens
equipped with a lie detector trying to get into a tobacco company's offices to
quiz sales executives about smoking's addictiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   The building was not specifically identified in either ad but the
commercials were filmed inside and outside the Philip Morris Cos. headquarters
in Manhattan. In addition to complaints from Philip Morris and several state
attorneys general, the CBS television network refused to run the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads are part of a $1.5 billion anti-smoking campaign being financed with
proceeds from the industry's huge 1998 settlement with the states over claims
for reimbursement for treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   An organization called the American Legacy Foundation was created to oversee
anti-smoking advertising and educational efforts, and last week it began running
the first commercials in the campaign developed by a team of agencies led by
Arnold Communications of Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The two remaining ads in the initial series of four parodied soft drink and
sneaker commercials, showing one of three product users being unexpectedly
vaporized. The message: "Only one product actually kills a third of the people
who use it. Tobacco."
</P>
<P>
	   But it was the other two ads that drew fire. The 1,200 "body bags" stuffed
with paper and stacked near the tobacco offices in one ad run on the USA Network
this past weekend was supposed to stand for people who die each day from
tobacco-related illness.
</P>
<P>
	   The teenage interrogators in the "Lie Detector" ad that ran on the cable
network Comedy Central late last week wound up being escorted to the door by a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Healton, the president and chief executive of the foundation, said
Tuesday the foundation's board held a teleconference meeting Monday and voted
without objection to take the ads temporarily out of the rotation. She said
efforts would be made to see if the ads could be reworked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is obvious we pushed a number of buttons and we are going to keep
pushing buttons," Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said "concerns were raised from a variety of sectors" about the two
ads and addressing the controversy was starting to take too much of her time.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, the maker of the top-selling brand Marlboro, had said last
week that it was disappointed with the "Lie Detector" commercial and the Web
site created for the anti-smoking campaign and said it was weighing its options.
</P>
<P>
	   It noted that the settlement agreement creating the anti-smoking campaign
specified that the fund wouldn't be used for personal attacks on an individual
or company, and said Tuesday it was pleased the ads had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS television network refused to run the "Lie Detector" and "Body Bag"
ads because "we feel they crossed the line," CBS spokesman Dana McLintock said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation remains in negotiations with CBS and other networks about
taking its other ads, Healton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, who led the states in the
1998 negotiations with the tobacco industry and chairs the American Legacy
Foundation, said through a spokesman that several attorneys general she did not
name had also raised objections about the two ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a distraction from the goal: to stop 3,000 kids a day from becoming
addicted to tobacco," she said. "It was not worth being distracted by one or two
ads with others in the arsenal."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the attorneys general who objected to the ads was Michael F. Easley
of North Carolina, who was among the state negotiators during the tobacco talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter distributed last week to the attorneys general who signed the
agreement, Easley said "there is little question that they can be fairly viewed
as personally attacking or vilifying the tobacco companies, something that all
of us who sat around the negotiating table in New York agreed we would not do."
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the states that signed the agreement rightly expect the tobacco
companies to live up to the commitments they made to us. If we hope to have this
agreement honored, we must do likewise," he wrote in the letter obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris spokesman Brendan McCormick said the company continues to
consider its options on the Web site, which is at www.thetruth.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco critic Matthew Myers, head of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
said even after the withdrawal of the ads, the Legacy anti-smoking campaign
still "is hard-hitting" and it bears watching whether the foundation will
continue in that direction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully this is a one-time incident in which the tobacco companies
demonstrate that they haven't really changed by threatening the foundation
whenever it produces hard-hitting ads that put the tobacco industry in a bad
light," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of New York Exec Surrenders  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive specially trained in
money laundering detection and her husband surrendered to the FBI Tuesday with
the expectation they would plead guilty to their roles in one of the
largest-ever money-laundering scandals, a source told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The former executive, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter Berlin, were
indicted last year. Investigators allege they were involved in illegally moving
as much as $10 billion from Russia through accounts at the Bank of New York, the
nation's 16th largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair surrendered to authorities shortly after arriving in the United
States from London, said a source familiar with the investigation who would only
speak on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   They were taken into custody in the company of their lawyers, and were
expected in Manhattan federal court Wednesday to plead guilty to charges related
to money laundering, the source said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the laundered money came from Russian
importers trying to avoid paying taxes, though they are still looking into
whether some of the money came from criminal activity and was transferred
through accounts at the Bank of New York in order to mask its origin.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said that Edwards, as head of the bank's Eastern European
operations in London, had easy access to bank accounts to engage in money
laundering, whereby crime proceeds are moved through a series of bank accounts
until they appear to be legitimate profits from legal businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards was dismissed from her job Aug. 18 after her name arose as a target
of an investigation that stretched across the globe. She was accused by the bank
of gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal policies, falsification of
bank records and failure to cooperate with the bank's investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband was targeted by investigators after it was suspected that the
majority of the billions of dollars at stake were moved through a company he
controlled, Benex Worldwide Ltd., and other accounts in his name.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators alleged they found nine accounts at the Bank of New York
connected to Benex or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Berlin and Edwards, together with their partner Aleskey Volkov, were
charged by U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan with conspiring to operate a
wire-transfer business. Volkov remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   All three have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges came in September, just a few months after Edwards made a
presentation on the latest money laundering techniques at a two-day conference
for financial executives in Riga, Latvia. Her speech was entitled "Money
Laundering: Latest Developments and Regulations."
</P>
<P>
	   In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that Edwards and Berlin conspired
from 1996 to last August to illegally transmit funds and receive deposits
without obtaining authorization from any federal or state banking agency.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted of those charges, Edwards would face a maximum prison term of
five years and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gain or loss resulting
from the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the conspiracy charge, Berlin and Volkov face charges of
conducting an illegal money-transferring business and engaging in an illegal
banking operation. If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in prison and a
fine of $175,000 or twice the gain or loss resulting from the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   A message left with the couple's lawyers Tuesday was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan,
declined to comment as did a spokesman for the FBI in New York, which is
conducting the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of New York also declined to comment, though it has acknowledged
previously that it needs to improve its money-handling procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the Bank of New York signed an agreement with the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York and the New York State Banking Department pledging to enhance
its customer screening program and report suspicious activities. It also has to
present a plan describing the steps the bank "will continue to take to
strengthen compliance with regard to anti-money laundering procedures and
suspicious activity reporting."

<HEADLINE> IRA Pulls Out of Disarmament Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army withdrew Tuesday
from disarmament negotiations, dealing a blow to hopes of resurrecting Northern
Ireland's Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
	   In a hard-line statement, the IRA also formally withdrew from the table its
latest hint that it might someday disarm. The outlawed group accused the British
government and the province's major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of
pursuing ``a military victory,'' something that ``cannot and will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   The development underscored the failure of a 3-month-old deal brokered by
American diplomat George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell had persuaded the Ulster Unionists to establish a four-party
coalition alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. In exchange, the IRA was
supposed to begin negotiating the gradual destruction of its hidden weapons
stockpiles, a goal of the province's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Britain suspended the 10-week-old administration's powers Friday
after confirming that the IRA had made no commitments to the disarmament
commission. The commission is charged with securing the IRA's total disarmament
by May in line with the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The British and Irish governments still intend to hold separate talks
Wednesday in London with Northern Ireland's key parties. But the odds against
transferring powers back soon to the Belfast administration look greater than
ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's IRA statement came after an ill-tempered meeting between Sinn Fein
leaders and Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland,
who took the decision to resume direct control of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a bad meeting, quite frankly,'' said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
a reputed former IRA commander. ``And this Sinn Fein leadership has now no
further room to move. We have seen the failure of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adams said he blamed Mandelson for rejecting the IRA's last offering to the
Belfast-based disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, head of the disarmament commission,
reported late Friday -- hours after Mandelson revoked the local Cabinet's powers
-- that the IRA had for the first time said it might put its weapons ``beyond
use'' in the event of unspecified political progress.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tuesday's statement the IRA said it was now ``withdrawing all
propositions'' presented to de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, in response, said the IRA's last offering ``had real potential,
and people will be sad that it could not be worked on and developed in the way
that is needed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's peace process now finds itself tied up in a familiar
knot: The Ulster Unionists won't share power with Sinn Fein unless the IRA
disarms, and the IRA won't budge unless the Ulster Unionists drop that
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major Catholic party, the pacifist Social Democratic and
Labor Party, condemned the IRA statement as a rejection of the Good Friday
accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Seamus Mallon, the SDLP's deputy leader and senior Catholic in the suspended
Cabinet, said the IRA and Sinn Fein seemed bent on treating disarmament as ``a
bargaining chip,'' when it was an established obligation within the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must now clearly establish if in effect the IRA is going to be part of
the new future,'' Mallon said. ``Or are they going to believe that they can
thwart the wishes of the Irish government, the British government, the people of
the island of Ireland, and indeed world opinion?''
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's refusal to disarm has cast a long shadow over peacemaking efforts.
The issue first brought Mitchell into the province in 1995, when he and de
Chastelain recommended that the IRA gradually disarm during negotiations
involving Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the IRA ended its cease-fire and killed two people with a one-ton
truck bomb in London.
</P>
<P>
	   British anti-terrorist chiefs said Tuesday that, despite the growing signs
of anger in Sinn Fein-IRA circles, they didn't expect the IRA to abandon its
current 31-month-old truce soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA statement is obviously not good news,'' said the commander of
Northern Ireland's police force, Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan. ``But we have
no information to suggest that the IRA intends to reengage in acts of violence
contrary to their stated cessation of violence.''

<HEADLINE> Anderson Files Lawsuit Against Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge, holding Iran in default, cleared the way
Tuesday for former hostage Terry Anderson to proceed with a $100 million claim
against Tehran. Anderson testified his Lebanese captors were ``trained by,
funded by and sometimes led by Iran.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Iranian government ``had specific and concrete goals in Lebanon'' in the
1980s and were carrying them out, said Anderson, the longest held hostage and
the former Middle East bureau chief of The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson opened a two-day hearing on
Anderson's suit by declaring Iran in default because it failed to send a
representative despite being notified through diplomatic channels. The defense
table remained empty throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Iran did not contest the case, the proceeding was largely an effort by
Jackson to gather evidence and testimony to use in determining the size of a
judgment for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's case is the latest to come to trial under a 1996 law that allows
Americans who are victims of terrorism in foreign countries to sue in U.S.
courts if the State Department lists those nations as sponsors of terrorism.
Iran has been on the list since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Recounting his nearly seven years in captivity, Anderson said, ``There was a
great possibility we would all end up dead. It was a possibility we faced every
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's wife, Madeleine Bassil, and their daughter, Sulome Anderson, 14,
are also seeking damages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very hard, the waiting. It was agonizing,'' said Bassil, who was
seven months pregnant when Anderson was kidnapped. ``I had no clue what to do.
It was very difficult.'' She described how she had been uprooted with a small
daughter who had never seen her father. She and Anderson were married after his
release.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the 1996 law, the Clinton administration has made it difficult for
winning plaintiffs to collect claims. It has argued that seizing frozen assets
of countries could violate diplomatic custom.
</P>
<P>
	   But efforts are under way in Congress to set up a mechanism for such
collections. Anderson said the administration seemed to show a new willingness
to work with hostage families to help them receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1998, Jackson ordered Iran to pay $65 million in damages to David
Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed, who were held hostage with Anderson,
and to the wives of Cicippio and Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, 52, now teaching journalism at Ohio University, accused Iran of
financing and directing the Hezbollah, or Party of God, kidnappers who held him
captive for 2,454 days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My kidnappers were Lebanese ... But they were trained by, funded by and
sometimes led by Iran'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The paramilitary terrorist and political organization operating in Lebanon
had direct Iranian sponsorship, he said. ``There were Iranian revolutionary
guards in uniform ... training them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson recounted his grueling years as a captive, beginning with being
seized Saturday morning, March 16, 1985, en route to a tennis match.
</P>
<P>
	   The time since his release has also been difficult, he said. For years, he
had problems making decisions, relating to his family, feeling comfortable in
crowds and expressing his emotions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was damaged a great deal more than I was aware of -- than anyone was
aware of,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said he does not bear anger toward his kidnappers nor towards Iran.
``But I've never believed they should get away with it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   While saying some of the other hostage families needed money more than he
did, Anderson told reporters, ``I'm not an angel. I'd love to collect some of
that money.''
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Stuart Newberger, said Jackson's finding that Iran was in
default left the amount of the judgment one of the few remaining issues in the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that Jackson, in previous cases, based the judgments roughly on the
length of captivity, awarding $20 million to Cicippio, $16 million to Reed and
$9 million to Jacobsen. Also, Elham Cicippio and Fifi Delati-Reed were awarded
$10 million each.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson has been visiting members of Congress to lend his support to a
bipartisan effort to strengthen the 1996 law to make it easier for winning
plaintiffs to obtain judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   He also met recently with Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, who
oversees compensation programs. Eizenstat seemed responsive to finding ways
short of the legislation, which the administration opposes, to help the
hostages, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's still a ways to go,'' he said in an interview.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Worried on Heating Oil Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday the federal government is
willing to give more help to families ``that are really getting hurt'' by the
soaring cost of home heating oil in New England and the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the government has released $200 million from the Low Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. ``We can release more,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will travel to Boston on Wednesday to meet
with leaders of industry and consumer groups about fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The rising cost of heating oil has become an issue in the Senate race
between the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and her likely Republican
rival, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The mayor has urged the president to
release oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve to offset oil price
increases that have put the price above $30 for the first time since the eve of
the Persian Gulf War nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   That war marked the only time the reserve was tapped since its establishment
a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have not closed off any options,'' the president said, talking with
reporters in the Cabinet Room during a meeting with high technology officials.
``I'm monitoring this on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, a coalition of Northeastern lawmakers announced plans Tuesday to
push legislation that would create a new 6.7 million-gallon heating oil reserve
that could be tapped to deal with price spikes.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill sponsor, Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., said he based his
legislation, in part, on an Energy Department report suggesting that a home
heating oil reserve would be an effective method of stabilizing home heating oil
prices. Many economists agree that an influx of home heating oil into the market
would drive prices down.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders called a Northeast reserve ``a cost-effective way of making sure
that the government has a mechanism to lower heating oil prices when global
situations cause them to rise.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said important meetings are scheduled among oil-producing countries
within the next few days. ``We will know more about this in a week or 10 days,
about what the trends are going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the American people are handling the price increase pretty well in
terms of every aspect of our lives because of increased energy efficiency,
except for home heating oil,'' he said. He said many people in New England and
Middle Atlantic states ``are still dependent upon a source of heating which the
rest of the country left long ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they are unbelievably burdened by this,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the government's heating oil assistance eases the burden of the
poorest families, ``but there are a lot of working people on modest incomes that
are just getting killed by this, because of their reliance on home heating
oil.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said middle- and lower-income Americans ``have no option to heat their
home but home heating oil. They're the people that are really getting hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 198.25; Nasdaq Up 2.22  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A rally in oil stocks and some bargain-hunting buoyed the
Dow Jones industrials Tuesday. In a major turnaround from recent weeks, the
strength in blue-chips helped pull technology stocks out of a severe slump.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.25 to close at 10,718.09. The
Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled as much as 127 points in earlier trading,
closed up 2.22 at 4,420.77.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were modestly higher, but the gains came on weak
breadth, with the number of declining issues and advancing issues roughly even.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 12.11 to 1,402.05.
</P>
<P>
	   For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated
Nasdaq. Consumer products companies Procter and Gamble and 3M led the blue-chip
index. Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 3 7/8 to 95 3/4, while 3M gained 6 1/4 to 89 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the Dow was poised for a comeback after its 538.59-point drop
last week, which knocked the index 11 percent below its January peak, within
market watchers' traditional definition of a correction. With big gains Monday
and Tuesday, the Dow is now 8.6 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of really good names had been beaten down badly," said Joseph T.
Keating, chief investment officer of the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich. "It
was time for some of those stocks to start attracting cash again."
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow got a lift from a surge in oil-related stocks. Exxon Mobil rose 2
7/8 to 79 5/16 as crude oil futures remained above $30 a barrel. Crude prices
topped $30 a barrel Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf
War in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Texaco rose 1 7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman Brothers analyst
raised his rating on Texaco stock, estimating that shares will reach 65 within
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil services companies like Schlumberger, up 4 1/2 to 65, also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for
oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors on
edge Tuesday, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks were particularly rattled by investors who are worried
that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this year as it
works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates four times
since June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth has slowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have
been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing rapidly -- namely,
technology stocks. But some of those favorites fell Tuesday as investors sold
shares to lock in profits from a big run in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco Systems fell 2 1/2 to 128 and MCI WorldCom slipped 2 1/4 to 47 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward
pressure on rates continue to take their toll on most financial instruments,"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   By late afternoon, however, some massive gains from a handful of technology
stocks powered the index higher. Rambus rose on the expectation that Intel will
use its technology to manufacture high-speed computer chips.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, investors are correct to place their money on the promise of
technology, Keating said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are two kinds of companies you've got to own: the techs and the
companies that can most successfully implement technology to stay ahead of the
pack as interest rates go higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and
consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation
pressures lurking in the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan will testify before the House Banking
Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the NYSE. On
the Nasdaq, five stocks fell for every four that rose.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.31 billion shares, compared with 1.13 billion in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.30 to 540.24.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index fell 3.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 1.0 percent, and France's
CAC-40 fell 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Judge approves $8 million settlement for inmates in 1971 Attica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A judge put his stamp of approval Tuesday on an
offer by New York state to pay $8 million to inmates caught up in the 1971
Attica riot, virtually settling a 25-year-old lawsuit over the nation's
deadliest prison uprising.
<P>
	   The proposed settlement "is determined to be fair, reasonable and in the
best interest ... of all parties concerned and is, therefore, preliminarily
approved," U.S. District Judge Michael Telesca said in a 27-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Final approval will be withheld, he said, until claims have been filed by
all surviving inmates who claimed they were tortured, beaten and denied medical
treatment in the aftermath of the revolt and the bloody efforts by authorities
to put it down.
</P>
<P>
	   State police launched an all-out assault on the maximum-security Attica
Correctional Facility near Buffalo on Sept. 13, 1971, the fifth day of the
uprising. More than 2,000 rounds of ammunition were fired over six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 32 inmates and 11 correction officers died, most of them killed
during the raid. Hundreds more were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to settle, the state admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to pay
the inmates' lawyers $4 million in legal fees and costs. The original
class-action lawsuit in 1974 sought $100 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 1,281 inmates who were in prison yard "D" when police stormed the
prison, hundreds have since died and no more than 500 were expected to file
claims. By year's end, the judge will divide up the money between them - most of
them former inmates in their 50s or older.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the former inmates Ellen Yackman said, "The legal team is
extremely gratified and relieved that the last chapter of this very long and
tedious process of bringing justice to the Attica plaintiffs has now finally
begun."
</P>
<P>
	   With one exception, more than a dozen former inmates spoke in favor of the
deal at a hearing held Monday to give claimants a chance to object to the terms
of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph McKee of Rochester, who testified that he was repeatedly beaten and
had four teeth knocked out, said it was time to "get it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   Attica's lesson could turn out to be that "even though you are in prison, at
least you can be treated like a human being," said one of the revolt's leaders,
Frank Smith, 66.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, a convicted robber who was freed in 1973, was forced to lie on a
table while officers beat and burned him. He was also ordered to hold a football
under his chin and threatened with death if he allowed it to fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the prison was recaptured, inmates were forced to run naked
through a gantlet of law enforcement officers who hit them with clubs and
nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, a federal jury awarded $4 million to Smith and $75,000 to David
Brosig, another inmate who was injured. Telesca was brought into the case in
August when an appeals court reversed those verdicts.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Pushes UN Force in Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke appealed to Congress on
Tuesday to support a new force of peacekeepers for Congo -- a force that would
not include U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is imperative that we fulfill our responsibility to help,'' Holbrooke
told a hearing of the House International Relations subcommittee on Africa.
``The time has come for the U.N. to take the next steps for peace in Congo.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has proposed an initial force of 5,537. It would include
protective troops for a corps of 500 military observers to monitor a cease-fire
agreement signed last summer between the main groups engaged in the conflict,
which has drawn in several African nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress must authorize the money before the United States can vote for the
increased U.N. presence in Central Africa. Holbrooke said he expects a Security
Council vote no earlier than Feb. 23 on a resolution dealing with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   That proposed resolution, which would require Congo's warring sides to
ensure the monitors' safety, represents the first major step in the proposed
deployment of a full-fledged peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda and Uganda are supporting rebels who launched an insurrection in
August 1998 to oust President Laurent Kabila, who is backed by Zimbabwe, Namibia
and Angola.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said the peacekeepers would be allowed to use force to protect
themselves and civilians under immediate threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   He said dispatching the force is part of a three-phase U.N. plan to bring
peace to Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   The first phase included just 90 U.N. military liaison officers in Congo and
other capitals involved in the conflict. The extent of the third phase has yet
to be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No U.S. peacekeeping troops would be on the ground as part of this
operation,'' Holbrooke assured the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United Nations would not taken any enforcement responsibility
and would not forcibly disarm ``nonstate actors'' in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. has an interest in upholding regional stability and in preventing
the resurgence of genocide and mass killing in Central Africa,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the operation involves risks. But if the conflict is allowed to
fester, Holbrooke said, it will be even more difficult to promote stability in
Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   He said instability in Congo also has drawn in ``rogue states'' such as
Libya, Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Sudan, who he said want to use the region for
weapons sales, terrorist bases and access to uranium and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current conflict is the most violent in Africa, with enormous costs to
U.S. political and economic interests,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New York state's highest court hears commuter tax case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki made a
"sham" of the lawmaking process when they rescinded a lucrative New York City
tax to help candidates in a state Senate election, a lawyer for the city argued
Tuesday.
<P>
	   Elizabeth Freedman, an assistant corporation counsel, told the seven-member
state Court of Appeals that state leaders eliminated the city's "commuter" tax
for "frivolous and truly insignificant reasons."
</P>
<P>
	   The members of the state's highest court would be justified in undoing the
tax rescinder, she argued, because of the political motivation behind passage of
the state law. She also contended that technically, the state did not have the
authority to rescind the tax because it had not been formally asked to do so by
the New York City Counsel in a "home rule" message.
</P>
<P>
	   But Freedman's arguments prompted some sharp questioning from Court of
Appeals judges.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Howard Levine told her, "You're suggesting that we're going to test
the credibility of the statements by (legislative) sponsors, statements in
debates? We're going to say they're disingenuous?"
</P>
<P>
	   And Judge Joseph Bellacosa said by using such words as "sham" and
"legitimate," Freedman was asking the court to get into "some heady waters"
where the judges were being asked to interpret not only the legality of what
legislators did, but their motivations for doing so, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, lawyers for New Jersey and Connecticut asked the court to find
it unconstitutional for New York to waive the commuter tax for New York state
residents who live outside the five boroughs, but to charge it to residents of
Connecticut, New Jersey or Pennsylvania who work in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dealing with fundamental, profound, significant principles,"
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. "This is precisely the
kind of levy, indeed, that our constitutional framers sought to prevent.
Disparate treatment. Discriminatory burden. Unfair treatment."
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman also called it unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   "This tax, the way the bill was written, the way it was implemented, is
unconstitutional and imposes an unfair tax burden on the residents of the state
of New Jersey," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's deputy attorney general, Patrick DeAlmeida, called on the Court
of Appeals to order refunds of the commuter tax to out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
	   "The state has hundreds of millions of dollars that it's going to keep from
out-of-state residents, interest free," DeAlmeida said. "It has had it for some
time and there is no justification for the state to have an interest-free loan
on the back of out-of-state residents under a clearly unconstitutional statute."
</P>
<P>
	   The Court of Appeals is expected to issue a written ruling within six weeks.
The judges have promised to handle the case - various earlier legal actions
against the commuter tax were consolidated into one case for reasons of the
appeal - in an expedited fashion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both friends and foes of rescinding the commuter tax agree that its demise
was precipitated by local politics.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a tough special election race to fill a vacant state Senate seat
in New York City's northern suburbs, the Democratic candidate stated that if
elected, he would not vote to extend the commuter tax. Republican candidate
Thomas Morahan - the eventual winner - said he would go one better and work to
repeal the tax altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   To the dismay of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Legislature and
Pataki quickly did away with the tax, even before the special election was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he and the Legislature did the right thing and it's time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the commuter tax is gone," Pataki said Tuesday at an appearance at
a high-tech research center in Albany. "I think it's a good thing that will help
the state's economy and certainly help the city's economy. People will no longer
have a reason to avoid working or having their office located in New York City."
</P>
<P>
	   The case puts Giuliani, who is expected to run for Senate against Hillary
Rodham Clinton this November, in the somewhat uncomfortable position of pursuing
a court case to make hundreds of thousands of commuters - and potential voters
in a Senate election - pay a tax to the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have the advantage and disadvantage of holding a public office that is
one of the most difficult in the country," he said Monday when asked about the
case. "The things that I did as mayor of New York City to protect the people of
New York City I would equally as strongly and equally as well do to protect the
people of the state of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Some 300,000 commuters from surrounding states work in New York City daily.
About 500,000 others come in from New York counties outside the five boroughs.
The city's 0.45 percent income tax totals $450 on an income of $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   A complete repeal could cost the city as much as $360 million a year;
repealing the tax only for New York residents would cost $210 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Looms for Examiner Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several possible buyers for the San Francisco Examiner
emerged Tuesday before a deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which had said it
might close the flagship paper of its media empire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hearst has recieved several indications of interest," the company said in a
brief statement from New York. "We are presently engaged in the process of
reviewing and evaluating proposals and have no official announcement at this
time." A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The staffs of the city's two daily newspapers, the afternoon Examiner and
the morning San Francisco Chronicle, were anxiously awaiting word on Hearst's
efforts to find a buyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst said it would close the Examiner if a buyer wasn't found by the end
of the day and would merge the remnants of the Examiner with the Chronicle,
which Hearst is buying.
</P>
<P>
	   The Examiner, owned by the Hearst family since 1880, has been up for sale
since August with no apparent bidders.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle and its efforts to dissolve
the papers' 1965 Joint Operating Agreement have been held up pending a Justice
Department investigation into complaints that Hearst will have a monopoly in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst sweetened the terms in January to address those concerns, and then
set a deadline for finding a buyer. If no one emerged, it could then claim the
Examiner is a failing enterprise, merge the dailies and dissolve the agreement,
which guarantees each paper 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst offered little information about the search for a buyer. By midday,
even Examiner Publisher Tim White complained of being stonewalled.
</P>
<P>
	   It is "very frustrating," White told KTVU-TV. "I'm bugging them but I'm
getting nothing. ... We're very frustrated not knowing about our future."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar tensions were being felt by the staffs of both papers, said Doug
Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California Media Workers Guild.
There are 377 guild members at the Chronicle, 203 at the Examiner and 543 at the
agency that runs both papers' business operations. In all, the papers have 2,600
employees, 580 of them in editorial jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers share business operations but maintain separate newsroom staffs.
The Examiner's weekday circulation is about 107,000, the Chronicle's, 457,000.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall in Light Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mostly lower in light trading Tuesday as
investors cashed in on gains made during the two previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said investors took some profits but essentially traded cautiously
in advance of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony,
scheduled Thursday before the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell  1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, rose
to 6.24 percent from 6.22 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Greenspan's upcoming testimony, bond traders were also
keeping a cautious eye on surging oil prices, which added to inflation worries.
Crude oil climbed above $30 a barrel on Monday for the first time since the eve
of the Persian Gulf War and remained about $30 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to down 1/16 point
Tuesday, while intermediate maturities fell  1/8 point or were unchanged,
according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Tuesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.73
percent, with the discount rising 0.06 percentage point from Monday's auction to
5.57 percent. Six-month yields were 6.00 percent as the discount fell 0.02
percent from the weekly auction to 5.74 percent. One-year yields finished
unchanged at 6.16 percent, with the discount holding at Monday's late rate of
5.81 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, rose
to 5.88 percent from 5.81 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds rose 1/16 point to 92 5/32. The
yield was unchanged at 6.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain Aviation Deal Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By ClAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater pledged Tuesday
to continue pushing the British government to allow more flights to Britain by
U.S. carriers but did not endorse retaliatory actions suggested by some
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., and the
committee's ranking Democrat, James Oberstar of Minnesota, suggested Slater
consider such steps as withdrawing landing rights for the Concorde and revoking
``slots'' allotted to British carriers at U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
	   Slater said such steps ``were under consideration'' by the administration
but he gave no indication that any action was imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   Slater told the panel's aviation subcommittee that improving access for U.S.
carriers is a priority, but when asked if he was willing to predict when that
would occur he replied, ``I don't really know.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1977 Bermuda II treaty, U.S. and British carriers each are limited
to 21 daily flights between the countries. Negotiations to expand the treaty
broke down last month.
</P>
<P>
	   USAirways is among the U.S. carriers pushing for expansion of the treaty. It
wants to pick up a Pittsburgh-to-London flight that was discontinued by British
Airways last year because planes were only half-full.
</P>
<P>
	   USAirways Chairman Stephen Wolfe told the subcommittee that the existing
agreement allows the British government and British Airways to ``veto innovative
pricing and, most importantly, to restrict access to London.''
</P>
<P>
	   In written testimony, the British government said it ``habitually honors its
obligations under Bermuda II, and makes concessions beyond it. We are naturally
disappointed when our closest ally does otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
	   It further accused the United States of backing policies that block access
to American markets. One such rule requires government personnel, contractors
and mail to only use American carriers. Britain has no such rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Frederick W. Smith, chairman of FedEx parent FDX Corp., said British and
American negotiators have not paid enough attention to improving the rules for
transporting cargo between the nations.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the panel the failure to reach an agreement ``represents the most
flagrant betrayal of businesses in both the U.S. and UK and the communities they
serve.''

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Award Cardinal Medal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to award an ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor the Congressional Gold Medal, the body's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
	   The longtime leader of the New York Archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman
Catholics recently turned 80 and had surgery last fall to remove a brain tumor.
He is expected to retire as soon as Pope John Paul II appoints a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The House voted 413-1 to give the award to O'Connor. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
was the lone opponent. Paul said he has great respect for the cardinal but
opposed the $30,000 it would cost to mint the medal.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the House voted 410-1 to give a Congressional Gold Medal to
``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz, who died in his sleep Saturday. The
77-year-old cartoonist's last strip featuring Snoopy and the gang was published
in Sunday's papers. Paul also cast the only dissenting vote for the Schulz
medal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate is expected to approve both honors next month.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters that O'Connor was
being ``justifiably honored'' and insisted the award was not an attempt to
appease Catholics upset by a flap over the appointment of a new House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   House GOP leaders nominated the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, for the $138,000-a-year position even though the Rev. Timothy O'Brien,
a Catholic priest, was the top choice of a bipartisan committee of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Democrats have accused GOP leaders of being anti-Catholic, a charge
they deny. A vote on the nomination is pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Tuesday's vote, lawmakers extolled O'Connor's work on behalf of the
needy, inner-city children, AIDS patients and others. They also spoke of his
leadership in establishing diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Israel and
his years of service as a military chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Cardinal O'Connor is a great man,'' said Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y.,
who nominated O'Connor for the medal. ``Soldiers, priests and parishioners know
in their hearts that the cardinal has always been a man of the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, O'Connor, the oldest active bishop in the United States
and a close ally of the pope, has drawn criticism over the years for denouncing
homosexuality, premarital sex and birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has had many critics,'' acknowledged Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``But
from the beginning of life to the very cessation of life, Cardinal O'Connor was
consistent in his belief that all deserved justice under the law and as much
human love as mankind was capable of.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor served as a chaplain in the Navy and Marines for 27 years and saw
combat in Korea. He was named bishop in Scranton, Pa., in 1983 and has led the
Archdiocese of New York since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor offered his resignation on his 75th birthday, as the church
requires, but the pope did not accept it. Cardinals lose their power to vote for
a new pope when they turn 80.
</P>
<P>
	   After an absence last year due to surgery and radiation treatments, O'Connor
is back celebrating Sunday Mass at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. His frail
condition has made it hard for him to stand and he delivers the homily from a
chair.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Thomson Corp. is selling its U.S. newspapers business,
made up mainly of 49 local and regional dailies, in order to concentrate on the
professional information services that make up the vast majority of the Canadian
company's operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson is keeping its flagship newspaper The Globe and Mail. Published out
of Thomson's home base of Toronto, it serves as a major national daily for
Canada, going up against the year-old newspaper launched by Conrad Black, The
National Post.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest divestiture for Thomson, following the sale of a British
travel business in 1998 and an oil and gas business in 1989. Thomson has also
sold several of its smaller newspapers over the past few years as part of an
effort to increase the consolidation of papers in regional clusters.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors welcomed the announcement, pushing Thomson's shares up 12.5
percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The dailies being sold are small; most have circulations of less than
50,000. Thomson is also putting up for sale five dailies in Canada and more than
75 nondaily newspapers, most of which are based in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Altogether the newspapers being sold account for less than 15 percent of the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Harrington, president and CEO of Thomson, said the company reached the
decision to put the papers up for sale after deciding to concentrate on business
and professional information services that could be delivered electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   "After we sold the travel business in 1998, we were really an information
company that had an interest in newspapers," Harrington said in an interview.
"Now we're going after the business-to-business and business professional market
that's global in scope and electronic in nature."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson's main business is selling specialized legal, professional and
educational materials, about half of which is delivered electronically. It has a
major legal and regulatory research arm, West Group, and a large business
providing scientific and health care research to academics and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   Increasingly, Thomson has focused on products that can be delivered
electronically instead of in print, such as textbooks.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson also operates a financial information service that includes First
Call, a service widely used by Wall Street analysts to disseminate research
about companies to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Garner, president of Thomson Newspapers, said several parties had
already expressed interest on Tuesday after the announcement was made. Lee
Westerfield, a publishing analyst at PaineWebber, said he expected the
newspapers could fetch a price of about 10 times cash flow, which would be more
than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Garner said the company hoped to complete the sale in as few transactions as
possible, adding that the company was not inclined to break up the geographic
concentrations around which the newspapers had been grouped.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. newspapers have been grouped into 21 regional clusters, the largest
being in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana. The titles being sold include the
Connecticut Post, The Tribune of Mesa, Arizona and The Post-Crescent, Appleton,
Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Clinton E-Mail Said Never Produced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former White House computer analyst alleged Tuesday that
the Clinton administration failed to produce thousands of e-mails related to
Monica Lewinksy, campaign finance and other issues that were the subjects of
federal probes.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the allegation, President Clinton said he was unaware of any
effort to withhold electronic messages and White House officials insisted that
every effort was made to comply with subpoenas from Congress, independent
counsels and the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that we have complied with every request,'' Clinton said before
a meeting with computer industry leaders in the Cabinet Room. ``I think that we
are in full compliance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheryl Hall, who served as chief of White House computer operations until
she accused administration officials of using an official database for political
purposes, alleged a computer glitch that resulted in some 100,000 not being
properly archived was discovered in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A keyword search of computer tapes of those messages turned up 4,000
references to Lewinksy, Hall said, as well as references to other issues under
investigation. But after contractors pointed out the error to White House
officials it wasn't corrected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it was intentionally not corrected,'' Hall said. ``They have
made no effort to start the reconstruction of those e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hall's allegations were first reported by The Washington Times. She has sued
the administration over her demotion, and now works at the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Hall said the contractors were warned against discussing the
e-mails by White House officials who said they contained classified material.
Hall said all sensitive systems were actually managed by the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing that we deal with is classified,'' she said in a telephone
interview from the offices of Judicial Watch, a group that has filed several
lawsuits against the Clinton adminstration.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said the allegations first arose two years
ago, adding that ``we've always made a good faith effort to respond to requests
for information. There are no outstanding disputes with anyone about such
requests.''
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky resulted in the
House voting to impeach the president in the winter of 1998. Clinton was
acquitted by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Seeks 'Big Dig' Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By CAREN BENJAMIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House subcommittee demanded an
investigation Tuesday into whether officials overseeing Boston's massive ``Big
Dig'' highway project withheld information about cost overruns to ensure federal
funding would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., head of the House Appropriations transportation
panel, also wants an independent audit of Big Dig finances and suggested
subpoenas may be necessary to ensure everything comes out.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said it was unacceptable that project
officials were not more forthcoming about costs but told Wolf's panel he must
complete a review of a report released Monday by the inspector general before
deciding whether to take action.
</P>
<P>
	   In his report, Kenneth Mead documented cost construction overruns of at
least $942 million and chastised state and federal transportation officials for
``an alarming lapse in oversight.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three-mile Big Dig project, officially called the Central Artery-Third
Harbor Tunnel, goes through downtown Boston. It was started in 1993 and was
supposed to be finished next year, but delays have pushed back the completion
date to perhaps as late as 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Three months ago, the Federal Highway Administration and Big Dig officials
objected to a draft version of the inspector general's report, claiming the cost
estimates were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   But last week, Big Dig officials revealed the project would cost about $1.4
billion more than previously estimated. That admission came only hours after the
FHA, charged with overseeing the project, had signed off on the Big Dig's yearly
finance plan. It did not mention the overruns, which by some estimates would put
the project's cost at more than $13.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolf, a longtime critic of the project, said protestations about the draft
report look like ``deliberate deceit.'' He asked whether there might be a
``civil or criminal penalty for not telling the truth'' in this situation.
</P>
<P>
	   He said neither Big Dig officials nor the FHA could be trusted to provide
information about costs and that an independent agency with subpoena power
should conduct an audit.
</P>
<P>
	   Big Dig spokesman Jeremy Crockford denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been working very closely with Federal Highway since the
beginning. We reject any notion that we left them in the dark about the
project,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Military Health Care Plan Offered  </HEADLINE>
   By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats on Tuesday proposed a health care plan
for military personnel and their families that would eliminate co-payments in
the government's insurance program for active-duty personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We made a promise to take care of these career men and women and their
families,'' said Missouri Rep. Ike Skelton, the senior Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee. ``We must keep that promise.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors said the plan would cost at least $910 million, far less than a
broader Republican measure offered last week and estimated to cost between $8
billion and $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Military health care improvements appear to be on the same path in 2000 as
the military pay raise and benefits package that became law in 1999. In
testimony before Congress last week, Defense Secretary William Cohen called
health care ``perhaps the single most important issue we can address this year
and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 health care proposals are before Congress, committee staff said,
and hearings are planned in the spring. The GOP plan already has more than 260
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   A key provision of the bill sponsored by Skelton and fellow Democrats Neil
Abercrombie of Hawaii and Gene Taylor of Mississippi would allow
Medicare-eligible military retirees over 65 to choose either a military hospital
or a Medicare provider in their communities.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1956, military retirees only have had a choice between free care at a
military facility or enrolling in an insurance plan, which for most meant the
government's Tricare program.
</P>
<P>
	   After 65, all retirees are switched to Medicare, which only pays a
reimbursement rate of about 75 percent, making it difficult to find providers
and forcing many veterans to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats' measure would extend for one year a demonstration project
allowing retirees to voluntarily sign up for the same health care program as
federal civilian retirees -- the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP proposal would eliminate the demonstration project and open the
civil service plan to any military retiree. For 20-year retirees who entered
military service before June 7, 1956, the government would pay 100 percent of
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats' plan would provide all retirees and family members with
access to the national mail-order pharmacy program and retail pharmacy, which
eliminates the requirement that retirees over 65 use a base pharmacy to fill
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure also would shave Tricare's out-of-pocket costs for catastrophic
care from $7,500 to $3,000 annually. Service members and their families also
would be reimbursed for travel costs when they are referred to specialists in
faraway places.

<HEADLINE> Dad Asks Reno for Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP ) -- Increasingly frustrated by his son's extended stay in the
United States, Elian Gonzalez's father has sent Attorney General Janet Reno a
letter demanding the boy be returned to him right away.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez's second letter to Reno in as many weeks was published
in Cuba on Tuesday. In the letter, Gonzalez says he does not recognize the
jurisdiction of the U.S. court system, which is weighing an attempt by
6-year-old Elian's Miami relatives to block his return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I formally object to the legal moves made or being made by those who are
arbitrarily retaining Elian,'' Gonzalez said in the letter, dated Monday and
published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman said the letter
was received Monday night through the State Department. ``We're reviewing it,''
Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the focus of an international custody battle since he was
rescued from an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. The boy's mother
and 10 other people died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is
fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States. Cuban exiles in Miami
say the boy's mother died to give him freedom in the United States and the Cuban
government maintains Elian is being improperly kept from his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the relatives in Miami filed a brief in federal court on Monday
arguing the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot return Elian to Cuba
without holding a political asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government lawyers have moved to dismiss the Miami relatives' suit,
arguing that they have no legal standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled last
month that only Elian's father has the right to speak for the boy in immigration
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first letter earlier this month, Gonzalez pressed Reno to return the
boy to him. He said that in the meantime, his son should be placed with Manolo
Gonzalez, another great-uncle in Miami. Manolo has said he supports the child's
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' the father wrote in his first letter. ``Elian has been
under constant harassment and pressure from politicians, journalists, lawyers,
publicity agents and others unrelated to his family.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Sequoia Protection  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is considering setting aside as much as
400,000 acres of forests in California as a federal monument to permanently
protect remaining groves of the state's giant sequoia trees, administration
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton asked Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman to explore whether the
trees ought to be protected under the 1906 Antiquities Act, as he did a month
ago to ensure permanent protection over a vast stretch of land adjacent to the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ensure that these majestic cathedral groves ... are protected
for future generations to study and enjoy,'' Clinton wrote the agriculture
secretary, whose department includes the U.S. Forest Service. He said he wanted
a recommendation within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists for years have campaigned to impose greater protection of
the giant sequoia trees -- about 70 groves in all -- that are located in Kings
Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite national parks and nearby Sequoia National Forest
in central California.
</P>
<P>
	   While about a third of the groves are protected within the national park
systems, the rest are in the national forest and they could be endangered by
future logging or other development. Environmentalists fear that while the trees
themselves might not be cut, nearby logging could threaten their long-term
existence.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's action ``is a recognition that there is a major gap in the
protection of this very, very important and majestic species. That gap needs to
be filled,'' George Frampton, the chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton said a monument designation would protect 70 remaining groves of
the giant redwoods, including about 35 groves that are not guaranteed future
protection because they are in the federal forest. At least one grove is in
private hands and land would have to be purchased, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton said the intent would be to protect 330,000 to 440,000 acres of
land, or about a third of the Sequoia National Forest, to ensure permanent
protection of the giant trees.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal to create a Giant Sequoia National Monument brought immediate
applause from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Creation of (such a monument) would be a world class gift to the American
people,'' said Nathaniel Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. ''...This swath of sequoia country should have been permanently
protected long ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has used the Antiquities Act on several occasions to carve out major
areas of land for special protection, each time meeting strong criticism from
some western lawmakers and state officials. White House officials have
acknowledged that the actions are part of an attempt by the president to leave
an environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Clinton used the backdrop of the Grand Canyon to announce the
designation of a million acres of cliffs, desert and scenic areas adjacent to
the Grand Canyon as the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. He also
extended monument protection to 71,000 acres of American Indian ruins north of
Phoenix and to hundreds small islands up and down the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Clinton used the 1906 law to set aside for increased
protection 1.9 million acres in southern Utah, creating the Grand
Staircase-Escalante federal monument. The action brought loud protests from Utah
officials, who called it a federal ``land grab.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the monument designation, the land would have increased protection
against development such as mining or logging, although some activities
including cattle grazing might still be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Farnsworth Is Oldest Actor Nominee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Richard Farnsworth can't say he's always wanted an
Oscar: Hollywood's highest honor hadn't even been invented when he was born.
</P>
<P>
	   But the 79-year-old former stuntman has a place for the statuette if his
name is called during the 72nd Annual Academy Awards on March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Farnsworth was nominated Tuesday for "The Straight Story," making him the
oldest leading actor to receive an Oscar bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry Fonda was the oldest leading actor when he was nominated at 76 for his
role in "On Golden Pond." "Titanic" star Gloria Stuart was the oldest performer
ever nominated when she was nominated for supporting actress at 87.
</P>
<P>
	   Farnsworth was nominated just once before, for 1978's "Comes a Horseman."
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," Farnsworth said in an interview from his longhorn cattle
ranch in Lincoln, N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles native was a stuntman for more than 30 years. He then moved
into acting, appearing in such movies as "The Grey Fox," "The Natural," "Tom
Horn," "Resurrection," "Rhinestone Cowboy" and "Anne of Green Gables."
</P>
<P>
	   The actor lives in a small town he calls "Billy the Kid country." He got up
at 4 a.m. and brewed coffee to watch the Oscar nominations announcement on
television.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to see it," Farnsworth said, and when they called his name, "I let
out a war whoop, naturally. I was sweating it out."
</P>
<P>
	   He planned a simple celebration.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll go out for a taco and a martini -- with an onion," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Official Poised for IMF Post  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL GEITNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser, the likely
next chief of the International Monetary Fund, is known as a consensus-builder
who speaks six languages and has worked both in developing countries and the
industrialized West.
</P>
<P>
	   European Union finance ministers look set to propose Koch-Weser as the EU's
candidate to succeed France's Michel Camdessus, who retired Monday after 13
years in the post. A consensus was reached after France, which has had the post
for 30 years and had been the main stumbling block, agreed to support the German
candidate, EU presidency spokesman Manuel Meneses said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were reports Tuesday that Britain was still wavering, but it has not
proposed an alternative candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The finance ministers will make a formal decision at their Feb. 28 meeting
in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had been lobbying hard for Koch-Weser,
who spent 26 years at the World Bank before joining the Social Democratic-led
government less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser, 55, was born in Brazil, where he grew up on his grandfather's
coffee plantation in the southern state of Parana. His grandfather, a leading
liberal politician in the Weimar Republic, fled Germany with his family in 1933
after the Nazis seized power.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser studied in Germany and Brazil, earning a master's degree in
economics. He joined the World Bank in 1973 and rose quickly, serving as
personal assistant to then-president Robert McNamara from 1977-1980, then as
division chief for China, director of the West African department and vice
president for the Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, he was named the bank's managing director for operations, with
responsibility for the bank's restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters view Koch-Weser as an evenhanded representative for the
developing countries that receive help from the international fund, as well as
for the rich Western nations that are its largest contributors. He speaks
German, Portuguese, English, Chinese, Spanish and French.
</P>
<P>
	   Former colleagues say Koch-Weser's biggest strength is consensus-building.
</P>
<P>
	   But skeptics, especially in France and the United States, have been cool on
Koch-Weser for lacking political clout and hands-on experience running a central
bank or finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
	   Such qualities could be vital as pressure mounts -- particularly in the U.S.
Congress -- for the IMF to restructure itself in the wake of the Russian and
Asian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
	   There was some speculation that U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
wanted to see his friend Stanley Fischer, the deputy IMF director, take over.
Japan, the IMF's second-biggest donor, also had been promoting its own
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   But either nomination would have violated the unwritten rule that reserves
the top IMF spot for a European and the top World Bank job for an American.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin seemed to suggest Tuesday that
Koch-Weser lacked sufficient clout to head the IMF, given his long background at
the development-oriented World Bank and had little experience in international
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is important to identify a leader of considerable experience and
judgment, with credibility in the markets," Rubin said in response to reports
that the Europeans had agreed on Koch-Weser.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been reports that some Latin American nations are opposed to
Koch- Weser.
</P>
<P>
	   As the largest shareholder in the IMF, the United States could line up
developing nations opposed to Koch-Weser and block his appointment. But the
Americans would have to weigh that choice against infuriating the Europeans by
not accepting their candidate.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters' endorsement unofficial - but welcomed by Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - It was a sudden show of support, a standing
ovation followed by an impromptu endorsement from the floor packed with
Teamsters representing locals from South Carolina to Maine.
<P>
	   The backing was unofficial for Bill Bradley, who has walked picket lines in
his campaign for union support. The national Teamsters organization remains
neutral in the Democratic presidential race, and front-runner Al Gore carries
most Big Labor support, including an AFL-CIO endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   But searching for a crack in Gore's wall of labor backing, Bradley basked in
the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent much of Tuesday in Brooklyn, N.Y., where he met with Jewish
students and leaders, talked health care with doctors and ate cheesecake at
Junior's, a famed downtown diner.
</P>
<P>
	   But the big moment came first thing in the morning, after he addressed about
400 union leaders attending the 13-state Eastern regional meeting of the
Teamsters at a casino hotel here.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that the AFL-CIO has endorsed Al Gore," Bradley told the delegates.
"But that doesn't decrease my commitment to working people in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   "My position on labor law reform, my position on health care, my position on
the minimum wage, my position on all of these issues is not related to whether I
got an endorsement or not from the leadership of the AFL-CIO. It's related to my
commitment to what a just society should be and to the working people of the
country."
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley shook hands and prepared to leave, Teamsters vice president
Thomas O'Donnell entertained a motion to endorse the former New Jersey senator.
It passed by acclamation, although many in the audience were talking or crowding
around Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did not know it was coming, and I think it's pretty significant," said
Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chip Roth, a spokesman for the Teamsters attending the conference, said
the "spontaneous expression of support" carried no official weight.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's pretty obvious that this entire body would like to endorse Bill
Bradley," O'Donnell declared, promising to communicate the group's support to
his fellow national leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth agreed that the group's sentiments would be expressed to national
headquarters, but he added that the union was still studying Gore and
Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan, an outspoken critic of free-trade
deals that Gore and Bradley both support, is another option. "He's the best of
the candidates on trade," Roth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls indicate that Gore's strong support from organized labor has
played a role in his success in the primaries to date.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Gore and Bradley split the votes of non-union families,
while Gore got almost two-thirds from those with a union member. In Iowa and
Delaware, Gore got two-thirds of the vote from voters in union households.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to win labor support, Bradley has rallied with strikers,
pledged to ease rules on picketing and touted his own days as a shop steward for
the professional basketball players' union. Gore also has visited picketers.
</P>
<P>
	   He is hoping to keep the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers - which
together represent 2 million of the 13 million AFL-CIO members - from signing on
to Gore's endorsement issued by the overall union in October.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is actively helping Gore, but its leaders admit the unions would
be better off with a united front.
</P>
<P>
	   "Really, in some ways, we're hamstrung by not having every union on board,"
AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told the conference of growing up in Crystal City, Mo., around
neighbors who had good wages and benefits because the local glass factory was
unionized. His uncle, by contrast, worked in a lead factory without a union and,
after decades of work, ended up with a pension of $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   For nine of his 10 years in professional basketball, Bradley was shop
steward on the New York Knicks. He recalled that the union made a deal with a
basketball card manufacturer but owners responded by saying the team names could
not appear on the cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said OK, everybody on the team, turn your shirt around," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the speech, an audience member showed him a souvenir - a 1971
basketball card of Bradley, his shirt on backwards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm the only presidential candidate, the only presidential candidate, who
has a union pension," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He held his hand at a 45-degree angle while saying the playing field is
slanted against union organizing. He proposed increasing the damages to be paid
by companies found to have fired an employee illegally for organizing a union.
And he said firms that break labor laws should not get contracts from the
federal government.

<HEADLINE> Flake's Support of Gore Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Floyd Flake's support of Democratic presidential
front-runner Al Gore is being criticized by a religious watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans United for Separation of Church and State has filed a complaint
with the Internal Revenue Service charging Flake, a former Democratic
congressman, with knowingly violating tax laws by backing Gore from the pulpit
of his Queens church on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never know who's
out there watching the types of laws that govern separation of church and
state,'' Flake said at his Allen A.M.E. Church. ``But I will say to you this
morning, and you read it well: This should be the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore appeared surprised by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   IRS laws prohibit churches and other not-for-profit organizations from
endorsing or opposing candidates for public office.
</P>
<P>
	   Flake called the complaint ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never endorsed Gore. I said I couldn't,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barry Lynn, executive director of the watchdog group, said Flake
``seemed fully aware that his actions were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a flagrant violation of the law cannot be ignored,'' Lynn said in a
letter Monday to IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS did not return a phone call Tuesday seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Employees Sickened by Food  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- About 100 employees of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep auto
dealerships nationwide have reported suffering from food poisoning, possibly
from boxed banquet meals shipped to them by parent company DaimlerChrysler AG.
</P>
<P>
	   DaimlerChrysler has periodically sent out the meals over the past two years
to congratulate dealerships that rated well in sales performance.
</P>
<P>
	   The company stopped all shipments and started contacting dealers after the
first illnesses were reported Thursday, said DaimlerChrysler spokeswoman Kathryn
Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
	   The meals were made only for DaimlerChrysler, said Dan Kurz, spokesman for
HoneyBaked Foods Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The packages included ham and/or turkey
with side dishes of pasta, cheese, bread and mustard and were packed in ice and
shipped by next-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackwell said about 100 employees at about 30 dealerships in 17 states had
reported being sick with a ''24-hour, bad food-type reaction.'' Two people spent
a night in hospitals with the illness, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said it was not known what illness the employees had contracted, nor was
it clear what if any food in the package might have been the source.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're testing all the products,'' Kurz said. ``Obviously, HoneyBaked Foods
is very concerned about the health and safety of our customers.''

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmates Prefer Injection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Not one of Florida's death row inmates has chosen
the electric chair over injection since the state changed its primary method of
execution last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The electric chair, previously the state's sole execution tool, had seen a
decade marked by flames shooting from the apparatus in two executions and blood
flowing from a man's face in a third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature changed the primary method to injection -- saving
electrocution as an option -- after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case
challenging its use of the chair. After the state law was changed, the court
backed out of deciding whether the chair was cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   About two-thirds of the 366 inmates on death row had until Monday to inform
the Florida State Prison warden if they wanted to go to the electric chair
rather than be injected with a fatal combination of drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   None did, said C.J. Drake, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining third still have their first appeal pending before the Florida
Supreme Court. If their sentences are upheld, they will have 30 days to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates' lawyers have challenged the constitutionality of the law.

<HEADLINE> Grim Aftermath of Georgia Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- The four Lewis children should have been in school
Tuesday. Instead, they spent the sunny day sifting through rubble, salvaging any
belongings that weren't obliterated by the deadliest tornadoes in Georgia in
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Their mobile home was reduced to a pile of smashed wallboard, torn
insulation and muddied clothing. Little was recognizable other than a blue and
orange sofa that sat undamaged on top of the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kind of liked my bunk beds and my stereo. And my house,'' 11-year-old
Marice said. ``I'm gonna help my mom and dad clean up some.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes struck southwest Georgia early Monday as people slept. The
death toll has been put as high as 22, according to reports from emergency and
hospital officials and relatives, while the state put the number at 19. In
Mitchell County, the hardest hit, authorities said some people were still
missing. Throughout the area, more than 100 were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the state's worst toll from twisters since 1936, when 203 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton declared disaster areas in four counties -- Colquitt,
Grady, Mitchell, and Tift -- making federal funding available to help people and
business owners recover from the storms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Information Institute estimated that the total damage of the
Georgia storms was $25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal aid won't help Mary Thomas retrieve the keepsakes lost when her
trailer was destroyed. She spent the morning trying in vain to find her
treasured collection of 20 ceramic angel figurines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's everything,'' she said. ``We might be able to get some clothes, some
shoes -- very little. I had some old pictures of myself, some of my dad, and I
lost all that.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Lewis family, which escaped injury despite the violent destruction of
their home, was able to save some damaged toys.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamonica, 9, pointed wistfully to pink doll boxes peeking through collapsed
rafters. Her father, Eugene Lewis, rescued a Nintendo game system and the
children's bikes were sprawled in the mud.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was thankful as he surveyed the destroyed furniture. Many of their
neighbors died or were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are chairs -- I can replace stuff like this,'' he said. ``I can't
replace one of my loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing is that we've got our lives,'' said Lewis'
brother-in-law, 28-year-old Keith Broadway. ``I had the house insured, so I know
I can get a place to stay.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Broadways and their three young children took refuge in a closet as the
storm approached. They were buried under wallboard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The house fell in and we went to screaming and asking God to save us,''
said Broadway's wife, Shanetta, who de-bones chickens at a nearby processing
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearing their cries, Mrs. Broadway's father next door, rushed over and freed
them.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Mrs. Broadway and her sister, Geneva, pulled clothing from the
debris, carefully folding each piece and placing them in plastic bags. The
family's aquarium still sat in the living room, but debris filled the now-murky
water and the fish were dead.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eyes Change in Pullout Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will consider making minor changes in an overdue
troop withdrawal from the West Bank, officials said Tuesday, but rejected
handing over suburbs of Jerusalem to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down earlier this month
after Prime Minister Ehud Barak refused to budge on the terms of a 6.1 percent
West Bank troop withdrawal that was to have taken place by Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Stressing that the maps showing the territory of the withdrawal had not been
finalized yet, Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said there was room for some
changes, although he would not specify what they would be.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to wanting the Jerusalem suburbs, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was seeking a contiguous block of land in the West Bank -- a crucial
underpinning for statehood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will see if these modifications are needed and don't endanger our
security interests (then) we will be willing to consider them,'' Baltiansky
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear when talks would resume. Israel radio quoted the chief
Israeli negotiator, Oded Eran, as saying talks between the sides would resume
next week. According to the report, which could not be immediately confirmed,
the resumption of negotiations would coincide with the visit of U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want the interim withdrawal to include populous Arab
suburbs of Jerusalem. The Israelis refuse, saying that such a handover should be
part of a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians are concerned that the Israelis will offer the suburbs instead
of Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, a city both sides claim as their capital.

<HEADLINE> Ex-S.F. Mayor Makes Examiner Offer  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several possible buyers for the San Francisco Examiner
emerged Tuesday before a deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which had said it
might close the flagship paper of its media empire.
</P>
<P>
	   One offer came from former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly, who had sued in
federal court to block Hearst's plans to sell or close the afternoon Examiner
and buy its morning rival, the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly, a millionaire political consultant who spent more than $3.5 million
trying to unseat Mayor Willie Brown last year, was invited to buy the Examiner,
said his lawyer, Joseph Alioto.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's an unusual guy and he's willing to do this and put up his money to do
it," Alioto said. Alioto would not disclose how much Reilly offered.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst said only that it had "received several indications of interest" that
it was evaluating. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The staffs of the city's two daily newspapers, the afternoon Examiner and
the morning Chronicle, were anxiously awaiting word on Hearst's efforts to find
a buyer. The papers have 2,600 employees, 580 of them in editorial jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Examiner, owned by the Hearst family since 1880, had been up for sale
since August with no apparent bidders. Hearst said it would close the Examiner
if a buyer wasn't found by the end of the day and would merge the remnants of
the Examiner with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle and its efforts to dissolve
the papers' 1965 Joint Operating Agreement have been held up pending a Justice
Department investigation into complaints that Hearst will have a monopoly in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst sweetened the terms in January to address those concerns, and then
set the deadline for finding a buyer. If no one emerged, it could then claim the
Examiner is a failing enterprise, merge the dailies and dissolve the agreement,
which guarantees each paper 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers share business operations but maintain separate newsroom staffs.
The Examiner's weekday circulation is about 107,000, the Chronicle's, 457,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly has had legal tangles with the Examiner before. In 1993, he sued
Executive Editor Phil Bronstein and the Hearst Corp. after his ankle was broken
in a confrontation with Bronstein. Reilly accused Bronstein of pushing him
during a meeting on the paper's coverage of Reilly.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was settled out of court.

<HEADLINE> Burlington County school district to ban cell phones in class  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MEDFORD, N.J. (AP) - Will Lawrence wasn't happy to hear an announcement
in homeroom last week that students could no longer carry cellular phones during
the school day.
<P>
	   Under proposed rule changes in the Lenape Regional High School District,
students would have to leave cell phones in their lockers during classes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's horrible," said Lawrence, a junior at Lenape High School in Medford.
"If there's an emergency I have to run back to my locker."
</P>
<P>
	   He wants to be able to call his mother and have her come and get him in case
there is another bomb scare in the district, he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Danielle Brining, a special education teacher at Lenape High School, said
after a bomb scare at nearby Shawnee High School last spring, not long after the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., many students asked their parents for cell
phones. And many got them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kids felt they had the right to have them," Brining said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey law has prohibited students from carrying beepers onto school
property since the 1980s, when the paging devices were primarily associated with
drug dealers. Exceptions are made for volunteer firefighters and paramedics and
students with certain medical conditions. There is no state regulation for the
use of cell phones in school, leaving each district to create its own policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lenape Regional High School District's board of education is expected to
adopt the cell phone ban on Wednesday. The district includes about 6,000
students at Lenape, Shawnee and Cherokee high schools in Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Milich, a spokeswoman for the district, said the board drafted the
policy as a "commonsense approach" to a new technology. It generated no response
from parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing in the parking lot of Lenape High School on Monday, students
acknowledged that some use their phones during class.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's mostly the girls," said Ryan Scott, a 17-year-old junior. He keeps his
cell phone in his car. "You don't need a cell phone in school. There are pay
phones."
</P>
<P>
	   Some other New Jersey schools already ban cell phone use during class.
</P>
<P>
	   Several educators said they have not received any complaints from parents -
and few squawks from students - about their bans.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Nagy, principal of Allentown High School, said his school
initiated the ban two years ago because students were using them in class.
</P>
<P>
	   "They went off at inappropriate times. They were not part of the educational
environment we were trying to uphold here," Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Parents understand this is school," said Henry Kiernan, superintendent of
West Morris Regional High School District. "The students must be focused on
their studies, not receiving a phone call during class."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's bad enough when one goes off in a movie theater, said John Kazmark,
principal of Princeton High School. "You can't have that in the classroom."

<HEADLINE> Gore on Tape at Fund-Raiser Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore became the featured player via
videotape at a criminal trial Tuesday as Democratic Party fund-raising figure
John Huang testified of walking into a Buddhist temple and being handed an
envelope containing $100,000 in campaign donations, many of them illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   On the videotape shown to a jury in the federal court trial of Democratic
fund-raiser Maria Hsia, Gore enters the California temple at the 1996 event and
the vice president is seen, though not heard, speaking to a crowd, with a
commentator describing the vice president's remarks in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Hsia translated Gore's remarks for the largely non-English-speaking crowd,
according to earlier testimony in the case against Hsia, who prosecutors say
engaged in a scheme to illicitly reimburse contributors to Clinton-Gore '96 and
the Democratic Party. Hsia is accused of five felony counts of causing false
statements to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The videotape of the vice president is the latest reminder of a controversy
that has followed Gore since the campaign fund-raising scandal erupted in 1996.
Some of the donors at the temple fund-raiser were illegally reimbursed for their
contributions out of temple funds and when questions first arose about it, Gore
said he thought he was attending a community outreach event, not a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore videotape was played for the jury by Hsia lawyer Nancy Luque to
make the point that there was no actual fund raising during the vice president's
appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Testifying against Hsia, Huang described how he, Hsia and the head of the
Buddhist sect from Taiwan visited the vice president at the White House in the
spring of 1996, laying the groundwork for what became the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president gave the master his (Gore's) book'' as a gift and ``the
master invited the vice president to visit the temple. ... The vice president
said he'd love to go and that he'd like to bring one of his daughters,'' Huang
testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said the temple fund-raiser had been planned as a community outreach
event, the same term Gore initially used to describe it. But Huang said the
temple event turned into a fund-raiser when two planned stops by Gore were
combined into one because of constraints on the vice president's time.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said he began realizing with some concern that the temple fund-raiser
was in danger of producing only meager rewards, $30,000 to $40,000, far less of
the $200,000 to $250,000 that usually flowed into Democratic coffers whenever
Gore showed up at an event.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said ``I mentioned'' to Hsia the day after the fund-raiser that ``I
hoped I could bring back $100,000,'' and Hsia subsequently told him to meet her
at the temple at 10 at night before Huang took the plane back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Huang said that when he showed up in a temple reception room shortly before
flying out of Los Angeles, Hsia ``handed me an envelope; she mentioned 'this is
$100,000,''' Huang testified. ``I just took it with me and went with my wife to
the airport.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Hsia, an immigration consultant, have described her as a
community activist trying to help newcomers to the United States, while Justice
Department prosecutors have depicted her as combining her business interests
with political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by prosecutor Eric Yaffe, Huang testified that Hsia
recommended that she be seated next to Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner at a Democratic Party fund-raiser at the Hay Adams
Hotel attended by President Clinton on Feb. 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors introduced a photograph of Hsia standing next to Meissner at the
event.

	   WACO, Texas (AP) -- News organizations asked a federal judge Tuesday to open
to the public an upcoming field test that is likely to resolve the key
outstanding question from the Branch Davidian siege: whether federal agents
fired on the compound in the final fiery moments.
</P>
<P>
	   In a motion, lawyers for The Dallas Morning News and The Associated Press
argued that the public's interest in the case trumps any secrecy claims that the
government could assert concerning its conduct during the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   But the request appears unlikely to be granted by U.S. District Judge Walter
Smith, who last week rejected a request by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to open
the test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am advised that for national security and safety reasons, access will be
strictly limited,'' Smith wrote in a Feb. 8 letter. ``Neither the media nor the
public will be permitted to attend.''
</P>
<P>
	   The question of government gunfire is the focus of a Waco reinvestigation by
Congressional committees, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General
Janet Reno and Branch Davidian survivors suing the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died in an inferno
at their compound near Waco, ending the standoff with members of the FBI and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Some died from fire, others from
gunshots. The government has said all along that the sect members were
responsible for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith is presiding over the wrongful death lawsuit, which is due to go to
trial in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, who ordered the field test, was to meet with lawyers, scientists
and special counsel John Danforth on Wednesday in St. Louis to iron out details.
The test is expected to take place at Fort Hood early next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The government long has insisted that none of its agents fired their
weapons. But the Branch Davidian plaintiffs, backed by infrared experts, contend
that aerial surveillance footage the FBI filmed captured bursts of light that
can be nothing other than gunfire -- a claim the government denies.
</P>
<P>
	   The airplane and infrared camera used by the FBI to record surveillance
footage during the 1993 standoff will be used for the upcoming field test, as
will a similarly equipped British Royal Navy helicopter. Weapons like those
carried by federal agents and the Davidians during the siege will be fired
during the field test. Footage recorded from the two aircraft will then be
compared with the 1993 video to determine if the bursts of light represent
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   Issues surrounding the siege and its deadly end continue to be of enormous
interest to the public, Dallas attorney Paul Watler argued in Tuesday's filing
on behalf of The Dallas Morning News and the AP. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch and
Waco Tribune-Herald also planned to press the case for public access.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Shrouding the test in secrecy serves only to undermine the public's
confidence in any such findings or conclusions,'' the news organizations said in
the filing.

<HEADLINE> Bailey Testifies in Sheppard Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- F. Lee Bailey, who won acquittal for Dr. Sam Sheppard at
the doctor's second murder trial, testified Tuesday that two neighbors killed
Marilyn Sheppard in the 1954 case that partly inspired ``The Fugitive'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey's version of the murder is at odds with the theory supported by the
Sheppards' son, Sam Reese Sheppard, who has sued the state claiming his late
father was wrongfully imprisoned for 10 years for his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey, the celebrity lawyer who also helped defend O.J. Simpson, was the
first witness. Sheppard's lawyers want him to show the doctor's first trial in
1954 was unfair because of a flood of negative news reports.
</P>
<P>
	   A few years after Bailey took the case, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned
the first trial's verdict in a landmark ruling against pretrial prejudice from
adverse media publicity. Sheppard's acquittal came at a 1966 retrial.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor told authorities repeatedly that a bushy-haired intruder at the
family home on Lake Erie early on July 4, 1954, beat his wife to death in her
bed. Sheppard said he was knocked unconscious twice while trying to help his
wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, Bailey said Sheppard told him privately he might
have confronted two people.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey testified that Spencer and Esther Houk, neighbors of the Sheppards,
may be responsible for Mrs. Sheppard's beating death. Bailey said Mrs. Houk
might have caught her husband and Mrs. Sheppard having sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Houks have been dead for years. After Sheppard's 1966 trial, Bailey's
theory was presented to a grand jury, which decided against indicting the Houks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Reese Sheppard thinks a window washer for the family, Richard Eberling,
was the murderer. Eberling was convicted in 1989 of killing an elderly widow; he
died in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey also conceded that Sheppard did not recognize Eberling as the killer
when Eberling testified at Sheppard's 1966 retrial.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That did not happen,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Steve Dever said during an argument without the jury present that
Bailey's testimony is important because it showed Sheppard changed his story
about the killing.
</P>
<P>
	   However Bailey said Sheppard was consistent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the bushy-haired man got a life of his own,'' Bailey said. ``That
was one feature of the assailant that Sam could remember.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also testifying Tuesday were Richard and Betty Knitter, a couple who said
they were driving home the night Sheppard was killed when they saw a suspicious
man with bushy hair near the Sheppard home about 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had a terrified look on his face,'' Richard Knitter said.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Stranded in Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Carnival Cruise Lines ship Destiny was adrift Tuesday near
the Turks and Caicos Islands because of an electrical problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The Destiny, which was carrying 2,956 passengers on a seven-day eastern
Caribbean cruise, left Miami on Sunday. There were 1,063 crew members on board.
</P>
<P>
	   All shipboard functions were normal and passengers had air conditioning,
running water and working toilets, said Carnival spokesman Andy Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ship is not in any immediate danger of running aground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newman said the ship was on its way to San Juan, Puerto Rico early Tuesday
when one of its two cycloconverters broke down. Cycloconverters transmit
electricity from the ship's diesel engines. As the ship's engineers were trying
to diagnose the problem, the other cycloconverter went down, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
	   More engineers arrived at the ship later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship was about 60 miles east of Grand Turk, Turks and Caicos Islands.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Granted Appeal Delay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Tuesday to give more
preparation time to the lawyer handling the appeal for convicted Oklahoma City
bombing conspirator Terry Nichols.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals pushed the due date for Nichols'
opening brief from Feb. 17 to April 3. It is the second delay granted.
</P>
<P>
	   In requesting the delay, attorney Susan L. Foreman said she wanted more time
to review new evidence that forms the basis of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols, 44, is serving a life sentence for his role in the April 1995
Oklahoma City bombing and for the involuntary manslaughter of eight federal
agents who were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had no objection to Foreman's request, according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, a federal judge turned down a similar request on behalf
of Timothy McVeigh, who was sentenced to die for his role in the bombing.
Prosecutors had opposed that request.
</P>
<P>
	   The bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building killed 168 people and
injured more than 500.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nordstrom Inc. is recalling about 2,250 infant and toddler
jackets because buttons on their flap pockets could be removed and pose a
choking hazard.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday that Nordstrom,
a Seattle-based department store chain, was recalling the jackets as a
preventive measure. No injuries have been reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled jackets were made in pink or blue cotton gingham fabric, with a
hood and flap pockets. They were sold in infant sizes six months through 24
months, and toddler sizes 2T through 4T.
</P>
<P>
	   The words ``nowhere but nordstrom'' appear on each jacket's hood label.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackets were sold at Nordstrom stores nationwide during January for
about $34 to $36 each.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers should immediately stop using the jackets and return them to any
Nordstrom store for a refund. For more information, consumers can call Nordstrom

<HEADLINE> Examiner Has Possible Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Several possible buyers for the San Francisco Examiner
emerged Tuesday before a deadline set by the Hearst Corp., which had said it
might close the flagship paper of its media empire.
</P>
<P>
	   One offer came from former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly, who is suing in
federal court to block Hearst's plans to sell or close the afternoon Examiner
and buy its morning rival, the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly, a millionaire political consultant who spent more than $3.5 million
trying to unseat Mayor Willie Brown last year, was invited to buy the Examiner,
said his lawyer, Joseph Alioto.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's an unusual guy and he's willing to do this and put up his money to do
it," Alioto said. Alioto would not disclose how much Reilly offered.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst said only that it had "received several indications of interest" that
it was evaluating. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The staffs of the city's two daily newspapers, the afternoon Examiner and
the morning Chronicle, were anxiously awaiting word on Hearst's efforts to find
a buyer. The papers have 2,600 employees, 580 of them in editorial jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Examiner, owned by the Hearst family since 1880, had been up for sale
since August with no apparent bidders. Hearst said it would close the Examiner
if buyers weren't found and would merge the remnants of the Examiner with the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst's $660 million purchase of the Chronicle and its efforts to dissolve
the papers' 1965 Joint Operating Agreement have been held up pending a Justice
Department investigation into complaints that Hearst will have a monopoly in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst sweetened the terms in January to address those concerns, and then
set the Tuesday deadline for finding a buyer. If no one emerged, it could then
claim the Examiner is a failing enterprise, merge the dailies and dissolve the
agreement, which guarantees each paper 50 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers share business operations but maintain separate newsroom staffs.
The Examiner's weekday circulation is about 107,000, the Chronicle's, 457,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Ridder, chief executive of Knight Ridder, one of the nation's largest
newspaper publishers, has said his company would be interested in buying the
paper if the Examiner's share of the Joint Operating Agreement were included in
the deal. He would not comment Tuesday on whether Knight Ridder was one of the
suitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Reilly has had legal tangles with the Examiner before. In 1993, he sued
Executive Editor Phil Bronstein and the Hearst Corp. after his ankle was broken
in a confrontation with Bronstein. Reilly accused Bronstein of pushing him
during a meeting on the paper's coverage of Reilly.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was settled out of court.

<HEADLINE> 'American Beauty' Leads Oscar Nods  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The Oscars embraced dysfunction and darkness
Tuesday, bestowing a leading eight nominations on the suburban burlesque
"American Beauty" and honoring movies about abortion, death row and the
tormented souls of the dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The top nominees included "The Cider House Rules," set in a combination
orphanage and abortion mill; "The Sixth Sense," about a boy from a broken home
who can see ghosts; and "The Green Mile," about the bonds between prison guards
and condemned men.
</P>
<P>
	   Those four movies, along with "The Insider," a film about a tobacco industry
whistle-blower, were nominated for best picture.
</P>
<P>
	   The top acting categories also were heavy on family dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
	   The best-actor candidates included Kevin Spacey in "American Beauty" as a
dad who blackmails his boss, smokes pot with a neighbor kid and flirts with his
daughter's cheerleading friend.
</P>
<P>
	   The other nominees were Sean Penn as a womanizing jazz guitarist in Woody
Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown"; Denzel Washington in "The Hurricane" as boxer Rubin
Carter, unfairly convicted of murder; Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower in
"The Insider"; and Richard Farnsworth as an irascible old man who takes a road
trip on his lawn mower in "The Straight Story."
</P>
<P>
	   Snubbed for the second straight year was Jim Carrey, who did an uncanny take
on the late comic Andy Kaufman in "Man on the Moon." Carrey received
back-to-back Golden Globes for that movie and "The Truman Show" in 1998 but
failed to get an Oscar nomination for either role.
</P>
<P>
	   The best-actress nominees included two adulterous wives (Annette Bening in
"American Beauty" and Julianne Moore in "The End of the Affair"), two struggling
single moms (Meryl Streep in "Music of the Heart" and Janet McTeer in
"Tumbleweeds") and a woman with a sexual identity crisis who poses as a man
(Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry").
</P>
<P>
	   For Streep, it was her 12th acting nomination, tying the record held by
Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cider House" and "Insider" had seven nominations each, while "Sixth Sense"
had six.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards will be presented March 26 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscars have taken some dark departures in the past with such
best-picture winners as "Midnight Cowboy," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and
"Ordinary People." Over the last 15 years or so, though, the awards have tended
to favor epics or costume pieces such as "Amadeus," "Dances With Wolves,"
"Titanic" and "Shakespeare in Love."
</P>
<P>
	   Another superstar, Tom Cruise, got a supporting-actor nomination for his
role as a misogynist sex guru in "Magnolia."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hurricane" got only one nomination, for Washington. It had been viewed
as a leading contender for a best-picture nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   At 79, Farnsworth is the oldest man ever nominated for best actor. A former
stuntman previously nominated for "Comes a Horseman" in 1978, he said he planned
to celebrate with a taco and martini with an olive.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not
have a chance again," Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
	   Swank played the real-life Teena Brandon, who was murdered after
acquaintances discovered the young man they knew as Brandon Teena was actually a
woman. The movie has been in very narrow release, but Fox Searchlight plans to
get it in more theaters this Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to help the movie get seen," Swank said. "It's an important
story, and this way Brandon's legacy lives on."

<HEADLINE> Nazi War Criminal Indictment Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN C. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvian prosecutors are hoping a meeting of Nazi
hunters from around the world will produce enough evidence to formally indict
alleged Nazi war criminal Konrads Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials say the aim of this week's conference, which begins Wednesday in
Riga, is to see Kalejs returned from Australia to stand trial in Latvia, where
he is alleged to have committed crimes during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Latvia is ready to take over this investigation,'' Dzintra Subrovska,
spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said Tuesday. ``We simply need the
other countries to hand over every bit of evidence they have.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the two-day conference would give participating investigators from
the United States, Canada, Australia, Great Britain and Germany a chance to turn
over any evidence they have on Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups say the Latvian-born Kalejs, 86, was a lieutenant in the Arajs
Kommando -- a notorious Nazi-sponsored death squad staffed mainly by Latvians.
The unit is said to have murdered some 30,000 Latvian Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs has said he was ordered by German officers to head an Arajs Kommando
unit, but he has denied being present when civilians were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Latvia has been under pressure by Jewish groups to extradite Kalejs and put
him on trial since he was discovered by Nazi hunters to be living in a
retirement home in Britain. Kalejs, who was deported from the United States and
Canada in the 1990s for lying about his wartime record, fled Britain to
Australia, where he gained citizenship in 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   In total, 80,000 Jews perished in Latvia during the Nazi occupation, with
most killings occurring within the first year of German rule. While Germans
planned and ordered the massacres, Latvian Nazis often carried out the actual
killings.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, authorities have said they don't have enough proof to charge Kalejs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Rise in Light Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index edged higher early
Wednesday in light trading. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 11.03 points, or 0.06
percent, to 19,378.86 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the
average closed down 188.63 points, or 0.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.10 yen, down 0.06 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 109.05 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, traders said the Nikkei was moving in a narrow range in
the absence of fresh market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Wednesday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial daily that the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel is considering a new tax system from
fiscal 2001 would be weighing on the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The system would tax companies on the basis of sales or amount of capital,
rather than income, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such a system would increase the tax burden on corporations and slow down
the economic recovery," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The banking sector rebounded slightly Wednesday after falling for the past
eight sessions. Shares had been hit by worries about the possible introduction
of a new bank tax by the Tokyo metropolitan government.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.25, or 1.9 percent,
to 10,718.09 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 11.58 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,678.56. The TOPIX closed
down 27.27 points, or 1.59 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved narrowly against the yen as investors
looked for new trading incentives.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 107.08 yen, down from 107.19 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7950
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its price rose 0.04 point to
99.18.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore campaigns for husband in Princeton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - One morning at the breakfast table, the Gores
faced a dilemma.
<P>
	   Tipper Gore had a live radio interview later that day, while Al Gore had a
meeting with a foreign head of state. Their son had a school function and wanted
one of his parents there. Tipper told Al she could not cancel her radio
interview, which was about mental illness. So Al Gore rearranged his meeting
with the foreign leader.
</P>
<P>
	   "In this very hectic year of campaigning, my husband was able to make all of
(their son's) football games, said Tipper Gore. "He puts his family first. And
he will continue to put your family first.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the type of tale Tipper Gore wove for women Tuesday, at a fund-raiser
at Jasna Polana, a posh Princeton country club, just a few miles from where Al
Gores primary rival, Bill Bradley, attended college and played basketball for
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted them to have a sense of who my husband is as a family man, his
service, his experience, his concerns about education, healthcare and the
environment, she said after the event.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the first time that the vice-presidents wife has campaigned in New
Jersey since Al Gore began his run for president. Her foray into Bradley's home
state influenced at least one voter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coming here today I had not made up my mind, said Irene Karmazsia, 42, from
Edison. "But, hearing what she had to say, I'm tending to sway toward her
husband. I didn't know his family values.
</P>
<P>
	   Tipper Gore has been campaigning heavily around the country, trying to drum
up support for her husband. On Tuesday, she was far from South Carolina, where
the next presidential primary is scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   That was partly because the New Jersey fund-raiser had been rescheduled from
earlier this month when Tipper Gore was recovering from having a nodule removed
from her thyroid. Doctors were unsure whether the growth was cancerous and so
removed it in late December as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's primary is not until June, when many expect the presidential
candidates will already have been chosen.
</P>
<P>
	   The fund-raiser was expected to add more than $55,000 to Gores coffers, said
event organizer Debra Lynch, wife of state Sen. John Lynch, D-Middlesex. The
vice-president has raised close to $900,000 in New Jersey, compared to Bradley's
$2.57 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think she sends a clear message that hes on board with we women on
healthcare and that he understands the issues, said Debra Lynch.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the attendees paid $250 a plate, but about 20 paid $1,000 and were
privy to a brief reception with Tipper Gore after the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Gore delivered her 15-minute speech, a lineup of speakers discussed
different issues, including cancer care for women and education for inner city
children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al has said many times that the very best that we can do for our children
is to give them a healthy start, said Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New Doral Cigarettes 'Burn Slower'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco has added more tobacco to
its Doral cigarettes and launched a new advertising slogan in an effort to stop
the slide of the nation's top-selling discount cigarette.
</P>
<P>
	   "Smokers have consistently told us that the primary product-quality issue
among value brands is that they burn too fast and don't last as long as
premium-priced brands," said Doug Shouse, the vice resident for Doral marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Packed tighter to burn slower" is Doral's new advertising slogan. RJR said
it will pack all of Doral's 18 styles tighter, but Doral's blend of flue-cured
and burley tobaccos won't change.
</P>
<P>
	   RJR hopes to strengthen its brand as smokers switch to cheaper cigarettes
because premium brands are getting more expensive, said Guy Chance of the
research firm Scott and Stringfellow in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past two years, RJR raised prices 82 cents a pack over the previous
two years to offset costs from the 1997 $206 billion settlement with 46 states,
the company reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good time for a (Doral ad) campaign to improve market share
considering the tremendous price increase of cigarettes overall," Chance said.
</P>
<P>
	   RJR shipped 26.6 billion Doral cigarettes in 1999, down 13.5 percent from
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Doral's retail market share slipped from 6.24 percent in the first quarter
last year to 6.20 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Marlin
retail-market share figures, the industry's leading retail-market source.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Doral remained RJR's top-selling cigarette in 1999 and held the
second-best market share among all domestically sold cigarettes, behind Philip
Morris' premium brand Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
	   Advertisements for the new Doral cigarettes will roll out on store fronts
and counters March 1. RJR said the campaign complements Doral's "Imagine Getting
More" theme introduced in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Survivor Death Ruled Suicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A former Army recruiter who survived the 1995 federal
building bombing and later testified against Timothy McVeigh committed suicide
by crashing his rented plane, the medical examiner has determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The conclusion was cited in a recently released report by the National
Transportation and Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurence Martin's plane went down near an Oklahoma City church Oct. 11,
1998. According to the report, Martin's girlfriend, who was attending services
at the church, had reportedly turned down his marriage proposal the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Martin, 41, also ignored a request from the plane's owner,
who thought Martin had taken off too fast, that he return to the airport
immediately. The NTSB said the control tower relayed the message and Martin
acknowledged receiving it, but he did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   An inspection of the Cessna 172 less than a month before the crash had found
no problems, and witnesses said the plane's engine was running when it plowed
into the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Toxicology tests conducted on Martin's body after the crash detected
diazepam, a drug commonly known as Valium that is used to relieve anxiety,
nervousness and tension, the report said. The FAA does not approve the use of
diazepam by pilots.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Fund Plan Questioned  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush's plan to crack down on big money
politics may work in Texas, but it would be doomed on Capitol Hill, both friends
and foes said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan contains proposals that already have died with legislation
sponsored by his opponent for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, McCain, who has forced Bush into a tight race for the nomination,
congratulated the governor on following his lead on banning some types of ``soft
money'' contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The next thing you know he's going to move to Arizona,'' McCain cracked
while campaigning in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has proposed several points of his plan before, including banning the
practice of ``rolling over'' money from a previous campaign to a current
political bid, as McCain has done this year to the tune of $2 million. Bush
sharpened the proposal Tuesday in a direct shot at McCain's claim to be a
campaign finance reformer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eliminate 'roll-over' loophole and prevent incumbents from transferring
excess funds from a prior federal campaign (e.g., for the Senate-- to a
subsequent campaign for a different federal office (e.g., for the presidency),''
reads the governor's press release.
</P>
<P>
	   The jockeying, hours before the two were to meet in their last debate before
the South Carolina primary Saturday, represented a Bush effort to dull McCain's
claim as the race's only true reformer.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts on both sides described Bush's proposal as incomplete, puzzling
and legislatively doomed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mirroring a law that governs the Texas Legislature, Bush's plan says
lobbyists should be prohibited from donating money to campaigns when Congress is
in session. Bush and his aides offered few specifics, other than to say
contributions would be permitted during any congressional recess -- be it on a
weekend, the month of August or when a Congress reaches the end of its two-year
lifespan.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who is supporting McCain, said the proposal would
be hard to put into effect given the nature of Washington's 24-hour-a-day,
seven-day-a-week political industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's ridiculous,'' Hagel said in an interview. ``I don't know if that's
just a lack of his understanding of the process or not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, argued that the problem with Bush's proposal
was ``more of a manifestation that they just haven't defined it properly.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's clearly unconstitutional,'' added Bennett, who is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be a bitter pill to swallow,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman
for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``Congress is in session for so much of
the year, unlike state legislatures. And when they're not in session, they go
home.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush did get support for the proposal from one lawmaker from his native
state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When Governor Bush becomes president next year, I will be happy to carry
his proposal in the Senate,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not likely to get far.
</P>
<P>
	   Another part of the Bush proposal has already been branded a ``poison pill''
because it would almost surely kill any campaign finance legislation to which it
was attached.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, dubbed ``paycheck protection,'' would specify that union
members would have the right to refuse to pay any portion of their dues used by
the union for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Unions, which overwhelmingly support Democrats, vehemently oppose the
provision and mobilize huge resources to block it.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Tuesday, Bush's campaign said that ``Senator McCain would
permit this abuse.'' In fact, McCain supports paycheck protection but declined
to add it to his campaign finance bill in an effort to preserve the underlying
legislation, which later died. McCain offered to introduce paycheck protection
as a free-standing bill, according to Senate aide Mark Buse.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett said Bush had no choice but to include that cornerstone of GOP
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he would have been subject to serious criticism among Republicans
who understand the issue if he had left it out,'' Bennett said. But still, he
added, ``They need to write a better press release.''

<HEADLINE> Congo Accused of Executing Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. human rights expert on Congo accused the
government Tuesday of breaking a 6-week-old moratorium on death sentences by
executing 19 soldiers in the capital, Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Garreton said he was deeply dismayed that the day before the
executions started on Jan. 28, Congo's human rights minister reaffirmed the
moratorium in a meeting with him at the United Nations, according to a U.N.
press statement.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Congo of a ``lack of respect'' for its international commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   The Congo's U.N. Mission said it had no immediate comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo has been devastated by a 1 1/2-year-old civil war. The six nations and
three rebel groups involved in the conflict signed a peace accord in Lusaka,
Zambia last summer but intermittent fighting has continued.
</P>
<P>
	   On the issue of executions, the United Nations said Garreton received
information that 19 soldiers accused of murder, armed robbery or revolt were
executed hours after being sentenced to death by Congo's Military Court between
Jan. 28 and Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-one other people sentenced to death by the court could also be
executed soon, the U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Garreton, the sentences cannot be appealed and are ``unfair and
incompatible'' with provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights which Congo has signed.

<HEADLINE> Records: McCain Family Kept Slaves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's ancestors owned as many as 52 slaves on
their plantation in Mississippi, campaign officials confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not know that,'' McCain said, after being shown documentation by
reporters for Salon, an online magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine gathered documents from the Carroll County, Mississippi area,
including slave schedules from 1860 that list ``W.A. McCain'' as the owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign press spokesman Todd Harris confirmed McCain's comments Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former prisoner of war, declared
the information ``fascinating'' and a surprise because he had always pursued his
family history through the military.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he knew, for example, that William Alexander McCain had fought in
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess when you really think about it logically, it shouldn't be a
surprise,'' McCain told the magazine. ``They had a plantation and they fought in
the Civil War, so I guess it makes sense.''

<HEADLINE> Private Co. To Help Keep Mir Alive  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A Bermuda-registered company said Tuesday it has reached an
agreement to lease Russia's Mir space station in a last-ditch effort to keep the
orbiting platform alive.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp, which was formed in December, already has paid $20 million to $30
million to the station to keep it up in space at least through the summer, said
its president, Jeffrey Manber. He said another $40 million would need to be
raised to keep the station afloat through the end of the year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that we can come up with clever imaginative ways to use a manned
orbiting platform,'' Manber said in a telephone interview from Alexandria, Va.
``God bless NASA and all the government space agencies, but we want to unleash
the full imagination of the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
	   No Russian officials were immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Mir has been flying without a crew since August, and heavily indebted Russia
had said it would abandon the station next month unless private investors came
up with funding.
</P>
<P>
	   But in January, the Russian government approved a new mission that sent up a
cargo ship earlier this month and is set to blast off with Russian cosmonauts on
March 31. The turnaround came after RKK Energia, which operates the station,
said it had received some foreign funding. No other details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp said in a statement that as part of a new agreement, due to be
signed Thursday in London, it would help fund that mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the lease agreement, Energia will continue to operate the station.
Energia is 38 percent owned by the Russian government and a majority shareholder
in MirCorp, Manber said.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp will seek additional sponsors by offering the use of Mir for
advertising purposes, space tourism and private scientific and pharmaceutical
research, Manber said. He also said the station could be used by private
companies to broadcast live images of the Earth and to repair or manufacture
space satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Mir is worth $2 billion to $4 billion dollars because it
is in space and it works,'' Manber said. ``It sounds basic, but anything already
in space is priceless compared to planning something on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to appealing to corporate sponsors, Manber said he also hopes to
attract people who see the romantic side of the Mir story -- a space station
created by the former Soviet Union being saved by an international investor for
commercial use.

<HEADLINE> Angry with Bradley, abortion rights group pledges to help Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Angry with Bill Bradley for making abortion rights an
issue in his campaign against Al Gore, leaders of a major abortion rights group
said they would place ads, make phone calls and walk door to door to convince
voters to support the vice president.
<P>
	   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, which never
before endorsed a presidential candidate during the primaries, pledged Tuesday
to put its more than 300,000 members and its resources behind Gore now - and in
the general election if he wins the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   "We reject attempts to use this issue as a political wedge to divide
pro-choice voters," said NARAL President Kate Michelman. "We are unhappy and
very disappointed that the Bradley campaign is using it in this fashion. It is
wrong to do so. It is too important. ... And I must say, personally, it's very
upsetting to see a pro-choice candidate use the issue in this way."
</P>
<P>
	   NARAL doesn't take issue with Bradley's position on abortion. "It's his
tactics that are unacceptable, and I think very harmful," Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who spoke with reporters after addressing Jewish leaders in New
York, said he was stunned by the decision. He noted that NARAL gave him a 99
percent rating for his abortion rights voting record when he represented New
Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   By raising the issue, Bradley has tried to point out that while Gore now
supports abortion rights, that wasn't always the case, particularly early in his
political career.
</P>
<P>
	   "For me this is an issue of core conviction on an issue I have believed in
from the beginning of my political life and I will always believe it, so I was
very surprised," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   By comparison, Gore voted in favor of abortion rights only 23 percent of the
time when he was a Tennessee congressman from 1976 to 1982, said Bradley
campaign spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke. She defended the campaign's tactics,
saying Bradley wants the public to know Gore hasn't always supported abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley knows that Al Gore had an anti-choice record. Kate Michelman
knows that Al Gore had an anti-choice record. The only person who doesn't seem
to know that is Al Gore. It has been a record which he has failed to
acknowledge, let alone explain," Ludecke said. "This endorsement has very little
to do with the issue of choice and a lot more to do with politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who appeared with Michelman, said he was grateful for the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot play political games with an issue as fundamental as a woman's
right to choose," he said. "As president, with your help, I will make sure that
that right to choose is never threatened, never weakened and never taken away."
</P>
<P>
	   Michelman said she is confident in Gore's support.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore is solidly pro-choice, has been a fighter for reproductive rights
and will continue to be," she said. "We had to step out at this moment in time
to set the record straight."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he does not fear a backlash from abortion rights supporters
"because women know where I stand on that issue and they also know what my
record is."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore says he's always supported a woman's right to an abortion and always
believed the procedure should be legal, saying he only had reservations about
government funding of abortions for poor women in Medicaid. But he was forced to
admit to a changed position as details of his record emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, he wrote a constituent that abortion was "arguably the taking of a
human life." In 1984, he voted to include "unborn children from the moment of
conception" in the definition of "person" under four existing civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelman said Gore did not seek the endorsement and didn't know the group
was thinking of making one. NARAL decided to back Gore to turn attention to the
anti-abortion records of the leading Republican candidates, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to get the focus where it belongs, which is that both Republican
presidential candidates would use the power of the presidency to end legal
abortion and take away a woman's right to choose," Michelman said.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cementing trade relations with China, opening markets to
Africa and the Caribbean and confirming America's leadership role in world
organizations are the main trade objectives of Congress this year, House
Republican leaders said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In outlining their agenda, Republicans also released a congressional study
finding that the November trade agreement the Clinton administration reached
with China offers real opportunities for U.S. farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   That agreement, committing China to major market-opening measures, sets the
stage for China's accession to the World Trade Organization and requires
Congress to end the annual review of China's trade status and put trade
relations with China on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The China vote expected this summer, said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., may
be the most important Congress casts this year to maintain the nation's economic
prosperity and leadership in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas., described the GOP's three goals
as the ``trade expansion Contract with America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before April, he said, Congress will try to complete legislation to promote
freer trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. The House last year
passed a bill that would allow most products from sub-Saharan Africa to enter
the country with no quotas or duties. The Senate passed a more limited Africa
trade bill and tacked on another measure to promote trade with the Caribbean.
The two chambers have yet to reach a compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Second, he said, the House will work to ``soundly defeat'' expected
legislation that would withdraw U.S. support from the WTO. ``The WTO is not the
villain the Seattle radicals and their Washington allies would have us
believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally is the vote on permanent trade status for China, which supporters
say will turn China into a more free and open society and be a significant
benefit to American exporters and investors. Opponents argue it would reward a
despotic, hostile country and take away an important tool to influence China's
human rights and weapons proliferation policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report issued by the
Republicans cited a forecast by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman that U.S.
farm exports could increase by $2 billion annually once the Chinese start
removing barriers cited in the November agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department repeated on Tuesday that sales of farm products
to China could triple to $3 billion annually and tariffs on beef alone could
drop from 45 percent to 12 percent if China enters the WTO. Glickman told farm
lobbyists they have to be ``intent and focused'' on the matter and urged them to
organize pressure from farmers and other constituents on members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said open trade with China is crucial
in his home state where corn prices are at their lowest in recent history and
Caterpillar tractors are not selling because of the lack of foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said he planned to work with President Clinton on the trade agenda
and several Republicans praised the president for his commitment to winning
Democratic support. Dreier said he and other Republicans met Clinton Tuesday
night and ``I believe he is going to do everything he can'' to win the China
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has assigned Commerce Secretary William Daley to lead its
lobbying efforts on the China issue. Permanent trade status is opposed by labor,
human rights and environmental groups, among the Democrats' most important
constituents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on Capitol
Hill,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta told farm groups last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Commerce Secretary William Daley said: ``Our market is already open to
China. This agreement will open China's market to the United States. If we do
not grant China permanent normal trade relations we will risk losting the full
benefits of the strong enforceable market-opening agreement we negotiated.''

<HEADLINE> Republican Debate Notebook  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Larry King apparently doesn't allow free advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Six huge signs promoting the sponsor of the Republican presidential debate,
the South Carolina Business and Industry Political Education Committee, had been
set up as TV backdrops for the talk-fest on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
	   But they were removed while preparations for the 1 1/2-hour debate were
under way and replaced with wordless signs showing images of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   With the candidates all set to throw rhetorical barbs, supporters of Sen.
John McCain were going for the darts.
</P>
<P>
	   A McCain party was organized at Jillian's, a bar and game room with loads of
pool tables, video games, air hockey, ping-pong tables and dart boards. His fans
could watch the debate on TV while indulging in their own gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   At last check, pictures of McCain rivals George W. Bush and Alan Keyes were
not hanging on the dart boards.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign is a little worried about fair weather friends of McCain;
namely, the independents and crossover Democrats who might come out in large
numbers in the Saturday primary to vote for the Arizona senator, especially if
the weather's nice.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's people are hoping the rain possible for Saturday will come to pass,
keeping many McCain supporters home while die-hard Republicans flock to vote for
Bush in conditions fair or foul.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been conjuring up some rain dances,'' said Heath Thompson, Bush's
state director.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Web site Speakout.com put together a focus group allowing participants
to critique the debate moment by moment with ``perception analyzers.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's a fancy name for a contraption with a dial. The user can turn the
dial up from the neutral 50 to register a positive response to something in the
debate, and down to respond negatively.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   What a trooper.
</P>
<P>
	   The state trooper and McCain fan who pulled over a campaign bus last week
won't lose his job, said Department of Public Safety spokesman Sid Gaulden.
</P>
<P>
	   Trooper Michael O'Donnell stopped the McCain bus on its way to Charleston so
he could meet the senator. But McCain was on another bus on his way to Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   The unconventional roadside stop caused some consternation in the state.
Someone from McCain's staff called and urged the department not to fire
O'Donnell, Gaulden said. But he said that played no role in the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Welcome to the South.
</P>
<P>
	   The street in front of Seawell's restaurant, the site of the debate, was
transformed into a monster truck race.
</P>
<P>
	   Pickup trucks with campaign signs and loud speakers rumbled up and down the
street, booming their support for candidates, while supporters along the road
chanted, cheered and carried signs.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Christians for Life has endorsed Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Steve Lefemine says only Keyes, Reform Party candidate Pat
Buchanan and Constitution Party nominee Howard Phillips are in line with his
group's anti-abortion philosophy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lefemine's group thinks abortion should always be illegal, and he is praying
``that the Lord will defeat George W. Bush'' in the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week another anti-abortion group, South Carolina Citizens for Life,
endorsed Bush.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fugitive Sought in Nebraska  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSK, Wyo. (AP) -- Police and National Guard troops with night vision
equipment searched a secluded area by foot and helicopter Tuesday night for a
Texas survivalist wanted in the killing of a farmer and the wounding of two law
officers in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Carl McDonald of the Wyoming Highway Patrol confirmed that Charles
Lannis Moses Jr. was in the area, but he said it appeared Moses had given police
the slip again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know if he is outside our perimeters or where he is,'' McDonald
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses, a 31-year-old construction worker, has been the subject of a
three-day manhunt that began in western Nebraska. He was spotted in Lusk at
about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses sped away and a number of state troopers, county deputies and the FBI
joined in pursuit until Moses crashed his vehicle into a ditch. He apparently
fled into a remote, rocky, hilly area with a few widely scattered ranches,
McDonald said, and police expanded the manhunt after creeping up on his empty
pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   The search in Wyoming came after military helicopters were called in and
schools in the Paxton, Neb., area were closed as more than 100 state troopers
searched for Moses. Paxton is about 150 miles southeast of Lusk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns declared a state of emergency Tuesday, which
allowed the guard to use two unarmed Blackhawk helicopters in the search. The
Nebraska State Patrol already had two planes and another helicopter taking part
in the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
	   A first-degree murder warrant was issued for Moses on Tuesday, one day after
Robert Sedlacek, 48, was found shot to death near an abandoned farmhouse eight
miles from Paxton. Police believe Moses had been hiding out on the farm and
killed Sedlacek to steal his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Sedlacek was speaking with his father-in-law, Paul Fisher, on a cell phone
and said he noticed unusual tire tracks on the property, Keith County Attorney
Deborah Gilg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said his last words with Sedlacek were to warn his son-in-law about
the fugitive. ``I heard him say, `What are you doing here?' and the phone went
dead,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The manhunt started late Saturday when a Lincoln County sheriff's deputy
tried to arrest Moses on Texas charges of theft and evading arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In a shootout with about two dozen officers who chased him in his truck,
Moses allegedly wounded one in the abdomen and another in the hand. He escaped
into the night on icy rural roads because his pickup had no tail lights, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a survivalist. He goes for camping equipment and weapons,'' said Gary
Studebaker, a chief sheriff's deputy in Nocona, Texas. ``Ninety-nine percent of
the time he always runs. He's good at it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Wyoming, ranchers armed themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Brown, a rancher about 5 miles north of where Moses crashed the pickup,
said he was alone but not worried. He had his lights turned on and his guns at
his side.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm kind of surrounded by them,'' he said. ``Yeah it wouldn't do good for
him to show up here at all.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain swapped charges of
negative campaigning Tuesday night in a close quarters debate, their final clash
before the South Carolina primary. ``You should be ashamed,'' the Arizona
senator lectured his rival. ``Don't compare me to Bill Clinton,'' Bush snapped
back.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he had ordered his staff days ago to stop running all negative
ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush, seated scarcely three feet away, waved a printed flyer that he
said attacked him harshly and had turned up on a car windshield earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not by my campaign,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It says paid for my McCain committee,'' was Bush's instant rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid back and forth between the two men left the third contender, Alan
Keyes, to complain about the tone. ``Is this the kind of pointless squabbling we
really want them to see,'' he said of a television and watching CNN's broadcast.
The studio audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderator Larry King of CNN made no attempt to interrupt the squabble,
though, as Bush and McCain recited grievances against one another stemming from
several heated weeks of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stunned Bush, the national front-runner, two weeks ago with a
landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary, and South Carolina shapes up as a
pivotal test for the two men. The state votes on Saturday, and recent polls
point to a close contest.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Top Official Visits Moscow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Calling for a new chapter in Russia's dealings with the West,
NATO's top official arrived in Moscow on Tuesday night for talks aimed at
smoothing relations between Russia and the alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see this as turning a page on past disagreements and turning to new
chapters of dialogue and cooperation on matters of mutual interest,''
Secretary-General Lord Robertson told reporters upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson said he had brought a document proposed for signing during the
trip but declined to detail its contents.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's ties with NATO, already strained by the alliance's expansion into
eastern Europe, have been nearly frozen in response to NATO's bombing campaign
in Yugoslavia last year. The two sides have also clashed over Russia's military
campaign in breakaway Chechnya, with NATO accusing Russia of using excessive
force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We shall be glad to welcome NATO's new secretary-general in Moscow ... but
the Russian position on Chechnya shall not be changed especially on the occasion
of his visit,'' said presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit, he added in comments cited by the Interfax news agency, will help
Robertson ``understand that the criticism directed at Russia does not correspond
to the present realities in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko said Robertson would meet
Wednesday with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
There was no indication that Robertson would be meeting with acting President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson has said he is eager to discuss Moscow's new national security
doctrine, which broadens the Kremlin's authority to use nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Jones Sues Tycoon Over Offer  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones is suing a New York tycoon for the $1
million he had offered her to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit against Abe Hirschfeld contends he broke a signed contract to
pay Jones after she settled with Clinton for $850,000 in November 1998, said
Jones' attorney Gregory Kitterman of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Paula would not have settled with the president had she not had Abe
Hirschfeld's written promise to pay her,'' Kitterman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed Feb. 7 in Dallas County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld said he had not received a copy of the lawsuit and would not pay
Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't owe her nothing,'' Hirschfeld said in a telephone interview from
his New York home. ``She didn't want to take my money. I gave her the check, she
gave it back to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld offered Jones the money in October 1998, but he later sought to
attach conditions to the payment and the offer appeared to fizzle out.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyer John Whitehead of the conservative Rutherford Institute, which was
providing legal help to Jones, said at the time that the conditions would have
made Hirschfeld's money meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   But Kitterman said that the signed agreement should still stand.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones contended that Clinton made an unwelcome sexual advance in 1991 in a
Little Rock hotel room while he was Arkansas governor and she was a state
employee.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, but Jones asked the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals to reinstate it. She reached the settlement -- in which Clinton
offered no apology nor admission of guilt -- while the appeal was pending.

<HEADLINE> IRA Pulls Out of Disarmament Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army withdrew Tuesday
from disarmament negotiations, dealing a blow to hopes of resurrecting Northern
Ireland's Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
	   In a hard-line statement, the IRA also formally withdrew from the table its
latest hint that it might someday disarm. The outlawed group accused the British
government and the province's major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, of
pursuing ``a military victory,'' something that ``cannot and will not happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   The development underscored the failure of a 3-month-old deal brokered by
American diplomat George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell had persuaded the Ulster Unionists to establish a four-party
coalition alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. In exchange, the IRA was
supposed to begin negotiating the gradual destruction of its hidden weapons
stockpiles, a goal of the province's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Britain suspended the 10-week-old administration's powers Friday
after confirming that the IRA had made no commitments to the disarmament
commission. The commission is charged with securing the IRA's total disarmament
by May in line with the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The British and Irish governments still intend to hold separate talks
Wednesday in London with Northern Ireland's key parties. But the odds against
transferring powers back soon to the Belfast administration look greater than
ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's IRA statement came after an ill-tempered meeting between Sinn Fein
leaders and Peter Mandelson, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland,
who took the decision to resume direct control of the province.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a bad meeting, quite frankly,'' said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
a reputed former IRA commander. ``And this Sinn Fein leadership has now no
further room to move. We have seen the failure of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adams said he blamed Mandelson for rejecting the IRA's last offering to the
Belfast-based disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, head of the disarmament commission,
reported late Friday -- hours after Mandelson revoked the local Cabinet's powers
-- that the IRA had for the first time said it might put its weapons ``beyond
use'' in the event of unspecified political progress.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tuesday's statement the IRA said it was now ``withdrawing all
propositions'' presented to de Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson, in response, said the IRA's last offering ``had real potential,
and people will be sad that it could not be worked on and developed in the way
that is needed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Northern Ireland's peace process now finds itself tied up in a familiar
knot: The Ulster Unionists won't share power with Sinn Fein unless the IRA
disarms, and the IRA won't budge unless the Ulster Unionists drop that
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major Catholic party, the pacifist Social Democratic and
Labor Party, condemned the IRA statement as a rejection of the Good Friday
accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Seamus Mallon, the SDLP's deputy leader and senior Catholic in the suspended
Cabinet, said the IRA and Sinn Fein seemed bent on treating disarmament as ``a
bargaining chip,'' when it was an established obligation within the accord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must now clearly establish if in effect the IRA is going to be part of
the new future,'' Mallon said. ``Or are they going to believe that they can
thwart the wishes of the Irish government, the British government, the people of
the island of Ireland, and indeed world opinion?''
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's refusal to disarm has cast a long shadow over peacemaking efforts.
The issue first brought Mitchell into the province in 1995, when he and de
Chastelain recommended that the IRA gradually disarm during negotiations
involving Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead the IRA ended its cease-fire and killed two people with a one-ton
truck bomb in London.
</P>
<P>
	   British anti-terrorist chiefs said Tuesday that, despite the growing signs
of anger in Sinn Fein-IRA circles, they didn't expect the IRA to abandon its
current 31-month-old truce soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA statement is obviously not good news,'' said the commander of
Northern Ireland's police force, Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan. ``But we have
no information to suggest that the IRA intends to reengage in acts of violence
contrary to their stated cessation of violence.''

negative campaigning Tuesday night in a close quarters debate, their final clash
before the South Carolina primary. ``You should be ashamed,'' the Arizona
senator lectured his rival. ``Don't compare me to Bill Clinton,'' Bush snapped

really want them to see,'' he said of a television audience watching CNN's

</P>
<P>
	   Moderator Larry King of CNN made no attempt to interrupt the squabble,
though, as Bush and McCain recited grievances against one another stemming from
several heated weeks of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stunned Bush, the national front-runner, two weeks ago with a
landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary, and South Carolina shapes up as a
pivotal test for the two men. The state votes on Saturday, and recent polls
point to a close contest.
</P>
<P>
	   There were handshakes all around as the three men took their seats around
King's interview table. And the opening moments of the 90-minute encounter
seemed more a seminar on foreign policy than a debate in the heat of a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   All three men said the United States should build a national anti-ballistic
missile system despite a Cold War-era treaty that forbids it, and called for
tougher treatment of China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All three of us agree that the president has drug his feet'' on the
anti-ballistic missile system, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The tone changed abruptly, though, when King asked Keyes whether the
campaign had been ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, complained that Bush's campaign
had paid for an event at which a spokesman for a ``fringe group'' had attacked
him for neglecting veterans. The same man years ago attacked Bush's father, the
former president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if you can undersand, this, George, but that really hurt.
That really hurt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah,'' Bush said quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should be ashamed of sponsoring an event with that man there who had
attacked your own father,'' McCain continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The man was not speaking for me ... if you want to know my opinion about
you , John, you served our country strongly and admirably,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he then turned the tables on McCain, noting that one of his supporters,
former Sen. Warren Rudman, had called members of the Christian Coalition bigots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' replied McCain, who did not disavow the
alleged remark.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate shaped up as a critical juncture in the statewide campaign where
Bush is trying to right his front-running campaign, and where McCain is hoping
to show his 18-point victory in New Hampshire was no fluke. Bush won the leadoff
Iowa caucuses and last week's Delaware primary, but McCain didn't campaign in
either state and polls have shown some of Bush's support slipping.
</P>
<P>
	   A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published Tuesday showed Bush edging out McCain
49 percent to 42 percent. A Los Angeles Times poll had the two in a statistical
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, during a McCain town hall meeting in Irmo, he said his
fate would hinge on turnout. The Arizona senator has been attracting new voters
and reaching out to Democrats and independents, a key to his New Hampshire
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we have a big voter turnout, I think we can win this. If all this
negative stuff depresses voter turnout, then I'm not as confident,'' said
McCain, who has pulled his negative ads off TV.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Chavez Attacks Intensify  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Three of the former military officers who helped
President Hugo Chavez stage his famous coup attempt eight years ago stepped up
their attacks against him Tuesday, saying he has betrayed the goals that
prompted their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
	   The former coup leaders charged that Chavez is crushing democratic debate
and running his government and Fifth Republic Movement political party with the
same old-style, backroom politics that have turned the oil-rich nation into a
bastion of poverty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chavez government ``doesn't represent in reality the hopes of the people
... for profound change,'' retired Lt. Col. Yoel Acosta Chirinos told a
nationally broadcast press conference in Maracaibo in western Zulia state. He
resigned as general coordinator of the Fifth Republic Movement last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The conflict between Chavez and the three former coup leaders has created
the biggest political crisis of his year-old government and threatens to divide
his governing coalition. The three include Chavez's former intelligence chief,
retired Lt. Col. Jesus Urdaneta, and retired Lt. Col. Francisco Arias Cardenas,
who is now governor of powerful, oil-rich Zulia.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's supporters say the three are jealous of the president's political
success and simply want a bigger share of power. Chavez has announced a full
investigation into allegations of corruption in his administration, and says he
has nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday the dispute spilled over to the secret police, where infighting
among Chavez backers led to the house arrest of the head the investigations
unit, Luis Pineda.
</P>
<P>
	   The new police head Eliezer Otaiza said Pineda had refused to accept his
dismissal and was wandering the headquarters without authorization.
</P>
<P>
	   Pineda was appointed by Urdaneta, who charged that the house arrest was
another attempt by Chavez and his supporters to block investigations into
government corruption.

<HEADLINE> Clues Sought in Littleton Shootings  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN ELLIOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Investigators worked to identify a suspect Tuesday in the
killings of two Columbine High students at a sandwich shop, where a surveillance
camera failed to capture the shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman who works at the Subway shop noticed a light on in the shop about 1
a.m. Monday, three hours after it was supposed to have closed. She went inside
and discovered the bodies of Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and his girlfriend,
Stephanie Hart, 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Kunselman worked in the sub shop, and Hart, whom he had been dating, had
come by the shop to pick him up, friends said. The Subway is about two blocks
from Columbine, where two teen-agers fatally shot 12 fellow students and a
teacher before killing themselves last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendy Kunselman said her son was a loving boy who had called Hart his
``soulmate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He believed that there was no way they could ever be apart, that they
would always be together,'' she told KUSA-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas Kunselman was in the school auditorium April 20 when Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold open fire in the school, his mother said. ``The Columbine
disaster really seemed to affect him more than he wanted to admit,'' his mother
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson County sheriff's investigators were trying to identify a motive
and a suspect in the Subway killings. Spokesman Steve Davis declined to say
whether a weapon was found but said the store's camera did not capture the
crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbine classes met as usual Tuesday but attendance was down about 10
percent, said Tanya Spasev, a spokeswoman for Jefferson County School District.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mood is just trying to pick up and move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   A small crowd of mourners stopped in the parking lot outside the shop
Tuesday, placing bouquets of flowers, messages and helium balloons.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the bodies were discovered, gun-control advocates unveiled a
wall in Denver bearing the names of 3,094 people killed nationwide with guns
since the Columbine massacre. Denver Mayor Wellington Webb and others hope the
wall will encourage state legislators to enact stricter gun laws.

<HEADLINE> ABC Pays Damages to Psychic Network  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ABC paid more than $900,000 to a Psychic Services
Network worker who claimed a secretly made videotape shown on "PrimeTime Live"
ruined his reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Sanders received a check from the network last week, his attorney,
Neville Johnson, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1993 lawsuit filed by Sanders claimed an "ABC spy" secretly taped him and
his co-workers at the psychic telephone counseling firm with the intent of
portraying such services as "a scam and illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
	   The footage aired on the news magazine "PrimeTime Live" in February 1993. In
1994, a jury awarded Sanders $335,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in
punitive damages. ABC appealed, but the verdict was upheld.
</P>
<P>
	   With interest and fees, the total payout rose to $933,992, Johnson said. ABC
spokeswoman Eileen Murphy in New York confirmed the amount paid but said the
network had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Wards Seized at Palermo Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Police have seized three wards at a private psychiatric hospital
in Sicily, where more than 100 patients were allegedly found in filthy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   State television aired video shot by police agents posing as repairmen which
showed emaciated patients at Villa Stagno hospital in Palermo. The footage
showed some patients in urine-soaked beds, a kitchen with rotting food,
excrement-smeared floors. There was no hot water.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Marzia Sabella called the scene shocking and said the owner and
managers were being investigated for patient abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately we've grown used to seeing scenes even worse than these,''
Sabella said in a telephone interview from the Sicilian capital. ``This is the
excuse the Villa Stagno management gave us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The owner, Paolo Stagno, denied any wrongdoing. ``These are difficult
patients, some of them are incontinent,'' Stagno was quoted as saying by the
ANSA news agency. ``But none of them were ever neglected.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press made repeated attempts to reach him without success.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional health authority has been paying Villa Stagno $75 a day per
patient for years, but officials seemed unaware of the conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first I heard of it was on television last night when I saw those
shocking images,'' Giancarlo Manenti, head of the regional health department,
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manenti said he suspended the official in charge of monitoring Villa Stagno
on Tuesday and is transferring patients to other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   Conditions in sections of the hospital catering to more affluent private
patients were described as significantly better than in the shuttered wards.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Joins Palestinian Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By VICTOR L. SIMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican joined the Palestinians on Tuesday in
condemning Israel's hold over all of Jerusalem as ``morally and legally
unacceptable,'' aggravating the Israelis just a month before the pope's visit to
the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
	   An agreement signed by the Vatican and Palestinian officials called for an
internationally guaranteed statute to preserve ``the proper identity and sacred
character'' of the city, which is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   The text did not mention Israel by name, but the Jewish state has
consistently considered Jerusalem its indivisible capital since it annexed the
eastern section following the 1967 Mideast War. It has repeatedly ignored
previous Vatican calls for such a statute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican, like many states, has never recognized Israel's occupation of
eastern Jerusalem. The final status of the city is to be decided in talks
between Israelis and the Palestinians, acknowledged as one of the most difficult
points in the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   The strong wording in Tuesday's bilateral agreement appeared to take the
Israelis by surprise. The Foreign Ministry said the Vatican's representative in
Israel has been asked to come to an ``urgent meeting'' Wednesday to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel flatly rejects the references to Jerusalem in the aforementioned
document,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ``Jerusalem, was,
is, and shall remain the capital of the State of Israel, and no agreement or
declaration by these or any other parties will change this fact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zvi Tal, spokesman for Israel's embassy to the Holy See, said that while the
Vatican's stance was known, Tuesday's action amounted to interference in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. He also said the Palestinians appeared
to have breached an agreement with Israel limiting the types of further
agreements they could make.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord signed Tuesday covers the Vatican's relations with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and the status of churches and freedom of worship in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
	   It was signed on the same day that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met with
Pope John Paul II and offered a last-minute invitation -- accepted by the pope
-- to add another Palestinian city, Jericho, to his Holy Land itinerary. The
pope is also scheduled to visit Bethlehem and a Palestinian refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican's stance underscored difficulties the pope may face on his March
20-26 tour of Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories. During a 1998
visit to Israel, the Vatican's foreign minister caused a stir when he called the
Israeli presence in east Jerusalem an ``illegal occupation.''

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Report Ordered Released  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The High Court on Tuesday ordered Britain to release a
medical report assessing Gen. Augusto Pinochet's fitness for trial, saying the
rights of countries seeking his extradition outweighed the former dictator's
right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-judge panel said Britain's top law enforcement official erred in
not allowing Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland to review the medical
findings and show them to their own medical experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said he would turn over the report immediately.
The nations, which must adhere to ``strict conditions of confidentiality,'' now
have until Feb. 22 to offer their assessments of the findings.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw will issue his final ruling shortly after that, but already has said
he believes the medical report shows Pinochet is not mentally fit to stand
trial. He says he is inclined to let Pinochet return to Chile rather than face
extradition to Spain on charges of torture.
</P>
<P>
	   The High Court decision came in response to an appeal by Belgium to see the
report, supported by six human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Straw and lawyers for Pinochet had argued that the report should remain
sealed to protect the general's right to privacy, but the court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ever there was a case in which the integrity of the international
criminal justice system needed to be demonstrated, a case calling for the
highest standards of fairness and transparency, this is it,'' said Lord Justice
Simon Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
after Pinochet ousted elected Marxist president Salvador Allende in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   The 84-year-old general was arrested in October 1998 on a Spanish warrant
while recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital. He has diabetes and
suffered two small strokes last fall, and remains under police guard at a rented
mansion outside the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spanish government, which has made it clear that it does not support
Magistrate Baltasar Garzon's bid to bring Pinochet to trial in Madrid, welcomed
the release of the medical reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Garzon, whom the judges specifically named as entitled to see the findings,
was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chilean plane is waiting to take Pinochet home, but even Straw's final
extradition ruling can be appealed by the parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain reiterated Tuesday that it would not contest any decision to release
the general. The other nations have not yet indicated what they would do.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaction to Tuesday's ruling was mixed in Chile, with Pinochet opponents
calling it a step toward justice and angry supporters blasting the decision amid
calls to take to the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's elder son, also named Augusto, told a local television station
that his father ``is ill, and I think it is not for lawyers to judge a report by
professional doctors.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Katherine Boo of The Washington Post won the 1999 Heywood
Broun Award for distinguished journalism for her stories on rapes, physical
abuse and forced labor of retarded people and city officials who profited from
the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The contest judges also awarded special commendations to Ellen E. Schultze
of The Wall Street Journal for coverage of the push to "modernize" pension plans
and Jason DeParle of The New York Times for his stories about the
welfare-to-work movement and its effect on people.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-member panel of Broun Award judges also noted Boo's extraordinary
perseverance, passion and outrage, qualities the judges said were in the best
tradition of Heywood Broun. The annual award, which carries a $5,000 prize, is
sponsored by The Newspaper Guild-CWA, an affiliate of the Communications Workers
of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Boo was honored for her series called "Invisible Lives" and "Invisible
Deaths," which examined the conditions at group homes for the retarded and later
looked at the deaths of people at group homes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the wake of Boo's reporting, District of Columbia officials closed group
homes, fired several top managers and indicted others.
</P>
<P>
	   Broun, a newspaper columnist in the 1920s and 1930s, was The Newspaper
Guild's founder. The award in his name has been made since 1941.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Officers Claim Diallo Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Echoing their fellow defendants' accounts, two of the
four New York City police officers on trial for killing an unarmed immigrant
testified Tuesday that the man appeared to draw a gun and take a ``combat
stance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, described a frantic search inside
the vestibule of Amadou Diallo's Bronx apartment building for a gun the African
immigrant never had.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss told the jury hearing the four officers' second-degree murder trial
that he was ``destroyed'' when he learned the black object in Diallo's right
hand was a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I kept praying the weapon would be in there, that it was somewhere,'' Boss
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The four white plainclothes officers had been searching the neighborhood for
armed criminals on Feb. 4, 1999. They saw Diallo at the rear of the 5-by-7-foot
vestibule with his right arm extended, Boss said. He ``was crouched like in a
combat stance. ... The same one I was taught in the police academy,'' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss said he saw Officer Edward McMellon fall back off Diallo's doorstep and
thought his colleague had been shot. When the gunfire ended, Boss said, he
grabbed McMellon and ``started feeling his chest, going `Where are you hit,
where are you hit?' ... He said, `I'm not hit.'''
</P>
<P>
	   In a recording of a radio call played for the jury, a frantic-sounding Boss
is heard saying, ``I need a bus forthwith, and a boss'' -- police parlance for
an ambulance and a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers fired 41 shots at Diallo, who was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy, who fired four times, testified that he was certain Diallo was
armed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was not a doubt in my mind that he had a gun. I had a sick feeling
in my stomach that I was going to be hit at any second. That's why I fired,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon, 27, and the fourth defendant, Sean Carroll, who turned 37 Tuesday,
took the stand Monday to explain why they each fired 16 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   All four officers emphasized similar points: that it was dark; that Diallo
ignored orders to halt for questioning; that he remained on his feet throughout
the gunfire. Each officer denied shooting the victim after he was down.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled a warning before
cornering Diallo and opening fire. Autopsy findings supported the prosecutors'
contention that several of the bullets hit Diallo while he was going down.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members and supporters of the officers sat in the Albany courtroom
Tuesday while the men testified. Many wore buttons reading: ``Free the Bronx
Four.''
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany after the shooting sparked protests and
allegations of widespread police abuse of minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony was expected to continue through the end of this week. If
convicted, the four could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

	   Toronto Co. Wants Warrant for ID
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- An Internet company says it will hand over the identity of a
possible suspect in last week's Internet hacking bonanza if it's presented with
a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet Direct of Toronto confirmed Tuesday someone using the handle
``mafiaboy'' was on an Internet provider, called Delphi Supernet, that the
company purchased last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say an Internet user with the same handle is a suspect in the
sabotage, which wrecked a number of major U.S. and other Internet sites last
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Company vice-president Colin Campbell said at a news conference Internet
Direct doesn't know whether its client is the one the FBI is seeking. The client
was allegedly kicked off Montreal-based Delphi Supernet in 1998 for abusing the
system.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell added the client's identity will be made available if authorities
obtain a search warrant.

	   Abbott Ejected From Commons
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The political dispute over federal job-creation grants turned
personal Tuesday, as Reform MP Jim Abbott was ejected from the Commons for
accusing Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart of lying.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange was sparked when Stewart maintained that individual Reform MPs
have been contacting her office to press for grants in their ridings -- while
their colleagues simultaneously denounce such spending as a waste.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Reform party says it wants to kill these programs,'' Stewart told the
House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Except when we have individual members who know that the Transitional Jobs
Fund, the Canada Jobs Fund ... and other programs make a difference to
individuals in their ridings.''
</P>
<P>
	   She identified three British Columbians -- Abbott, Mike Scott and Reed Elley
-- as Reformers who ``keep calling my office saying can't you please hurry up
and approve the application.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abbott objected that he had never personally called Stewart's office and
characterized the minister's words as lies -- a use of unparliamentary language
that got him turfed from the chamber by Speaker Gilbert Parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart later clarified her statement to explain it was a member of Abbott's
staff who had called her office. Scott also had a staff member do the phoning,
while Elley sent a personal letter to the minister.
</P>
<P>
	   All three Reformers insisted, in separate interviews, that they disagree in
principle with government handouts for business. But all said they felt a duty
all the same to companies in their ridings that had applied for federal money
under the Canada Jobs Fund.

	   Thomson To Sell Most Newspapers

<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Thomson Corp., once Canada's dominant newspaper chain, plans
to sell all its papers except the Globe and Mail in Toronto as it focuses on
expanding its specialized information services businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson said Tuesday it expects the sale of 55 daily and 75 non-daily papers
in Canada and the United States -- valued at $1.3 billion -- to close in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The five Canadian dailies being sold are the Winnipeg Free Press and Brandon
Sun in Manitoba, the Lethbridge Herald and Medicine Hat News in southern Alberta
and the Thunder Bay Chronicle-Journal in Northern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomson's properties will be eyed by various other newspaper chains,
including Conrad Black's wide-reaching Hollinger Inc., printing giant Quebecor
Inc., and southern Ontario-based Torstar Corp.
</P>
<P>

	   Justice Cites 'Gun Epidemic'
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The Ontario government should abandon a challenge of new
federal gun laws and instead take its own steps to curb the province's ``gun
epidemic,'' a provincial Liberal justice critic says.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bryant outlined a five-point plan of action Tuesday that includes
taking U.S. gun manufacturers to court to recoup health costs, a tactic already
in use there.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant also wants Premier Mike Harris to require trigger locks on new guns
sold in Ontario, start incentive-based swap programs and set up a provincial gun
registry, should the Supreme Court allow it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time for the government to pass legislation that will actually do
something about the gun epidemic in Ontario,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa's gun control law, drafted by the federal Liberals and passed in
Parliament in 1995, requires every gun owner to be licensed by Jan. 1, 2001 and
to register every firearm they own by Jan. 1, 2003.

	   Weed Said Threat to Great Lakes
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- A nasty foreign weed is moving inexorably northward from the
United States posing a major threat to Canadian lakes, an international
conference on nuisance species heard Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hydrilla has been devastating waterways from Florida to Connecticut and has
the potential to cause heavy ecological and economic damage in Canada, John
Madsen of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant can completely cover the water surface in shallow waters,
preventing sunlight from reaching other species underneath, Madsen said in an
interview from the Toronto conference.
</P>
<P>
	   It is impossible to predict when the plant will reach the Great Lakes
because it has been progressing in unpredictable jumps.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell moderately Wednesday morning on
profit-taking following recent gains. The dollar edged higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 46.67 points, or 0.24
percent, to 19,321.16 at the end of the morning session. On Tuesday, the average
closed down 188.63 points, or 0.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 109.25 yen, up 0.09 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and
also above its late New York level of 109.05 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei moved slightly higher early in the session,
but traders said it later moved into negative territory as the market
consolidated after closing above 20,000 points for the first time in 31 months
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Wednesday in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial daily that the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel is considering a new tax system from
fiscal 2001 caused concern in the market, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The system would tax companies on the basis of sales or amount of capital,
rather than income, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Such a system would increase the tax burden on corporations and slow down
the economic recovery," said Hidenori Karaki, general manager at
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.25, or 1.9 percent,
to 10,718.09 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 29.78 points, or 1.76 percent, to 1,660.36. The TOPIX closed
down 27.27 points, or 1.59 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved narrowly against the yen as investors
looked for new trading incentives. Market players were also waiting for
congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 107.25 yen, up from 107.19 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7900
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.8000 percent. Its price rose 0.09 point to
99.23.

<HEADLINE> Private Co. To Help Keep Mir Alive  </HEADLINE>
   By MARA D. BELLABY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- A Bermuda-registered company said Tuesday it has reached an
agreement to lease Russia's Mir space station in a last-ditch effort to keep the
orbiting platform alive.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp, which was formed in December, already has paid $20 million to $30
million to the station to keep it up in space at least through the summer, said
its president, Jeffrey Manber. He said another $40 million would need to be
raised to keep the station afloat through the end of the year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that we can come up with clever imaginative ways to use a manned
orbiting platform,'' Manber said in a telephone interview from Alexandria, Va.
``God bless NASA and all the government space agencies, but we want to unleash
the full imagination of the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
	   No Russian officials were immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Mir has been flying without a crew since August, and heavily indebted Russia
had said it would abandon the station next month unless private investors came
up with funding.
</P>
<P>
	   But in January, the Russian government approved a new mission that sent up a
cargo ship earlier this month and is set to blast off with Russian cosmonauts on
March 31. The turnaround came after RKK Energia, which operates the station,
said it had received some foreign funding. No other details were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp said in a statement that as part of a new agreement, due to be
signed Thursday in London, it would help fund that mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the lease agreement, Energia will continue to operate the station.
Energia is 38 percent owned by the Russian government and a majority shareholder
in MirCorp, Manber said.
</P>
<P>
	   MirCorp will seek additional sponsors by offering the use of Mir for
advertising purposes, space tourism and private scientific and pharmaceutical
research, Manber said. He also said the station could be used by private
companies to broadcast live images of the Earth and to repair or manufacture
space satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that Mir is worth $2 billion to $4 billion dollars because it
is in space and it works,'' Manber said. ``It sounds basic, but anything already
in space is priceless compared to planning something on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to appealing to corporate sponsors, Manber said he also hopes to
attract people who see the romantic side of the Mir story -- a space station
created by the former Soviet Union being saved by an international investor for
commercial use.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Sequoia Protection  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is considering setting aside as much as
400,000 acres of forests in California as a federal monument to permanently
protect remaining groves of the state's giant sequoia trees, administration
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton asked Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman to explore whether the
trees ought to be protected under the 1906 Antiquities Act, as he did a month
ago to ensure permanent protection over a vast stretch of land adjacent to the
Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to ensure that these majestic cathedral groves ... are protected
for future generations to study and enjoy,'' Clinton wrote the agriculture
secretary, whose department includes the U.S. Forest Service. He said he wanted
a recommendation within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists for years have campaigned to impose greater protection of
the giant sequoia trees -- about 70 groves in all -- that are located in Kings
Canyon, Sequoia and Yosemite national parks and nearby Sequoia National Forest
in central California.
</P>
<P>
	   While about a third of the groves are protected within the national park
systems, the rest are in the national forest and they could be endangered by
future logging or other development. Environmentalists fear that while the trees
themselves might not be cut, nearby logging could threaten their long-term
existence.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's action ``is a recognition that there is a major gap in the
protection of this very, very important and majestic species. That gap needs to
be filled,'' George Frampton, the chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton said a monument designation would protect 70 remaining groves of
the giant redwoods, including about 35 groves that are not guaranteed future
protection because they are in the federal forest. At least one grove is in
private hands and land would have to be purchased, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton said the intent would be to protect 330,000 to 440,000 acres of
land, or about a third of the Sequoia National Forest, to ensure permanent
protection of the giant trees.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal to create a Giant Sequoia National Monument brought immediate
applause from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Creation of (such a monument) would be a world class gift to the American
people,'' said Nathaniel Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council. ''...This swath of sequoia country should have been permanently
protected long ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has used the Antiquities Act on several occasions to carve out major
areas of land for special protection, each time meeting strong criticism from
some western lawmakers and state officials. White House officials have
acknowledged that the actions are part of an attempt by the president to leave
an environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Clinton used the backdrop of the Grand Canyon to announce the
designation of a million acres of cliffs, desert and scenic areas adjacent to
the Grand Canyon as the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument. He also
extended monument protection to 71,000 acres of American Indian ruins north of
Phoenix and to hundreds small islands up and down the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years ago, Clinton used the 1906 law to set aside for increased
protection 1.9 million acres in southern Utah, creating the Grand
Staircase-Escalante federal monument. The action brought loud protests from Utah
officials, who called it a federal ``land grab.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the monument designation, the land would have increased protection
against development such as mining or logging, although some activities
including cattle grazing might still be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Finds Sales, Charity Link  </HEADLINE>
    By KRISTEN EVERETT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- With its year-end sales figures, Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. released data Tuesday indicating that the stores that sold the most also
gave the most to charity.
</P>
<P>
	   The 100 stores with the highest sales contributed three times as much to
their communities as the 100 stores with the lowest sales in the fiscal year
that ended Jan. 31, Wal-Mart officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there is definitely a connection and it has been proven year after
year," said Betsy Reithemeyer, director of the Wal-Mart Foundation and the
company's community affairs office.
</P>
<P>
	   Bentonville-based Wal-Mart said Tuesday that its annual sales were up 26
percent over last year; the amount given to communities in 1999 was up 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart gives each of its stores money it can use in the community, with
the amounts based on store size, Reithemeyer said. She said money is given to
stores because company officials in Bentonville don't know what's needed in
communities in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   But the stores also chip in money for their communities, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Wal-Mart raised and donated $164 million nationally. Of that, $80
million was allocated from Wal-Mart headquarters to each store.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wal-Mart stores that gave the most to charity among other stores in
their divisions were: Bentonville; Jasper, Ala.; Santee, Calif.; Bangor, Maine;
Bloit, Wis.; and Mocksville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   For Sam's Clubs, the Jacksonville, Fla., store was the top giver.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain swapped charges of
negative campaigning Tuesday night in a close quarters debate, their final clash
before the pivotal South Carolina primary. ``You should be ashamed,'' the
Arizona senator lectured his rival. ``Don't compare me to Bill Clinton,'' Bush
snapped back.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men and Alan Keyes also clashed over abortion, taxes and campaign
finance and found common ground on foreign policy in a 90-minute encounter, but
the debate crackled when the topic turned to negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator, said he had ordered his staff days ago to stop
running all negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Texas governor, seated scarcely three feet away, waved a printed
flyer that he said attacked him harshly and had turned up on a car windshield
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not by my campaign,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It says paid for by John McCain,'' was Bush's instant rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid back and forth between the two men left Keyes to complain about
the tone. ``Is this the kind of pointless squabbling we really want them to
see,'' he said of a television audience watching CNN's broadcast. The studio
audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderator Larry King of CNN made no attempt to interrupt the squabble,
though, as Bush and McCain recited grievances against one another stemming from
several heated weeks of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stunned Bush, the national front-runner, two weeks ago with a
landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary, and South Carolina shapes up as a
pivotal test for the two men. The state votes on Saturday, and recent polls
point to a close contest. Bush runs strongly among registered Republicans in the
surveys, but McCain gains strength from independents, who are permitted to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   There were handshakes all around as Bush, McCain and Keyes took their seats
around King's interview table. And the opening moments of the 90-minute
encounter seemed more a seminar on foreign policy than a debate in the heat of a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   All three men said the United States should build a national anti-ballistic
missile system despite a Cold War-era treaty that forbids it, and called for
tougher treatment of China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All three of us agree that the president has drug his feet'' on the
anti-ballistic missile system, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush outlined a campaign finance proposal earlier in the day, but McCain,
who has made reform the centerpiece of his campaign, said his rival's plan
wouldn't do enough to stem the influence of big money. King broke in at one
point to ask McCain whether a $1 million contributor would find his phone call
returned. ``Sure, ask any ex-senator, they'll tell you,'' McCain said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain caught Bush in a contradiction on abortion. He noted the Texas
governor supports the Republican platform language on abortion from 1996, a
plank that envisions no exceptions for a ban on abortions. Yet Bush has also
said he favors exceptions for cases of rape, incest and the life of a mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, who opposes all abortions, attacked both men. ``One individual
doesn't really accept the pro-life position of the party, and the other ... says
he supports it and takes a position that is logically inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain disagreed over tax cuts, as they have repeatedly, Bush
saying that without his larger cut, money would go to Washington and be spent on
bigger government. McCain has a smaller cut, and sets aside more money for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has attacked Bush's tax cut for providing too much relief for the
wealthy, and said that was precisely the type of criticism that can be expected
from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sounds exactly like Al Gore. See that's what he took offense of when I
talked about Bill Clinton,'' McCain said, linking the issue back to the
controversy over negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   That issue had come up in the first several minutes of the debate, when King
asked Keyes whether the campaign had been ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, complained that Bush's campaign
had paid for an event at which a spokesman for a ``fringe group'' had attacked
him for neglecting veterans. The same man years ago attacked Bush's father, the
former president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if you can understand, this, George, but that really hurt.
That really hurt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah,'' Bush said quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should be ashamed of sponsoring an event with that man there who had
attacked your own father,'' McCain continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The man was not speaking for me ... if you want to know my opinion about
you , John, you served our country strongly and admirably,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he then turned the tables on McCain, noting that one of his supporters,
former Sen. Warren Rudman, had called members of the Christian Coalition bigots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' replied McCain, who did not disavow the
alleged remark.

<HEADLINE> Bush Mischaracterizes Laws  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush mischaracterized the campaign finance
laws he's proposing to change, suggesting in Tuesday's GOP debate that
individual donors are already barred from giving huge sums to politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor was defending his proposal to ban soft money
contributions to political parties from corporations and unions -- but not from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   When presidential rival Sen. John McCain complained that a businessman could
write a $1 million check under the plan, Bush protested. ``John, there's a
thousand-dollar limit,'' he said to the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   But the $1,000 limit to which Bush referred applies to individual giving to
specific candidates. Individuals can give $20,000 a year to a party to be spent
directly on candidates and unlimited amounts of money to parties for generic
activities like getting out the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Those unlimited sums are known as soft money, an area of giving that McCain
is proposing to get rid of entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   With campaign finance reform as his signature issue, McCain knows the rules.
But even he went off base when he set up his challenge of Bush's plan by saying
that an individual, Bernard Schwartz, ``gave $1 million individually to the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schwartz gave about $650,000 in federal political contributions in the 1996
re-election campaign, most of it to Democrats, according to Federal Election
Commission records. He gave $1,000 to the Clinton-Gore campaign.

<HEADLINE> Show Combines Pageant, Dating Game  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- They say money can't buy love, but it can buy a bride.
Especially on national television.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Rockwell, a real estate investor and motivational speaker who lives
near San Diego, met and married Darva Conger after a two-hour prime-time
competition aired on Fox Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire," broadcast the night after
Valentine's Day, combined elements of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," "The
Dating Game" and a beauty pageant -- and ended with the toss of a bouquet.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is no joke," said actor Jay Thomas, the emcee, at the show's outset.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox executive Mike Darnell came up with the idea after watching ABC's "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire" soar in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
	   "It struck me that part of the reason it was so successful was wish
fulfillment," said Darnell, Fox's executive vice president for alternative
programming. "I thought, 'what else do people wish for?' They wish for a
relationship. They want to get married. And I thought, 'how could I combine the
two?"
</P>
<P>
	   Fox launched a nationwide search for a millionaire who wanted to get
married, and a woman who would marry him. Thousands of women applied.
</P>
<P>
	   "The money is a cutesy motivational factor," Darnell said. "I think mostly
people are looking for a relationship."
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell, who grew up in Pittsburgh and now has a second home in Vancouver,
was shrouded in shadows for most of the show before emerging to pick Conger, a
Gulf War veteran also from California.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll be your friend, your lover and your partner," Conger promised before
Rockwell made his selection. "You will never be bored."
</P>
<P>
	   The special began with 50 women who ranged in age from 19 to the mid-40s.
They were quickly cut down to 10 semi-finalists. The women paraded on stage in
bathing suits and wedding gowns, and answered questions like what they
considered an ideal Friday night and what they would do if they found a woman's
name and phone number in their new husband's pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   Rockwell asked for advice judging the answers from his friends and his
mother, who wasn't quite sure what to make of things. "I think it's going to be
an interesting evening," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   He then chose five finalists. Each was asked what qualities would bring out
the best and worst in them, and whether they considered children important.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know exactly what I'm looking for in love and in life and it's here
tonight," Rockwell said, before proposing to a shaking Conger.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge was then summoned to the Las Vegas Hilton, where the special was
taped, to perform the wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday night's special is a ratings winner, expect to see it again as a
semi-regular series -- particularly during "sweeps" months like February.
</P>
<P>
	   As America watched their whirlwind "courtship," Rockwell and his bride were
in an undisclosed location on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "As funny as it sounds, they got married and now it's time to get to know
each other," Darnell said.
</P>
<P>
	   If it doesn't work out, there's always another hit TV show they can try:
"Divorce Court."

<HEADLINE> Blair's Salary Goes Up This Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair is getting a 2.9 percent salary
increase, bringing his yearly pay to $180,300.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said Tuesday that increase over Blair's current $175,628
income takes effect on April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The independent review body that makes salary recommendations approved a pay
raise of $253,300, but Blair opted for the lower figure. The review panel came
into effect in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers and government ministers will also get a 2.9 percent pay raise,
Blair's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   That takes ministers' pay to $154,600 and parliament to $77,200. from
$75,000. The raises are above Britain's rate of inflation
</P>
<P>

doubling the annual salary of future U.S. presidents to $400,000.

<HEADLINE> Hostages: Hijackers Were Big Family  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR SHAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- While most passengers on the hijacked Afghan
plane cowered in fear, dozens of others -- many of them women and children --
laughed, tossed aside their veils and received the choicest food and drink from
their captors.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the relatives of the hijackers, according to some of the freed
hostages who returned to Afghanistan. Seventy-three passengers returned home.
</P>
<P>
	   In Britain, meanwhile, another former hostage claimed asylum in Britain,
officials said Tuesday, bringing the total number seeking to remain in Britain
to 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed Shamsullah said the hijackers' goal was to seek asylum for
themselves and their families. He said more than 30 of the people on the plane
were relatives of the hijackers. Some passengers said as many as 40 were
related.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 was hijacked Feb. 6, shortly before arrival
at the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif after a flight from Kabul. Nine men
jumped out of their seats, brandishing guns and knifes. The hijacking ended Feb.
10 in Britain after a standoff with British police at an airport outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers -- 13 men have been charged in a British court -- beat one man
with a stick and warned others to keep their heads between their knees, the
freed hostages said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers appeared to relax after the aircraft landed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't know what was happening because we never knew of a hijacking. I
thought maybe it is something political or there was a problem with the plane,''
Shamsullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Shahbibi, was making her first flight. She said she was terrified:
``I just kept crying and praying from the Koran.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first stop was in Uzbekistan. Shamsullah said the hijackers were
nervous, refusing to let small children leave their seats. Then the aircraft
made an emergency stop in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The second time when we landed everyone was very afraid because there was
something wrong with the plane,'' he said. ``When it landed everyone said 'God
is great'.''
</P>
<P>
	   After Kazakstan, the plane stopped in Moscow and finally London, where the
passengers were given food and drink.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers gave preferential treatment to their families, giving them
food and water first and even handing out Pepsis -- prized because they're so
expensive in Afghanistan -- to their children, Shamsullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They gave all the Pepsis to their children and we got what was left,'' he
said. ``In our country Pepsi is very sweet, because it costs too much money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another passenger, who identified himself only as Rokhai, said there were 35
to 40 family members traveling with the hijackers. They sat throughout the
aircraft, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They divided their people among us. Everyone was afraid, but their women
and children were laughing, they threw off their burqua and showed their faces.
I thought they are very bad,'' Shamsullah said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan is strictly Islamic, and men and women who are not related do
not interact. Shamsullah said the hijackers talked freely with several women and
children ``and the women were very relaxed and not worried at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the outset of the hijacking there were reports that 36 members of the
same family were aboard the plane, including a woman who was to be married in
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamsullah denied that there was a bride aboard. Rokhai agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of the 13 names given to the British court was found on the
passenger list at the Ariana Airlines office in Kabul. An official there said
the airline may have been given false names.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamsullah and Rokhai spoke to The Associated Press at the airport in Kabul
on Tuesday before finally flying home to Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Afghanistan's ruling Taliban have requested that the asylum seekers be
returned, and promise they will not be punished. Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed
Muttawakil has warned Britain that to grant asylum to people who are economic,
not political refugees, would encourage hijackings.

   By The Associated Press Dean Davenport
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Retired Air Force Col. Dean Davenport, co-pilot of
the bomber ``Ruptured Duck'' during the daring Doolittle Raid on Japan early in
World War II, died Monday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Ted W. Lawson, Davenport's pilot, wrote a book about the Doolittle Raid
titled ``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.'' Davenport served as technical adviser when
the book was made into a movie starring Spencer Tracy as Gen. James ``Jimmy''
Doolittle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ruptured Duck was one of 16 B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from the deck
of the USS Hornet about 650 miles from Tokyo on April 18, 1942. All but seven of
the 80 crew members survived and returned to the United States, even though most
had to bail out or crash-land before reaching landing strips in China because
they had run out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Davenport was injured when the Ruptured Duck ditched into the South China
Sea after the Tokyo raid. Davenport eventually made his way to Egypt where he
took a commercial flight to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   He later flew 86 combat missions during the Korean War. He retired in 1967.
John Clint Dennis
</P>
<P>
	   CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (AP) -- John Clint Dennis, a Democratic sheriff and
state senator from southeast Missouri for 40 years, died Tuesday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Dennis was Scott County sheriff from 1951 until 1976, when he was elected to
the first of four terms in the Missouri Senate. After 16 years as a senator,
Dennis didn't seek re-election in 1992.
Leonard Phelps Good
</P>
<P>
	   CHICKASHA, Okla. (AP) -- Leonard Phelps Good, an artist, historian and
former head of the art department at Drake University, died Sunday. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
	   Good taught art in public schools in Texas and Oklahoma from 1927 to 1930.
He was a member of the faculty at the University of Oklahoma School of Art from
1930 to 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Good became head of the art department at Drake in Des Moines, Iowa, in
1952. He served in that position until 1968 and remained at the school until
1977 as a professor and emeritus professor.
</P>
<P>
	   His art work is in galleries across the United States.
John C. Kuehne
</P>
<P>
	   ROCKPORT, Texas (AP) -- John C. Kuehne, who played music with The Monkees,
Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor, died Saturday. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of death was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   An accomplished bass player, he attended San Antonio College and won musical
competitions along with Michael Nesmith.
</P>
<P>
	   When Nesmith was chosen for a starring role with The Monkees, a 1960s
television sitcom about a pop music group, Kuehne became a backstage player with
the show. Under the stage name John London, Kuehne did musical work with the
group and played small roles in some episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   He later was a studio musician for Ronstadt, Taylor and others. Kuehne left
California and returned to San Antonio in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuehne worked in advertising sales for both the San Antonio Express-News and
the San Antonio Light. After the Light closed in 1993, Kuehne and his family
moved to the Gulf Coast, where he joined the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.
G. Leon Netterville
</P>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Southern University President G. Leon
Netterville, who oversaw the historically black school during times of student
unrest in the early 1970s, died Saturday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
	   A longtime Southern University administrator, Netterville became the
school's president in 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting deaths of two students during a protest on campus in 1972
weighed heavily on him and he resigned later that year, according to Clayton
Lewis, retired University Relations director.
Elmer Redd
</P>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Elmer Redd, the longtime University of Houston Cougars
assistant football coach who assisted Bill Yeoman through some of the program's
glory years, died Friday. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
	   Redd retired from Houston in 1986 after 17 seasons with the Cougars. During
that time, the team entered the Southwest Conference and immediately became a
power in the league.
Vitamin T. Smith
</P>
<P>
	   LAKE DALLAS, Texas (AP) -- Vitamin T. Smith, a running back for the 1951
National Football League champion Los Angeles Rams who once held the single
season record for kickoff returns for touchdowns, died Monday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith joined the Rams in 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   He led the team and the league in receiving and kick and punt returns. In
five seasons, Smith accumulated 1,025 receiving yards and 12 touchdowns;
returned 75 punts for 814 yards and one touchdown; and returned 57 kickoffs for
1,453 yards and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith led the league in punt returns in 1949 with 427 yards and one
touchdown and led the league in kickoff returns in 1950 with 742 yards and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's three kickoff returns for touchdowns stood as the NFL record until
Green Bay's Travis Williams returned four in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith retired from the NFL in 1953 to work in the oil industry.
William Oliver Swofford
</P>
<P>
	   SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) -- William Oliver Swofford, a singer who under the
stage name Oliver had late-'60s hits with the songs ``Good Morning, Starshine''
and ``Jean,'' died Saturday of cancer. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1969, his recording of ``Starshine,'' from the Broadway musical ``Hair,''
climbed to No. 3 on the pop charts and the ballad ``Jean'' reached No. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   He toured throughout the 1970s, then left the music business in the 1980s
and worked in the home-construction and pharmaceutical industries.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Calmer in S.C. This Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- For Alan Keyes, Tuesday's GOP presidential debate in
South Carolina was a far cry from last time.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, with the debate limited to candidates who finished in the top four
in New Hampshire, Keyes did not make the cut and was not allowed in.
</P>
<P>
	   The next week in Atlanta, Keyes -- who had threatened a hunger strike after
being excluded in South Carolina -- was taken into custody by police when he
tried to enter the television station where other GOP candidates were set to
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a right to speak,'' Keyes shouted as police hustled him away in
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes referred to the snub Tuesday night. ``I was so far outside this
process at one point that the last cycle when we held this debate I wasn't
allowed to participate in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, he finished fourth in New Hampshire. With Steve Forbes out of the
race, Keyes is one of three Republican candidates still running -- along with
George W. Bush and John McCain.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Walk a Fine Line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
</P>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain walk a fine line
between aggressive tactics and negative politics in their campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination. Their balancing acts were put to the test
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In a contentious debate, the third man on the stage, Alan Keyes, chided the
top contenders for their ``pointless squabbling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Squabbling, yes. Pointless, no. McCain and Bush are making strategic
strikes, knowing the consequences will be severe if they go too soft or too
hard.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain seemed to find the balance he sought, defending himself against
criticism while striking out at Bush with a smile on his face. He used a
stiletto, not a sledgehammer, to dispute the Texas governor's portrayal of his
tax policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a Washington mentality, it's the grownup mentality,'' McCain
said, suggesting that Bush is not mature enough to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, combative on the heels of his landslide defeat in New Hampshire, spoke
with exclamation-point passion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't know my record!'' he told Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me finish! Let me finish!'' he told McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to be a pro-life party!'' he told moderator Larry King.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor, pulling out a McCain campaign flyer that criticized
Bush's tax-cutting plan, accused the Arizona senator of breaking his pledge to
run a positive campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not by my campaign,'' McCain said, pointing to the paper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It says, `Paid for by John McCain,'' Bush fired back. Indeed, McCain
acknowledged later that the handout was produced by his campaign, but said his
staff had nothing to do with handing it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters who had urged Bush to be more aggressive had to be happy with his
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ever since New Hampshire, it has been important for him to show he's
willing to fight for the nomination,'' said GOP consultant Scott Reed, who is
not tied to any of the campaigns. ``I thought his fire was healthy, actually.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was the candidates' final shot at a wide audience before
Saturday's primary, a flash point in the intense nomination fight. Contests in
Michigan and McCain's home state of Arizona are one week away, little time for a
loser here to regain his footing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people will decide who to vote for, and just as important whether
or not to vote, based on the debate,'' said Dave Woodard, a GOP consultant and
professor at Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain used a lengthy discussion of foreign policy to draw a subtle
distinction with Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Texas governor said the United States must be careful where it
deploys forces, McCain seemed dismissive. ``It's not that simple,'' he said,
then argued that a superpower must keep its options open.
</P>
<P>
	   While McCain provided crisp, clear answers to foreign policy questions, Bush
sometimes rambled. ``I don't know. I don't know. Probably not. Maybe,'' Bush
said when asked if he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin as the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain really came through on the foreign policy and national defense
issues as somebody who looks presidential,'' Reed said. He said Bush produced
``a lot of unforced errors.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain hopes to return to the form that helped him win New Hampshire's
primary. He let Bush get under his skin in the opening days of the South
Carolina race and approved a highly critical ad -- what one chagrined adviser
now calls ``an electronic temper-tantrum.''
</P>
<P>
	   It suggested that Bush, like President Clinton, couldn't be trusted. A
follow- up ad found Bush guilty of ``truth twisting.'' McCain had been set off
by an ad that said he wasn't telling the truth about Bush, but that one didn't
make the comparison to Clinton -- the ultimate insult in GOP politics.
</P>
<P>
	   After his own polling suggested the spots had backfired, McCain yanked them
and promised to run a clean campaign. The ads had tarnished his image and
threatened to suppress voter turnout; McCain needs a large showing of new GOP
primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush needed to undermine McCain's credibility to slow his momentum, but the
strategy was risky. Voters may be turned off by his rhetoric or the work of his
surrogates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're both in a box,'' Woodard said. ``The perception has been that both
have honor, courage and dignity -- the things people are looking for in the wake
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. And when you go negative, you look like
President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, even more than Bush, suffers if voters feel a debate is too
negative; he is the only candidate promising to defeat the establishment and
change the way campaigns are run.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People could begin saying, `This is politics as usual, not politics that's
different,'' Woodard said.

<HEADLINE> Blues 4, Thrashers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Michal Handzus scored two short-handed goals as the St.
Louis Blues extended Atlanta's winless streak to 11 games by beating the
Thrashers 4-1 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-ever game between the franchises was a contrast of teams heading
in opposite directions. Atlanta is 0-10-1 in its last 11, and 3-21-4 on the
road. The Blues are 9-2-0 in their last 11 and lead the Western Conference with
78 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Pavol Demitra added a goal and an assist for St. Louis. Lubos Bartecko had
the other Blues goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamie McLennan, making a rare start in place of All-Star Roman Turek, made
13 saves in goal. The Blues have allowed only 2.05 goals per game, the fewest in
the league. St. Louis is 30-3-6 when allowing two goals or less.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Ferraro scored his 15th goal for the Thrashers, who have not won since
beating Philadelphia 1-0 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   With the game tied 1-1, Handzus and Bartecko scored 35 seconds apart midway
through the second period to put the Blues ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   While teammate Tyson Nash was in the penalty box, Handzus poked the puck
away from Maxim Galanov at center ice, skated in and beat Scott Fankhouser with
a wrist shot for his 15th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Just after Nash got out of the box, Bartecko carried the puck into the
Atlanta zone and scored on a slap shot from just inside the blue line at 12:16.
Fankhouser was replaced by Norm Maracle at the start of the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Handzus got an empty-net goal with 2:55 left, again while the Blues were
shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis, 22-3-4 when it scores first, opened the scoring 13:29 in on
Demitra's 25th goal. Demitra came in on a 2-on-1, faked Fankhouser out of
position and put the puck into the open net.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferraro tied the game at 6:03 of the second, beating McLennan with a shot
from a bad angle.

<HEADLINE> Report: St. John's Probe Continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The NCAA, which ordered St. John's guard Erick Barkley
suspended earlier this month, is continuing its investigation of other players
on the team, the Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Mike Jarvis said he had received no official notice but that he has
heard the NCAA inquiry is not over.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not worried about them coming back," Jarvis said. "We've got nothing to
hide."
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis said much the same thing before Tuesday night's game at Boston
College: "I have nothing to be concerned about."
</P>
<P>
	   He said there needs to be changes made in the way the NCAA handles
investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything won't end until things are changed," he said. "Hopefully this
program will be about change. This speaks in the necessity in the way business
is done.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the things that has to happen is concern for the student and his
rights," he said. "This is not about St. John's. It's about every kid that plays
basketball."
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's issued a statement before the game saying it has "not hired an
investigator. St. John's has hired someone to represent us and work with the
NCAA in its information-gathering process. In this way, we will protect the
interests of our student-athletes. This is not someone who will independently
investigate anything. Again, this is someone who will protect the interests of
our student athletes."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Tuesday, in a statement, St. John's athletic director Ed Maneta
said, "We understand the NCAA has additional questions. We do not know the
specific nature of those questions. We will cooperate and provide them with the
information they need."
</P>
<P>
	   The Daily News reported that the NCAA is probing alleged violations of its
rules regarding gifts to athletes and potentially improper relationships between
St. John's players and people outside the university who may be acting as
representatives of sports agents.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper said that a jewelry store near the St. John's campus had been
selling items to a number of players, a practice that began with Ron Artest, who
played two years before declaring for the NBA draft. Artest now plays for the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley was suspended for three games because of what the NCAA said was an
improper benefit when he swapped cars with the brother of his former summer
league coach. St. John's appealed and the suspension was reduced to two games.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fugitive Caught in Wyoming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSK, Wyo. (AP) -- The search for a Texas survivalist wanted in the killing
of a farmer and the wounding of two law officers in Nebraska ended late Tuesday
when the fugitive was wrestled to the ground after entering a couple's home.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Lannis Moses Jr. had been the subject of a three-day manhunt that
began in western Nebraska. Moses, a 31-year-old construction worker, was accused
of shooting two Nebraska police officers on Saturday and gunning down a farmer
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He had outrun authorities in the hills just over the Nebraska-Wyoming state
line.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses was caught around 8:40 p.m. after entering a farmhouse, where the
occupants wrestled a firearm away from him and called police, Sgt. Troy McLees
of the Wyoming State Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses was not injured but he was taken to a hospital for injuries he
suffered in a shootout with Nebraska officers on Saturday night, Lees said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Moses sped away and a number of state troopers, county
deputies and the FBI joined in pursuit until Moses crashed his vehicle into a
ditch. He then fled into a remote, rocky, hilly area with a few widely scattered
ranches, and police expanded the manhunt after creeping up on his empty pickup.
</P>
<P>
	   The search had shifted to eastern Wyoming from western Nebraska. In the
Paxton, Neb., area, military helicopters were called in and schools closed as
more than 100 state troopers searched for Moses. Paxton is about 150 miles
southeast of Lusk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns declared a state of emergency, which allowed the
guard to use two unarmed Blackhawk helicopters in the search.
</P>
<P>
	   A first-degree murder warrant was issued for Moses on Tuesday, one day after
Robert Sedlacek, 48, was found shot to death near an abandoned farmhouse eight
miles from Paxton. Police believe Moses had been hiding out on the farm and
killed Sedlacek to steal his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Sedlacek was speaking with his father-in-law, Paul Fisher, on a cell phone
and said he noticed unusual tire tracks on the property, Keith County Attorney
Deborah Gilg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said his last words with Sedlacek were to warn his son-in-law about
the fugitive. ``I heard him say, `What are you doing here?' and the phone went
dead,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The manhunt started late Saturday when a Lincoln County sheriff's deputy
tried to arrest Moses on Texas charges of theft and evading arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In a shootout with about two dozen officers who chased him in his truck,
Moses allegedly wounded one in the abdomen and another in the hand. He escaped
into the night on icy rural roads because his pickup had no tail lights, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a survivalist. He goes for camping equipment and weapons,'' said Gary
Studebaker, a chief sheriff's deputy in Nocona, Texas. ``Ninety-nine percent of
the time he always runs. He's good at it.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pulls Out of C. African Rep.  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) -- United Nations peacekeepers
formally ended their presence in the Central African Republic Tuesday, fueling
public fears of escalating lawlessness and banditry.
</P>
<P>
	   In a quiet handover ceremony at a U.N. base in the capital, departing force
commander Gen. Barthelemy Ratanga shook hands with Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's representative, Baryu Adeyeni, who will lead a small team of 20
political observers who are expected to arrive in April.
</P>
<P>
	   A Senegalese peacekeeping contingent flew out of the capital over the
weekend, leaving Ratanga and a handful of officers the only remaining members of
the 1,350-member force.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. force replaced French soldiers who helped implement a peace accord
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has welcomed the peacekeepers' departure, saying it was time
for them to go after a two-decade presence by troops from France, the country's
former colonial ruler, and other foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet many civilians and opposition groups expressed dismay Tuesday at the
pullout which came during a rash of armed robberies and car hijackings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are attacked day after day in our homes and on the streets by men with
Kalashnikovs (automatic rifles). We will need U.N. soldiers for years to come,''
complained Mama Mariam, a civic leader in Bangui's middle-class Fondo
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutinous soldiers staged three major uprisings in the Central African
Republic since 1996 against President Ange-Felix Patasse, whose election in 1993
ended more than a decade of army rule. Patasse won re-election late last year
amid opposition claims of voting fraud.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain swapped charges of
negative campaigning Tuesday night in a close quarters debate, prelude to a
pivotal South Carolina primary. ``You should be ashamed,'' the Arizona senator
lectured his rival. ``Do not compare me to Bill Clinton,'' Bush snapped back.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, McCain and Alan Keyes also clashed over abortion, taxes and campaign
finance and found common ground on foreign policy in a 90-minute encounter, but
the debate crackled when the topic turned to negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator, said he had ordered his staff days ago to stop
running all negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Texas governor, seated a few feet away, waved a printed flyer that
attacked him over Social Security, a copy of which he said turned up on a car
windshield on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not by my campaign,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It says paid for by John McCain,'' was Bush's instant rejoinder, and in
post-debate comments, McCain conceded he may well have been right.
</P>
<P>
	   On stage during the debate, Bush said he was willing to stand by all ads he
was running, and said to McCain, ``you can disagree with me on issues, John, but
do not question - do not question my trustworthiness and do not compare me to
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the stakes high, McCain appeared calm throughout the evening, while
Bush seemed particularly intent on making his points. ``Let me finish,'' he
insisted several times.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid back and forth between the two men left Keyes to complain about
the tone of the debate. ``Is this the kind of pointless squabbling we really
want them to see,'' he said of a television audience watching CNN's broadcast.
The studio audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderator Larry King of CNN made no attempt to interrupt the squabble,
though, as Bush and McCain recited grievances against one another stemming from
several heated weeks of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stunned Bush, the national front-runner, two weeks ago with a
landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary, and South Carolina shapes up as a
pivotal test for the two men. The state votes on Saturday, and recent polls
point to a close contest. Bush runs strongly among registered Republicans in the
surveys, but McCain gains strength from independents, who are permitted to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   There were handshakes all around as Bush, McCain and Keyes took their seats
around King's interview table. And the opening moments of the 90-minute
encounter seemed more a seminar on foreign policy than a debate in the heat of a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   All three men said the United States should build a national anti-ballistic
missile system despite a Cold War-era treaty that forbids it, and called for
tougher treatment of China.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All three of us agree that the president has drug his feet'' on the
anti-ballistic missile system, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush outlined a campaign finance proposal earlier in the day, but McCain,
who has made reform the centerpiece of his campaign, said his rival's plan
wouldn't do enough to stem the influence of big money. King broke in at one
point to ask McCain whether a $1 million contributor would find his phone call
returned. ``Sure, ask any ex-senator, they'll tell you,'' McCain said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain caught Bush in a contradiction on abortion. He noted the Texas
governor supports the Republican platform language on abortion from 1996, a
plank that envisions no exceptions for a ban on abortions. Yet Bush has also
said he favors exceptions for cases of rape, incest and the life of a mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, who opposes all abortions, attacked both men. ``One individual
doesn't really accept the pro-life position of the party, and the other ... says
he supports it and takes a position that is logically inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes also questioned Bush on his visit to Bob Jones University, a school
that has a long-standing ban on interracial dating. He said the Texas governor
accepted applause from his audience, but risked nothing because he refused ``to
raise the issues'' of racial and religious bigotry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I walked in and talked about how our conservative cause must be
compassionate,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said if he had been invited, he would have told his audience: 'Look,
what you're doing in this ban on interracial dating is stupid, it's idiotic and
it is incredibly cruel to many people.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain disagreed over tax cuts, as they have repeatedly, Bush
saying that without his larger cut, money would go to Washington and be spent on
bigger government. McCain has a smaller cut, and sets aside more money for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has attacked Bush's tax cut for providing too much relief for the
wealthy, and said that was precisely the type of criticism that can be expected
from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sounds exactly like Al Gore. See that's what he took offense of when I
talked about Bill Clinton,'' McCain said, linking the issue back to the
controversy over negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   That issue had come up in the first several minutes of the debate, when King
asked Keyes whether the campaign had been ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, complained that Bush's campaign
had paid for an event at which a spokesman for a ``fringe group'' had attacked
him for neglecting veterans. The same man years ago attacked Bush's father, the
former president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if you can understand, this, George, but that really hurt.
That really hurt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah,'' Bush said quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should be ashamed of sponsoring an event with that man there who had
attacked your own father,'' McCain continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The man was not speaking for me ... if you want to know my opinion about
you , John, you served our country strongly and admirably,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he then turned the tables on McCain, noting that one of his supporters,
former Sen. Warren Rudman, had called members of the Christian Coalition bigots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' replied McCain, who did not disavow the
alleged remark.

<HEADLINE> Boeing CEO Talks Tough  </HEADLINE>
    By LUIS CABRERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Striking Boeing engineers will have to make the first call
if they want to return to the bargaining table, company CEO Phil Condit said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Condit called a news conference with other top Boeing managers to say
Boeing's final offer was fair and the striking white-collar employees should
reconsider it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It balanced the interests of our employees with the realities of a highly
competitive global marketplace," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, spoke outside Boeing headquarters as more
than 50 union members walked a picket line and waved to honking motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd be happy to make the call," to come back to the table, Bofferding said.
"But the talks have to be productive."
</P>
<P>
	   He said one of the main sticking points is benefit reductions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's takeaways," he said. "Every offer they've had on the table has had
takeaways."
</P>
<P>
	   Bofferding criticized Condit and the other managers for calling a news
conference rather than reaching out to the union.
</P>
<P>
	   SPEEA represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers at Boeing. The union
went on strike Feb. 9 after federally mediated negotiations over a new contract
broke down.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses similar to those
received by production workers represented by the Machinists union. Boeing has
offered mostly selective pay hikes, reductions in life insurance benefits and
some changes in health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no contract offers currently on the table, and no further talks
have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Condit said the striking workers are losing an estimated $3.4 million in
wages each day. But he declined to estimate how much the strike is costing the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   He said about 25 percent of SPEEA members have remained on the job, but no
planes have been delivered since the beginning of the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has missed its deadlines for six scheduled deliveries, but
Condit said the planes are not technically late, since deliveries are tallied by
the month.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fugitive Caught in Wyoming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSK, Wyo. (AP) -- The search for a Texas survivalist wanted in the killing
of a farmer and the wounding of two law officers in Nebraska ended late Tuesday
when the fugitive was wrestled to the ground after entering a couple's home.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Lannis Moses Jr., accused of shooting two Nebraska police officers
on Saturday and gunning down a farmer on Monday, had outrun authorities in the
hills just over the Nebraska-Wyoming state line.
</P>
<P>
	   He was caught around 8:40 p.m. after entering a farmhouse, where a couple
wrestled a firearm away from him and called police, Sgt. Troy McLees of the
Wyoming State Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moses, a 31-year-old construction worker, was not injured in the
confrontation but he was taken to a hospital for injuries he suffered in a
shootout with Nebraska officers on Saturday night, McLees said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wasn't going to last very long, he had to get of there,'' McLees said.
It's pretty cold and windy down there.''
</P>
<P>
	   A first-degree murder warrant was issued for Moses on Tuesday, a day after a
western Nebraska farmer was shot to death. Authorities, already searching for
Moses after the shootout Saturday, found Moses in Wyoming on Tuesday afternoon,
but he managed to escape in the remote, hilly area.
</P>
<P>
	   The search had shifted to eastern Wyoming from western Nebraska. In the
Paxton, Neb., area, military helicopters were called in Tuesday and schools
closed as more than 100 state troopers searched for Moses. Paxton is about 150
miles southeast of Lusk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns declared a state of emergency, which allowed the
guard to use two unarmed Blackhawk helicopters in the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer Robert Sedlacek, 48, was found shot to death near an abandoned
farmhouse eight miles from Paxton. Police believe Moses had been hiding out on
the farm and killed Sedlacek to steal his pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Sedlacek was speaking with his father-in-law, Paul Fisher, on a cell phone
and said he noticed unusual tire tracks on the property, Keith County Attorney
Deborah Gilg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said his last words with Sedlacek were to warn his son-in-law about
the fugitive. ``I heard him say, `What are you doing here?' and the phone went
dead,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The manhunt started late Saturday when a sheriff's deputy tried to arrest
Moses on Texas charges of theft and evading arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In a shootout with about two dozen officers who chased him in his truck,
Moses allegedly wounded one in the abdomen and another in the hand. He escaped
into the night on icy rural roads because his pickup had no tail lights, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a survivalist. He goes for camping equipment and weapons,'' said Gary
Studebaker, a chief sheriff's deputy in Nocona, Texas. ``Ninety-nine percent of
the time he always runs. He's good at it.''

    HOUSTON (AP) -- Shandon Anderson scored 25 points, including eight in the
fourth period, to lead the Houston Rockets to a 107-102 victory over the Detroit
Pistons on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Rockets leading 79-74 going into the fourth period, Anderson scored
six points in the first 3 1/2 minutes to help Houston take a 89-79 lead with
8:31 left.
</P>
<P>

13 for Houston. Kelvin Cato grabbed 13 rebounds.

<P>
	   Jerry Stackhouse led Detroit with 29 points, followed by Grant Hill with 23
and Lindsay Hunter with 19.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing by 14 at the half, Detroit cut its deficit to five, 79-74,
going into the final quarter. Stackhouse had 11 third-quarter points.

outscored the Pistons 28-22 to take a 55-41 advantage at the half.
</P>
<P>
	   A 3-point shot by Mobley gave Houston a 40-25 lead with 7:20 left in the

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Sharpe Visits Busy Ravens  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GINSBURG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens aren't worried about the
middle linebacker spot -- yet. For now, they're more concerned about filling
other positions on the team, primarily tight end.
</P>
<P>
	   Free agent Shannon Sharpe visited the Ravens training complex Tuesday and
spoke at length with director of pro personnel Ozzie Newsome and head coach
Brian Billick. Sharpe on Monday had dinner with Ravens officials after flying up
from Atlanta on owner Art Modell's private plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Modell was in Atlanta to testify at the bond hearing of linebacker Ray
Lewis, who faces murder charges in connection with two deaths last month. The
Ravens have yet to react to the possibility that they might need a new middle
linebacker in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "The judicial process will take care of that," Newsome said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ravens entered the offseason intent upon adding a quality tight end to
an offense that in 1999 relied too heavily on outside receivers Qadry Ismail,
Justin Armour and Patrick Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg DeLong led Baltimore tight ends with 13 catches for a mere 52 yards.
Aaron Pierce had 11 receptions for 102 yards before being placed on injured
reserve Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ravens met with Miami tight end Troy Drayton on Monday and expect to
host Andrew Glover on Wednesday. Glover, a nine-year veteran, was released by
the Minnesota Vikings last week in a cost-cutting move.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ravens also hope to interview free agent tight ends Ben Coates and
Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still accumulating all the information we can get," Newsome said. "No
decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe had his 1999 season cut short by a broken collarbone. He is Denver's
career leader in receptions (552) and receiving yards (6,983). He also is one of
only four tight ends in NFL history to have at least 6,000 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
	   He would fit well in the Ravens' offense, which lacked a short to
intermediate passing game last season. But Sharpe has said he would prefer to
stay in Denver, and his agent suggested that Sharpe would take less money to
return to the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Demoff said he believes Denver will offer Sharpe about 90 percent of
what other teams would offer. Sharpe is looking for a three-year deal worth
about $3 million per season, but might be willing to take closer to $2.7
million, based on Demoff's figures.
</P>
<P>
	   In comments televised on Denver stations Tuesday night, Sharpe said his trip
to Baltimore "went real well. I'm very impressed, and I like coach Billick. So
now it's just a process of going back home and just waiting and seeing."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked how many teams were on his short list, Sharpe replied: "Just two."
Asked if he meant the Ravens and the Broncos, he said yes and moved away
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ravens last weekend reached agreement with defensive end Rob Burnett on
a four-year, $14 million. Burnett had 81 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks with Baltimore
last season.

<HEADLINE> McCain Flier Derides Bush Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The flier that George W. Bush waved at Sen. John McCain
during the debate Tuesday says the Texas governor's plans will leave a $3
billion deficit in Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George Bush's plan will threaten Social Security for our seniors! John
McCain's plan protects Social Security for our people!'' the flier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said the flier had turned up on a car windshield earlier in the day.
During the debate, McCain denied that the flier came from his campaign, but he
later reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That could have been put out last week before we stopped all ads,'' the
senator said.
</P>
<P>
	   The flier compares McCain's ``responsible'' plan for Social Security with
Bush, who ``squanders the entire surplus on tax cuts targeted to the wealthiest
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also compares the two candidates regarding education and special
interests, accusing Bush of rejecting campaign finance reform and wanting to
turn education over to ``Washington educrats.'' The flier encourages people to
vote for McCain in the South Carolina primary Saturday to ``keep our Social
Security system sound and secure.''

	   The South Carolina primary will be followed closely by voting in Arizona and
Michigan next Tuesday, a Virginia primary on Feb. 29 and a multi-state primary a
week later, including New York and California, as the competition for convention
delegates quickly escalates. McCain claimed a California convert during the

abandoning his earlier endorsement of Bush and would be backing the Arizona

saying that without his larger cut, money would go to Washington and be spent on
bigger government. McCain has a smaller cut, and sets aside more money for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has attacked Bush's tax cut for providing too much relief for the
wealthy, and said that was precisely the type of criticism that can be expected
from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sounds exactly like Al Gore. See that's what he took offense of when I
talked about Bill Clinton,'' McCain said, linking the issue back to the
controversy over negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   That issue had come up in the first several minutes of the debate, when King
asked Keyes whether the campaign had been ``dirty.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, complained that Bush's campaign
had paid for an event at which a spokesman for a ``fringe group'' had attacked
him for neglecting veterans. The same man years ago attacked Bush's father, the
former president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know if you can understand, this, George, but that really hurt.
That really hurt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah,'' Bush said quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You should be ashamed of sponsoring an event with that man there who had
attacked your own father,'' McCain continued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The man was not speaking for me ... if you want to know my opinion about
you , John, you served our country strongly and admirably,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he then turned the tables on McCain, noting that one of his supporters,
former Sen. Warren Rudman, had called members of the Christian Coalition bigots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' replied McCain, who did not disavow the
alleged remark.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Award Cardinal Medal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Tuesday to award an ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor the Congressional Gold Medal, the body's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
	   The longtime leader of the New York Archdiocese's 2.4 million Roman
Catholics recently turned 80 and had surgery last fall to remove a brain tumor.
He is expected to retire as soon as Pope John Paul II appoints a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   The House voted 413-1 to give the award to O'Connor. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
was the lone opponent. Paul said he has great respect for the cardinal but
opposed the $30,000 it would cost to mint the medal.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the House voted 410-1 to give a Congressional Gold Medal to
``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz, who died in his sleep Saturday. The
77-year-old cartoonist's last strip featuring Snoopy and the gang was published
in Sunday's papers. Paul also cast the only dissenting vote for the Schulz
medal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate is expected to approve both honors next month.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters that O'Connor was
being ``justifiably honored'' and insisted the award was not an attempt to
appease Catholics upset by a flap over the appointment of a new House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   House GOP leaders nominated the Rev. Charles Wright, a Presbyterian
minister, for the $138,000-a-year position even though the Rev. Timothy O'Brien,
a Catholic priest, was the top choice of a bipartisan committee of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Democrats have accused GOP leaders of being anti-Catholic, a charge
they deny. A vote on the nomination is pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Tuesday's vote, lawmakers extolled O'Connor's work on behalf of the
needy, inner-city children, AIDS patients and others. They also spoke of his
leadership in establishing diplomatic ties between the Vatican and Israel and
his years of service as a military chaplain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Cardinal O'Connor is a great man,'' said Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y.,
who nominated O'Connor for the medal. ``Soldiers, priests and parishioners know
in their hearts that the cardinal has always been a man of the people.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, O'Connor, the oldest active bishop in the United States
and a close ally of the pope, drawing criticism over the years for denouncing
homosexuality, premarital sex and birth control.
</P>
<P>
	   He also has not been averse to mixing politics and religion for causes he
believes in. In 1990, he wrote that anyone ``advocating legislation supporting
abortion, or by making public funds available for abortion ... must be warned
that they are at risk of excommunication.'' The warning was a slap at Catholic
abortion rights supporters such as Geraldine Ferraro and then-Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has had many critics,'' acknowledged Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``But
from the beginning of life to the very cessation of life, Cardinal O'Connor was
consistent in his belief that all deserved justice under the law and as much
human love as mankind was capable of.''
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor served as a chaplain in the Navy and Marines for 27 years and saw
combat in Korea. He was named bishop in Scranton, Pa., in 1983 and has led the
Archdiocese of New York since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor offered his resignation on his 75th birthday, as the church
requires, but the pope did not accept it. Cardinals lose their power to vote for
a new pope when they turn 80.
</P>
<P>
	   After an absence last year due to surgery and radiation treatments, O'Connor
is back celebrating Sunday Mass at New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. His frail
condition has made it hard for him to stand and he delivers the homily from a
chair.

<HEADLINE> Westminster Dog Show Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By MARGARET LILLARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gwen DeMilta's dog wasn't distracted by the noise and the
crowds at the Westminister Kennel Club Show. The Doberman had found something a
lot more interesting: the dried chunks of liver stuffed squirrel-like in
DeMilta's cheeks.
</P>
<P>
	   DeMilta used the meat-in-the-mouth trick to get Trevor's undivided
attention. And Trevor, the nation's top-ranked Doberman pinscher, was positively
hypnotized by the sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,600 dogs in 156 breeds and varieties competed Monday and Tuesday at
the nation's most prestigious dog competition. But it can be almost as
entertaining to watch the tricks performed by the humans to make their dogs look
their best.
</P>
<P>
	   In the staging area at Madison Square Garden, the air buzzes with the sound
of hair dryers and clippers. Handlers wield squeeze bottles of water and metal
combs to tame last-minute dog hair disasters.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-haired breeds such as poodles, shih tzus and spaniels are kept with
their hair tucked in curlers, pins or even doggy snoods until they head for the
competition ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Even there, handlers primp whenever the judges' backs are turned, using
silver show combs to capture stray hair, or a towel to mop up mastiff slobber.
</P>
<P>
	   When the handlers show off their animals, they match their strides to the
gallop of a Great Dane or the dainty trot of a Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
	   And they console and cajole and bribe their dogs with treats and toys --
anything to draw out the sparkling personality that can set a dog apart from the
pack.
</P>
<P>
	   As DeMilta tried to calm Trevor with liver treats, her daughter had
different tricks to get her own Doberman, Edna, to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ee-ee-EE! Ee-ee-EE!'' Carissa DeMilta squeaked as the dog aimed her pointy
ears at the ceiling. ``Edna! Ee-EE!''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Trevor won an award of merit, which is similar to an honorable
mention. On Tuesday night, the highest award -- best of show -- was presented to
Samantha, an English springer spaniel owned by Carl Blain and Fran Sunseri of
Sacramento, Calif. Samantha is the 5 1/2-year-old daughter of 1993 top dog
Salilyn's Condor
</P>
<P>
	   The dog handler's guidance is critical at a show like Westminster, where
there are big crowds and lots of distractions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes it's hard if the dog hasn't been here before because it's very
chaotic with the people crowding in,'' 17-year-old Carissa DeMilta said. ``You
have to try to make the dog feel it's doing what it wants to do, trying to keep
its attention away from other things.''
</P>
<P>
	   Liver treats were popular among the Doberman handlers. Carissa DeMilta held
a bit of food in her hand to get Edna's attention. Other handlers flicked bits
ahead of their dogs or waved a treat in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Most avoided Gwen DeMilta's in-the-mouth technique.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a nervous habit,'' said DeMilta, a professional trainer for 22 years
who lives in Downingtown, Pa. ``I need to get to it quick -- don't want it
getting stuck in my pocket. It tastes pretty awful.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics 101, Jazz 99  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Kenny Anderson scored 19 of his 33 points in the
fourth quarter as the Celtics beat the Utah Jazz 101-99 on Tuesday night,
Boston's first victory over Utah since Larry Bird's playing days.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Pierce scored 20 and made two free throws with 1:03 remaining to give
the Celtics a 99-96 lead. Anderson hit four free throws in the final 16.4
seconds as Boston snapped a 14-game losing streak to the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
	   The Celtics last beat Utah in 1991-92, Bird's final season. The victory also
was Boston's first in Salt Lake City since January 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Antoine Walker added 19 points for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone, well-rested after playing only three minutes in Sunday's
All-Star game, led Utah with 32 points. Howard Eisley added 19, Jeff Hornacek
had 13 and John Stockton scored 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz forced a final chance when Bryon Russell, who hit a 3-pointer with
2.9 seconds left, intercepted Boston's inbounds pass and called timeout with two
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell inbounded to Stockton, whose running scoop shot from 10 feet bounced
off the close side of the rim as the horn sounded.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Ship Evacuated Off Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COZUMEL, Mexico (AP) -- Some 750 passengers, mostly Canadians, were forced to
abandon the cruise ship Carousel after running over rocks, seriously damaging a
propeller and causing an oil leak, Mexican authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The damage was done early Sunday, shortly after the ship pulled away from
the port of Calica on this Caribbean island, 40 miles south of the popular
resort city Cancun, according to a report distributed by Mexican maritime
authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   About eight hours later, the crew noticed the damage and ended the cruise,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Small boats were sent out to the ship, owned by the British company
Airtours, to ferry passengers and their luggage back to the island. They were
then taken to Cancun airport and flown to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   A company spokesman said passengers would be offered a cruise on another
boat or their money back.
</P>
<P>
	   The damage to the bottom of the boat caused a 50-ton spill, and
contamination has been detected along surrounding beaches, port spokesman
Fernando Valencia said.

Taxes, Abortion Hot Topics at Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- In their final clash before the pivotal South
Carolina primary, John McCain, George W. Bush and Alan Keyes sparred over
negative campaigning, abortion and taxes. McCain stunned Bush, the national
front-runner, two weeks ago with a landslide victory in New Hampshire's primary,
and South Carolina shapes up as a pivotal test for the two men. The state votes
on Saturday, and recent polls point to a close contest. Bush runs strongly among
registered Republicans in the surveys, but McCain gains strength from
independents, who are permitted to vote.

Private Co. To Help Keep Mir Alive
</SUBHEAD>

	   LONDON (AP) -- A Bermuda-registered company said Tuesday it has reached an
agreement to lease Russia's Mir space station in a last-ditch effort to keep the
orbiting platform alive. MirCorp, which was formed in December, already has paid
$20 million to $30 million to the station to keep it up in space at least
through the summer, said its president, Jeffrey Manber. He said another $40
million would need to be raised to keep the station afloat through the end of
the year and beyond. Mir has been flying without a crew since August, and
heavily indebted Russia had said it would abandon the station next month unless
private investors came up with funding.
