<HEADLINE> New Continental Bridge Brings Asia and Europe Closer  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the trans-continental rail opened to traffic in 1992,
China, Japan, ROK and several international organizations on both
continents have shown great interest in its development.
</P>
<P>
The UN Development Program, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have volunteered to provide funds and applied to
participate in the rail's development.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations has discussed
cooperation regarding cross-border trade many times. The European
Union developed a plan to build a Europe-Kavkaz-Asia transport
corridor last year, and Japan has presented its design for a Silk
Road in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Ma Hong, a well-known Chinese economist, predicted that the
Euro-Asia Continental Bridge would become the most attractive
inland trade corridor in this region, and would re-create the
prosperity of the ancient Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
To raise the rail's capacity, China has signed agreements with
Kazakhstan, Russia, ROK, Japan, Poland and italy for its
development and cross-border trade.
</P>
<P>
A fiber-optics cable linking nearly 20 countries will be
completed early next year, paving way for the economic cooperation
among countries along the rail.
</P>
<P>
China has invested 13 billion yuan in the rail's construction
over the past few years. About 70 percent of the 1,767-km-long
Lianyungang-Urumqi railway line has been mostly converted into
double-track lines. Of the 68 highway trunk roads in the country,
38 connect with the continental bridge, said Li Ruikun, an
official from the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to invest an additional amount in the rail's
construction and technological transformation in the next five to
15 years, and to build a highway road between Lianyungang and
Horgos, in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
before the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Entering New Fiscal Year With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is entering the new
fiscal year starting July 1 at a juncture when the national
economy exhibits mixed trends.
</P>
<P>
The overall economic situation during the 1995-96 fiscal year
improved significantly with the most prominent feature being the
strong upsurge in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate
from 4.4 percent in 1994-95 to 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly due to the increased buoyancy in the agriculture
sector which grew by 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale manufacturing sector, which makes up about half
of the GDP, however, has failed to show signs of recovery with a
low growth rate of about three percent as against the six percent
targeted for the year.
</P>
<P>
Another positive development for the outgoing fiscal year is
the increase in private investment from eight to nine percent of
the GDP. The bulk of the increase is in electricity and gas and
large-scale manufacturing which is badly needed by Pakistan during
its course of industrialization.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic performance in the current fiscal year
also reveals a number of major shortcomings and some failures to
meet planned targets.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit for 1995-96, which had been expected to be
brought down to 4.6 percent of the GDP following agreement with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and taxation measures,
remains about 5.5 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The higher than expected budget deficit is due to increases in
costs of debt servicing and as well as subsidies, especially after
the devaluation of the local currency and the apparent inability
of the Central Board of Revenue to achieve even the reduced target
for revenues.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Pakistani government was optimistic
that, with inflation coming down substantially, the target of 9.5
percent would be achieved. But due to noticeable increases in some
of the major consumer goods, the year has ended with a double
digit inflation rate of close to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another adverse feature emerging this year is a rapidly rising
imbalance in the external sector. The out-going fiscal year will
close with a trade deficit of about three billion dollars while
the current account deficit may approach 4.5 billion dollars,
equivalent to over six percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the rising trade deficit is a rapid growth
in imports, lower than the target growth in exports, and the
decline in remittances. Imports in 1995-96 have increased by about
19 percent in dollars terms.
</P>
<P>
Exports in dollar terms, on the other hand, have grown by six
percent. The bulk of the growth is due to the increase in the
export value of raw cotton. Other exports, however, registered a
seven percent decline.
</P>
<P>
In view of the state of the economy, the Pakistani government
has proposed budgetary measures for 1996-97 to reduce the
inflationary pressure, accelerate growth and slash dependence on
domestic as well as external borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue the multi-dimentional financial
approach aimed at arresting inflation trends.
</P>
<P>
To achieve an economic growth rate of 6.3 percent, Pakistan
will still have to put much reliance on the performance of the
agriculture sector, of which, cotton is the largest contributor in
terms of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, agriculture, which relies heavily on weather for
output increases, is believed to be the weakest link in Pakistan's
economy. The output of this sector, therefore, is unpredictable,
especially in view of the aging irrigation systems, inadequate and
delayed supplies of farm inputs and the small scale of farming.
</P>
<P>
The government faces a major problem in the new fiscal year of
raising the output, imposing tax on agricultural income and
implementing the decisions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another tough task facing the government is to
reduce the overall fiscal deficit from five to four percent of the
GDP as demanded by the IMF in order to continue the agreement of
standby loans.
</P>
<P>
The government has vowed to reduce the reliance on the bank
borrowing, thus curtailing the alarming increase in the debt
servicing, to which a staggering 37 percent of the budget outlay
has been allocated in the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Facing the great challenges ahead, the government of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto has little choice but to impose a tougher
budget, which has been termed the "bitter medicine" for the
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic has handed over power to his deputy, Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"An official document of the Bosnian Serb republic under which
Mr Karadzic is replaced as functioning President by Mrs Biljana
Plavsic has been handed to me," said a statement of the
international community's High Representative to Bosnia, Carl
Bildt, issued in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"The document is signed and sealed by Mr Karadzic. It takes
legal effect from today (June 30). There are no conditions of
any sort associated with his replacement.
</P>
<P>
"As from today Mr Karadzic cannot exercise any public functions
or public powers as President in Republika Srpska."
</P>
<P>
"It is immediately illegal for any public official or
institution to accept decisions by, or instructions from, Mr
Karadzic or persons acting on his behalf," the statement reads.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said he would closely follow the development of the
situation in Bosnia to see whether the Serb leader has really
relinquished power.
</P>
<P>
Bildt threatened Friday to reimpose sanctions on Belgrade or
the Bosnian Serbs if Karadzic did not resign by July 1.

<HEADLINE> Law Code to Protect the Private Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Legislators in the capital of
south China's Guangdong Province have formed the country's first
local law code that proposes to protect the rights and interests
of private enterprises owners.
</P>
<P>
The code, or the Regulations on the Protection of the Rights
and Interests of Private Enterprises in Guangzhou City, was passed
during a recent session of the city's 10th People's Congress, and
granted private enterprises the same legal status as the
state-owned and collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the property and assets of private
enterprises are legally protected, and employees of these
enterprises who commit crimes such as bribery or embezzling will
be punished according to the country's "Corporation Law."
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates that private enterprises have the
right to receive loans from local banks, to purchase state-owned
and collective enterprises, and to obtain land-use rights.
</P>
<P>
Also, owners and employees of these enterprises are given the
rights to participate in any judgement on titles of technical
and professional posts, and to compete equally for any honorable
titles with those employees of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has seen a boom in its private economy over the past
few years. The city has had 16,400 private enterprises and 192,000
individually-run businesses whose output value topped one billion
yuan (about 120 million US dollars) in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, a growing number of private enterprises are often
victims of corporate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets Deadline for Surrendering Weapons, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities has set August
12 as the deadline for citizens to surrender their unregistered
weapons and ammunition, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati as
saying that the decision to collect the firearms and ammunition was
made by the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).
</P>
<P>
Besharati said those who hold illegal firearm can step forward
and surrender them to low enforcement agencies without facing
charges.
</P>
<P>
He said that the holders would receive receipts upon
surrendering their arms, and those meeting the qualifications
required can apply for and receive licenses.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, the holders must meet the deadline of
August 12 to be eligible for the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline, those who were found of possessing weapons
illegally will be penalized and receive prison sentences ranging
from three to 10 years, he said,
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said a considerable amount of firearms
ended up in the public's hands during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei made the first order in
February this year, asking all Iranians who are in possession of
weaponry to surrender while offering amnesty to those who are
pursued for smuggling of arms in the country.
</P>
<P>
Those who turn in their weapons voluntarily would not be
prosecuted and are given amnesty, according to the order.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Iraq war brought about the proliferation of arms
smuggling in Iran. Arms are both smuggled in and out of Iran
through Iran's border with Iraq's Kurdish area.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons produced by Iran's defense industries are said to
be smuggled outside of the country because of corruption and poor
management in government bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
Sources here say that arms smuggling has always gone hand
in hand with narcotic trade. Iran's drug dealers are said to have
the state-of-the-art weaponry and have on occasion overwhelmed
Iranian anti-narcotic squads with their superior firepower.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of arms into the country is also attributed to
the People's Mojahedin of Iran (PMOI), a main armed opposition
against Tehran government.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials themselves have become the target of the
weapons and ammunition that are available in arms black
market. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani narrowly escaped a
shot in 1994 while addressing a crowd at the mausoleum of late
religious leader Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei was injured and his right hand was forever paralyzed
as a tape record filled with explosives went off while he was
addressing a group of worshipers at a mosque in 1981.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
determined to resuscitate the textile industry with a loan of 45
million US Dollars from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Deputy Minister for Commerce, Trade and
Industry Alfred Lienda here today.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan would be made available to textile
manufacturers to borrow at low interest rates to recapitalize
their industry which had collapsed due to competition from
imports, according to Lienda.
</P>
<P>
Lienda said that the problem textile manufacturers had faced
was aged machinery which made them unable to compete with
imports.
</P>
<P>
"We are now providing capital on the market to resuscitate the
textile industry," Lienda said, adding that between 3,000 and
4,000 jobs were expected to be created when the industry were
recapitalized.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government would concentrate on job creation as
the drought which had diverted attention had ended, Lienda said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Invites Opposition Party to Join </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina today
invited the largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
to join her government of national consensus if they wanted to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big rally organized by her ruling Awami League
(AL), Hasina said, "certain quarter is trying to ridicule this
government of national consensus. I call upon the BNP to join the
government if they want so. We do not politicize and we do not
believe in the concept of monopolizing everything."
</P>
<P>
Addressing tens of thousands of AL supporters, Hasina gave an
overall outline of the policies of her new government to establish
a terrorism and corruption free country and ensure the welfare of
the people.
</P>
<P>
In the 7th parliamentary elections on June 12, the AL defeated
the ex-ruling party BNP by winning 146 seats against 116 seats,
and formed the new government on June 23.
</P>
<P>
"Under article 7 of the constitution, people are the only
owners of the republic. Therefore, this government is compelled to
be accountable to the people," Hasina said, adding that the
parliament would be the focal point of all activities and the
government will be accountable to the people through parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hasina noted that she had already asked the ministers and MPs
to "work with self-purification." "The people would not forgive
any one, if indulged in corruption, like the leaders of the past
governments," she warned.

<HEADLINE> Israel Threatens to Use Force against PLO Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani warned today that force could be used to stop
Palestinian political activities in the Orient House, Palestine
Liberation Organization's office in East Jerusalem, Israel
Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office announced today that Kahalani has
been put in charge of a committee that will monitor activities in
the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani said the law barring activities in Jerusalem on the
part of the Palestinian Authority (PA) is clear-cut and police
jeep and roadblocks will be used to prevent foreign diplomatic
visits to the Orient House when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Israel would make clear to the
Palestinians that diplomatic visits to the Orient House would be
seen as a violation of the peace accord and would not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy also said today that the PA should
abide by the peace agreement which bars PA activities in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Israel's problem not lie in the existence
of the Orient House, rather than activities linking the PA.
</P>
<P>
But FaisaL Husseini, member of PLO Executive Committee in
charge of the Jerusalem affairs, has repeatedly denied that the
activities in the Orient House have anything to do with the PA.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that the Orient House has been a venue used for
hosting activities linked with the peace process ever since the
Madrid Middle Peace Conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Likud vowed to shut down the Orient House during the
election campaign. But the new Israeli government appears to be
backing down from the position, taking a wait-and-see
approach instead.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Final Statement of G-7 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today welcomed the final
statement adopted by Group of Seven leaders at their annual summit
in Lyon Saturday, but it regretted the summit's failure
to endorse Palestinians' call for an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The world's seven industrialized countries and Russia, in the
statement, called for a revival of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations
on the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa termed the statement as
"positive," saying that it helps clarify the stances of the
international community as well as political and economic powers.
</P>
<P>
These powers are backing the principle of land for peace, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority (PA) to promote development and called on
all aid donors to fulfil their pledges to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On the statement's failure to address the issue of Palestinian
statehood and its avoidance of mentioning Israeli plans to expand
Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab lands, Moussa said that this
"does not negate the fact that the establishment of a Palestinian
state is a necessary condition for realizing durable and
comprehensive peace."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel
would not return more captured Arab lands, indicating that
he would not stick to the land-for-peace principle. Arab states
have urged Netanyahu to change his hard-line policy on the
Arab-Israeli peace process.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Not TO Compromise Sovereignty for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have called for
increasing foreign investment in the continent but they would not
compromise sovereignty for investment.
</P>
<P>
The leaders attending the international conference on reviving
private investment in Africa held in Ghana said they wanted
investors to come as partners instead of masters, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders include Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Sam
Nujoma of Namibia, and Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali as well as
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Prime Minister
Daniel Duncan of Cote D'ivoire, who participated in a summit on
the private sector during the conference in Accra, capital of
Ghana.

Ethiopia Kassu Ellala and special representative of the President
of Tunisia, Bebacar Toufik.
</P>
<P>
Calling on foreign investors to appreciate the peculiar
problems of various African countries, the leaders said that most
of the countries in the continent have carried out necessary
reforms and wondered why foreign investors were reluctant to
reciprocate by investing in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that African countries appreciated the need for
political stability and democracy and the need to open up their
economies for investment.
</P>
<P>
Ghanian President Jerry Rawlings urged foreign investors to
set aside prejudices and make investment in the continent.

The leaders expressed the hope that Africa will become a
leading emerging market from the first quarter of the next

especially in the areas of tariff, foreign exchange control,
trade liberalization and bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> More Than 5 Million Americans In Prison System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Almost three out of every 100
American adults were in prison or on probation or parole in 1995,
according to a study of U.S. Justice Department released today.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Justice Statistics said there were a total of 5.3
million Americans in U.S. prison system last year, 2.8 percent of
American adults.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, there were 3 million people on probation at the
end of the year, up by 4 percent during the year; 700,000 on
parole, up by 1 percent; and nearly 1.6 million in federal, state
and local jails, up by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said that since 1980 the total number under
correctional supervision had almost tripled, from 1.84 million to
5.36 million, with an average annual growth rate of 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study, which focused on the probation and parole
populations, found that the numbers in those two categories was up
by 3.2 percent in 1995, slightly down from the average 3.4 percent
growth rate increase since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Won't Re-negotiate EU-UK Beef Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has ruled out
any re-negotiation of the package of measures to end the European
Union's (EU) global ban on British beef exports during its
six-month EU presidency which starts today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Times newspaper, Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring said that the EU-UK deal to lift the British
beef ban would remain in force, regardless of mounting pressure on
the British Conservative government from Euro-sceptics within the
party.
</P>
<P>
Spring, also Deputy Prime Minister, made it clear: "If people
try to unravel that package -- given the hostility in Europe and
the difficulties there were putting this package together -- you
would reopen the crisis again."
</P>
<P>
He stressed although there were "dangers" in implementing the
BSE or mad cow disease eradication measures, Ireland intends
keeping the plan on course during its EU presidency so as to
achieve a gradual lifting of the total ban.
</P>
<P>
At the EU summit in Florence, Italy, last month Britain dropped
its non-cooperation policy with the EU after its partners agreed a
deal to gradually lift the ban, which included increasing the
slaughter of cattle at risk from BSE.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on March 27 when the British
government admitted a possible link between the so-called mad cow
disease and its human equivalent Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Yaohan Headquarters In Shanghai Goes Into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters for Japan's
Yaohan International Group, recently moved from Hong Kong to
Shanghai, opened today.
</P>
<P>
Thus Yaohan became one of the first overseas consortiums to
move its headquarters to the mainland since China initiated the
policy of opening to the outside world in late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Kazuo Wada, president of the Yaohan group, said that his group
plans to vigorously pursue a strategy with China as the focus of
its operations.
</P>
<P>
Yaohan plans to open 1,000 chain supermarkets and 100 goods
exhibition and distribution centers by the year 2005 in fourteen
coastal and major cities in China, including Shanghai, Wuxi,
Jinan, Beijing and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Yaohan currently has 20 chain supermarkets in Shanghai and
Wuxi. It also has production plants for food, toilet paper,
cosmetics, packaging materials and clothing in Shanghai, Wuxi,
Suzhou and some other cities, which soon will go into operation.
</P>
<P>
A well-known international business group, Yaohan recorded
sales of 4.5 billion US dollars last year, of which 1.3 billion
were realized in China, including Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the group's sales volume is expected to reach 13
billion US dollars, of which 6.5 billion will come from China.
</P>
<P>
"China's reform and opening policy has achieved great success,
with high speed attained for both economic growth and improvement
of people's living standards," Kasuo Wada said. "It made me change
my initial decision, and start the plan to open 1,000 chain
supermarkets in China five years ahead of the original schedule."
</P>
<P>
The president, who has already moved his home to Pudong, is
confident about his decision. "I never made a wrong prediction. I
believe my decision to move the headquarters to Shanghai will
prove to be right," he said.

LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Tennis veteran Martina
Navratrilova Monday accused world number one Steffi Graf of
faking a knee injury, said a press report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"Steffi Graf could run in the quarter-mile at the
Olympics. The knee injury is just an excuse ahead of time in case
she needs it," said the nine-times Wimbledon singles champion.
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, who is commentating at Wimbledon for the
American HBO television network, told viewers: "If you read the
newspapers you'd think she belongs in the hospital, if you look
at her today she's running like a gazelle."
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, 39, is playing in the mixed doubles with
Jonathan Stark, who partnered her to the title last year. A win
again this year will give Navratilova her 20th Wimbledon title,
equalling Billie Jean King's record.
</P>
<P>
Graf, the favourite to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title,
pulled out of a British tournament at Eastbourne last month
because of a left knee injury incurred during practice.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is to give special emphasis
 to the development and promotion of its tourism industry by
targeting key international tourism markets, King Birendra said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The government will launch programs to upgrade and enlarge
tourism facilities in the country with a view to establishing
Nepal as one major destination for foreign tourists, according to
the king while addressing the parliament on the government's
policy platform for the upcoming 1996-97 fiscal year starting in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will reach agreements with foreign countries to increase
the country's international air links in order to attract more
foreign visitors, the king said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has proposed to allow local private
airlines to operate on international routes, which have been
monopolized by the state-run Royal Nepal Airlines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government had earlier announced that it will
organize a nationwide "visit Nepal year" program in 1998 aimed at
attracting 500,000 foreign tourists. The total number of foreign
tourist arrivals in Nepal is around 350,000 last year.

SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has become an investment
hot spot for transnational firms worldwide, increasing the city's
hunger for more professionals.
</P>
<P>
Job openings for senior staff, written in English, were

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Unemployment Increases In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in the Gaza Strip
now stands at 39.2 percent, in the West Bank 24.3 percent, The
Jerusalem Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
These figures were disclosed by the head of the Palestinian
Central Statistics Department, Hassan Abu Libdeh, quoting a recent
survey conducted in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Abu Libdeh said that the Palestinian Authority must find
111,000 work openings if it wants to keep unemployment under
control and stabilized at 8 percent. But he added that this
is an impossible goal, given the overall unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
Other significant results from the survey indicate that the
percentage of laborers who work in Israel has fallen from 16
percent last October 1995 to 9 percent in May 1996, while those
who work in public services amount to 54 percent of the total work
force.
</P>
<P>
"This is clear evidence that there is more attention given to
public service than general investment," Abu Libdeh said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Statistics Unit, Lu'ay Shabaneh, held that
this is a negative indicator, revealing as it does the chronic
imbalance in the Palestinian economy between consumption and
production.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of unemployment differs also from one
governorate to another. In east Jerusalem, it is 15 percent, in
Nablus 18 percent, and in Hebron 34 percent. The daily average
wage is 48 shekels (15 U.S. dollars) in the West bank, 39 shekels
(12.2 dollars) in Gaza, and 96 shekels (29.8 dollars) in
Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A new exhibition hall, the Energy
 Efficiency Center, to demonstrate various ways of energy-saving
was opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The center filled with specially designed interactive exhibits
takes up an area of about 500 square meters on the Hong Kong
Science Museum's third floor.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Symposium on Protecting White Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A three-day symposium on
protecting Chinese white dolphins opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Eight overseas dolphin and cetacean specialists, together with
local experts from companies, institutions and government
departments, are to present their theses on the subject.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address, Lawrence Lee, director of Agriculture
 and Fisheries, said that the symposium will focus on issues that
threatened the continued survival of the Chinese white dolphins in
 Hong Kong waters.
</P>
<P>
To give the dolphins a fighting chance of surviving in the
21st century all major threats must be identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the issue came up following the decision to build
 the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. Large scale reclamation and
associated development works had potential impact on these
dolphins whose population was so far little known.
</P>
<P>
A number of research studies and conservation work have been or
 being carried out by the government to help protect these
endangered mammals, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the first two day's talk sessions of the
symposium are to focus on the status of cetacean knowledge, Hong
Kong marine environment, human influences and management aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said that the group discussion on the third day will center
on topics about fishery interactions with human dimensions, water
quality and population issues, dolphin watching, marine traffic
and noise, and habitat loss.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets PM Amid Speculation Over His Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin today, quelling growing
speculation about his health in the run-up to Wednesday's
second-round presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Footage of the meeting was aired on television, showing
Yeltsin's voice was hoarse and seemingly confirming his aides'
explanations that he was resting due to a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who discussed the domestic socio-economic
situation and the second round of presidential poll with Yeltsin,
told the press that the president felt well, though he had a sore
throat.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about Yeltsin's health has been growing after he
was reportedly not seen in public for four days and apparently
cancelled a string of campaign appearances including a major
festival in Moscow on Sunday. He also delayed a meeting with the
presidents of Ukraine and Moldova scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
The president's campaign aide Sergei Filatov said Yeltsin's
meeting today with Chernomyrdin would alleviate people's concerns
over his health.

<HEADLINE> Book on Hong Kong Basic Law Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A new book on the Basic Law of
the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was
published today to mark the 365 day countdown to July 1, 1997 when
 China resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a question-and-answer form, the 200-page book explains the
Basic Law in simple language by going through 167 questions
closely related to Hong Kong residents. More than 100 photos
inside make it easier for readers to understand the concept.
</P>
<P>
Compiled by the Sino United Publishing (Hong Kong) Company
Ltd., the book is the latest in a series aimed at popularizing the
 Basic Law among Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law was drafted in accordance with the concept of
"one country, two systems," set forth by Deng
Xiaoping. Promulgated in 1990 after four-year drafting, it makes
clear a series of fundamental principles and policies the Chinese
government will implement in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Lee Cho Jat, chairman of the Sino United publishing house,
said that everyone living in Hong Kong should get a knowledge of
the Basic Law, which will serve as the constitution of Hong Kong
after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law maps out a blueprint of Hong Kong in various
aspects, ranging from politics to society, economy, legal system
and way of life, said Lee, who is also a member of the Preparatory
 Committee of the future HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He added that only by gaining a good understanding of the Basic
 Law, can Hong Kong people realize the aim of high degree of
autonomy and Hong Kong people running Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
 Branch, attended the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Colonial References Disappearing in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club
removed the word "royal" from its title today when there is
exactly one year left to Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Many other communities and organizations in Hong Kong have
already done away with or are planning to do away with colonial
references in their titles.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Golf Club dropped the "Royal" from its title at
the start of last month, while the Post Office began to replace
the old mailboxes bearing a "crown" with new mailboxes bearing a
"P" sign--the first letter of "post". The Postmaster of Hong Kong
said that by 1997 all of the 800 mailboxes on the streets will be
replaced with new ones.
</P>
<P>
As July 1, 1997 nears day by day, the atmosphere for
celebrating the handover of Hong Kong is increasingly
strong. People are talking about the handover, communities and
social groups are holding various celebrating activities, and all
kinds of titles, insignias and logos with a colonial touch are on
the way of disappearing.
</P>
<P>
A set of new definitive stamps featuring the scene of the Hong
Kong island has been designed in May this year to replace the
current definitive stamps, which bear the portrait of the British
Queen, in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The coins with the Queen's image have been circulating for over
 100 years in Hong Kong. Since 1993, however, they have been
gradually replaced with newly-designed coins bearing "Bauhinia",
the emblem of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Last week some porcelain cups and saucers with colonial prints
were auctioned by Hong Kong's civil service at fairly high
prices. Many people believe that most of those items with colonial
references will become collectors' treasures.

<HEADLINE> China's Missile Troops Modernized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- After 30 years of arduous efforts
and intensive training, China's missile troops not only boast
modern equipment, but also have developed "all-weather" combat
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Since the troops were founded 30 years ago, they have built a
dozen bases with a deployment of different types of missiles using
varying launching methods, said sources from the special army
force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The missile bases, located in the unexplored regions of
plateus, outlying mountains or wild deserts, can be taken as
launching sites for offensive or defensive missiles, and also to
store missiles.
</P>
<P>
Using findings from nearly 1,000 research experiments in
missile manufacturing and military training, the troops have
improved remarkably their emergency response abilities and missile
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the officers in the missile army have
received systematic training at military institutes, or have
studied in colleges or universities, which contributes to the
troops' modernization.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Deplores Japanese Lawmaker's Remarks on Comfort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Foreign Ministry
today expressed deep regret about the absurd remarks made by
Japanese lawmaker Seisuke Okuno that comfort houses were not run
by the Japanese military, but by businessmen during the World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Okuno claimed on June 29 that the sex slaves were engaging in
"commercial activity" and weren't forced to serve in military
brothels during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Okuno's remarks are glossing over and distorting the essence of
the issue, and are "anachronistic," a foreign ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official criticized the Japanese Lower House member's
repeated blunders, saying that they can no longer be overlooked
since they are trampling on the pride of the Korean people,
especially the victims. He said that Japanese history textbooks are
acknowledging that the Japanese military coercion was used to
mobilize the comfort women.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were
recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves - for
the Japanese imperial army as it swept through East and Southeast
Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
Japan's World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The official construed Okuno's remarks to be lamentable attempt
to discourage efforts to establish more friendly ties to successfully
co-host the 2002 World Cup Soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the International Football Federation decided in
Zurich, Switzerland, that South Korea and Japan will jointly host
the World Cup football finals in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Raises Retail Prices of Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Retail grain prices for urban
residents in the Chinese capital were raised today, according to
the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The price of rice has been raised from 2.80 yuan to 3.10 yuan
per kg. Flour has gone from 2.14 yuan to 2.74 yuan per kg.
</P>
<P>
Prices of flour products, such as noodles and steamed bread --
staples for Beijing residents -- will also be raised about 0.4 yuan
per kg.
</P>
<P>
The price hike was in response to the State Council's recent
decision to raise purchasing and retail prices of grain this year,
the local government announced in a circular.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, decided to
raise purchasing prices of grain this year to encourage greater
output of grain.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices have to be raised to meet the government's heavy
investment in grain subsidy, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government injected more than 700 million
yuan in 1995 to subsidize grain purchasing. The figure is expected
to reach 1.2 billion yuan this year if the retail prices remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the welfare of low-income families, the government
has provided living allowances to households whose per capita
income is lower than 170 yuan per month.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 million yuan have been handed out to 144,000
workers with financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Each student in Beijing's colleges, universities and technical
secondary schools will receive an additional seven yuan in monthly
food allowances.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be taken to stabilize grain prices and ensure
grain supply, according to the municipal government.

<HEADLINE> No Close to Textile Industry, Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
harare, july 1 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira today appealed to the textile
industry not to rush into liquidation as the government is
"trying hard" to make the sector viable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Monday's press reports that fashion industrial
holdings, owners of Julie Whyte Dresses and Sreentone Private
Ltd, were being placed under provisional liquidation, putting
about 2,000 jobs on the line, the minister said, "that's
unfortunate, the private sector should not do that."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very hard to assist the textile industry.
That's the whole point why we are having discussions with South
Africa on high tariffs and the reason why the minister of finance
announced a new tariff regime for imports last week," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's clothinbg and textile industry has been crippled by
cheap imports as well as punitive duties on exports to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 workers at Cone Textiles also lost their jobs when
the company was liquidated about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe told a recent central committee
meeting of his ruling ZANU PF party that the rate at which Zimbabwe's
manufacturing industries were closing called for immediate the
government intervention.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Of Computers Sold In Shanghai Fails Quality Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the computers
sold in Shanghai failed to meet quality standards, according to a
recent spot test of computers conducted by the city's quality
control authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Technological Supervision Bureau checked
computers of 53 computer models above the 486 level, made by 53
manufacturers. This number covers more than 95 percent of the
local computer market. Only 22, or 41.5 percent of the 53 models,
met quality standards.
</P>
<P>
Popular domestic brand-name computers such as the Legend, and
the Great Wall passed the spot test, and some imported models also
rated high.
</P>
<P>
Most of the low-quality computers were assembled with
components, according to test findings, and many of the
manufacturers are unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
These businesses tend to use low-priced, low-quality components
to cut back costs, which results in sub-standard products, the
test showed.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Exports in June Grow at Slowest Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's exports in June
stood at 11.47 billion U.S. dollars, up only two percent from
the same month last year, according to tentative trade figures
for the month released by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry here today.
</P>
<P>
The two-percent increase last month was the slowest since
exports declined 1.2 percent in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor exports, which account for 18 percent of all
exports, plummeted 23.8 percent in June as prices fell 60 percent
from a year earlier. This, together with the 38 percent decline
in steel and 8 percent in petrochemical products, was responsible
for the lackluster increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import growth rate also slowed to 1.7 percent in
June from 2.7 percent in May, 4.5 percent in April, 3.9 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
June's 1.7-percent import growth rate was also the slowest
since October 1993 when imports declined 3.2 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Slower import growth vis-a-vis export growth reduced the trade
deficit by 24 million U.S. dollars from a year earlier to 563 million
U.S. dollars for the month, the second lowest month so far for this
year following March's 388 million U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Repeats Refusal of Holding Multilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz reiterated here today his country's refusal of holding
multilateral peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a forum on
Euro-Lebanese relations.
</P>
<P>
"The present Israeli policy (of Benjamin Netanyahu's
government) has proved the correctness of the Lebanese position
in boycotting the multilateral talks," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating with Syria, Lebanon has insisted that it will not
take part in multilateral peace negotiations on the problems of
environment, disarmament, refugee, water resource and economic
development before tangible progress is achieved in bilateral
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, he warned Europe of the danger of Israel's
alleged nuclear stations and arsenals that, he said, "constitute
volcanos, which, if explode in the region, will affect European
countries neighboring the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the importance of an economic unity of the Arab
countries and an establishment of a joint Arab market to confront
Israel, Boueiz said that he was not optimistic over achieving such
goals in a "near" future.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the standing rivalries among Arab states have
impeded the establishment of a joint Arab market," adding that the
agreements signed in this regard were not executed.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz expressed the hope that the Arab summit, which was held
in Cairo on June 22-23, would be a "starting point" for the
revival of dialogue among the Arab countries in order to unify
them by an economic agreement, which would prevent anyone of them
from going its own way in the future.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the necessity to negotiate with Europe in order
to crystallize the agreements with them, underlining that any
agreement would be reciprocal instead of favoring one side
against the other.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has demanded Israel to clarify its commitment to a
withdrawal from a 850-square-kilometer border enclave in south
Lebanon which Israel occupied in 1982 and proclaimed as a "security
zone" in 1985, before resuming the deadlocked Lebanese-Israeli
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea to Send Two Cyclists to Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ASMARA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea, Africa's youngest nation,
will send two cyclists to compete in the Atlanta Olympics, the
first Olympic representatives from the Red Sea state.
</P>
<P>
Yonas Zekarias and Bereket Zere left Eritrea recently for
Japan for final training before the Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time Eritrea participates in the Olympic
Games. We don't expect any medals. The cyclists are there only
for the participation," Fessahaie Andemariam, secretary of the
Eritrean Cycling Federation, said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which became independent from Ethiopia in 1991
after 30 years of war, has a proud history of cycling and held
many races in the 1940s and 1960s during Italian and British
administration.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Joins Grassroots Party Members to Mark Party's Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China has the
ability to overcome difficulties and lead the people of the whole
country forward, Premier Li Peng said here today during a seminar
to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, is on an
inspection tour in northeast China's Helongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the socialist cause is now at a low tide
internationally, yet socialism in China has achieved marked
progress and is thriving.
</P>
<P>
The premier attributed the success of socialism in China to
the fact that the Chinese Communist Party has successfully
combined Marxism with the realities of China's revolutionary
practices.
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely from the combination that the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has pushed our cause
forward, has been brought forth" he said.
</P>
<P>
In its history, the Chinese Communist Party made some mistakes
and encountered temporary setbacks and failures, Li said. However,
the Party was not overwhelmed by difficulties; it picked itself up
from difficult conditions by learning lessons from experiences.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of reform and opening up, we inevitably meet
with problems and difficulties. But the Party has the
determination, confidence and the capability to solve the problems
and overcome difficulties and lead the whole nation forward," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our Party members are good, and serve as
models in their work and most of the grassroots organizations of
the Party are strong. That is why our cause can make great
strides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among those speaking at the seminar were local model workers
and Party members, as well as provincial officials.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Hong Kong's History and Development Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale picture exhibition
that illustrates the history and development of Hong Kong and
marks the one-year countdown till its return to the motherland was
held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people crowded outside the Museum of the Chinese
Revolution to attend the exhibit's opening ceremony, which took
place under the huge electronic timer that is ticking off the
seconds until Hong Kong's return to the Chinese mainland on July
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the most comprehensive and systematic display
about Hong Kong that the mainland has sponsored.
</P>
<P>
Works on exhibit show the history of Hong Kong over the past
150 years, including the origin of the Hong Kong issue, the
development of Hong Kong, the connections between the mainland and
Hong Kong, and the settlement of the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was completed after two and a half years of
preparation. It is regarded as a textbook of Chinese history and a
window through which to view Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During today's opening ceremony, Liu Zhongde, minister of
culture, cited China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong as
a significant event in Chinese history, and expressed1 his belief
that the exhibition will play an important role in publicizing the
significance of this historic event while also inspiring
patriotism among the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
More than 370 pictures are on display in the exhibition hall,
which covers a floor area of more than 1,400 sq m. Rare items
include copies of the three treaties that allowed the British to
take control of Hong Kong, and the two fountain pens that the
Chinese and British leaders used when signing the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on December 19, 1984.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is sponsored jointly by the Ministry of Culture,
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and
the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the ribbon at the ceremony were Wang Guangying,
vice-chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office under the State Council, Zeng Jianhui, director of the
Information Office of the State Council, Zhou Nan, director of
Xinhua New Agency Hong Kong Branch, and Liu Zhongde.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Support Tariff Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Textile Federation
said on Monday it has recommended that its government reduces by
about 50 percent punitive tariffs on Zimbabwean exports.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency, Ziana,
President of the South African Textile Federation Mike Hankison
said the offer was made at a meeting held in Pretoria last week
between representatives of the textile and clothing sector from
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first of several planned between three
technical committees set up at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe when
Zimbabwe and South Africa met last month to resume stalled talks
aimed at concluding a new bilateral trade pact.
</P>
<P>
''A lot of progress was made on the issue of local content and
tariffs, and we have found a common ground to negotiate from,''
Hankison said.
</P>
<P>
''On the duty, we have offered a reduction for Zimbabwe on the
duties in place of about 50 percent. Obviously Zimbabwe is
looking for much lower duties and we continue to negotiate and
there is no deadlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said while Zimbabwe's demand for lower duties was
understandable, it had to be accepted that international trade in
clothing and textile products was depressed at present.
</P>
<P>
He also said South African clothing and textile companies were
no longer insisting on local content of 75 percent for Zimbabwean
products destined for that country, saying it was ''no longer an
issue between the two parties''.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hankison said a further meeting was scheduled to be
held in Cape Town by the end of the month. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Tobacco Farmers Urged to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association
(ZTA) today told its members to increase production by over 230
million kgs during the 1996/97 season and take advantage of
rising world prices.
</P>
<P>
During the last season, farmers grew about 200 million kgs
compared with the original estimation of 210 million kgs.
</P>
<P>
ZTA market information director Pat Davis said to achieve the
target, the area planted to flue-cured tobacco this year should
increase by 10 percent, from 81,000 hectares to 89,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
"The factors supporting a large crop production are higher
prices this year, larger amounts of stored water for increased
irrigation and an increase in small-scale production," said
Davis.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco grown during the just-ended season was expected to
earn farmers 400 million U.S. Dollars at the auction floors which
opened for sales on April 23, and more than 70 million U.S.
Dollars when processed for export.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is one of the top three growers of flue-cured tobacco
together with Brazil and the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Syria is optimistic that relations
between Syria and Turkey could improve after Islamic Welfare
Party's leader Necmettin Erbakan became the new Turkish prime
minister, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official daily Tishrin said Syria hoped that new Turkish
prime minister would make efforts to remove the sources of tension
between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at odds in recent months over the
sharing of water from the Euphrates River and a military pact
signed in February between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tishrin said "any move by the new Turkish government toward a
rapprochement with Syria will be reciprocated."
</P>
<P>
In another sign of optimism, Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi
today sent a greeting cable to Necmettin Erbakan in which he
expressed his country's confidence over the possibility of
broadening and developing cooperation between the two countries.

parliamentary cooperation to enhance the development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During separate meetings with Oliviu Gherman, speaker of the
Romanian Senate and Andrian Nastase, speaker of the Chamber of
Deputies, Jiang said China attaches great importance to relations

<HEADLINE> Vice-Chairman of Tibet Autonomous Regional Government Meets Norwegian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Gyamco, vice-chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Regional Government, has met in Lhasa with a Norwegian
delegation, led by Rolf Melheim, president of the Norway-China
Association.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting last Friday, Gyamco answered questions
concerning Tibet's economy, politics, Tibetans residing outside
China, religious culture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Tibetans residing outside the country, he said, the
central government has a clear-cut policy for those Tibetans
outside China, including the Dalai Lama, under which they are free
to come and free to go. Dalai and his followers are welcome back
to join in building up Tibet, provided that they give up their
separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
"In my own view," however, he said, "Dalai has shown no signs
of repentance, bent on with his separatist stance."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the relations between the autonomous region
and the central authorities and power distribution, Gyamco said
that for over 30 years since the founding of the Tibet Autonomous
Region, the central government's policy toward Tibet has always
been special and privileged.
</P>
<P>
Tibet can makes appropriate adaptations in carrying out the
documents by the central government in the light of its actual
situation. The country's autonomy law involving ethnic minority
regions stipulates that Tibet enjoys full rights of autonomy, and
that Tibet can make its own economic and social development plans
in accordance with its own conditions.
</P>
<P>
The people in Tibet can fully enjoy their rights in managing
their ethnic affairs and participate in the administration of
China's state affairs. The autonomous regional people's congress
could also enact certain local laws, Gyamco added.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian guests arrived in China on June 25 for a nine-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King on Government's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
accelerate the socio-economic development of the country by
furthering its decentralization program and liberal economic
policy in the coming fiscal year, King of Nepal Birendra said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the Upper and Lower Houses of
Parliament to present the government's policy program for the
1996-97 fiscal year from July 16, the king said the government
would make the local administrative bodies more able, competent
and strong.
</P>
<P>
The government would launch a nationwide employment promotion
program in the new fiscal year to create jobs for educated and
semi-educated jobless people in the country, said the king,
reiterating that poverty alleviation is a priority of the
government.
</P>
<P>
While stating that the government is to continue the liberal
economic policy, the king said austerity budgetary measures would
be adopted in the 1996-97 fiscal year to control the rising
unproductive government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
On external trade, the king said the government would formulate
short- and long-term strategies to reduce the nation's growing
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's trade deficit is estimated at around one billion US
dollars this year, more than three times bigger than four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Necessary steps would be taken to implement market-oriented
trade system and regional trading arrangement, he added, referring
to the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) which
came into force last December.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the government would launch programs
including irrigation, technology application, agricultural
extension, loans, roads and electrification in an integrated way
in the country's rural areas in the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government would work to integrate women in the
country into the mainstream of socio-economic development along
with the implementation of welfare programs for children's
development, the king said.
</P>
<P>
Special programs would also be launched to improve the living
standards of the deprived communities and backward ethnic groups,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, the king said Nepal will continue its policy
based on the promotion of national interest, sovereign equality,
mutual trust, goodwill and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The recent visits by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to India
and China have further strengthened the traditional relations with
the two neighboring countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will play its role by actively participating in various
programs for regional cooperation in South Asia within the frame
work of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Speculation Over Yeltsin's Health After Meeting Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A planned meeting between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and the presidents of Ukraine and Moldova
has been delayed, increasing speculation about Yeltsin's health
just three days before the second round of the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the delay announced by Yeltsin's press
today, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Moldovan
President Mircha Snegur had planned to meet in Moscow Monday to
sign a memorandum on settling a conflict between Moldova and the
breakaway region of Dnestr.
</P>
<P>
Today was the last day of official campaigning ahead of the
second-round run-off between Yeltsin and his political rival for
the presidency Gennady Zyuganov on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's officials say that the president lost his voice and
needed a rest after a hectic campaign schedule following the first
round of the presidential election on June 16.
</P>
<P>
But the postponement of the meeting has fuelled speculation
about Yeltsin's health. He had two heart attacks last year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has reportedly not been seen in public for four days
and has apparently cancelled a string of campaign appearances
including a major festival in Moscow on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His rival Gennady Zyuganov rejected the official line and today
asked for an official inquiry to be held into the president's
health, Reuters news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Vows to Devote Final 2 Years in Office to sustain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine president Fidel Ramos
today vowed to devote the final two years of his term in office to
sustain the momentum of economic growth and social reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In his "report to the nation" released today marking the four
years of his presidency, Ramos said "the challenge now is no
longer to survive but to finish the job to complete our victory
against national inertia, stagnation and poverty, and to move
upward with confidence towards our place in the community of
progressive nations of Asia."
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1993, Ramos launched a vision called
"Philippines 2000" that defines the economic target in terms of
three specific economic activities:
</P>
<P>
To raise national per capita income from 780 US dollars to at
least 1,000 US dollars by 1998;
</P>
<P>
To enable the economy to grow by an average of 6 to 8 percent
during the remainder of the 20th century;
</P>
<P>
To reduce poverty incidence among the people from about 40 to
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the per capita income in Philippines has now
risen to 1,085 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew from a zero growth in 1991 to 5.5 percent in
1995.
</P>
<P>
And the incidence of poverty went down from 39.9 percent in
1991 to 35.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has also been deleted from the International
Monetary Fund's list of poor countries in need of assistance to
meet the balance-of-payment problems.

MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines' growth in garment export is expected to
slow down due to the uncompetitive cost prevailing in the
industry, especially on labor, the Garments and Textile Exports
Board said today. The board set a 15 percent export increase for
this year, or from 2.7 billion US dollars in 1995 to 3 billion
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- Recognizing the role of women in pursuing economic growth,
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will hold a

<HEADLINE> New Residence Booklet Put to Use in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- As of today, every Chinese baby
is entitled to have his or her permanent identity card (ID) number
for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Once a newborn's ID number is registered, the baby is formally
recognized as a Chinese citizen, and from that moment on is
entitled to enjoy his or her full rights and interests of
citizenship, and also to fulfill the obligations of a Chinese
citizen.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese citizens could not obtain their permanent
ID residence cards until they were 16.
</P>
<P>
A new residence booklet was issued nationwide today, according
to the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The unified and more standardized residence booklet makes it
possible for the ministry to adopt improved scientific methods to
manage household registration, in order to better safeguard the
legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The booklet requires applicants and appropriate departments to
sign and seal it, thus making it legal proof of citizenship and a
document that contains information about family background.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the new booklet retains the
categories of "agricultural residence" and "non-agricultural
residence".
</P>
<P>
Using the new residence booklet paves the way for the future
reform of census registration, and the building of a computer
network for population information, a senior official with the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China is scheduled to spend five years to
complete the enormous census project, which involves about 1.2
billion people and some 400 million households.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Describes Hosting of APEC Meeting as Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that the hosting of this year's informal meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a challenge to
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the nation marking the start of his fifth year
in office, Ramos said that the hosting of the APEC meeting is a
challenge for Filipinos to show their capacity in organizing an
event that will witness the participation of 18 leaders of
economies and some 3,000 officials.
</P>
<P>
The privilege of hosting the fourth APEC meeting in Subic is "a
challenge without precedent in our history", he said.
</P>
<P>
"But with the challenge comes a unique opportunity to show what
Filipinos can do and subsequently to profit from the effort,"
Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of this year's APEC meeting, the Philippines is
tasked with compiling and harmonizing over 1,500 individual and
collective action plans of the 18 member economies for the 1996
Manila Action Plan for APEC, which will be issued by the leaders
after their meeting in Subic on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan will see concrete actions to implement
the goal of a free and open trade and investment in 2010 for
industrialized economies and 2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos said that as host of the APEC meeting, the
Philippines should go beyond mere compilation and harmonization of
the action plan.
</P>
<P>
"Our chairmanship of APEC must bear an indelible mark that will
be the Philippines' distinguished and lasting contribution to the
Asia-Pacific Economic cooperation," he said.

<HEADLINE> International Capital Pouring into Yangtze River Delta Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- International funds have continued
to flow into the Yangtze River Delta area, China's most prosperous
and dynamic region.
</P>
<P>
Capital from overseas is reportedly flowing into such local
fields as infrastructure projects, agriculture, finance, insurance
and commerce, rather than just processing industries.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River delta area is comprised of 14 cities,
including China's largest city Shanghai, and other major cities of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
So far the region has approved 55,000 overseas-funded projects,
involving a 90 billion US dollar spending spree in overseas money.
</P>
<P>
During the entire 1980s and the early 1990s, almost all foreign
businesses invested in processing sectors in the region because of
its large market potential and cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
However the investment proportion in the secondary industry has
dropped to 60 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales sector in Shanghai has become one of the
hottest investment spots for foreign investors, with the gross
investment soaring to 300 million US dollars in the first quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yaohan International Group, the giant Japanese business
conglomerate, has moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to
Shanghai, and started retail businesses throughout the Yangtze
River delta area.
</P>
<P>
The development of Shanghai's Pudong New Area has attracted
some 100 architecture design firms from across the world since
construction started on several hundred high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
About 120 foreign financial organizations gathered in Shanghai
have unanimously cast their eyesight on such cities as Hangzhou,
Ningbo, Nanjing and Suzhou. Several dozen of them have applied to
set up branches and offices there.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that foreign business people can be found
in many other fields, including commercial wholesale and retail
sale business, medicine, hotels, recreations, transportation,
advertising, engineering and building construction.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, which had long been neglected by foreign
businesses, has attracted a total of 200 million US dollars from
some 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign business people hold that the development of
agricultural products enjoys bright prospects in the Yangtze River
delta area because it is the most populous region in the country,
with the per-capita consumption the highest.
</P>
<P>
With an annual economic growth rate of 17 percent in the area,
foreign businesses have started to make long-term investments into
such areas as transportation and power facilities, which used to
draw small amounts of capital.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign firms have set up investment funds to directly
finance local enterprises and infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
So far, foreign companies have invested six billion US dollars
in the construction of bridges, tunnels, subways, expressways,
railways, wharfs, airports and power plants.
</P>
<P>
To embark on a new stage of development, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and
Shanghai are expected to invest two trillion yuan in fixed assets
between 1996 and the year 2000, with 600 billion injected into key
projects in the delta area.
</P>
<P>
Wan Xueyuan, Zhejiang provincial governor, said that it is
imperative to absorb more foreign capital to make up for domestic
deficiency, since many domestic areas have capital constraints.

<P>
- The Russian government has made several declarations assuring
people of Yeltsin's health in an effort to silence rumors.
General Alexander Lebed occupies the vacuum left by President
Boris Yeltsin. The general, who is already posing as a successor
to Yeltsin, has asked for the job of vice-president.
</P>
<P>
- French Justice Minister Jacques Toulon is under strong
attack from the socialists. After the attorney general ended
investigations into an apartment owned by the son of the mayor of
Paris, socialist leader Lionel Jospin called Toulon "the guard of
interests" rather than the guard of the seal.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
- French Justice Minister Jacques Toulon is accused by the
opposition and magistrates of putting justice under government
orders. Two days after police refused to accompany Judge Halphen
to search the apartment of the son of the mayor of Paris Jean
Tiberi, the attorney general declared the case closed on June
29. The two events triggered an outcry from the opposition and
some judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
- A Chinese-European plane takes off. The European consortium
membered by Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Alenia, will
announce on Tuesday an agreement reached with China for building
100-seat planes.

<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
- The "rest" Boris Yeltsin is taking increases the
uncertainty surrounding the Russian presidential
election. Although the president's aides have claimed the
president continues to work two to three hours a day, a large
number of voters who supported Yeltsin in the first round could
turn to communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. A former member of
Yeltsin's campaign team said if voter turnout is below 60 percent
in the second round of the election on Wednesday, Yeltsin may
lose.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants to Be Japanese Investors' First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants to be the first
choice for Japanese investment, according to a report of the Thai
Board of Investment.
</P>
<P>
The board is drafting a white paper with Japan to boost their
economic ties during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes that Japanese investors will give it top
priority when they move their factories to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Japan has been the biggest direct investor in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry sources said that Thailand wants Japanese
investment in the vehicle and related parts industries as part of
its drive to become the automobile export hub of the region.
</P>
<P>
The electrical appliance and electronics industries are also
targeted for Japanese funding as Thailand wants to become a
leading exporter of these products.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also want Japanese investment in supporting
industries, such as molds and dies, jigs and fixtures, forging,
casting with the use of induction furnace, cutting tools, grinding
tools, sintered products, surface treatment and rechargeable dry
batteries.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Japanese businesses sought board investment privileges
for 1,530 projects worth a total of 591 billion baht (23.64
billion US dollars), compared to 1,255 worth 279 billion baht
(11.16 billion US dollars) in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Deliberate Draft Law on Protecting Old People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Eighth National
People's Congress Standing Committee deliberated the draft Law for
the Protection of Rights and Interests of the Aged, at the
committee's on-going 20th meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Such a law will help promote the practice of respecting and
protecting the elderly in China, legislator Sun Honglie said.
</P>
<P>
He said that most aging Chinese people live out their final
years in their homes, and that most of the incidents that
negatively affect the rights and interests of the old have
occurred within the home.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wang Yu said the new law should be practical, as
farmers in some areas are underfed and poorly clothed, and
generally lead a hard life.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Chi Haibin held a similar view, saying that an
over-complicated law may be detrimental to family harmony.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Denghai, curses, humiliation, slander and
violence aimed toward the aged must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Mahinur Kasim said that the law should force children to take
care of the elderly, because many young people today pay little
attention to these responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Changshu noted that old people should have the
freedom to form organizations for their own development, education
and protection.
</P>
<P>
In addition, children and other relatives are not allowed to
move into the houses that belong to the old without their consent,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that a special department under the State
Council should designated to take charge of protecting the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Call for Stricter Control over Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have suggested
that the country's top legislature approve a Law on the control of
firearms as soon as possible, as an excess of illegal firearms is
endangering public safety.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing
Committee made the suggestion during the committee's on-going 20th
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Many firearms are now circulating in society, and the
responsibility of relevant departments for this should be
investigated and affixed, lawmaker He Huanfen said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yuzhang suggested adding an article to the law that
states: "Public security departments will check up on existing
firearms in the society, all units and individuals holding
firearms should make an active move to report to public security
departments. Violators will shoulder responsibility in accordance
with the law."
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Hao Yechun said the law should clarify the boundaries
between hunting and non-hunting areas, and also establish the
punitive measures banning firearm smuggling, and the management of
guns granted to leading officials.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Zhou Jue said that toy guns brought in from abroad
also must be banned, in addition to those made and sold in China.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers Xu Qin and Hu Min agreed that people who violate the
firearms law must face harsh penalties.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ligong noted that illegal guns seem to be rampant in China,
despite the high number of firearms confiscated during the
country's recent crackdown on crimes.
</P>
<P>
Guards who protect firearm storage places, but fail in their
duties, must be punished according to the law, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Gun owners must have firearm registrations, said lawmaker Sun
Tingfang, otherwise, the problem of smuggling and illegal
production cannot be solved.

<P>
MACAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- All existing laws applicable after
1999 will have a Chinese version by the end of 1997, the "Macao
Daily News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official with the law translation office
as saying that his office is making preparations to translate
several existing laws that still do not have Chinese versions.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and Portuguese languages have equal status and
legal effect in Macao," he said.
</P>
<P>
The localization of law, which consists of the translation of
Portuguese-language laws in Macao and the making of laws suitable
to Macao, is deemed one of the leading issues in the transitional
period of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the office has started translation of 19 laws and
133 sets of regulations that are operational in Macao. The office
has notified the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group that it will
start translation of other laws applicable after 1999 after it
finishes translation of the above-mentioned laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The official said that among the five major laws, only the
"Civil Code" remains to be translated because it has over 2,000
articles and has complicated contents. But he promised that the
code will have a Chinese version by the end of 1997.

<P>
He said the public response had made up his mind.
</P>
<P>

he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a finale and hopefully I'm going to go out there and
bring the medal back."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"I believe I'm capable of running as fast as it takes to win."

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Leader Urged to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the opposition
Indian National Congress has for the first time openly urged
former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to resign as party
president, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a local TV channel to be broadcast
tonight, senior Congress party leader K. Karunakaran said that Rao
should have accepted personal responsibility for the Congress
party's recent electoral debacle.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has lost its status as the largest party in
the country by garnering only 140 out of the 545 seats in the 11th
Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) in the parliamentary
elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Rao should have accepted responsibility, Karunakaran
said "that is the usual thing ... that is the usual procedure
adopted and I don't know why this time it did not happen ... he
should have done that. that would have raised his prestige high."
</P>
<P>
Karunakaran said the Congress party had been defeated because
it failed to communicate the achievements of its government to the
people.
</P>
<P>
The former industry minister said that "the entire Congress
Working Committee (supreme decision-making body of the Congress
party) should take the responsibility. At the same time, the
captain has more responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Congress party's defeat in the elections, Rao
has been under repeated attacks from his party men. But so far he
has managed to survive the challenges to his leadership.

<HEADLINE> Syria Hopes for Better Relations with New Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Fresh hopes for a genuine
relaxation in Syrian-Turkish relations have emerged after the new
Turkish government headed by Welfare Party Chairman Necmettin
Erbakan was formed, the Syrian newspaper Teshreen said today.
</P>
<P>
Syria is eager to improve its relations with the Turkish people
and finds it necessary that peace, security and stability should
be established in the entire Middle East, including Turkey, the
paper added.
</P>
<P>
Teshreen pointed out that Damascus has spared no effort to
settle its outstanding problems with Turkey, especially the water
problem.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian-Turkish relations are not at their best now and it
was not Syria that started pushing these relations toward the
worse. On the contrary, Syria has made considerable efforts to
maintain its historical ties with Turkey. It has also sought
constantly to enter in a serious dialogue with Turkey for a
solution to the water problem," Teshreen said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to defuse tensions in the Syrian-Turkish
relations lies in the fact that each side should have goodwill and
be prepared to enter into a deep dialogue intended to find
solutions that would ensure the rights and interests of both
parties," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Teshreen affirmed that Syria hopes the Erbakan government will
make positive moves toward Syria, and the latter will then show
readiness to get all the outstanding problems between the two
countries resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish pro-Islamic Welfare Party and the True Path Party
led by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller formed a new coalition
government Friday.

<HEADLINE> New Crisis Brewing in Indian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A fresh crisis is brewing in
India's United Front government as a senior Janata Dal leader,
Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, is reluctant to join the government
despite his appointment as a minister of state, the Hindustan
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second episode of this kind since the Gowda
government was expanded on June 28.
</P>
<P>
Singh, who had been a cabinet member of the Bihar state
government, found his appointment as a minister of state in the
central government "humiliating" because persons junior to him had
been inducted as cabinet ministers for given independent charge.
</P>
<P>
Though the Janata Dal leader knew about his inclusion in the
Gowda government, he kept away from the capital on June 28 when
the swearing-in ceremony was held at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
In a similar episode, R.L. Jalappa, who was sworn in as a
minister of state, had walked out of the presidential palace
minutes after taking oath in protest against the denial of a
cabinet berth and later submitted his resignation to Prime
Minister Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
However, he relented after a meeting with the prime minister
the next day and was subsequently given independent charge of the
Textiles Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ruling United Front comprises of 13 parties including the
Janata Dal. The allocation of portfolios among the constituents
taking part in the government has been a source of controversy
among the alliance.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Industry Expects Bright Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yang Zilin, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks
(HKAB) told Xinhua recently that he had full confidence in the
future of this regional financial hub with the approach of
1997. Yang, general manager of the Bank of China Hong Kong Branch,
is the first Chinese to take the rotary post of the HKAB's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has built itself into one of the world financial
centers after going through ebb and flow over the past century,
said the chairman of the 99-year-old bank guild.
</P>
<P>
The city has implemented a three-tier banking system --
licensed banks, restricted-license banks and deposit-taking
companies. Statistics provided by the association showed that
Hong Kong had 185 licensed banks at the end of June 1996, twice as
 many as that of 1978; they maintain a total of 1,468 branches,
fivefold the figure in early 1970s. There are 63
restricted-license banks, 131 deposit-taking companies and 156
representative offices of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Calculating on a population of 6.3 million, every 3,000 Hong
Kong residents share a financial institution or branch. Yang
said: "No other places in the world are banks so densely
distributed as in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is also a place that pools together financial
capital around the world," said Yang. It is one of the three
global financial centers backed by highly concentrated foreign
banks. Among the 185 licensed banks, 155 or 83 percent are wholly
owned or controlled by foreign capital. At the end of 1995, 85
out of the world top 100 banks had set up branches in Hong
Kong. Foreign currency has become an important component both on
deposit accounts and on the lending market.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that Hong Kong's banking industry took a big
leap forward over the past two decades, when the Chinese
hinterland created the world's fastest growing economy through the
reform and open-up. The year of 1997, when Hong Kong returns to
China, indicates an even bigger opportunity for the development of
Hong Kong's banking sector.

<P>
MACAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Government is to issue
"senior citizen card" to people over 65 years in a bid to help
them in their daily life.
</P>
<P>
The card-holders will enjoy deducted price in shopping, seeing
doctors and taking buses, at more than 100 firms in Macao. These
firms include department stores, clinics, eateries, glasses shops,
color film printing companies and a bus company.
</P>
<P>
The senior citizen card program was jointly launched by the
Social Works Department of the Macao Government, the Elderly
People's Rights Society, the Neighborhood Committee and several
other societies in Macao.
</P>
<P>

<P>
"China impact" plays an increasingly important role in looking
into the future of Hong Kong. According to Yang, the three-year
macroeconomic readjustment has laid down a good foundation for
sustained economic growth in the country up to 2000.
</P>
<P>
With inflation under control, China can expect fairly fast
economic growth during the Ninth five-year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Rising personal income, expanding social wealth, huge fund
needed in manufacturing, trade, commerce and infrastructure will
give an impetus to Hong Kong's banking business related to China,
said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, Yang said, Japan is pulling out the
six-year-long recession, and Southeast Asian economies are
continuing to boom. As a regional financial hub, Hong Kong will
benefit from the vibrant Asia-Pacific economies.
</P>
<P>
Yang believed that those who think 1997 is a concern will
change their view later. He stressed that the Basic Law had
provided strong legal guarantee for the development of Hong Kong's
 financial industry.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems,"
 there will be two monetary authorities, two monetary systems and
two currencies in China after July 1, 1997 -- one in Hong Kong and
 the other in the mainland, said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be
the authorized currency of the future Special Administrative
Region, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will continue to play the
role of the central bank, and the present free and open financial
system will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Having been chairman of the HKAB for half a year, Yang has made
 every effort to enhance exchanges among bank members and
intensify cooperation with HKMA and the Secretary of Finance, so
as to ensure the health development of the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
Bank of China (BOC) Group has been one of the three permanent
members of the HKAB since 1917, and the other two are Hongkong and
 Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and Standard Chartered. All
three are note-issuing banks in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
BOC started to issue notes in Hong Kong on May 1, 1994. Even
since, general managers of the three note-issuers have been in the
 chair of the HKAB in rotation, each with the term of one
year. This is the first time for the BOC general manager to take
the chairman position in the year of 1996.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Experimental Fast Neutron Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build an
experimental fast neutron reactor by the year 2000 to lay a solid
technological foundation for the construction of commercial fast
neutron reactors.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhuxun, president of Chinese Academy of Nuclear Energy,
said here today that preliminary designs for the facility are
expected to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
To be owned by the academy, the facility will have a designed
thermal power of 65 mw and electricity generating output of 20 mw,
the president said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Compared with neutron reactors in ordinary nuclear power
plants, fast neutron reactors are capable of raising the utility
efficiency of uranium resource sixty to seventy fold.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study on the construction of the reactor last
month passed an examination by Chinese National Nuclear
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Research on the fast neutron reactor was listed in 1987 as part
of China's medium-to-long-term high-technology research program.
</P>
<P>
Development of fast neutron reactors is of strategic importance
for China to meet its growing energy needs in the next century,
Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say China's need for primary energy will reach 4.5
billion tons of standard coal by the year 2050, while the
country's supplies of conventional energy, including coal, oil and
natural gas, can only provide 3.5 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
They conclude that China will need 120 million to 240 million
kwh of nuclear energy by 2050.
</P>
<P>
Fast neutron reactors are already operational in France,
Russia, Japan, the United States and Germany, according to the
president.

<HEADLINE> 18 Executed for Relics Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China has executed a total of 18
people since 1992 through March this year for illegally digging
tombs and stealing items from museums and pagodas, a senior
Chinese official revealed in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenbin, deputy director of the State Bureau of Cultural
Relics, disclosed the executions at a recent meeting marking the
fifth anniversary of the implementation of the law governing the
protection of China's cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
He added that 32 major cases were handled between 1992 and
1995, following the passing of the law to impose stiff punishments
on cultural relics thefts.
</P>
<P>
"The rising trend of relics crimes has been curbed since the
implementation of the law," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1995 could be defined as a "safe year" since the
museums in 18 provinces reported no major thefts.
</P>
<P>
However, specialists say, the protection of cultural relics is
an "arduous and complicated project," and "the current situation
is still pregnant with grim possibilities." Efforts should be
made to "publicize and popularize the law while earnestly
implementing the law and cracking down on the relics crimes, they
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today in his report to the nation that the government is
seeking to create 3 million jobs in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has been successful in creating 1.2
million jobs a year since 1994, partly as a result of the fivefold
increase in easy credit to small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the target of 3 million jobs
by June 30, 1998 will be attained due to the government's
comprehensive employment programs, which are being implemented
nationwide, and the new economic growth outside Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The report marks the start of Ramos's fifth year in office as
the Philippine president.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Major Japanese electronics makers are
trying to balance the amounts of dollar-based export and import
contracts to ease foreign exchange risks, Kyodo News Service
quoted company officials as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was prompted by the dollar's steep fall against the yen
last year, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's top mainframe computer maker, said it
wants to prevent wild foreign exchange fluctuations from affecting
its business. Its dollar-based export contracts concluded in
fiscal 1995 totaled 2.9 billion dollars, while import contracts
were worth 2.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
NEC Corp. said its imbalance will drop sharply to 500 million
dollars in fiscal 1996 from the previous year's 1.5 billion
dollars on increased overseas production and purchases from
overseas suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Victor Co. of Japan (JVC) said it aimed to balance dollar-based
exports and imports in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi Ltd. said its home electrical appliances department
plans to balance dollar-based exports and imports by the end of
fiscal 1998.

<HEADLINE> Trains to Ship 180.1 million Riderships This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Trains expect to transport
a more than 180 million riderships during the peak summer season
between now and August 31, railway authorities have predicted.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated figure is 4.2 percent lower than the figure of
last year. The expected decrease in train passengers is mainly due
to a rise in fares, and fierce competition from highway and air
transport, market analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
But the pressure on Chinese railways will be still heavy with
the coming flow of summer holiday makers and students returning
home for the summer vacation. Railway authorities will add an
extra of 16 temporary express returns.
</P>
<P>
The authorities expect that some trunk lines, such as the
Beijing-Harbin line, Beijing-Shanghai line, and Changchun-Dalian
line, will be most crowded.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Mexico said here
today the two countries would like to further enhance economic
ties and make efforts to upgrade their bilateral trade and
investments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with his Mexican
counterpart Angel Gurria, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said Mexico can be a gateway for Malaysia to market
its products to central America.
</P>
<P>
He said Mexico could be a very important focal point for the
expansion of Malaysian trade in the region including setting up
plants for Malaysia's automotive industry, adding Mexico had
offered limitless opportunities for Malaysian producers.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the potential was there for both countries to
cooperate in the automotive industry as Mexico is one of the
world's largest exporters of car engines with export value of 12
billion to 15 billion US dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said Mexico was keen to diversify its trade with other
countries. At present, 80 percent of its trade is with the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Malaysia and Mexico currently amounts to 460
million dollars, in Malaysia's favor.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, both ministers said they also
exchanged views on bilateral, multilateral and international
issues including disarmament, and restructuring and reorganization
of the United Nations.
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Overall sales of passenger cars, as measured by registration,

<HEADLINE> Israeli Workers Strike to Protest Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- About 400,000 Israeli workers
staged a one-hour strike today to protest against the
government's new economic plans to curtail public spending and
accelerate privatization.
</P>
<P>
The strike, called by the Histadrut (Israel's trade union),
involved government ministries, local authorities, transport and
government corporations, including the Israel Electric Corp.,
Bezeq, EL Al, Ports and Railways Authority, Israel Chemicals and
others.
</P>
<P>
In most workplaces, the workers held protest meetings from 10
to 11 a.m.. Banks, post offices and other public services were
closed for an hour, while hospitals and firefighters only handled
emergency calls during the striking hour. However, no major
disruptions were reported.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut said that the strike is a part of its fight
against the new government's plans for privatization and the
anticipated cutbacks in government spending, which will lead to
massive lay-offs and violations of workers' pension rights.
</P>
<P>
Despite Finance Minister Dan Meridor's promises not to harm
the lower income earners and not to raise taxes, Histadrut
leaders said the drastic cuts in health, education and welfare
budgets are tantamount to wage cuts and tax increases for
salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the workers also feared that the massive
privatization plan will throw thousands of public workers out of
work.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz, who is also member of Knesset
(Israel's parliament), held a meeting at noon with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Meridor to discuss the new economic program
and its implications.
</P>
<P>
Peretz said today's strike was only a warning shot, the
question whether the Histadrut would call larger-scale strikes
depends on the attitude of the government. He stressed Histadrut
should be accepted as a partner to the economic program that will
affect all the nation's workers.
</P>
<P>
However, Meridor defended his new economic policies in the
cabinet meeting held Sunday, saying that they would only benefit
the workers in a long term.
</P>
<P>
"The Histadrut and its economists know as well as we do that
if we don't take these measures the workers will be the first to
be hurt," he said, promising he would do his best to protect the
poor from being hit by cuts in public spending.
</P>
<P>
Meridor predicted Israel's budget deficit to reach about 5.5
billion shekels (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In April, the cost of living index rose to a
higher-than-expected 1.7 percent, pointing to an annual inflation
rate of 14 percent as against last year's 8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on "One Country, Two Systems" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The peaceful way in which Hong
Kong's future has been resolved will set a model for tackling the
question of Taiwan, a high-ranking State Council official said
here recently as the year-long countdown starts to Hong Kong's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
He said after July 1, next year, the implementation of the "one
country, two systems", and the Basic Law over Hong Kong, and
maintaining its stability and prosperity will set a model for
solving the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy is the best way to solve
the Hong Kong question, and it also tallies with the actual
situation in China, said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had fully considered Hong Kong's history and
reality before he put forward the policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"One country" means that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of
the Chinese territory, while "two systems" means that Hong Kong
can retain its capitalist system, on the premise that socialism is
the main body of China, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Our reform and opening-up policy, as well as the
modernization drive, need Hong Kong as a window and a bridge,
through which we can have access to markets in western countries
and introduce their funds, advanced technology and management
expertise. Meanwhile foreigners can also enter into the Chinese
markets through Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The adoption of "one country, two systems" policy for Hong Kong
has also set an example on how to solve international issues in a
peaceful way, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Deng Xiaoping has said, the world has many contradictions
and disputes that cannot be solved by the war, instead they should
be settled peacefully, Lu remarked.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese side had set out to draft the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) after signing
the Sino-British Joint Declaration, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the four years and eight months' work, the Basic Law had
been completed, based on the opinions broadly sought from the Hong
Kong people, and won support from them, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government then embarked on work in Hong Kong's
transitional period, engaging four groups of advisors on Hong Kong
affairs, and establishing the Preliminary Working Committee of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR and the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This move has laid a solid foundation for establishing the
Hong Kong SAR government," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> BOJ to Maintain Easy Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's central bank, the Bank of
Japan (BOJ) will mainain its easy monetary policy for the time
being for strengthening further the economy, Kyodo News Service
quoted bank Governor Yasuo Matsushita as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is appropriate to carefully monitor developments in
financial and economic circumstances, while putting emphasis on
further solidifying the basis of economic recovery," Matsushita
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a two-day meeting of BOJ branch
managers, Matsushita said the economy is still on a moderate
recovery track amid brisk public spending and housing investment
and rising personal consumption.
</P>
<P>
But the pace of economic turnaround remains slow due to
pressures for structural adjustment of Japanese industry and other
factors, Matsushita said.
</P>
<P>
"To further ensure transition to a self-sustained economic
recovery, the current momentum needs to gain more strength and
width," Matsushita said.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have been at a historic low since the central
bank last September reduced the official discount rate to 0.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Relations between Mainland and Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will not be subordinate
in its relations with the departments under China's Central
People's Government and local governments in the mainland after
1997, Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council, said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will enjoy
executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including
that of final appeal, he said, adding that this is just what is
meant by "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central People's Government's policy towards
Hong Kong and the Basic Law, the Central People's Government will
be responsible for the foreign affairs and defence of the future
Hong Kong SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other daily affairs will all be handled by Hong Kong people
themselves, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Basic Law also stipulates that no department of the
Central People's Government, and no province, autonomous region,
or municipality may interfere in affairs which the Hong Kong SAR
itself administers.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the future SAR will have independent
finances, and it will use its financial revenues exclusively for
its own purposes, instead of handing them over to the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government will not levy taxes in the Hong
Kong SAR, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked on whether it will be easier for people from the
mainland to travel to Hong Kong for business after 1997, Lu
replied they must obtain permission, as Hong Kong is a special
administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
"Even people like us must also have a certificate when going to
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
If large numbers of mainland people crowd into Hong Kong, it
will be too big a pressure for Hong Kong, as it has only an area
of about 1,000 square kilometres, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As Deng Xiaoping said, it may have an even stricter control on
this issue, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question whether it will be more convenient to
travel abroad after Hong Kong residents get new passports, Lu said
after 1997, the Hong Kong SAR government will grant SAR passports
to all the Chinese citizens among permanent residents in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In order to provide convenience to the Hong Kong compatriots,
we are negotiating with some countries on visa-free access for
them through diplomatic channels," Lu said.

<HEADLINE> Leaflet Circulated in Hebron Calling for Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid uncertainty over Israeli
withdrawal from Hebron, a leaflet reportedly distributed in the
West Bank city is calling for "burning the ground under the feet
of the occupier."
</P>
<P>
About 30 Palestinian cars in downtown Hebron had their tires
slashed during the night. Palestinians believe that Jewish
settlers did it to increase tension and reduce the chances of the
Israeli army withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Further south, the village of Samua was under curfew for the
eighth day. The curfew was imposed after some radical youths set
fire to a bulldozer during a protest over land confiscation for
building a bypass road for settlers. Israeli military sources said
the isolation of the village is necessary to prevent protests
spreading to Hebron itself.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Shuhi, a 33-year-old Fatah activist, was said to be the
distributor of the leaflet which calls for action next Friday. He
also called for a general strike the following Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will start to organize our strike forces everywhere in the
Hebron area. The Israeli leaders and (Prime Minister Benjamin)
Netanyahu at their head will take responsibility for not
withdrawing from Hebron," said the leaflet.
</P>
<P>
A previous leaflet called for clashes last Friday. Shuhi's
second leaflet was signed by "the Popular National Solidarity
Committees."
</P>
<P>
The leaflets do not limit themselves to Hebron, but call for
organized actions until a Palestinian state is established with
its capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said on several occasions that he is studying
the Hebron issue more carefully than any other single issue. The
redeployment, defined under the Oslo 2 agreement, was delayed
three months from December to find a way to secure the 450
settlers in the city center. It was delayed again after a spate of
suicide bomb explosions in Israel in February and March, and again
after the defeat of the Labor-led government in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders have warned that as the situation in
Hebron is growing from bad to worse, the frustrated Palestinians
would eventually resort to intifada (uprising).

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Tasks of Establishing HK SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- With just one year left before Hong
Kong's return to its motherland, it is imperative to make full
preparations to establish the future SAR, said Lu Ping, director
of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, in an
interview here recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the chief executive of the future SAR will be elected
by a Selection Committee, composed of 400 permanent Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee Panel is now studying methods of
choosing the members of the Selection Committee, based on the
opinions sought from people in various circles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The method will continue to be studied in the panel's next
session this month, then be submitted to the Preparatory
Committee's fourth plenum to be held this August in Beijing for
adoption, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is expected to be formed in October, Lu
said, adding that the provisional legislature, the chief
executive, and the future SAR governing body are all expected to
be chosen by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said from the end of this year to July 1, next year, the
chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR must understand the situation
and live his part.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the British side will co-operate with the Preparatory
Committee and make the future SAR government body to be appointed
familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
"After the establishment of the provisional legislature, it
will study some absolutely necessary laws that cannot be made by
the current Legislative Council before June 30, 1997, so that
those laws can be brought into effect on July 1, next year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sino-British relations, Lu said the Chinese
government's policy toward Hong Kong has never changed.
</P>
<P>
"We always hope the British side will enhance co-operation with
the Chinese side in the remaining one year, according to the
principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration," he added.
</P>
<P>
There are still many problems between the two sides to settle
through negotiation, and the Sino-British Joint liaison Group is
now speeding up its work, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not exclude the possibility that the British side will
create new contradictions. But from the Chinese side, we do not
hope this will happen," he noted.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Preparatory Committee will still play
its role after July 1, 1997, Lu answered that the committee should
also help in the task of preparing the establishment of the first
legislative council of the Hong Kong SAR, according to the
decision made by the National People's Congress on April 4, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The provisional legislature will only exist until June, 30,
1998, he explained.
</P>
<P>
After the first legislative council is elected, the historical
obligation of the Preparatory Committee will be fulfilled, Lu
said.

</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council, was asked in a major interview here recently why
China had not taken back Hong Kong soon after the PRC was formed
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that at that time China didn't have the idea of taking
back Hong Kong immediately, because it had many domestic issues to
deal with, while some western countries headed by the United
States, also imposed an economic blockade on China.
</P>
<P>
"Under that circumstance China needed a peaceful environment to
restore its economic order and heal war wounds," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese government never recognized three unequal
treaties over Hong Kong, nor regarded Hong Kong as Britain's
colony, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the one-year countdown starts before China's resumption of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Lu recalled Hong Kong's history. He
also spoke of the negotiations between China and Britain over Hong
Kong, and matters about Hong Kong's transitional period, saying he
was confident about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
He said after the founding of the People's Republic of China,
the Chinese government repeatedly declared that the three unequal
treaties had been forcibly imposed on the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"China would solve the Hong Kong question at proper time and in
an appropriate way," he quoted Huang Hua, former permanent Chinese
representative to United Nations, as saying, adding that both the
UN and the world media supported China's standpoint on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhou Enlai once put forward a policy of "long-term
arrangement and making full use" of Hong Kong, which meant not to
take back Hong Kong temporarily, while making full use of Hong
Kong's advantages, to serve China's economic construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu recalled that Deng Xiaoping had assured that as a special
question, the Hong Kong question would be solved in a special way,
when he met with former Hong Kong governor Maclehose in 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Deng also pointed out that there was no room for
discussion on the issue of sovereignty over Hong Kong, when
meeting with visiting British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for China's firm stand, the British side had to reconcile,
and a Sino-British Joint Declaration had been signed in December,
1984 after 22 rounds of negotiations between the two sides, Lu
said.

ULAN BATOR, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's opposition Democratic
Union Coalition has obtained 48 of the 76 seats in today's
elections for the Great Hural (parliament), toppling the ruling
Mongolian Revolutionary People's Party.
</P>
<P>
The former communist Mongolian Revolutionary People's Party,
which has been in power for more than 70 years, collected 23
seats, Lhagvasuren, head of the election committee, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that they are still waiting for the results of the
remaining five constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Within the coalition, the National Democratic Party (NDP) won
33 seats, followed by the Social Development Party (SDP) with 12,
and independent candidates three.
</P>
<P>
The NDP and the SDP are the two major opposition and democratic
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the opposition coalition's landslide
victory to its full and comprehensive preparation before the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The policy mistakes made by the ruling party recently,
especially its failure to check the increasing inflation, also
contributed to the opposition's victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs about 440 million U.S.
Dollars per year to provide basic infrastructure in the country
between now and the year 2010, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Top quality infrastructure would even cost the nation an
estimated 1.246 billion Dollars a year, the bank said over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on Nigeria's infrastructure, a World Bank
official said 440 million Dollars for basic standard
infrastructure are "not attainable in a country like Nigeria,
with about 100 million population".
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank can only provide just 10 percent of the
estimate, while the country would source the remaining somewhere
else," said Trevor Byer, the bank's resident representative in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The bank advised that the role of the government could be
limited to policy-making, regulation, ownership or financing,
leaving actual investment, operation and maintenance to
non-government bodies.

<P>
The landmark visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and the
establishment of Sino-Russian strategic relations of cooperation
facing the 21st century, ushered in a new chapter in the history
of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In the post-cold war years which still see "Cold War Thinking"
prevailing, the new type of relationship between China and Russia,
featured by no alignment, no antagonism and not directing against
any third country, has chartered a new way of handling relations
between countries, as well as an enlightment for handling
relations between major nations in particular.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement in late April by China, Russia and
the three Central Asian countries on strengthening military trust
in border areas, the first of its kind in human history, not only
will promote stability and development in the region, but also
benefit peace and stability in the world.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and the developing countries have shared
extensive acknowledgement in terms of developing bilateral or
multi-lateral relations, and generated a good basis in terms of
strengthening cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They all hold that all countries should choose their own social
systems and development mode in line with their specific
conditions. All oppose interference by other countries, oppose
hegemonism and power politics, and stand for developing
cooperative relations among all countries, big or small, on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The active and effective diplomatic moves in the six months
have helped created a better international environment for China's
economic construction, local observers believed.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the situation, China will become more
involved in international affairs to contribute its share to the
establishment of new global political and economic orders, the
observers said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Upcoming Visit to Kyrgyzstan to Push Forward Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Kyrgyz diplomatic envoy to China
has said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit to
Kyrgyzstan is to raise bilateral relations to a new high.
</P>
<P>
A. A. Osmonaliev, Kyrgyzstan charge d'affaires ad interim to
China, made the remark in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Osmonaliev said that this visit is of regional significance
beyond bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries will sign a series of
documents, and the most important one is the joint communique of
the two countries, which will outline the basis for bilateral
friendly relations and the basic direction for bilateral
cooperation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade cooperation, Osmonaliev said
with pleasure that the development of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation so far is satisfactory and cherishes a bright future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trade volume between the two countries last
year reached 230 million US dollars, over twice that in 1994,
adding that Kyrgyzstan has become China's big trade partner among
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), following Russia,
Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that furthering bilateral economic and trade cooperation
is an important part of Jiang's visit, Osmonaliev said that his
country hopes that the economic and trade cooperation committee
between the two governments can make more efforts for bilateral
cooperation, especially in the infrastructural construction such
as communications and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyzstan people are expecting Jiang's forthcoming visit and
believed that this visit is to be a full success, marking a
brilliant page in development of bilateral relations, said
Osmonaliev.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Army to Establish Reserve Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA),
which is currently reducing its size, is working on a mechanism
of establishing a reserve force as a means of preserving the
potency of the army in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Defence Forces Spokesman Colonel Trust Mugoba said on Sunday,
plans were underway to establish a reserve force in terms of the
the Defence Amendment Bill of 1993 which empowers the minister of
defence to form such a force.
</P>
<P>
Although Mugoba could not immediately shed light on the size
of the force and when it would be in place, he said Major-General
Paradzai Zimonte had already been appointed chief of staff of the
reserve force.
</P>
<P>
Zimonte and his team were working on the command, control,
administration and conditions of service of such a force before
coming up with a policy governing its operation.
</P>
<P>
''When they have completed their findings, they will submit
them to the commander of the defence forces who will then submit
them to the minister of defence, who will then issue an official
announcement on the establishment of a reserve force,'' said
Mugoba.
</P>
<P>
While the army was reducing its size from over 50,000 to
40,000, he said the exercise was also part of the re-organisation
of the defence forces. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's  Globe-Trotting   Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's globe-trotting leaders
helped to take all-faceted diplomacy in the first half of this
year to new heights.
</P>
<P>
Their journeys across five continents, and visits to China by
top world leaders, yielded major progress in promoting the
country's relationships with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Active diplomatic moves, featured by frequent exchange visits
by leading Chinese and foreign leaders, also provided new room for
thought for the world in handling the country-to-country
relations, particularly links between major nations.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese leaders have visited more than 20 countries
spanning five continents over the past six months. The current
visit by President Jiang Zemin to six European and Central Asian
countries, and Premier Li Peng's participation in the Eighth
National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam last week,
have pushed the country's diplomacy and party links with overseas
friends to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Other official visits by Chinese leaders included the trip by
Premier Li Peng to France, and his participation in the first
Europe-Asia Meeting in Thailand, the National People's Congress
Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi's trip to Cuba, Greek and
Canada and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's trip to Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening and developing of friendship and cooperation
with developing countries, neighboring countries in particular,
has been one of China's key diplomatic aspects. Of the
almost 20 heads of state and government leaders who visited China
in the six months, the majority were from Africa, Asia, the Middle
East and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
They included presidents or prime ministers from Sri lanka,
Ghana, Guinea, Kazakstan, Kyrghyzstan, Tajikstan, Palestine,
Mongolia, Lebanon, Nepal and Thailand. Other distinguished guests
were the presidents of Finland and Slovania, the Chairman of the
European Union and ASEAN's AIPO (ASEAN Interparliamentary
Organization) delegation.

BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's ambassador to China
has said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming visit to
his country will open up a new page in the history of

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
is to ban the use of arable land for luxury buildings and
entertainment facilities such as golf courses.
</P>
<P>
The ban, coming into force this year, is one of the province's
latest measures to curb the enroachment on precious farm land, a
serious problem facing the province since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the province has taken economic, legal and
administrative measures to control the loss of arable land.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-year Plan (1991-1995) period provincial
authorities collected nearly 900 million yuan to develop 171,600
hectares of land suitable for farming, including 87,780 ha of
arable land. The provincial government is setting aside 50 million
yuan annually for the development of land suitable for farming
starting this year.
</P>
<P>
So far the Provincial People's Congress and government have
stipulated 13 rules and regulations concerning land management and
protection. In 1994 almost two million hectares of land was set
aside across the province as basic arable land, under protection
in accordance with the regulation stipulated by the Provincial
People's Congress.

Years of human activity, especially industrial development, in

special pipes to carry waste water to the Yangtze River estuary as
part of a treatment program.

The Shanghai municipal government has now decided to remove

Qinghai is one of the poorest provinces in the country, with a
quarter of its 3.32 million population living in poverty. They
mostly inhabit the arid mountainous areas or the frigid pastoral
regions.

According to a local official, the province will focus its
poverty elimination efforts on capital agricultural construction,
involving water and soil conservation, afforestation and
improvement of arable land.
</P>
<P>
The province is still striving to supply water and electricity
and provide road access to all villages within five years.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include vigorous support for animal husbandry in
the province which will effectively enhance the incomes of the
herdspeople. The province will develop enclosed grasslands for the
herdspeople in the area.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to move part of the rural population
residing in extremely harsh natural conditions to better-off
areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's newly-appointed Energy and
Natural Resources Minister Recai Kutan said that Turkey needed to
make an investment ranging between 80-100 billion U.S. dollars to
avoid electricity shortages by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Daily News today quoted Kutan as saying that it
had become clear that it was impossible for Turkey to supply its
energy needs by its own means.
</P>
<P>
Kutan said that he and his colleagues would undertake a study
of the "build-operate model" of hydroelectric power plants which
are now under construction, and also of thermal and nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that every part of the world was dependent on
others from the standpoint of energy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Turkey's neighboring countries have great gas
potential, the minister said, "There is (such potential) in
Iran, in the Turkic republics. However, there has not been an
opportunity to bring up concrete projects. We will seek
possibilities to cooperate with the Turkic republics and our
friend Iran on the issue of crude oil and natural gas pipelines."
</P>
<P>
Kutan pointed out that in any case the government would exert
all efforts to prevent Turkey from facing hardships from the
standpoint of electrical energy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey needs to acquire nuclear technology as soon as
possible, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges World To Help Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa has
underlined the need for the world to help poor countries like
Tanzania which were likely to lose heavily in the wake of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Openning the 20th Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair
(DITF) on Sunday evening, the president said there were
advantages in a liberalized world trade, but dangers and risks
were also abound.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said forecasts had it that unless the world
took action now, Africa could end up lossing 2.6 billion U.S.
Dollars a year by the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa called for international action that would
enable countries at different level of economic development to
compete fairly in the world trade, where each could have equal
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Short of that it will be like putting me in the same ring as
Mike Tyson, and expect that since the same boxing rules will
apply, I stand a chance to beat him," the president said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also called for diversification of the
country's exports and do away with the present over-dependence on
traditional commodities such as coffee, tea, tobacco, sisal and
cotton.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "on their own, commodities cannot help us to
escape the poverty-cum-marginalization trap that lies ahead of
us."
</P>
<P>
The president warned that terms of trade in respect of
coummodities were generally unfavourable and prices unstable. He
said that the trend was not only a disincenive to producion, but
also made planning for development difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said developing countries should collectively press for
effective and efficient market-based instruments to hedge
comodity supply risks and stabilize prices, since locally the
liberalization of domestic economies had narrowed the scope of
government in commodity markets.

JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Arab members of
Knesset (MKs) have appealed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to carry on Israel's commitment to peace, reported Israel Radio

</P>
<P>
The Arab MKs made the call when they met with Netanyahu in his
office here Sunday night. The rightwing Likud premier expressed his
support for the peace process and pledged his commitment to the
equal treatment of all citizens, Jews and Arabs alike.
</P>
<P>
MK Abudl Wahab Darawshe told the radio that the atmosphere
during the meeting was generally good, but there were
differences.
</P>
<P>
"We demanded him to fulfill the agreements with the
Palestinian Authority (PA), the Oslo agreements, and also to
continue the peace process," said Darawshe. "Netanyahu said that
he wants to continue the peace process, but to examine the
agreements carefully. He doesn't want to make mistakes as he
said."

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Hits Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of food-poisoning
continued to spread in Australia as the number of confirmed cases
of salmonella rose to 19 in Queensland state.
</P>
<P>
State Health Minister Mike Horan said that a further 60
suspected cases were being monitored.
</P>
<P>
The food-poisoning cases were the same as those happened in
Victoria and South Australia states in the past months. Over 50
persons in the states suffered salmonella mbandaka after eating
contaminated peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
The 19 cases in Queensland were identified in Brisbane, Dalby,
Gatton, Ipswich and Caloundra. Eleven of them are children under
seven. None of them had been positively linked to peanut butter,
Horan said.
</P>
<P>
The Queensland Health Department took samples of recalled
peanut butter at the Peanut Company of Australia's factory near
Brisbane, the capital city of the state, last Wednesday. The
samples will be analyzed in Melbourne in Victoria state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, food-poisoning had caused General Foods, the United
States-based company producing 90 percent of peanut butter sold in
Australia, to recall all Kraft and ETA brand peanut butter with
use-by dates before March 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to General Foods, the source of contamination was a
batch of roast peanuts from a Queensland supplier. But Queensland
growers said that the contaminated nuts were more likely from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Horan said that contamination could happen at any stage after
peanuts were roasted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Implement Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today that there is an urgent need to
implement a pipeline project in view of the great increase of
future demand for gas among the members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Delivering an opening speech at the 14th ASEAN Energy Ministers
Meeting here, Anwar said a study on the master plan on natural gas
development and utilization in the ASEAN region indicates more
than six-fold increase in the ASEAN market from 23 million tons of
oil equivalent at present to about 150 million tons in 2020.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for regional infrastructures such as a
trans ASEAN-gas pipeline. ASEAN members will have to view the
pipeline project with greater urgency than before," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He also said there is a need to look at the potential in
enhancing intra-ASEAN energy trade like the export of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said there is also a need to look at other related
matters such as pricing policies, regulatory framework and
investment incentives in each member country to provide the
conducive environment to attract investors.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members should improve their efficiency in energy
utilization by the promotion of research and development of energy
efficiency measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, established in 1967, now groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urged to Cut Import Tariffs, Control Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Faced with an export growth decline
 during the first five months this year, Thai Farmers Research
Center has recommended reduction of import tariffs on raw
materials and prevention of fast labor cost growth.
</P>
<P>
The center said in a study that imported raw materials and
labor costs, on average, account for 31.6 percent and 10.6 percent
of total production costs respectively.
</P>
<P>
Therefore it is better to cut import tariffs on raw materials
and make sure that wages and salaries do not rise too fast, so as
to make export costs cheaper.
</P>
<P>
The center said the impact of an interest rate cut, as the
government has requested, is too small to lead to any significant
increase in Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
Thai exports in the first five months rose only 8.7 percent,
compared to 29.3 percent in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
During the five months, Thailand's trade deficit increased to
169.2 billion baht (6.77 billion US dollars), a 15.8 percent rise
from the same period in the previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Foreign
Affairs (DFA) said on Sunday that the government may soon lift its
ban on the entry of Filipino maids into Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The DFA said in a statement that Secretary Domingo Siazon will
announce this decision during his four-day visit to Singapore
starting July 16.
</P>
<P>
Siazon is also expected to renew an invitation from President
Fidel Ramos to Singaporean Prime Minister Go Chok Tong to visit
the Philippines at any time.
</P>
<P>
Go's scheduled visit to Manila was canceled as a result of the
public furor over the hanging of a Filipino maid in Singapore in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
The furor led to the down-grading of the two countries'
embassies and pullout of their ambassadors. The Philippines also
decided to ban maids to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Normal relations between the two countries were restored in
January this year, culminating in the exchange of ambassadors.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Gives Priority to All-round Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province,
China's largest special economic zone, is giving more attention to
all-round development. It is a switch from the past when the
province merely focused on real estate.
</P>
<P>
In line with local conditions and economic law, the province
has now formed a new economic structure, with manufacturing
industry as the leading factor, agriculture as the basis, and
tourism as the driving force.
</P>
<P>
Due to different political, economic and social factors, large
amounts of capital continued to flow into Hainan Island from 1988
when it was turned into a province and a special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
By June, 1993 the province had a savings surplus exceeding 20
billion yuan. From then investors from both home and abroad poured
huge amounts of funds into such areas as real estate, tourism,
finance and catering.
</P>
<P>
As a result the tertiary industries soon became the most
dynamic sector in the local economy, while the manufacturing
sector, which ought to have taken the leading position, had long
been overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the situation of "superficial prosperity" brought by
the real estate boom, the province began adopting forceful
measures in 1993 to adjust the economic structure to place the
local economy on a solid footing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period (1991-1995),
local economy began embarking on a healthy development track with
the gross domestic product (GDP) soaring to 38.1 billion yuan last
year, 5.6 times that of 1987.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is abundant in tourism resources, which has become the
most active and dynamic force for the local economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year around 1.23 million
tourists visited the province, up 51.7 percent from he
corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tropical agriculture, which enjoys bright
prospects, has become a hot investment for foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
So far some 430 foreign-funded agricultural enterprises have
been established, involving a contractual foreign capital of 350
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the most dynamic pillar industries of the province are
oil, gas and chemicals, automotive manufacturing, beverage and
food, chemical, fiber and textiles, medicines as well as pulp and
building materials.
</P>
<P>
The industrial fixed investment has been growing at an annual
rate of 42.7 percent, bringing the total investment to 12.7
billion yuan since 1988 and the gross industrial output value to
more than 14 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Import Valuation Shift Takes Effect in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of Customs
(BOC) today began to use "export value" as the basis for measuring
duties and taxes imposed on imported articles.
</P>
<P>
The BOC said the country's shift from the present "home
consumption value" to "export value" as a tool to assess duties
and taxes will allow importers to pay 20 percent less than before.
</P>
<P>
It said the transition will affect industries sector by
reducing or eradicating tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade
when a low tariff structure equals the invoice value.
</P>
<P>
But the BOC said the export value method is just a transitory
system until the shift is made to "transaction value" on or before
January 1, 2000.

SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 restaurants with
Japanese, Korean, French, American and Italian flavors, are
satisfying the tastebuds of diners in Shanghai, China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
The exotic atmosphere, and clean and comfortable environment,
attracts diners, including children who enjoy small gifts often
given as they tuck into their meals.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Fried Chicken, Mcdonalds and Pizza Hut have become
popular fast-food outlets in the city.
</P>
<P>

visits to Japan. The growing number encouraged Japanese investors
set up several large restaurants, where the light dishes meet the
tastes of residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
However the fairly high prices of Japanese dished have kept
some people away.
</P>

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million yuan deal to
renovate a world famous Buddha was agreed at a three-day tourism

and a thousand eyes" which sits in the resort's Puning Temple.
</P>
<P>
Located 230 kilometers northeast of Beijing, the summer resort
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) emperors was listed as one of the
Ten China Leading Scenic Zones, as well as a world cultural
heritage site under the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The festival, staged between June 26 and 28, drew
representatives from the tourist industry, relic and religious
circles from a dozen countries and regions, and from over 30
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The signed agreements also included the renovation of a number
of temples and halls, and the building of a ski run and amusement
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Weasels Tutors American Black-Foot Colleagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN. July 1 (Xinhua) -- Endangered American black-foot
weasels have reappeared on North American prairies after learning
how to hunt and protect themselves in the wilderness by their
coaches: 12 husky weasels from northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Northeast China Forestry University
received a letter from their American counterparts praising them
for their contributions to save the rare animals in North America.
</P>
<P>
Wild black-foot weasels were nearly extinct in the United
States in the 1980s, but 18 artificially-bred weasels lived under
the supervision of experts.
</P>
<P>
However, once set free in the wild, they were unable to fend
for themselves, and either were killed by hawks, or starved.
</P>
<P>
After repeated efforts to return the animals to their natural
surroundings failed, American experts brought in the weasels from
northeast China, that are a species similar to the American
weasels.
</P>
<P>
A research team of Chinese and American experts was formed to
study the American black-foot weasels and the Chinese weasels.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jianzhang, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
supervised the study of the Chinese weasels in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Following four years of study, Chinese scientists wrote a
detailed report about the Chinese weasels' viability, nutrition
needs and natural enemies, and sent 12 wild Chinese weasels to
America.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese researchers' report, American experts
conducted training programs for the black-foot weasels to teach
them how to adapt to nature.
</P>
<P>
The 12 Chinese weasels also coached their American colleagues,
and the number of black-foot weasels rapidly increased to 500.
</P>
<P>
Some of the black-foot weasels have been successfully returned
to nature.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic Resigns as "President" of Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic was forced to resigned as "president" of Bosnian Serbs
under mounting international pressure, the international mediator
Carl Bildt said in a statement issued in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said an official document signed and sealed by Karadzic,
under which Karadzic was replaced by deputy Biljana Plavsic as
functioning president, was handed to him. The document takes
legal effect today.
</P>
<P>
Bildt hailed the move as "a vital step" the Bosnian Serbs made
in the right direction and a manifestation of their willingness to
distance themselves from the war criminal indicted by the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that as from June 30 Karadzic will not exercise any
public functions or public powers as President in Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
He added that this is by no means Bosnian Serb's "last step,"
adding he would watch closely if there is an effective handover of
power.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bildt delivered an ultimatum to Karadzic,
threatening to revive international sanctions against the Bosnian
Serbs and Yugoslavia if he would not step down before July 1.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic's resignation is in clear response to pressures from
looming fresh sanctions and efforts of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic has been in power as leader of Bosnian Serbs since
April 1992 and is wanted for trial by The Hague war crimes
tribunal since the 43-month Bosnian conflict ended last year.

<HEADLINE> Books Busy Going in and Out of "Bank" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Books circulate just like money at
a "book bank" in Chengdu, capital city of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Readers save the books which have been gathering dust on their
shelves, and receive ten percent of interest a year later.
</P>
<P>
With a library card they can have access to all the books,
stored in the bank, use a readers salon and listen to speeches.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also sell the books for readers when they decide
not to keep them any longer.
</P>
<P>
"Books cost too much these days, even well-off people like me
feel it is hard to afford many books. That is why I opened the
book bank," said Huang Weicai, manager of the book bank, who was
once the owner of a chafing dish restaurant.
</P>
<P>
"Reading is my first interest, running a restaurant only comes
second. I used to spend one-third of my monthly income on books,"
Huang said keenly.
</P>
<P>
Senior professor Yang Yuanhong said: "The book bank helps
people share the books, which would be of little use if kept at
home. It is extraordinary to see books shared by a large group of
people, just like knowledge is shared all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Zhong Song, a senior student at Sichuan Union University was
worried about his collection of over a hundred books before he
heard about the bank.
</P>
<P>
"The bank will give my books a final resting place, where they
can be read by the people who really love books, instead of being
sold as waste paper," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has collected thousands of books during just one and a
half months since it opened. Each day it receives students and
teachers from the nearby universities and some technicians,
working temporarily in the city.

TIRANA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Albania's ruling Democratic Party
today asked outgoing Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi to stay in
the office he has held since the party came to power four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The party, that won 122 of 140 parliamentary seats in the
disputed legislative elections late May and early June, has
presented Meksi's nomination to President Sali Berisha, also a
Democrat. The president will seek parliamentary endorsement of the
nomination when it holds its first meeting July 1.
</P>
<P>
Tritan Shehu, Democratic Party leader, is nominated deputy
prime minister while Pjeter Arbnori, current parliamentary
speaker, would continue in his post.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, the Socialist Party, has refused to take
up the seats it won in parliament, dismissing the country's third
multi-party elections as fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats will face a slim parliamentary opposition, with
only two minor right wing parties -- the Republicans and National
Front -- and the ethnic Greek Union of Human Rights taking up
their seats.

Pearl River is being turned into a State tourism zone.
</P>

area, a water amusement area, an agricultural viewing area, a
holiday resort, a conference center and a shopping area.
</P>

Construction is also under way to improve links to the island
by introducing ferry boats and expanding the ferry dock. Roads

<HEADLINE> China Bans 999 Paper Mills Along Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of small paper mills along
the Huaihe River were being shut down by zero hour today under an
order from the State Bureau of Environmental Protection. The ban
will affect a total of 999 mills, officials reported.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, claimed that paper mills ignoring the ban will be
seriously punished.
</P>
<P>
Small paper mills indicate those with annual production
capacities under 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily quoted the official as saying that the
ban was being imposed to curb pollution of the Huaihe River, which
runs through Henan, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
The order also requires local power units to stop electricity
supplies to the mills, the administrative departments for industry
and commerce to withdraw the licenses, and banks to take back
loans from the small paper mills.
</P>
<P>
By yesterday afternoon small paper mills in Henan, Shandong and
Anhui had all stopped the operation of their chemical pulp-making
facilities, while several small paper mills in Jiangsu remained
operational.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection has been urging
the shutdown of those paper mills in Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also warned against the transfer of the small paper
mills to other places in an effort to guarantee the purity of the
Huaihe River.

<HEADLINE> China's Rubber Industry Bounces to World Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 1 (Xinhua) -- China's rubber industry is walking
tall after becoming the world's top producer of rubber-soled shoes.
</P>
<P>
More than 53 billion pairs of shoes were made in China last
year, taking the country to top spot in the world for rubber-sole
shoe output.
</P>
<P>
The country, where the main mode of transport is pedal power,
also ranks number one in the world for the number of bicycle tires
made. Around 127 million rolled off the production lines in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a hat trick of successes the country also hit the world's
top spot for reclaiming rubber - with over 300,000 tons recycled.
</P>
<P>
The trio of top places helped China's rubber industry to bounce
ahead to catch up with world advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
Rubber consumption exceeded 1.3 million tons last year, ranking
China in third place in the world after the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The country was also listed in fourth place worldwide after
the United States, Japan and France by producing nearly 56 million
vehicle tires last year.
</P>
<P>
During recent years the country has improved its application of
technological advances in the rubber industry, achieving
remarkable success in restructuring its range of products.
</P>
<P>
Now radial tires account for 13 percent of the country's total
tire production. And high-grade rubber-soled shoes account for 25
percent of the country's total rubber-soled shoes.
</P>
<P>
China has also developed a group of fine rubber products for
automobile, electronics, building materials, and household
appliances industries.

<HEADLINE> Germany Snatches Euro Soccer Championship Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- European soccer superpower Germany
has snatched its third Euro Soccer Championship title in Sunday
evening when they defeated dark horse Czech Republic 2-1 in the
Euro Soccer final played at the Wembley Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Czech Republic, which has defeated favorite Italy, Portugal and
France en route to Sunday's final, launched waves of effective
attacks upon their strong opponents from the beginning of the game
and displayed excellent footwork.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which was suffering from a shortage of Starters, was
forced to played defensive football at the early stages of the
match, but lost no chance to stage swift counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
The Czech team had rocked Germany with a disputed penalty kick
at the 59 minute after Karel Poborsky was felled by German
fullback Mattihias Sammer around the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
The German players, led by its captain Juergen Klingsmann,
launched fierce counterattacks in an effort to turn the tables and
the German team's efforts were paid off at the 73 minute when
Oliver Bierhoff of Germay hit an estonishing equaliser from a
direct kick.
</P>
<P>
During the "sudden death" overtime, Bierhoff helped Germany to
take its third European Soccer honour by scoring a "golden goal"
at the 95 minute.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the stunning match, the German hero said, "I was
just about to turn to my left foot when I heard Marco Bode shout
now turn right".
</P>
<P>
"So I did that and I just whacked the ball. All I could see was
the ball going in the far corner. Afterwards it was just a sea of
happniess. I was aware that was a Golden Goal and I had scored
it," Bierhoff said.
</P>
<P>
German coach Berti Vogts told a press conference, "the best
team of the Championship rightly won the title. We had great
problems and the way the players worked and sacrificed they
deserved the title."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Czech coach Dusan Uhrn hit out at officials after a
lineman's flag cast doubt over the winning goal, "I can't explain
how he allowed it. I looked at the linesman after the goal and he
had his flag up."
</P>
<P>
"Then he put it down, but raised it again and then referee
ignored him. I have not seen a replay, but one thing is clear, the
linesman's flag was up".

<HEADLINE> Icy Jacket To Cool Hot Olympians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Olympic team will
be ice-clayed when they warm up for competitions at the Atlanta
games this month.
</P>
<P>
To combat the heat and humidity in the US city, the Australian
Institute of Sport (AIS) developed an ice-filled vest for
Australian athletes to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
AIS physiologist David Martin told local press that the vest
could make a difference between a bronze and a gold medal in
Atlanta, where temperature is expected to be above 30 C degrees
with a humidity of 80-90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The vest has a number of pockets that athletes can put ice
in. It helps to cool the skin of athletes quickly, thus ensuring
that optimal blood supply flow to the muscles rather than to the
surface of the body.
</P>
<P>
International research showed that athletes competed better and
longer in the heat if their skin and core temperature were kept
cool.
</P>
<P>
A fraction of a second will mean the difference between a
bronze and a gold medal in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
AIS has trialed the vest on the Australian men's hockey team.
</P>
<P>
Hockey player Ken Wark said that the vest helped to bring the
body temperature down quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will be a huge advantage, maybe a quarter of
a percent -- it's not going to be a substitute for trapping the
ball--but anything that helps the players feel comfortable and
stay focused will help," team coach Frank Murray said.
</P>
<P>
AIS has adjusted the vest to suit the specific need of
different athletes competing outdoors in sports like rowing,
canoeing, hockey, cyclying and track and field. The athletes will
wear the vest during their warm up to prevent over heating. Some
may even elect to compete in it.
</P>
<P>
All major sports nations have developed methods to cope with
the Atlanta heat, including refrigerated room and ice baths. But
the Australian vest was simpler and more portable than other
techniques, Martin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shuttle Columbia Returns July 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Jacques Favier, the French
astronaut working on the U.S. space shuttle Columbia orbiting 278
kilometers above the earth, told journalists here today from the
sky that he is doing so well as a fish in the water.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference transmitted live from space at the
National Center of Space Study here, the 47-year-old engineer from
the Commission of Atomic Energy of France, said that he was really
taken by surprise when the space shuttle took off 11 days ago,
because he no more felt like in another world, "without the sense
of high or low."
</P>
<P>
"Several hours later, I began to swim like a fish in water,"
said Favier, sitting together with six other members of the crew.
</P>
<P>
Commander Tom Henriks, a colonel of the U.S. Air Force, said
that all crew members were doing exceptionally well. He said that
he was following news about the terrorist attack on an American
air base in Saudi Arabia last week.
</P>
<P>
"We see a best earth (from space) and we wish to be able to
share this vision to help bring about peace," said Henriks.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk said that when returns to
his house, he will have a different view about the world. He said
that to see the earth from space is a uniquely good experience.
</P>
<P>
Susan Helms,the only woman astronaut on board, said the
scientific experiments on micro-gravity the crew are conducting
are the uniquely important.
</P>
<P>
Favier is working on experiments on metallurgy and alloy in a
space-lab designed by the European Space Agency. He said his
experiments would produce new materials that could be soon put to
use.
</P>
<P>
The Columbia will land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
on July 7. It will set a new record of the time of stay in space.

The fourth PASOK national congress took place four days after
the founder of the party Papandreou died of heart attack. It is
believed that simitis's victory will gurantee the smooth
transition of the party to the post-Papandreou ear.
