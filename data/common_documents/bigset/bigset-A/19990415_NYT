NFL PLAYS MIND GAMES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You're a kid just out of college interviewing for
your first job. Not just any position, mind you, but
in-a-Willie-Wonka-world work.
</P>
<P>
   You have an impressive resume and an impeccable background for
someone who's only 22. Accordingly, you find yourself with your
foot half in the door of the most prestigious establishments.
</P>
<P>
   You have prepared your whole life for this chance. You ache to
convey how capable you are for this job, how well you'll acquit
yourself if given the chance. You sit down for that
make-or-break-first interview, confident you can deftly handle any
line of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   And then they throw at you this:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)You prefer a shower to a bathtub. True or false.(end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   So that's the NFL's idea of coming clean.
</P>
<P>
   If you're former UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, you have no
earthly idea what your bathing habits have to do with driving the
length of the field in the final two minutes for the winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, isn't the best answer ``none of the above?'' Wouldn't
they prefer that you not bathe at all, at least not on weekends,
the better to discourage opposing defensive players from getting
too close to you? That's what you'd like to say, in a snide sort of
way.
</P>
<P>
   You do snicker at the NFL's fixation with figures. The teams are
as bad as Hugh Hefner that way. As much as they obsess over how
much you bench press, you'd think they expect you to literally
carry their team to the Super Bowl someday.
</P>
<P>
   And does it really matter how fast or far your throws travel?
The last time you checked, you had a football in your hands, not a
baseball or a javelin.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's your height (6-foot). Didn't Doug Flutie expose the
6-foot-4 prototype passer as a tall tale? And Joe Montana? Fellow
southpaw Steve Young has less than an inch on you but the way
people talk you'd think it was a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they start to miss the forest for the trees,''
you say.
</P>
<P>
   This is the game the NFL plays, though, and so, if you're Cade
McNown you play along.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's draft, the focus hopefully will shift to your
stout heart and smarts. All that'll matter is your ability to move
the chains and make big plays and consistently close the deal. But
for now, you tell the NFL team representatives whatever it is they
want to know.
</P>
<P>
   And you keep the answers mostly to yourself. When a reporter
asks you about the bathing question, you feign forgetfulness. Of
the 400 questions on the psychological profile test administered by
the New York Giants, you'll own up to answering one:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Sometimes I feel that I am about to go to pieces.
True or false.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   A no-brainer. ``I don't ever feel that way,'' you say.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Cade McNown, you laugh when people ask if this yawning
audition played out in the press has been nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out and do my best,'' you say. ``It's not like I'm
trying to win anybody over. It's not a pride thing with me. I don't
care where I'm drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   You are part of a quarterback class that many people are calling
the finest since 1983 when six signal callers _ John Elway and Dan
Marino among them _ were selected in the first round. It's
conceivable that four of the first six picks Saturday in New York
will be quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   You keep reading that you won't be one of them. The so-called
experts have you going after Tim Couch, Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb
and Daunte Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can throw harder than a lot of guys being hyped up right
now,'' you say. ``I see what people are saying and I laugh at it
quite a bit. It's not like what Mel Kiper says is what (the teams)
go by.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're Cade McNown, you know teams will have an exhaustive
plan going into the draft but won't hesitate to adjust on the fly.
They'll scramble to take whatever's there for them, just like you
did with much success during your four years as a starter at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take (what the prognosticators) say seriously,'' you
say. ``Obviously a lot of my future is going to depend on Saturday.
But you can't let it eat you up.''
</P>
<P>
   You long for the days before the advent of cable television and
its pick-by-excruciating-pick coverage. In a bygone era NFL
representatives thought nothing of bringing football magazines to
the draft table, armed as they were with no more insider's
knowledge than the modern-day fan who opts into a fantasy league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they do so much of that stuff,'' you say. ``I
don't think it's as hard as people are making it. They see enough
of us on film. I don't know. Maybe there's something to it. I don't
know what it is. It's just sort of a weeding-out process, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Some answers are likely to get you yanked from teams' boards
faster than others:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)You often think of injuring yourself and others.
True or false.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone (admits to) that one, you might want to do further
testing,'' you say, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Cade McNown, you agree with Minnesota player-personnel
director Scott Studlow, who says, ``There's a lot of overkill in
our business.'' &QL;

A SPECIAL RACE FOR HERTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach is a special
race for CART FedEx Championship veteran Bryan Herta. How special?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked me, `If you could win one race all year what
would it be?''' said the 28-year-old Valencia native, who drives
the Shell Ford-Cosworth/Reynard for Team Rahal. ``I mean, I
wouldn't hesitate (to answer) that (Long Beach) is the race I would
choose. They are all important, but emotionally or personally, this
would probably be the biggest single accomplishment I could have
during the season. This is the race that made me want to become a
(Champ car) driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Herta has raced six times in Long Beach but has never won not
even in his Indy Lights championship season of 1993. Herta finished
third at Long Beach that year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Herta had his best shot at a Long Beach win after
starting on the pole and having the lead with two laps remaining.
But, with Herta running on severely worn tires, Alex Zanardi shot
past on the 104th lap. Herta had to settle for third place after
also being passed by Dario Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we had a great car last year,'' Herta said.
</P>
<P>
   Herta did take his first CART victory later in the season when
he took the checkered flag at Laguna Seca.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of struggled through a dry spell together,'' said
Herta, who has six second and third-place finishes in 76 CART
starts. ``Everybody knows we have been oh so close so many times.
But it seems the fates had it against us or sometimes we had it
against us. It's hard to talk about championships until you can be
a race winner. Those things kind of go hand in had and race winning
comes before the championship part.''

Moore
</P>
<P>
   's home country of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And when Moore was growing up, he was an accomplished
goaltender. In fact, several of his former teammates play hockey
for a living including Paul Kariya
</P>
<P>
   of the Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of think where I would be (if I chose hockey),'' said
Moore. ``You never know what would have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore had to make a choice when he was in his early teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, I was doing both,'' Moore said. ``I would race
2-3 times a week and play hockey 3-4 times a week. My dad told me
to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore hasn't been on skates since he was 17.
</P>

   Four of of the Toyota-powered cars participating in the Champ
Car competition at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach will be

   Obviously, the most prominent anniversary this weekend is the
25th renewal of the Long Beach Grand Prix. But, there also's a
significant anniversary for the PPG-Dayton Indy Lights Championship
as Sunday marks six years to the day that an Indy Lights graduate
Paul Tracy
</P>
<P>
   won a CART race for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul proved that a driver trained in Indy Lights can win in
CART,'' Indy Lights president Roger Bailey
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   Further proof of that comes in the first two races of this
season when Indy Light graduates Greg Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Adrian Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   claimed wins at Homestead and Japan respectively. Other Indy
Light graduates racing in CART are 1998 rookie of the year Tony
Kanaan

   Patrick Racing general manager Jim McGee
</P>
<P>
   took part in his 85th career CART victory when Adrian Fernandez
</P>
<P>
   took the checkered flag last Saturday at Japan. The win puts
McGee into a tie with George Bignotti
</P>
<P>
   for most career wins by a general-team manager or chief
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe a deep debt of gratitude to the drivers, owners,
mechanics and all the other people who supported me over the
years,'' said the 61-year-old McGee, who is in his 40th CART year.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers who McGee has been associated with include series
champions Mario Andretti

METS BEAT MARLINS AS FRANCO GETS 400TH SAVE OF HIS CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco had been especially quiet lately, not
wanting too talk too much about anything. Franco knew that an
amazing milestone was one inning away for him. All Franco needed
was one more successful ninth to achieve a special place in
baseball history, and the thought of it turned the talkative Franco
silent.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco's emotions erupted on Wednesday night after he struck
out Jorge Fabregas with a sweet slider to preserve the Mets' 4-1
victory over the Marlins and record the 400th save of his major
league career. Franco, the little left-hander from Brooklyn, had
become only the second pitcher in history to reach that lofty
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   After Franco finished the save in style by striking out the
side, thanks to Edgardo Alfonzo botching a pop-up before Fabregas
batted, he jumped up and down like a pogo stick and tossed his
glove. Catcher Todd Pratt rushed to the mound and gave Franco a
bearhug and then the rest of the Mets emptied out of the dugout and
lifted Franco even higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Franco said. ``But now I'd like to go onto the
next level and make it to the post-season. Hopefully, this will be
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be. Orel Hershiser had enough fastballs, sinkers
and sliders and enough help from the wind in nudging his pitches to
guide the Mets to their seventh victory in the last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt and Alfonzo stroked run-scoring doubles and the the Marlin
starter, Jesus Sanchez, also walked in a run during a three-run
second. Robin Ventura's homer was New York's only hit after the
second, but it did not matter since Turk Wendell struck out two in
one and one-third innings, Armando Benitez tossed a 1-2-3 eighth
and Franco finished with a flourish to creep within 78 saves of Lee
Smith, the career leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very special to see,'' said Hershiser, who had to put
his uniform pants back on and scamper from the clubhouse to the
dugout to watch Franco's ninth. ``It's an amazing feat. It's
probably the only time that any of us will ever have a teammate get
400 saves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Franco, who has accomplished an amazing amount
for a 5-foot-10-inch pitcher who was told he was too small and did
not throw hard enough to make it as a professional, was asked if
could overtake Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's reachable,'' he said. ``Just as long as I get the
opportunities and stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets gave Franco three bottles of Dom Perignon and he poured
it into plastic flutes as his teammates clapped. Franco held up the
Champagne and said, ``This is the first of many celebrations,
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no mysteries about what the 40-year-old Hershiser
does, which is what made his easy effort so impressive. He worked
into the sixth inning and limited Florida to one run on three hits
while striking out two and walking two. Although Hershiser needed
relief help after five and two-thirds innings, the Mets smiled.
They will gladly take this kind of start from Hershiser every five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Licking his fingers as he circled the mound and never leaving
the rubber during an at-bat, Hershiser was almost robotic in his
approach. Hershiser did not permit a hit until Mark Kotsay singled
with two outs in the fourth and he glided through four innings on
40 pitches. A single, a hit batter and a walk put him in a
precarious position in the fifth, but he gave up Bruce Aven's
sacrifice fly and stranded two runners to protect the 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what we wanted,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He threw strikes, he was competitive and gave us a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between Hershiser and Sanchez was significant.
While Hershiser took a mere 10 pitches to buzz through the first
two innings without a blemish, Sanchez labored through 65 pitches
while walking six and was fortunate to only allow three runs.
Sanchez, who was part of the deal that brought Al Leiter from the
Marlins, is 0-4 against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   With a relatively small crowd of 15,729 at Shea on this cool
night, there was little drama until Franco started warming up in
the eighth. Some fans chanted, ``Four hundred, four hundred,'' as
Franco handled the ninth. With his wife, Rose, and his brother,
Jim, at Shea, Franco, the lefty from Brooklyn, made history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a pretty good accomplishment for me,'' said Franco.
``Some people don't believe in the save statistic. It's a pretty
good accomplishment for me to be the second guy in the game to get
it.''

YANKEES CRUSH ORIOLES, 14-7
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cynics could exit Yankee Stadium last night and gnaw
on the image of Hideki Irabu nearly blowing a six-run lead.
Optimists could wonder if the Yankees, now 7-1 after their 14-7
thrashing of Baltimore, might be even stronger than last year.
Realists could ponder the spiraling Orioles, playing like a truly
dreadful team.
</P>
<P>
   There was something for everybody but baseball purists in the
strange, 3-hour-51-minute game, which the Yankees finally broke
open with a four-run rally in the eighth inning. The Yankees' Chuck
Knoblauch went 5 for 5 and Paul O'Neill had four runs batted in,
reaching 1,001 for his career and prompting a curtain call from the
26,898 in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   By picking up his second victory in two starts, David Cone has
as many victories as the Orioles (2-6). Roger Clemens will try to
complete the sweep for the Yankees and extend his personal 16-game
winning streak on Thursday night against Mike Mussina, the
Baltimore ace, who snapped Randy Johnson's 16-game winning streak
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina, who is among the American League's elite pitchers, is
capable of dominating the Yankees, but one game on one night won't
alter the fact that the Orioles, who have a payroll of about $85
million, appear as if they will be an expensive disaster this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Baltimore shortcomings are illuminated when the
Orioles play the Yankees. Many of the Yankees are homegrown
products of the farm system, players such as Derek Jeter, Bernie
Williams, Mariano Rivera and Ramiro Mendoza; the Orioles have
relied on free agent signings. The Yankees have had a steady
infusion of dynamic young players like Jeter; the Orioles are an
old team _ catcher Charles Johnson is the only everyday player who
is still developing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are loaded with tremendous athletes, whose abilities
can be seen in those sprints from first to third, or when fielders
converge on a ball hit into seemingly open spaces, or when Orlando
Hernandez and Rivera move to field bunts; the Orioles are slow and
lifeless in their movements. The Yankees appear to be almost as
good as they were in 1998; the Orioles went 79-83 last summer and
could be even worse this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees extended their string of victories over Baltimore to
eight games, even though they probably played their worst baseball
of 1999 in the first two games of this series. With some erratic
defense, the Yankees allowed four unearned runs to Baltimore the
last two nights, or as many unearned runs as the Yankees
surrendered in a 32-game stretch last year, from April 30 to June
5.
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw 59 pitches in his first two innings on Wednesday
night, and in light of the 1.51 earned run average compiled by the
Yankees' starters in the first seven games of this year, Cone
probably was more vulnerable last night than any Yankee starter in
any game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles failed to exploit Cone's early-inning struggles,
or the Yankees' various defensive lapses. Baltimore took a 1-0 lead
in the top of the first inning on Wednesday night, and the Orioles
immediately surrendered three runs, in listless fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson, who pitched against the Yankees perhaps better
than anybody else last year, once again came at them with his
fastball on Wednesday night. But he could not keep his pitches down
in the strike zone, and to compensate, he tried throwing harder;
the harder he tried, the higher his pitches sailed.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the bottom of the first inning, Knoblauch fouled off
several fastballs, all of them about the same speed. Finally,
Knoblauch timed a fastball just right and slammed it down the right
field line, just inside the foul pole and into the second row of
seats. So much for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson jammed Derek Jeter with a fastball, but Jeter fought it
off and blooped a double down the first base line. Erickson tried
harder, threw harder, and his sinker didn't sink. He walked
O'Neill. Williams then chopped a grounder to first. Will Clark
fielded it, turned and started throwing to second, then thought
better of it and flipped the ball to first, where Erickson had
moved to cover the base. Easy play.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Erickson was staring at second base, where he
thought Clark had thrown the ball. Instead, Clark's underhand flip
hit Erickson in the gut and fell to the ground, a play made for a
blooper reel. The Yankees went on to score two more runs when Cal
Ripken bobbled a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drove Erickson from the mound in the fourth inning,
six straight hitters reaching base after there were two outs.
Knoblauch singled, Jeter walked, O'Neill laced a single _ the
Yankees were hitting everything hard by then _ before Williams
slammed a triple to the wall in left-center. Tino Martinez reached
base when the home plate umpire Terry Craft ruled mistakenly that
he had been hit by a pitch, Chili Davis smashed a two-run double,
and with the Orioles losing, 8-2, Erickson was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Yankees' interim manager, Don Zimmer,
wished aloud for a situation in which he could pitch Irabu. Maybe
if Cone gets through five innings with a five-run lead, Zimmer
could use Irabu in an extended outing. The Yankees led by six runs
after six innings, and Irabu relieved in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu retired just one of the six hitters he faced, allowing
five runs, and when he walked off the mound and into a hurricane of
boos, the Yankees' lead had been cut to a single run.

JOHNSON: LATE LOSS NOT ALL BAD 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Todd Hundley walked into the clubhouse and didn't need
to check the lineup card. There was no way he'd be on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not after catching 15 innings for the Dodgers the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I got run over by a truck,'' Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of that going around Bank One Ballpark on
Wednesday, as people reminisced about the Arizona Diamondbacks' 7-6
win in 16 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost it, it was good for a lot of reasons,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``Defensively, we got to play
in certain types of situations, the players got to know how I want
to play it.... They performed and it was under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the longest game the Dodgers have played since they went 18
innings on Aug. 3, 1996. That was a 5-3 loss to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Dodgers lost to the Diamondbacks in this
5-hour, 14-minute marathon, the excitement of the situation wasn't
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored twice in the top of the ninth to tie it 4-4,
narrowly missing a win when Dave Hansen's pinch-hit triple hit a
few inches from the top of the wall. In the 10th, the Dodgers' Dave
Mlicki pitched out of a bases-loaded, none-out situation and then
escaped a first-and-third situation in the 11th when second baseman
Eric Young fielded the ball behind second and flipped to Tripp
Cromer, who made a spinning pivot at second and threw to first to
complete a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they had the bases loaded and nobody out, that's as
intense and as exciting as you can get,'' Hundley said. ``When
(Young) and Tripp pulled that off, it was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain of it for the Dodgers was scoring twice in the 16th
inning to take a 6-4 lead only to have Kelly Stinnett hit a
pinch-hit two-run homer in the bottom of the inning to tie it
before Dante Powell's RBI double ended it.
</P>
<P>
   Role reversal: The Dodgers' Mark Grudzielanek is an offensive
shortstop who's had trouble with the fielding and throwing part
during the past three years. However, Grudzielanek's game has been
the opposite of that so far.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday, Grudzielanek had yet to commit an error. The
flip side was Grudzielanek's batting average, which has doubled in
the past few days to .222. He also did not have an extra-base hit
nor an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen no Rusty: Hansen entered Wednesday 5 for 6 in pinch-hit
attempts, with his lone out being a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his managerial career, Johnson has had a few good
ones who specialized in coming off the bench to deliver key hits
late in games. The guy he talks about the most is Rusty Staub, who
was with Johnson in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hansen) reminds me of Rusty Staub, but I hope he doesn't
start acting like Rusty and coming out in the sixth inning,''
Johnson said. ``Maybe he'll be a restaurant owner and become a wine
connoisseur.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Hundley was replaced in the starting
lineup by catcher Paul LoDuca, who was enjoying a type of
homecoming. LoDuca, a Brooklyn native, played collegiately at
Arizona State and resides in Peoria, a Phoenix suburb.... Arizona's
Bobby Chouinard picked up the win Tuesday, and his reward was a
trip to Triple-A Tucson. He was sent there before Wednesday's game
and replaced with pitcher Vladimir Nunez.... The Dodgers' Eric
Karros singled in the second inning to push his hitting streak to
nine, matching the number of games the Dodgers played.

NUGGETS TOP NETS, 120-97
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The New Jersey Nets have apparently given up on the
idea of guarding people. Just a week after building a reputation as
a budding defensive force, the most disappointing team in the
Eastern Conference has reverted to the permeable club that lets
opponents drive the lane for resounding dunks and shoot wide-open
jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games of this once-promising West Coast trip have
washed away the memories of the assistant coach Eddie Jordan's
great pick-and-roll schemes and made Kendall Gill's record-setting
steals spree seem like a distant mirage. ON Wednesday night, it was
the woeful Denver Nuggets who accepted the Nets' benevolence.
Draining uncontested 3-pointers like layups and giving the
McNichols Arena crowd more than its share of scintillating slams by
Antonio McDyess, the Nuggets drilled the Nets, 120-97.
</P>
<P>
   The way Denver picked apart the Nets' sluggish rotations and
footwork to record a season high in points, it was hard to believe
it had won only 11 games before welcoming the Nets with open arms.
The same could be said for the Los Angeles Clippers, who scored a
season-high 109 points Tuesday night in beating the Nets for only
their sixth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess led Denver with 36 points and 10 rebounds, but he was
not alone in providing highlights. Five Nuggets scored in double
figures as Denver made 10 of 14 3-pointers. Chauncey Billups led
the long-distance display with four triples and scored 26 points.
Danny Fortson complemented McDyess inside with a powerful 18-point,
17-rebound showing.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, the worst defensive team in the league, was content to
outscore the Nets, thus leading to big statistics for a couple of
Nets. Keith Van Horn and Stephon Marbury scored 25 points apiece,
and Marbury also had 10 assists. Gill added 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Nets' third straight and dropped them to 10-28
over all. They are 7-11 under the interim coach Don Casey and visit
the Seattle Supersonics on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have struggled inside over the past three games, and it
is no mystery why. The only intriguing issue, in fact, is how they
won five of six games with such a depleted front line. Van Horn,
for all his ability, is not a strong post-up player. And while
Jamie Feick _ the starting center in the absence of the injured
Jayson Williams _ has rebounded well, he is not an offensive threat
on the low block. And at 6 feet 8 inches, Feick is almost always
outsized.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not on Wednesday night. In fact, the smallish Nets
were bigger than the Nuggets. With Denver's rookie center, Raef
LaFrentz, out for the season with a knee injury, it started a front
line of McDyess (6-9), Fortson (6-7) and Bryant Stith (6-5). Still,
the Nets, with Van Horn providing all their inside punch, were
outplayed in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and McDyess, seemingly destined to become two of the
league's best power forwards, waged a beautiful battle in the first
half. Neither could stop the other, so it became a question of who
could outscore whom. Van Horn, hitting 7 of 8 shots, had the most
productive first half with 17 points, but McDyess had a couple of
explosive crowd-pleasing dunks in transition while scoring 14
before the break.
</P>
<P>
   In a game where playoff implications do not exist, one-on-one
matchups are inevitable, and Marbury and Nick Van Exel put on the
perimeter's equivalent of Van Horn vs. McDyess. Marbury ran the
finer floor game in the first half, dropping dazzling passes to his
teammates to record six assists in the first quarter. If the Nets
had hit more open jump shots, his total would have reached double
figures.
</P>
<P>
   But while Marbury spread the ball around, Van Exel took it upon
himself to score, notching 11 points in the first 12 minutes. In
addition to drilling a pull-up 3-pointer in transition, he made two
spectacular layups over Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The individual matchups lost their luster when the Nuggets used
a 12-2 run to pull away in the second quarter. Fortson, eclipsing
his per game averages in the first half with 10 points and 11
rebounds, led the critical charge with 4 points, and the reserves
Eric Washington and Johnny Taylor each added 3-pointers. &QL;

LOCKYER INVESTIGATES GAS PRICE HIKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Daily News staff writer Steve Carney contributed to this story. 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amid seemingly random, dramatic hikes in gas
prices, Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is investigating
whether oil companies are gouging motorists at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he is suspicious of the recent 45- to
50-cent-a-gallon spike, and his probe will include whether price
fixing and recent mergers of Mobil and Exxon, Arco and British
Petroleum played a role. He said he is perplexed why gasoline costs
an average of 98 cents per gallon in Georgia as compared to $1.70
in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil industry's explanations that were provided involve the
refinery fires in the Bay Area and OPEC's policies that have
increased the world price of oil,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to accept their explanation because there
is a greater supply of oil products on hand and a larger production
of new products this month compared to a year ago. If those factors
affect the price, it would seem to be a reason for the price to be
going down, not up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His investigation could lead to legal action, in an effort to
force oil companies to drop prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation adds to the government's growing response to
gas price hikes, including a request for a Justice Department probe
of price fixing and a Los Angeles City Council vote protesting the
cost of gas.
</P>
<P>
   At the pumps Wednesday, motorists uniformly welcomed Lockyer's
investigation as a step toward price relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's smart,'' said Rebecca Feldman, 23, a resident
of the Woodland Hills community in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley who
stopped for a tank of gas at Ventura Shell in Woodland Hills.
``Everybody has to have gas, especially in L.A. It's a commodity we
can't do without.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langland, spokesman for Arco in Los Angeles, said the oil
industry has not colluded in setting prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, in a very short period of time, four refineries
on the West Coast have had production problems,'' he said. ``When
you have that much of a tightening of supply, you'll see price
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   With the supply of gasoline now coming back, Langland said
prices should start coming down at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Langland noted that the difference in prices of gasoline between
Georgia and California is mostly due to differences in taxes and
air quality guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Californians, who are burdened with the fourth-highest gasoline
tax in the country, pay 48 cents a gallon in federal, state and
local taxes, compared with 38.4 cents a gallon in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have the cleanest-burning gasoline in the world,''
Langland said. ``The California Air Resources Board estimates that
gasoline here costs an additional 5 to 15 cents a gallon than
gasoline found in the rest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline industry experts agreed with Langland that prices
should start to drop. Heralding that, they said, is that gasoline
prices are falling on the New York Mercantile Exchange, mostly due
to reports that supplies are much larger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy
Commission, said prices have already dropped at the wholesale
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some retailers are actually posting lower prices,'' Chandler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gas station owners said the cut in prices couldn't come soon
enough. Lockyer's probe was prompted by his recent meeting with
station owners and others who decried the ``inexplicable,
illogical, random spikes'' in gasoline prices in California, said
Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura Shell Manager Bud Clark in Woodland Hills said the high
prices are placing him between the oil companies and his customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They raise the prices on us, and we have to pass it on to the
public,'' he said. ``Otherwise, we'd have to close the doors, and
there wouldn't be any gas for anybody. It's hurting us now because
people aren't driving as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who has been at the same location for 18 years, said he
is paying $1.09 per gallon for regular unleaded and is charging
customers $1.59. But he said he only makes 2 to 3 cents a gallon
profit after paying state and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal move Wednesday mirroring Lockyer's actions, U.S.
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., asked the Justice Department to look into a
pattern of price collusion and possible anti-trust violations by
the oil industry to assess the reasons behind the recent 31 percent
rise in gasoline prices on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some price increases may well be attributable to a
tightening of overseas supplies and to a recent series of refinery
fires, the size and pattern of recent price hikes certainly raises
questions of anti-competitive practices by the gas companies,''
Wyden wrote in a letter to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Post, 83, of the Lake Sherwood community of Los Angeles,
called the high prices ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really ugly,'' she said, while putting $20 worth
of premium into her Lexus. ``I have all kinds of money, but I shop
for gasoline.''

PANEL CALLS FOR PROBE  OF BABBITT IN CASINO DENIAL 
 'TIL DR. DEATH DO US PART

<P>
   The judge and prosecutors in Dr. Jack Kevorkian's recent murder
trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are hypocrites or
fools, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Kevorkian is an inno cent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, sir, is above the law. No one,'' Judge Jessica Cooper
told Kevorkian at his sentencing this week. He was convicted of
second-degree murder. ``You had the audacity to go on national tele
vision, show the world what you did and dare the legal system to
stop you,'' the judge said. ``Well, sir, consider yourself
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Prosecutor John Skrzynski said, ``The reason we
came in to this court is because Dr. Kevorkian appeared on TV with
the tape . . . and dared the prosecution to do its job. This case
is about what Jack Kevorkian did, and in this state, what Jack
Kevorkian did was murder.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge and prosecutor know it.
</P>
<P>
   If the case were really about mur der _ if these people honestly
be lieved Kevorkian was a killer _ then they'd be prosecuting the
per son who helped him commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The ``victim's'' wife.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian didn't seek out Thomas Youk. Just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Youk was the 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. He was
in a wheelchair and could barely move his arms or legs. He suppos
edly was afraid of choking to death on his own saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Youk wanted Kevorkian's help but, given his condition, couldn't
have hooked up with Kevorkian without the assistance of his wife,
Melody. If this were a real murder, Mrs. Youk wouldn't be described
as a ``grieving widow,'' but as an ``ac complice.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a Republic re porter accompanied a mother and
her son, who also suffered with Lou Gehrig's disease, on a trip to
Michi gan, where Kevorkian assisted the 27-year-old man's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian was arrested, but the man's mother and the reporter
weren't charged as ``accessories be fore the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost every jurisdiction, a person who hires an assassin is
as guilty as the killer himself. But at the Oakland County
prosecutor's of fice, no one I spoke with Wednes day is aware of
any plans to prosecute Mrs. Youk. She appeared on the Today show
Wednesday morning in support of Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing hearing where Kevorkian received 10 to 25
years in prison, she said, ``My husband had come to the end of his
life as he chose to. He was not depressed. He was not a victim. He
requested Dr. Kevorkian's help and was grateful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk's brother, Terry, added, ``Any American who has watched
this trial should be outraged. I don't believe that Dr. Kevorkian
is a crim inal, and I don't believe he should be put in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kevorkian was hauled away, a spokesman for the Archdiocese
of Detroit said the doctor's long prison sentence leaves ``no doubt
that so ciety will neither authorize physi cians to kill nor look
the other way if they do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same kind of selective self-righteousness displayed by
Judge Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   She told Kevorkian, ``This trial was not about the political or
moral correctness of euthanasia. It was about you, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Why just him?
</P>
<P>
   If this were a real murder case, and Kevorkian were a real
murderer, you can bet prosecutors would be going after all the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian didn't brainwash the Youk family. They knew exactly
what they were doing. They wanted it done. They helped facilitate
the act. But only Kevorkian was con victed of murder.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to upset authorities in this case more than anything
is that Kevorkian had the audacity to send a videotape of Youk's
death to 60 Minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor John Skrzynski harped on it. So did the judge.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if Kevorkian's most hei nous act wasn't murder, but arro
gance.
</P>
<P>
   If that's a crime, then there's a judge and some prosecutors in
Michigan who should be doing life. &QL;

'TIL DR. DEATH DO US PART
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The judge and prosecutors in Dr. Jack Kevorkian's recent murder
trial proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are hypocrites or
fools, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Kevorkian is an inno cent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, sir, is above the law. No one,'' Judge Jessica Cooper
told Kevorkian at his sentencing this week. He was convicted of
second-degree murder. ``You had the audacity to go on national tele
vision, show the world what you did and dare the legal system to
stop you,'' the judge said. ``Well, sir, consider yourself
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Prosecutor John Skrzynski said, ``The reason we
came in to this court is because Dr. Kevorkian appeared on TV with
the tape . . . and dared the prosecution to do its job. This case
is about what Jack Kevorkian did, and in this state, what Jack
Kevorkian did was murder.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   And the judge and prosecutor know it.
</P>
<P>
   If the case were really about mur der _ if these people honestly
be lieved Kevorkian was a killer _ then they'd be prosecuting the
per son who helped him commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The ``victim's'' wife.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian didn't seek out Thomas Youk. Just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Youk was the 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. He was
in a wheelchair and could barely move his arms or legs. He suppos
edly was afraid of choking to death on his own saliva.
</P>
<P>
   Youk wanted Kevorkian's help but, given his condition, couldn't
have hooked up with Kevorkian without the assistance of his wife,
Melody. If this were a real murder, Mrs. Youk wouldn't be described
as a ``grieving widow,'' but as an ``ac complice.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a Republic re porter accompanied a mother and
her son, who also suffered with Lou Gehrig's disease, on a trip to
Michi gan, where Kevorkian assisted the 27-year-old man's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian was arrested, but the man's mother and the reporter
weren't charged as ``accessories be fore the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost every jurisdiction, a person who hires an assassin is
as guilty as the killer himself. But at the Oakland County
prosecutor's of fice, no one I spoke with Wednes day is aware of
any plans to prosecute Mrs. Youk. She appeared on the Today show
Wednesday morning in support of Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing hearing where Kevorkian received 10 to 25
years in prison, she said, ``My husband had come to the end of his
life as he chose to. He was not depressed. He was not a victim. He
requested Dr. Kevorkian's help and was grateful for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk's brother, Terry, added, ``Any American who has watched
this trial should be outraged. I don't believe that Dr. Kevorkian
is a crim inal, and I don't believe he should be put in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kevorkian was hauled away, a spokesman for the Archdiocese
of Detroit said the doctor's long prison sentence leaves ``no doubt
that so ciety will neither authorize physi cians to kill nor look
the other way if they do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same kind of selective self-righteousness displayed by
Judge Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   She told Kevorkian, ``This trial was not about the political or
moral correctness of euthanasia. It was about you, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Why just him?
</P>
<P>
   If this were a real murder case, and Kevorkian were a real
murderer, you can bet prosecutors would be going after all the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian didn't brainwash the Youk family. They knew exactly
what they were doing. They wanted it done. They helped facilitate
the act. But only Kevorkian was con victed of murder.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to upset authorities in this case more than anything
is that Kevorkian had the audacity to send a videotape of Youk's
death to 60 Minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor John Skrzynski harped on it. So did the judge.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if Kevorkian's most hei nous act wasn't murder, but arro
gance.
</P>
<P>
   If that's a crime, then there's a judge and some prosecutors in
Michigan who should be doing life. &QL;

NATO CONDUCTS NEW ATTACKS ON BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO warplanes mounted a withering new attack on
Wednesday night against targets across Yugoslavia, including
numerous strikes on the capital, Belgrade, Pentagon and NATO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO struck military targets and a bridge in one of the most
sustained nights of bombing yet. In Belgrade, loud explosions and
anti-aircraft fire were heard beginning at around 1:30 a.m.
Thursday, Belgrade time.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials declined to discuss which targets
were struck, saying operations were ongoing, but a senior Pentagon
official said strikes had been stepped up. ``It's partly taking
advantage of the weather and partly a desire to intensify the
attack,'' the official said.

RUBY PICKED UP BRUSH A FINAL TIME BEFORE DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Ruby, the Phoenix Zoo's artistic elephant, left her
fans one last painting before she died Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Confined indoors while awaiting surgery that veterinarians hoped
would save her life after a ruptured uterus, Ruby kept boredom at
bay by playing with balls and a push broom.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 10-minute burst of creativity, Ruby executed a colorful
abstract titled ``Amrita,'' Chinese for ``elixir of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of her better ones,'' elephant keeper Bill Bonucci
said, praising the patterns and brush strokes in the work. ``It was
something that catches your eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16- by 20-inch painting, done in washable latex, is being
stored during renovation of the zoo's Stone House pavilion. After
renovation, the pavilion will be re-named Ruby's House.
</P>
<P>
   The painting will be on display there, but lithographs available
in the gift shop after a May 1 unveiling at a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amrita'' will remain zoo property as a legacy to the beloved
Asian elephant, which died at 25 of complications of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Other elephants at the zoo have expressed interest in art,
Bonucci said, but none has equaled Ruby's success or enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Indu, a 33-year-old female, has been allowed to try her hand, he
said, but ``she tends to eat the brushes.'' &QL;

Stars' jaw-breaking revenge on Coyotes could be costly 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars claimed a jaw for an eye in their rumble with
the Phoenix Coyotes last night. However, they might have lost
captain Derian Hatcher to a suspension in the process.
</P>
<P>
   At the 5:52 mark of the first period of the Stars' 4-2 victory,
Hatcher ended speculation on whether the Stars would try to pay
back Coyotes winger Jeremy Roenick for a hit he delivered to the
eye of Stars center Mike Modano during a March 23 game. Hatcher
landed a thundering hit, slamming Roenick's head into the end
glass. The blow broke Roenick's jaw in three places, and Coyotes
coach Jim Schoenfeld said his first impression is that Roenick, the
Coyotes' leading scorer with 72 points, will miss the entire
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be re-evaluated when we get home, but as it stands now,
he's out for the remainder ... remainder of the season,''
Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   As Roenick did when he blindsided Modano in Phoenix, Hatcher
received a five-minute major penalty for boarding and a
game-misconduct penalty. But while Roenick escaped suspension,
Hatcher likely will not. Modano did not miss any additional games
after the earlier hit. Roenick could miss playoff games, and those
types of factors weigh heavily on the mind of Colin Campbell, the
NHL's senior vice president and director of hockey operations.
</P>
<P>
   While Brian Burke shied away from suspending players in the
playoffs during his tenure as the NHL's chief disciplinarian last
season, Campbell has shown a willingness to ``send messages''
through suspensions this season.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell will review the play today and issue his decision
before the Stars and Coyotes continue their rivalry at 3 p.m.
Saturday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colin Campbell needs to make a statement,'' Coyotes winger
Rick Tocchet said. ``He \RHatcher\S should get at least 10-15
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes winger Keith Tkachuk added: ``We're going to see what
kind of league we have, see what the league is going to do about
this. Hatcher should be suspended as long as Jeremy Roenick doesn't
play in the playoffs. It's a premeditated incident. He said in the
papers `We're going to get him.' Well, they got him. They broke his
jaw, they shattered it. They say it's the worst shatter they've
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, in fact, played down the incident before the game,
saying he didn't know what to expect. Tkachuk, meanhwile, issued
this challenge before the game: ``If they've got a problem with
\RRoenick's hit\S, tell them to do something about it. Otherwise,
tell them to shut their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld also said the hit was ``premeditated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's coming off the heels of the hit on Modano in
Phoenix,'' he said. ``Roenick was ready for the hit, you can see
that. He wasn't ready for the elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he expected no suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Hitchcock said. ``The original call was two
minutes, and I guess because there was some blood there, it went to
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he didn't know what might happen as far as a
suspension was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say what they're going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher said he felt bad about breaking Roenick's jaw and that
he ``wouldn't want to be in his shoes right now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the hit was not premeditated and he did not try
to injure Roenick as payback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was him, he and I saw each other before the hit,''
Hatcher said. ``But it wouldn't have mattered who it was, I was
going to hit the guy. It wouldn't have changed anything, I wasn't
going to stop in my tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars (51-17-12) were faced with a five-on-three power play
for 1:41 and then killed the remainder of the five-minute penalty.
Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk then added first-period goals, and the
Stars had a 2-0 lead to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The game continued to be filled with skirmishes, but only one
actual fight _ between Grant Marshall and Louie Debrusk. The Stars
pushed their lead to 3-0 in the second period on Sergei Zubov's
power-play goal before the Coyotes answered with two goals in the
final six minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stars goalie Ed Belfour came up with 33 saves to get the victory
and a 4-1 season series lead against the Coyotes (38-30-12).
</P>
<P>
   However, the two points in the standings were pretty meaningless
compared to the playoff implications for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an joke,'' Tkachuk said. ``We lose our leading scorer
all'' because of Hatcher. He said he was going to hit \RRoenick\S
and Campbell better get off his \Rbackside\S and do something.''

   NORTHAMPTON-KIDDER (Undated) _ Northampton, a city of 30,000 in

more than 300 years _ charity, self-interest, tolerance and
division. They are issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th
century when Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas
Cole or described with affection by Henry James in his first novel,
``Roderick Hudson.'' They were questions raised when it hanged two
innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and when
it tried a policeman, a native son, for the rape of his own child,
during the four years Tracy Kidder spent reporting his new book,
``Home Town'' (Random House), published this month. Kidder, 53,
lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, Franny, a painter, but
considers Northampton also his home. As he proudly showed it to a
visitor recently, the city gave him a parking ticket. No place is

   SUPERADOBE (Hesperia, Calif.) _ On a recent windy day in a park

sand and cement and build a museum. They pumped the mixture into
plastic sandbags that ran hundreds of feet long, then laid the
sandbags in a large coil. Later they sat together inside an
intricate brick dome, as the four aborigines sang ancient songs. A
New Age moment, you think. But what brought four men from
Australia, two avid readers of American Survival Guide (the
Magazine of Self Reliance) and Gabriel Reyes, a builder the Oasis
Preserve International in Costa Rica, to this spot was the chance
to learn how to build cheap, easy, earthquake resistant and quirky
buildings. By Frances Anderton.

   BARTRAM-GARDEN (Undated) _ It's easy to get lost trying to find
America's oldest living botanical garden. Just south of Center
City, Philadelphia, is Historic Bartram's Garden, now a public
park, cinched in between the railroad track and a river lined by
oil tanks. But it must have been a little paradise when John
Bartram, a Quaker farmer with a lust in his heart for wild plants,
bought 102 acres along the Schuylkill and proceeded to grow a lot
more than corn. By Anne Raver.

JOHNSON BLAMES HIMSELF AFTER LOSS

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Dodgers' season-opening sweep of the Arizona
Diamondbacks has been swept aside.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the only thing between the Dodgers' being swept four
straight by the Diamondbacks is beating 6-foot-10 Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That's the situation after the Diamondbacks scored four times in
the seventh inning and went on to defeat the Dodgers 6-2 Wednesday
in front of 30,561 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season 5-1, the Dodgers have lost three
straight and are 5-4. After nine games last season the Dodgers were
4-5.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson blamed himself for the loss,
saying he should have yanked starter Carlos Perez out before he ran
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game Perez (0-2) yielded four runs in
the seventh inning. In his first start of the season the Colorado
Rockies pinned the loss on Perez. The big blow was a Todd Helton
three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos pitched great, and again, the same thing happened as
the first time out,'' Johnson said. ``He got around 70 in pitches
and all of a sudden, boom. When I saw him before, I didn't see
this. That's my fault, not going to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was leery to go to his bullpen after Tuesday's 16-inning
loss to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, the identical thing,'' Johnson said. ``It ain't
happening again, tired bullpen or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Diamondbacks, Perez went 62/3 innings and gave up
six earned runs on 11 hits. At some point the Diamondbacks won't
hit a plethora of homers, and if the Dodgers are going to contend
for a playoff spot they'll have to stop surrendering them.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have played six times this season, and the
Diamondbacks have hit 15 homers. Meanwhile, Dodgers pitchers have
given up 16 homers and are on pace to yield 288 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Diamondbacks battled back from a 2-0 deficit
against Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Finley was able to pull the Diamondbacks within 2-1 when
he hit a Perez fastball over the left-field fence with one out in
the fifth. Then it was second baseman Jay Bell's turn to inflict
more punishment upon the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-day span in which balls are flying out of the park at an
alarming rate, Bell has been presented the biggest problem for
Dodgers pitchers. All five of his homers have come against the
Dodgers, including three in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting two homers against Ismael Valdes on Tuesday, Bell
took a shot at solving Perez. After two fly-ball outs in his
previous at-bats, Bell was able to connect with an outside pitch
and hook it down the left-field line. The ball bounced off the foul
pole to make it a 2-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried everything against him,'' Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca
said. ``He's just a professional hitter. If you make a good pitch
you're going to get him out. Carlos got that pitch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez then helped himself out of further difficulties in the
inning when he picked Greg Colbrunn was picked off second for the
third out.
</P>
<P>
   The long ball got Arizona back into the game, but the ability to
string hits together gave them the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' four-run inning featured a pair of doubles and
a triple, and by the time it ended Perez was out of the game. It
began with Tony Batista doubling to left-center field, but he was
erased at third on Steve Finley's sacrifice attempt. Bernard Gilkey
flied out and it appeared Perez could get out of the inning
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller doubled off the left-field wall to put runners on
second and third and pinch-hitter David Dellucci singled through
the middle to score two runs and give Arizona a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a ball in the zone,'' Dellucci said.
``It was up a little and I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack hit a bloop single and right fielder Raul Mondesi's
throw to third sailed into the Diamondbacks dugout, allowing
Dellucci to score and Womack to move to third. Bell then tripled as
Arizona went up 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitching coach Charlie Hough said there's no reason to
think Perez couldn't keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a pretty good track record of finishing games,''
Hough said. ``Ball up, change-up less effective. He's a real simple
guy. When (Dellucci) comes up, if he makes a good pitch it's 2-2 in
the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona lefty Omar Daal fought off wildness to pitch seven
strong innings to get the win. Daal (1-0) walked six batters, but
allowed three hits _ none after the fourth _ and struck out five.

DUCKS FALL TO BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The St. Louis Blues were in town Wednesday night and
the Ducks' faint hopes of finishing fourth in the Western
Conference ended as the the Blues ground out a 3-1 victory before
16,510 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   With two games remaining the Ducks fell a point behind the
Blues, who finish their season with games against Phoenix tonight
and the Kings on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ducks, who finish against the Kings and San Jose,
need one point to clinch sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr frustrated the Ducks for more than 45 minutes. Anaheim
generated the majority of the scoring chances, but they were unable
to break through until Teemu Selanne's shot hit the post and
bounced to Paul Kariya, who scored his 38th goal into an open net
with 14:56 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's energy level picked up considerably after scoring, but
they couldn't get another past Fuhr. Former Duck Scott Young put
the game away at 16:50 with his 21st goal of the year on a shot
from the left circle that slipped through Guy Hebert's pads.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first suspect goal Hebert had allowed. The Ducks
had been fighting a uphill battle since 16:12 of the first period
when Michel Picard's seemingly harmless 45-footer bounced off
Hebert's glove. Twenty-five seconds later ex-Duck Terry Yake forced
a turnover and Geoff Courtnall put the Blues ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt by slow starts recently, the Ducks dominated the majority
of the first period, generating numerous quality scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening 20 minutes was a tale of two goaltenders. Fuhr
turned aside everything the Ducks threw at him. He made a brilliant
glove save on a point-blank shot by Matt Cullen, stopped Jamie
Pushor after Selanne created a shorthanded chance, and then turned
aside another great chance by Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues needed nine minutes to record a shot on goal, but
Picard's goal at 16:12 seemed to take the Ducks' collective breath
away. Before they had recovered from the shock of the normally
reliable Hebert allowing a soft goal, Yake took the puck away from
Ted Drury at the side of the Anaheim net and got it to Courtnall
for an easy tap-in at 16:37.
</P>
<P>
   It was fourth goal of the season for Courtnall, who was playing
his first game after missing 57 with post concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr faced only eight shots in the second period. But he came up
with two big stops on Kariya one-timers, including a 40-footer that
he just got his right pad on. Fuhr also made a key stop on Ruslan
Salei's drive from the left circle with 5.7 seconds left in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also had some good fortune. Drury missed the net off a nice
feed from Jim McKenzie; Fredrik Olausson was wide open in the slot,
but missed the net from 25 feet out; and Travis Green rattled a
shot off the post.

ANGELS LOSE ON CLOSE CALLS

<P>
   OAKLAND _ For once, Kenny Rogers didn't beat the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be argued that Drew Coble and Gary Cederstrom
played a big role in the Oakland A's 6-5 win before 8,377 at the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Coble and Cederstrom don't play for the A's, they were the first
base and plate umpires, respectively, for Wednesday night's game.
Rogers, the A's pitcher who has beaten the Angels more than any
other team in his career, was out of the game and in line to lose
when the A's rallied thanks to questionable calls by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough way for the the Angels to lose, considering they
jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Chuck Finley took a 5-4 lead into the bottom of
the seventh and retired Tony Phillips on a fly to center for the
first out. That's when Jason McDonald hit a grounder to the hole at
short, where Andy Sheets backhanded the ball and made the long
throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was in the dirt, but first baseman Darin Erstad dug it
out. The throw was in time, but Coble gestured that Erstad pulled
his foot off the bag. Replays showed Erstad's foot was on the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Jason Giambi, appeared to strike out on a 3-2
pitch in the dirt. However, Cederstrom ruled that Giambi got a
piece of it to stay alive. Replays showed Giambi missed the ball by
about six inches.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi walked on the next pitch, and Finley was yanked.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Angels bullpen, which had been so good so far this
season, couldn't throw the ball over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa came in to face John Jaha and walked him to
load the bases. Mike Magnante entered the game and walked Matt
Stairs on a 3-2 pitch to force in McDonald with the tying run.
Olmedo Saenz followed with a sacrifice fly to give the A's a 6-5
edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from a 4-3 deficit in the seventh inning by
making the most out of a little. A bloop single, a sacrifice, an
infield single and an error led to one run. Erstad's third hit of
the night off Rogers drove in the second run of the inning to give
the Angels a shortlived 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has owned the Angels throughout his career, taking a mark
of 11-5 with a 3.39 ERA against them into the game. And that
included his perfect game as a member of the Rangers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys with him is patience,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said before the game. ``He's smart enough to know if he
doesn't have to throw it in the zone, he isn't going to. You've got
to be disciplined enough to look for one ball you can handle.
Whatever your approach is, you've got to be ready even if it's
early in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was less than perfect in the first inning, starting with
a leadoff single by Erstad and then another single by Randy
Velarde. One out later, Troy Glaus walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' first run was scored on a wild pitch, but Garret
Anderson struck out for the second out of the inning. Todd Greene
then came up with the big hit of the inning, a two-run bloop single
to right for a 3-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rallied against Finley, getting a two-out, two-run
single by Miguel Tejada in the second inning and a two-out, two-run
double by Saenz for a 4-3 A's lead in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rogers reverted to his old form against the Angels.
Following Greene's two-run single in the first, Rogers retired 12
Angel hitters in a row before Erstad broke the string with a
two-out infield single in the fifth.

CARSON: NFL NOD TO COLISEUM
</HEADLINE>
 JUDAS REFERENCE AND `HIS' TO `HAS' IN 23RD(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League's expansion committee is still
scheduled to visit Carson and the Los Angeles Coliseum next Tuesday
to assess the two proposed locations for a 32nd NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Ovitz, Carson's partner heretofore in the NFL
expansion effort, told Carson officials Wednesday that the
expansion committee will likely select the New Coliseum group and
ask Ovitz to join its ownership team.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz also told Carson officials the league may ask the city to
keep its proposal on the table for 60-to-90 days should something
go amiss with the Coliseum project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way Carson is going to hang around while the NFL
and the Coliseum work on their issues,'' said Carson city
councilman Daryl Sweeney, the city's point man in the NFL expansion
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be used as leverage. We can read the tea leaves.
The league wants the Coliseum. The whole Dodger issue was NFL spin
to make the Coliseum proposal look more credible to those owners
who still do not feel the Coliseum is a viable site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine. But we have no intention of staying on hold while
they try to sell the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the NFL gave Los Angeles a conditional bid for a 32nd
franchise, giving interests here six months to formulate a stadium
plan and ownership group that would meet league standards.
Tuesday's visit by the committee is expected to produce a consensus
on the two stadium sites.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports Wednesday said that Ovitz was planning to
withdraw his Carson proposal and lend his support to the New
Coliseum group. Sweeney said Ovitz denied that in a telephone
conversation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement issued by Ovitz on Wednesday did not refute the
report. ``If it's not true,'' said Sweeney, ``then why didn't he
deny it in the statement?''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's statement says he met with Paul Tagliabue in March and
told the NFL commissioner that ``my partners and I were committed
to doing whatever was in the best interest of bringing NFL football
back to Los Angeles, even if that meant voluntarily withdrawing our
Carson stadium proposal. The NFL encouraged us to continue to
pursue our Carson proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Tuesday, we expect the NFL will select a stadium plan on
which to focus its efforts over the coming months ... We will
support the NFL in whatever decision is made ... (and) continue to
pursue our goal of owning and operating a NFL franchise in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Press-Telegram last month, Ovitz said
that while Carson had the most to offer, ``you can't force (the
NFL) to choose your site. They'll make the decision, and if they
tell me to play in a sandlot, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ovitz and New Coliseum representatives deny there have
been any meetings between the two sides, sources close to the two
groups say Ron Burkle, a key member of the Ovitz ownership group,
met with New Coliseum partner Eli Broad a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carson officials are both disappointed and angry over the way
things have progressed in the last few weeks. Since the NFL
meetings in Phoenix, officials have been wary of Ovitz shifting his
alliance. Sweeney, Mayor Peter Fajardo and other officials have for
weeks urged Ovitz to help coordinate a public show of support by
Carson citizens that would help convince the NFL that Carson was a
viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot all of our ideas down,'' said Michael Padilla, a
member of Carson's economic development committee. ``He's Judas. He
sold us out.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be clear that the league favors the New Coliseum,
several issues still need to be addressed before anyone can claim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers: NFL sources floated a story this week that the
Dodgers may consider moving to a new stadium to be built next to
the Coliseum. Two NFL sources said the idea came out of league
discussions on how to make the Coliseum and Exposition Park look
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger officials confirmed the league and L.A. civic officials
broached the idea, but they essentially pooh-poohed it. Despite the
denials, the NFL may try to keep the Dodger angle alive so as to
make the Coliseum proposal look better to rank-and-file owners wary
of returning to a stadium that lost two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Money: A source from one of the competing groups said expansion
committee chairman Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner,
is expected to drop this shoe before the committee arrives next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria keeps changing, but it's my understanding that
$150 million is the minimal amount an expansion city needs to
have,'' said the source. ``And how does the league say yes to the
Coliseum when it could get more from Carson?''
</P>
<P>
   Carson has signed off on a $180 million investment for its
stadium-and-mall complex. The Coliseum's proposal refers to more
than $300 million in public money, but only $40 million of it is
new money. Most of the Coliseum's public money is in the form of
land value and already completed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Strange bedfellows: The league may be overlooking how difficult
it will be for the various parties to work together. Ed Roski has
carried the Coliseum torch from the beginning, and it was Roski who
added Broad to the ownership team when the league said the Kings
owner was overextended.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, meanwhile, has his own flotilla of part owners, including
actor Tom Cruise and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Jerry West,
and it's hard to imagine the former Hollywood agent accepting a
role as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution may be the creation of a titular head of a
Coliseum ownership group, like former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley.
He is owed a debt by Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan for bowing
out of the NFL sweepstakes on behalf of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   League surveys: The league also has to deal with its own
internal surveys which indicate Los Angeles is not frothing for a
NFL franchise. Both proposals are based on a massive influx of
money from private seat licenses, $100 million at the Coliseum and
$70 million in Carson, but league studies say both are too
optimistic.

 &HT;     UNDERMANNED HAWKS BEAT CELTICS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Hawks77Celtics70
</P>
<P>
   The captain has had enough. The coach says the captain has had
enough. Antoine Walker and Rick Pitino took turns Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night
wondering about the so-called home-court advantage in the NBA,
something that is very much missing in the FleetCenter these days.
</P>
<P>
   With the smallest crowd in the Pitino Era (15,364) looking on,
and noisemakers targeting a struggling Walker (3 of 12 from the
floor) from the first quarter on, the Celtics dropped a
demoralizing 77-70 decision to the very undermanned Atlanta Hawks.
Afterward, Pitino and Walker each addressed what has become a
thorny issue: the ongoing booing of Walker and the team, a
situation that prompted the coach at the end of the game to turn to
a disgruntled fan and shout, ``Why don't you go home?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Walker offered the somewhat startling observation
that he no longer considers himself the main offensive option on
the team. He barely leads Ron Mercer in field goal attempts,
although he has been the Celtics' leading scorer all season. He
also said he still is adjusting to this situation, adding, ``I'm
trying to figure out what my role is on this team . . . I don't
know yet. I'm in the process of trying to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who is making $2 million this season but signed a
six-year, $71 million extension in the offseason, was an easy
target Wednesday night, turning in one of his more dreadful games
of the year. He had 6 points, 4 rebounds, and 1 assist in 33
foul-plagued minutes. But the fans were on him uncommonly early,
starting with Boston's hideous 12-point first quarter and again at
the end, when Atlanta went on a 9-0 run over the final 3:39 to
settle things.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, who prefaced his remarks by noting there have been times
that the team and Walker have deserved the boos, nevertheless said
he thought the fans went a bit overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid (Walker) is not going to want to do anything out
there. He's going to be afraid, tentative,'' Pitino said. ``Cut him
a break a little bit because he's trying awfully hard out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowd issue, Walker said, ``How would you feel if
you were out there, trying hard, and you're getting booed every
time you miss a shot? Put yourself in my place. I enjoy basketball.
I love playing basketball. But it's uncomfortable . . . Maybe I'm
not the type of player Boston fans want. They have high standards
and I'm going to try and meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's to the point, where, if I have a bad game, boo
me. I take a shot you don't like, so you boo? That may be the play
that's called. It's ridiculous. If you're going to come to the game
and do that . . . we need the fans' support. We're a young team.
Last year, this was a very difficult place to play (for opponents).
Unfortunately, it's not that way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't. The Celtics dropped to 8-10 at home. The Hawks
were missing three starters, including their top two scorers and
had played the night before. But one of the Celtics' goals for the
game was to not get dominated on the boards, which is what happened
the last time the teams met and is exactly what Atlanta did again
Wednesday night. The Hawks had a 51-40 rebounding advantage and got
some huge offensive rebounds in the final two minutes, allowing
them to keep the ball and work the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics trailed most of the game, but led, 70-68, after a
free throw by Vitaly Potapenko with 3:39 left. They didn't score
again, missing their last four shots. Mookie Blaylock (5 of 17) hit
a layup to tie the score, then, after the ultra-long Atlanta
possession resulting from three offensive rebounds, Grant Long
broke the final tie with two free throws with 1:17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce (16 points, 8 rebounds) then missed and Chris
Crawford (a career-high 17 points) added a second-chance trey with
18.2 seconds left to make it 75-70. That was it. Ed Gray added two
inconsequential free throws with 7.7 seconds left to account for
the final totals as Atlanta ended a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer led Boston with 19 points (on 22 shots), but it was a
clearly agitated and pained Walker who held court afterward. He
said the team had just won four of five, so why were people booing
so early? He said it's not only affecting him, but the team. He
said the team gets rough treatment on the road and doesn't need a
similar response at home.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked about his changing role, one which, he says,
merely adds to the overall state of confusion on this very young
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have roles on this team,'' he said. ``Every night
it's different. You see veteran teams like Orlando and Miami and
they have the same guys doing the same things every night. That's
what we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being the number one option. I like having that type
of pressure on me. But, like I said, unfortunately, it's not that
way this year. We've got other guys who can score, so I have to
figure out what my role is going to be. It may be best for me to be
the number two option. It can be a number of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he was a lot of things, but not many were good.
The same can be said for his teammates. This was one they logically
should have won, given Atlanta's hobbled state and their own recent
improved play. They didn't, which again drives home how far they
still have to go.

 &HT;    HARD KEEPING UP WITH CELTICS' JONESES
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The name was taped over Bruce Bowen's locker. It read, `D. Jones
13.' Whoa. Could this be true? Could we be witnessing the return of
Dontae Jones?
</P>
<P>
   There was a D. Jones who wore No. 13 and played for the Celtics
Wednesday night against the Hawks. It wasn't the departed Dontae,
however. It was newcomer Damon Jones, who earlier in the day signed
a 10-day contract to give Rick Pitino depth at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job,'' Pitino said. ``I like the way he hawks
the ball on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Damon Jones's first trip to the FleetCenter. He played
12 minutes and scored 5 points in New Jersey's 99-97 victory over
the Celtics March 1. He was a Net then, signed to keep Lucious
Harris's seat warm. When Harris returned, Jones left. He averaged
4.5 points in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played as hard as I could play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former University of Houston guard then played for the Idaho
Stampede in the Continental Basketball Association. They were
eliminated a week ago and since then, he has been home in Houston,
hoping the phone would ring. It did on Monday; the Celtics needed
point guard insurance with Kenny Anderson injured and Jones was on
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, a Boston Celtic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Jones, the Celtics had to jump through hoops.
They had to send Eric Riley to New York for an independent
evaluation of his sprained right ankle. The reason: Boston had the
maximum number of players on the injured list (three) and needed a
waiver to get a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was still a bit surprised at the whole procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're bringing in an All-Star basketball player.
We're bringing in someone to fill a roster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley will have to miss at least five games. Pitino said he
decided not to send Anderson (hamstring) because he thinks Anderson
may be able to come back sooner (not to mention that he is a more
important player).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pulling together
</P>
<P>
   The depleted Hawks were without their top scorers, Steve Smith
and Alan Henderson. Smith is due back Friday while Henderson, who
bruised his tail bone Tuesday night in Milwaukee, is listed as
day-to-day. ``I like our chances when we get healthy,'' coach Lenny
Wilkens said . . . Attention Dikembe Mutombo: You may have leveled
a few people with your errant elbows this season, but Vitaly
Potapenko says you didn't do it to him. Potapenko broke his nose in
a game against Atlanta earlier this season and the thinking was
that it was due to Mutombo's elbow. Potapenko Wednesday night said
it was Smith, not Mutombo, who delivered the blow . . . Walter
McCarty, who missed Monday's game against Cleveland with a left
groin strain, returned to play six uneventful minutes . . . There
was no official count, but there had to be at least a dozen air
balls in the game. The Celtics shot 36 percent, the Hawks' 39
percent . . . Mutombo finished with 16 points and 17 rebounds but
did not block a shot. He caused a lot of guys to think twice,
though . . . Pitino said plans nearly are set for a summer league
in Boston in July. The team should have everything finalized in the
next few days. One possible site is Boston College . . . These
teams will meet a week from Thursday in Atlanta.

 &HT;     STATE SEEKS TO EASE BAN ON SCALPING

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>

<P>
   Sports fans who find their plans have changed may soon be able
to resell their tickets without risking arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci's Consumer Affairs Office is weighing a
plan that would eliminate penalties for reselling tickets within a
specified ``zone'' near the ticket office of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would ease the current prohibition against
reselling tickets not only for sporting events, but for all
entertainment ticket sales, sources told the Globe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under Massachusetts law, only licensed ticket brokers can resell
tickets, and they are prohibited from selling them for more than $2
above face value, plus a ``reasonable'' service charge. Individuals
cannot resell tickets _ even for less than face value.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment and sports promoters generally oppose ticket
resales because it threatens their ability to sell out an event.
But, as any concert or sports fans knows, scalpers frequently offer
tickets through printed ads, the Internet, or at the entrance to
the event an hour or two before it's scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, for example, scalpers were quietly offering ``great
seats'' for the Red Sox' standing-room-only Opening Day game just
outside Fenway Park, though they were careful to avoid drawing the
attention of police stationed around the ballpark. And scalpers are
already pressing season ticket-holders to resell tickets for the
All-Star Game at Fenway in July.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the proposal Wednesday, the Red Sox were
noncommittal. ``We would be interested in working with anyone who
wants to make life easier for our fans,'' said Sox spokesman Dick
Bresciani. ``But we don't know the details of how this plan would
work and would be interested in learning more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources said some sports and entertainment providers, including
attorneys for the Sox, have privately expressed concerns about the
proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, following a sting by the Attorney General's office
against ticket brokers charging exorbitant rates, a bill was
proposed that would have allowed the resale of tickets with a
limited markup, but rejected. According to sources, some
facilities, including Camden Yards in Baltimore, allow ticket
resales as a service to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A day of rest
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox had a 45-minute workout Wednesday at Fenway Park.
The Red Sox had the day off, although several pitchers, including
Tom Gordon, got in a day of throwing under the eyes of pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan . . . It's been a week since Nomar Garciaparra
suffered a pulled hamstring. Manager Jimy Williams continues to say
he won't return until he is completely healed.

PEREZ TIRES AGAIN IN SEVENTH
</HEADLINE>

By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Normally, two baseball games aren't enough for a trend
to develop. Not even two weeks are enough.
</P>
<P>
   But two starts that ended in nearly identical fashion are plenty
for Dodgers manager Davey Johnson to draw a conclusion regarding
left-handed pitcher Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Straight forward: You can bet Perez won't give up four runs in
the seventh inning of his next start. In fact, even reaching the
seventh inning is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Not after the Arizona Diamondbacks scored four times in the
seventh to rally for a 6-2 win against the Dodgers at Bank One
Ballpark on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It comes on the heels of Perez (0-2) allowing four runs in the
seventh inning last Thursday in a loss to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And it leaves the Dodgers needing to defeat Randy Johnson
tonight to avoid being swept by the Diamondbacks in the four-game
series. The Dodgers (5-4) counter with Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos pitched great, and again, the same thing happened as
the first time out,'' Davey Johnson said. ``He got around 70 in
pitches and all of a sudden, boom. When I saw him before (this
season), I didn't see this. That's my fault, not going to get
him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to think Perez should tire. He threw 88
pitches, 15 more than he threw in his start against the Rockies,
and didn't find himself in any tight jams.
</P>
<P>
   Perez showed no signs of fatigue, despite giving up solo homers
to Steve Finley and new Dodgers killer Jay Bell. He hit his fifth
homer of the season _ all against Los Angeles _ to tie the score
2-2 in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Johnson was leery to go to his bullpen after Tuesday's
16-inning loss to Arizona because only the struggling Mel Rojas was
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, the identical thing,'' Johnson said in comparing
Perez's starts. ``It ain't happening again, tired bullpen or not.
I'm in a learning curve right now, and I'm not happy with myself
right now. Tired pen or not, I've got to get him help.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson stood up for Perez afterward, Perez was nowhere to
be found in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgers pitching coach Charlie Hough said there's no
reason the 6-foot-3, 210-pound Perez should tire before reaching 90
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a pretty good track record of finishing games,'' said
Hough, knowing Perez has 15 complete games the past two years.
``Absolutely, he's got to (go further). You could tell the pitches
he tried to make didn't happen. The ball is up, the changeup less
effective. He's a real simple guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem was that Arizona took the lead when the
left-handed hitting David Dellucci lined a pinch-hit, two-out
single over the head of shortstop Mark Grudzielanek to score Finley
and Damian Miller to give Arizona a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to go up looking for a ball in the zone, for
one pitch, and I did,'' Dellucci said. ``I didn't notice any
difference in him. He's just as nasty in the seventh as he was in
the sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci's first hit of the year in four pinch-hit attempts was
the big blow, but Arizona's rally persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack blooped a single, and Dodgers right fielder Raul
Mondesi tried to throw Dellucci out at third. Instead, the ball
sailed into the Diamondbacks' dugout and allowed Dellucci to score
and Womack to move to third. Bell then tripled to push Arizona's
lead to 6-2 and knock Perez from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed six earned runs on 11 hits. He walked one and
didn't strike out a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he lost his stuff. He just missed his spots,''
Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca said. ``I don't think he really got
tired. He just got a few balls high.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona lefty Omar Daal fought off wildness to pitch seven
strong innings to get the win. Daal (1-0) walked six batters, but
allowed three hits _ none after the fourth _ and struck out five.

ANGELS LOSE ON CLOSE CALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ For once, Kenny Rogers didn't beat the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be argued that Drew Coble and Gary Cederstrom
played a big role in the Oakland A's 6-5 win before 8,377 at the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Coble and Cederstrom don't play for the A's, they were the first
base and plate umpires, respectively, for Wednesday night's game.
Rogers, the A's pitcher who has beaten the Angels more than any
other team in his career, was out of the game and in line to lose
when the A's rallied thanks to questionable calls by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough way for the Angels to lose, considering they
jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first inning against Rogers, their
long-time nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Chuck Finley (1-1) took a 5-4 lead into the
bottom of the seventh and retired Tony Phillips on a fly to center
for the first out. That's when Jason McDonald hit a grounder to the
hole at short, where Andy Sheets backhanded the ball and made the
long throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was in the dirt, but first baseman Darin Erstad dug it
out. The throw was in time, but Coble gestured that Erstad pulled
his foot off the bag. Replays showed Erstad's foot was on the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Jason Giambi, appeared to strike out on a 3-2
pitch in the dirt. However, Cederstrom ruled Giambi got a piece of
it to stay alive. Replays showed Giambi missed the ball by nearly a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi walked on the next pitch, and Finley was yanked.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Angels bullpen, which had been good so far this season,
couldn't throw the ball over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa came in to face John Jaha, and walked him to
load the bases. Mike Magnante entered the game and walked Matt
Stairs on a 3-2 pitch to force in McDonald with the tying run.
Olmedo Saenz followed with a sacrifice fly to give the A's a 6-5
edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have changed (the outcome), yeah,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said of the blown calls. ``But you still have to come
in and go after somebody and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels believe they were hurt by the bad calls, they
wouldn't use it as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to come back and get Giambi out there,'' Finley
said. ``What am I going to do? From where I was, he missed it by a
foot. I don't know if that necessarily would have changed the game
or not, but it might have made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charlie O'Brien said he has never seen an umpire miss a
call like that during his long major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He missed it by at least a foot, it wasn't even close,''
O'Brien said. ``I asked for help (from the third-base ump), but
(Cederstrom) said he thought he tipped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cederstrom was unavailable for comment after the game, but
Coble, the crew chief, spoke for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he heard it,'' Coble said. ``You get used to hearing a
couple of sounds. It's a reaction, a reflex.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the call at first, Erstad shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called him safe, that's baseball,'' he said. ``That's his
discretion, his ruling. If he says he's safe, he's safe. I asked
him why, because I knew the throw beat him. He said I pulled my
foot, and I said `What?' That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from a 4-3 deficit in the seventh inning by
making the most out of a little. A bloop single, a sacrifice, an
infield single and an error led to one run. Erstad's third hit of
the night off Rogers drove in the second run of the inning to give
the Angels a shortlived 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has owned the Angels throughout his career, taking a mark
of 11-5 with a 3.39 ERA against them into the game. And that
included his perfect game as a member of the Rangers in 1994.

DUCKS LOSE TO BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The St. Louis Blues were in town on Wednesday night
and as a result the Mighty Ducks might soon being seeing red --
either that of the Detroit Red Wings or the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' 3-1 loss to the Blues before 16,550 ended their hopes
of finishing fourth in the Western Conference, and their chances of
finishing fifth, thus avoiding Colorado or Detroit, suffered a
severe setback.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's fate is no longer in its own hands. The Ducks dropped
one point back of the Blues with two games to play and they will
need help from either Phoenix or the Kings to finish fifth and play
the Coyotes in the opening round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg insisted that the Ducks
weren't deflated by losing a game that they dominated, or by losing
a chance to control their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been one our best efforts of the year,'' he
said. ``There have been games we've won this year that I wasn't as
happy with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There goalie was unbelievable, he was the difference. That's
how he's won so many Stanley Cups.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Ducks, Guy Hebert wasn't so sharpe at the
other end. The Anaheim goalie gave up a demoralizing goal on a
45-foot shot by Michel Picard at 16:12 of the first period and let
a shot by Scott Young slip through his pads at 16:50 of the third
when the Ducks were desperately attempting to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Guy would like to have that goal (Picard's) back, but
there's nothing you can do about it now,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr frustrated the Ducks for over 45 minutes. Anaheim generated
the majority of the scoring chances, but they were unable to break
through until Teemu Selanne's shot hit the post and bounced to Paul
Kariya, who scored his 38th goal into an open net with 14:56
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the only shot they could get by Fuhr, who made 31
saves and had a couple other Anaheim shots bounce off the post
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing,'' said Kariya. ``We produced a lot
of scoring chances and played good defense, but we played the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing the right way the Ducks were forced to play
uphill from late in the first period on after Picard scored and the
Blues followed that up with a goal by Geoff Courtnall 25 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   Hurt by slow starts recently, the Ducks had no such problem on
Wednesday night. They dominated the majority of the first period,
generating numerous quality scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening 20 minutes was a tale of two goaltenders. Fuhr
turned aside everything the Ducks threw at him. He made brilliant
glove save on a point-blank shot by Matt Cullen, stopped Jamie
Pushor after Selanne created a shorthanded chance, and then turned
aside another great chance by Cullen.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues needed nine minutes to record a shot on goal, but
Picard's goal at 16:12 seemed to take the Ducks' collective breath
away. Before they had recovered from the shock of the normally
reliable Hebert allowing a soft goal, Yake took the puck away from
Ted Drury at the side of the Anaheim net and got it to Courtnall
for an easy tap-in at 16:37.
</P>
<P>
   It was fourth goal of the season for Courtnall, who was playing
his first game after missing 57 with post concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set the temp early, we just weren't rewarded for it,'' said
Hartsburg. ``We can't be disappointed, I thought we played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr didn't face nearly as much pressure in the second period --
only eight shots. But he came up with two big stops on Kariya
one-timers, including a 40-footer that he just got his right leg
pad on. Fuhr also made a key stop on Ruslan Salei's drive from the
left circle with 5.7 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   He also had some good fortune. Drury missed the net off a nice
feed from Jim McKenzie, Fredrik Olausson was wide open in the slot,
but missed the net from 25 feet out on the Ducks' first, and Travis
Green rattled a shot off the post.

BITTER DEBATE IN EUROPE ON U.S. ROLE IN NATO  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
PARIS _ As bombing raids mount over Serbia, NATO's war against
Slobodan Milosevic is paralleled by a bitter war of words raging
inside the borders of the Atlantic Alliance itself.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The confrontation pits NATO's supporters against an unlikely
coalition of opponents _ ranging from the Communist Party in Italy
to the extreme right-wing National Front in France, along with a
broad range of prominent intellectuals and mainstream politicians _
who view the intervention in Kosovo as a thinly disguised effort to
impose Washington's will on Europe's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Held on a leash by the Americans, we have violated
international law and the charter of the United Nations,'' charges
former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot accept the presence on its soil of a man
(Milosevic) and a regime which, for nearly 10 years, has engaged in
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and now in Kosovo, in ethnic cleansing
operations, assassinations and massacres,'' responds French
President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, NATO's critics and supporters alike ask precisely
the same question that troubles many Americans: Will Europe ever be
able to police its own back yard?
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo demonstrates ``that a common European defense policy is
brutally absent today, and also that such a policy has never
appeared so necessary,'' Francois Hollande, first secretary of
France's governing Socialist Party, said  &LR; April 9 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has become the de facto department of diplomacy, defense
and security in Europe,'' declares former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua, a right-wing critic of the Kosovo intervention.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sign that the controversy will halt the bombing,
which is firmly backed by the center-left parties that govern 13 of
the European Union's 15 member-states in 1999 and also by a
majority of their voters.
</P>
<P>
   But there is every sign that the bitterness will be lasting, as
will European unhappiness with military reliance on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership with NATO in the Yugoslav crisis is simply a
cloak, masking great differences between the United States and its
European allies,'' a former high-ranking aide to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a Chronicle interview before
the bombing campaign had even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the cloak has decidedly come off, in a wave of the
harshest anti-Americanism to sweep Western Europe since the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony has been greatest in France, where suspicion of
U.S. intentions always runs high and where the commitment of troops
and equipment to the Kosovo intervention is the largest of any
European country in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At times, newspaper commentaries are so unremittingly hostile to
the United States that a reader might well imagine Paris is at war
with the Pentagon, rather than with the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of total victory (in Kosovo), one would have to
say that it is both a great military success for NATO _ that is,
for the United States _ and an irreparable humanitarian
catastrophe, a political setback for Europe,'' thundered Alain
Joxe, director of France's elite Graduate School of Social Studies
and an influential political pundit.
</P>
<P>
   America's strategic and economic views ``are dangerous and
foreign to our political ethics,'' he wrote in Le Monde on  &LR; April
12 &LR; . Its activities in Kosovo ``do not set the stage for postwar
reconstruction, but for mafia chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis Debray, a longtime adviser to late French President
Francois Mitterrand, went so far as to charge that his fellow
Europeans had become brain-dead automatons, their minds destroyed
by American imperialism and too much exposure to frivolous U.S.
cultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   In a fog induced by overconsumption of McDonald's, CNN and
Hollywood movies, ``America is deprogramming Europe, which grows as
uncivilized and myopic as its leader,'' he wrote in a widely quoted
attack on the Kosovo intervention April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``America: You have to be against her. That's the basic demand
of intellectual conformism, on the left and on the right (in
Europe),'' French writer Pascal Bruckner answered in an angry
reply. ``In short, you put those who want to save the Kosovars on
the same level as those who want to liquidate them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the memory of Auschwitz means anything, insists German
philosopher Hans Magnus Enzenberger, ``Europeans themselves are not
merely capable of intervening (in Kosovo), we are morally obligated
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then is the European Union so paralyzed, so wary of acting
without U.S. leadership? With 3 million troops, the European
defense establishment is more than able to meet the purely military
challenge of Yugoslavia. Nor is it too pinched for cash to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total arms expenditures of the EU's 15 member states
surpass $200 billion per year,'' notes Armand de Decker, president
of the Defense Commission of the Western European Union. ``That's
almost as much as the military budget of the United States, which
is $250 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Europe's defense expenditures _ and more
importantly, its decision-making procedures _ are parceled out over
15 central governments, legislatures and political party leaders.
As most EU countries merge their economies and move toward a single
currency, the prospects for a common defense policy remain cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, those prospects are even dimmer than they were
before 1999 opened. The first three months of this year were marked
by unprecedented divisiveness and scandal in the EU, leading up to
the wholesale resignation in late March of the organization's
entire 20-member ruling European Commission and its president,
Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the European Commission scandal, there had been a
glimmer of progress. At a September Anglo-French summit in St.
Malo, France, Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair signed a
declaration urging that joint defense arrangements be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But to date, concrete measures have been rare. Beyond the
establishment of a small experimental Franco-German infantry force
and the release of a 1997 position paper on further military
integration, almost no steps have been taken to create permanent
common security institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the position paper, both French and German strategists
assume that their common efforts will be conducted under a larger
NATO umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great force wielded by the United States in conflicts is
that they are decisive and they act,'' concedes French Defense
Minister Alain Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over Europe's dependence on America _ and its own
indecisiveness _ has grown steadily since the first bloody phases
of Yugoslavia's collapse between 1991 and 1995, which left 200,000
dead and 3 million homeless in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Sent in as peacemakers, but hamstrung by the lack of a
well-defined mandate, the European-led United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) was powerless to halt massacres that transpired in
plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir came on July 10, 1995, when Serbian forces overran the
eastern Bosnian city of Srebrenica, which was technically a
U.N.-protected enclave. As Dutch troops helplessly watched, the
Serbs disarmed and dragged off nearly all of the city's men. An
estimated 8,000 to 10,000 are believed to have been summarily
executed.
</P>
<P>
   The war also resulted in hundreds of U.N. casualties, primarily
among French, British and other European troops who were not
allowed to defend themselves fully, much less defend millions of
terrified civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a mission in which there was no clear understanding
what came next,'' said France's Lieutenant General Bertrand
Guillaume de Lapresle, who resigned as commander in chief of
UNPROFOR in 1995. ``I was a general with no enemy to fight and no
victory to win. What I can't put out of my mind is the 140 U.N.
soldiers who gave their lives in Bosnia, and the 1,200 who were
wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``NATO has a very clearly defined enemy and a clear
determination to achieve a military victory,'' de Lapresle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Europe,'' a bitter French foreign legionnaire told
a Chronicle reporter in 1995, shortly after their U.N. plane was
hit by Serbian anti-aircraft fire over Sarajevo and forced into an
emergency landing. ``Our approach is to let them shoot at us as
much as they like, and wait for the Americans to tell us when we
can shoot back.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 30 of that year, NATO air strikes supervised by the
United States were finally called in, and the Bosnian Serbs agreed
to a cease-fire within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia cast the absence of a coordinated European defense policy
in painfully stark terms, and set the controversial precedent that
is now being followed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans _ essentially the Germans, British and French _
play their part in the (Kosovo) offensive. But they would have been
perfectly unable to manage it without the United States,'' conclude
French political analysts Alain Frachon and Daniel Vernet.

   ``NATO has become the de facto department of diplomacy, defense
and security in Europe,'' declares former French Interior Minister
Charles Pasqua, a right-wing critic of the Kosovo intervention.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sign that the controversy will halt the bombing,
which is firmly backed by the center-left parties that govern 13 of
the European Union's 15 member-states in 1999 and also by a
majority of their voters.
</P>
<P>
   But there is every sign that the bitterness will be lasting, as
will European unhappiness with military reliance on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership with NATO in the Yugoslav crisis is simply a
cloak, masking great differences between the United States and its
European allies,'' a former high-ranking aide to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a Chronicle interview before
the bombing campaign had even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the cloak has decidedly come off, in a wave of the
harshest anti-Americanism to sweep Western Europe since the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimony has been greatest in France, where suspicion of
U.S. intentions always runs high and where the commitment of troops
and equipment to the Kosovo intervention is the largest of any
European country in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   At times, newspaper commentaries are so unremittingly hostile to
the United States that a reader might well imagine Paris is at war
with the Pentagon, rather than with the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of total victory (in Kosovo), one would have to
say that it is both a great military success for NATO _ that is,
for the United States _ and an irreparable humanitarian
catastrophe, a political setback for Europe,'' thundered Alain
Joxe, director of France's elite Graduate School of Social Studies
and an influential political pundit.
</P>
<P>
   America's strategic and economic views ``are dangerous and
foreign to our political ethics,'' he wrote in Le Monde on  &LR; April
12 &LR; . Its activities in Kosovo ``do not set the stage for postwar
reconstruction, but for mafia chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis Debray, a longtime adviser to late French President
Francois Mitterrand, went so far as to charge that his fellow
Europeans had become brain-dead automatons, their minds destroyed
by American imperialism and too much exposure to frivolous U.S.
cultural exports.
</P>
<P>
   In a fog induced by overconsumption of McDonald's, CNN and
Hollywood movies, ``America is deprogramming Europe, which grows as
uncivilized and myopic as its leader,'' he wrote in a widely quoted
attack on the Kosovo intervention April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``America: You have to be against her. That's the basic demand
of intellectual conformism, on the left and on the right (in
Europe),'' French writer Pascal Bruckner answered in an angry
reply. ``In short, you put those who want to save the Kosovars on
the same level as those who want to liquidate them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the memory of Auschwitz means anything, insists German
philosopher Hans Magnus Enzenberger, ``Europeans themselves are not
merely capable of intervening (in Kosovo), we are morally obligated
to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then is the European Union so paralyzed, so wary of acting
without U.S. leadership? With 3 million troops, the European
defense establishment is more than able to meet the purely military
challenge of Yugoslavia. Nor is it too pinched for cash to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The total arms expenditures of the EU's 15 member states
surpass $200 billion per year,'' notes Armand de Decker, president
of the Defense Commission of the Western European Union. ``That's
almost as much as the military budget of the United States, which
is $250 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Europe's defense expenditures _ and more
importantly, its decision-making procedures _ are parceled out over
15 central governments, legislatures and political party leaders.
As most EU countries merge their economies and move toward a single
currency, the prospects for a common defense policy remain cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, those prospects are even dimmer than they were
before 1999 opened. The first three months of this year were marked
by unprecedented divisiveness and scandal in the EU, leading up to
the wholesale resignation in late March of the organization's
entire 20-member ruling European Commission and its president,
Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the European Commission scandal, there had been a
glimmer of progress. At a September Anglo-French summit in St.
Malo, France, Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair signed a
declaration urging that joint defense arrangements be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But to date, concrete measures have been rare. Beyond the
establishment of a small experimental Franco-German infantry force
and the release of a 1997 position paper on further military
integration, almost no steps have been taken to create permanent
common security institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the position paper, both French and German strategists
assume that their common efforts will be conducted under a larger
NATO umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great force wielded by the United States in conflicts is
that they are decisive and they act,'' concedes French Defense
Minister Alain Richard.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over Europe's dependence on America _ and its own
indecisiveness _ has grown steadily since the first bloody phases
of Yugoslavia's collapse between 1991 and 1995, which left 200,000
dead and 3 million homeless in Croatia and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Sent in as peacemakers, but hamstrung by the lack of a
well-defined mandate, the European-led United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) was powerless to halt massacres that transpired in
plain sight.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir came on July 10, 1995, when Serbian forces overran the
eastern Bosnian city of Srebrenica, which was technically a
U.N.-protected enclave. As Dutch troops helplessly watched, the
Serbs disarmed and dragged off nearly all of the city's men. An
estimated 8,000 to 10,000 are believed to have been summarily
executed.
</P>
<P>
   The war also resulted in hundreds of U.N. casualties, primarily
among French, British and other European troops who were not
allowed to defend themselves fully, much less defend millions of
terrified civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left a mission in which there was no clear understanding
what came next,'' said France's Lieutenant General Bertrand
Guillaume de Lapresle, who resigned as commander in chief of
UNPROFOR in 1995. ``I was a general with no enemy to fight and no
victory to win. What I can't put out of my mind is the 140 U.N.
soldiers who gave their lives in Bosnia, and the 1,200 who were
wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``NATO has a very clearly defined enemy and a clear
determination to achieve a military victory,'' de Lapresle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Europe,'' a bitter French foreign legionnaire told
a Chronicle reporter in 1995, shortly after their U.N. plane was
hit by Serbian anti-aircraft fire over Sarajevo and forced into an
emergency landing. ``Our approach is to let them shoot at us as
much as they like, and wait for the Americans to tell us when we
can shoot back.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 30 of that year, NATO air strikes supervised by the
United States were finally called in, and the Bosnian Serbs agreed
to a cease-fire within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia cast the absence of a coordinated European defense policy
in painfully stark terms, and set the controversial precedent that
is now being followed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans _ essentially the Germans, British and French _
play their part in the (Kosovo) offensive. But they would have been
perfectly unable to manage it without the United States,'' conclude
French political analysts Alain Frachon and Daniel Vernet.

WHY NO EUROPEAN NATION HAS EMERGED AS A LEADER  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
PARIS _ Behind Europe's acceptance of U.S. leadership in the
Yugoslav crisis, however grudging and bitter, is the fact that the
European Union itself has no leader. With the EU's executive branch
and governing commission floundering in scandal and unprecedented
disarray, none of the organization's member states seems ready to
step in and provide direction.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three nations _ Britain, France and Germany _ have the
population size, global influence and military capabilities to
claim such leadership. Yet for different reasons, each is unable to
exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the reason is history. The EU was established in the
ruins of World War II, and its fundamental intention was to create
a European-wide political buffer against the resurgence of
expansionist German nationalism. Although Bonn commits a hefty $42
billion annually to defense, making it one of the world's five top
military spenders, it is still relegated to a supporting role in
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until the Kosovo intervention, to which it has
contributed special Tornado fighters equipped with radar-jamming
gear, Germany had never directly participated in a NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   The British, whose widely admired political system and World War
II victory might have led to pre-eminent status in postwar Europe,
did not join the EU (then known as the Common Market) until 1973
and have often played a disruptive part in its unifying efforts
since. After refusing to sign on to the euro, the EU's new single
currency, and rejecting key trade and social agreements, the
British have effectively opted out of European leadership by
choice.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves France, which was the central player in the
foundation of the EU's parent body 40 years ago, and is the world's
third largest defense spender with a yearly military budget of $48
billion. For many years, its dominance in Europe was unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   France's problem today is politics, and specifically the impact
of ``cohabitation'' _ the French term for shared government, with
power at the top split between left and right, between prime
minister and president. Cohabitation has stymied French governance
for most of the past 13 years, making it difficult for Paris to
rule France efficiently, much less undertake leadership in a
European war.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's leadership quandary in a security crisis is compounded
by a yawning technology gap between the old and new worlds, which
has obliged French, British and German operations to rely on U.S.
computers and satellites in battlefield command and control.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the globe's five leading defense contractors are U.S.
firms. Just two of them, Lockheed Martin and Boeing-McDonnell
Douglas, have an annual sales turnover _ and research and
development capacity _ 50 percent higher than all European defense
firms combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``American `hyper-power' irritates us because it bluntly reduces
us to the recognition of our own historic diminishment,'' says
Bruno Racine, a chief adviser to former French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe.

SONICS BURNED AGAIN, SET NBA RECORD FOR FEWEST REBOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The good news is Rex Chapman did not treat the Sonics
like a pop-a-shot machine.
</P>
<P>
   That was a small consolation for the Sonics, however, after
losing to the Phoenix Suns 101-94 Wednesday night at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The bad new is the Sonics (18-19) are still functioning like a
yo-yo. No sooner than the team takes an upward turn it falls down.
In losing for the second time in three home games, the Sonics hit a
couple of low points.
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed just 19 rebounds, which set an NBA record for
fewest in a game. More importantly, though, their season might as
well be spinning on a thin string.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Sonics' third loss in six games and this latest one _
a critical contest against a team fighting the them for a playoff
spot _ left the Sonics toying with their chances of making the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (19-20) drew even with the Sonics in the Western
Conference. Both teams meet again Sunday in Phoenix for a third and
final time in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens in that game Phoenix will own the
tie-breaker edge against the Sonics, who now sit in the eighth
slot.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, which hosts the Sonics Thursday, is just 1{ games
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been worried about making the playoffs,'' said Sonics
coach Paul Westphal. `` ... We've got some good teams that are
chasing us and one good team just tied us up. We have 13 games left
and we've got to make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Sonics have won every other game the past 11
days, it figures they should beat the Kings. What happens after
that is up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy season, an up-and-down season. I don't like this
season,'' said point guard Gary Payton, who led the Sonics with 31
points. ``I didn't want to play this season anyway. But we have to
just concentrate on making the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 73-72 with 9:29 left in the fourth quarter.
Phoenix then pulled away with a 20-6 run. Seattle had just two
field goals during that six-minute span.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing. What else can you say in a game where both
teams desperately needed to win the game?,'' said guard Hersey
Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Sonics did not rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Since both team shot extremely well, there were not many boards
to grab. Phoenix benefited from 57-percent shooting and the Sonics
shot a season-high 59 percent. However, the Suns were hungry on the
glass. They outrebounded the Sonics 32-19 overall and 12-3 on the
offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Sonics' rebounding problem stemmed from using a
small lineup to run with the Suns. That meant center Olden Polynice
played just 22 minutes and sat out the entire fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Detlef Schrempf led the Sonics with four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by Westphal's rotation, Polynice said it was no wonder
the Sonics beat the previous NBA-low of 20 rebounding in game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be frustrated when I don't play,'' said Polynice,
who had three rebounds. ``I'm the (team's) leading rebounder and
we're getting outrebounded. ... I believe in myself. I don't like
it when people don't believe in me. Of course we got outrebounded.
Your best rebounder is sitting on the bench. I hate losing when we
know exactly why.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the reason wasn't Chapman, who has put together a
number of shooting clinics against this team to become a notorious
Sonic killer.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help though that Phoenix point guard Jason Kidd _ a
43-percent shooter _ decided to find his jump shot. Kidd dropped a
season-high 30 points on the Sonics to go with 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's 3-pointer over Payton with 1:58 left in the game put the
Suns ahead 95-85 and killed any chance of a Sonics rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that every time we play Seattle, it's gonna be a
war,'' Kidd said. ``You just hope the ball is bouncing for you and
you take care of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had just 14 turnovers in what was an uptempo game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics fell behind by 15 points in the first, then outscored
the Suns, 31-17 in the second. After taking a 49-48 lead at
halftime, the Sonics played the Suns to a near standstill in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 lead changes and two ties in the period, which
ended with the Suns ahead 67-66. Phoenix, though, shot 75 percent
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more aggressive than we were most of the game,''
Westphal said. ``Usually the most aggressive team wins. The only
time I can say we were the aggressors was in the second period. The
rest of the time they were just more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Sonics, they have rebounded with more force
whenever their record has fallen below the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it all year long when people thought we were going
to fold,'' Hawkins said. ``I don't want to say I feel tremendous
pressure. I feel more frustrated than anything. Whenever we think
we can run off some wins, we tend to not play as well as we're
capable of playing.''

MARINERS GET LITTLE RELIEF AS BULLPEN SQUANDERS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners figured out Ivan Rodriguez Wednesday
night. The rest of the Texas Rangers gave them trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who had nine RBI Tuesday, had just one of the
Rangers' 17 hits Wednesday. The non-Pudge portion of the lineup,
combined with the efforts of winning pitcher Jeff Zimmerman, was
enough to down the Mariners 9-6 before 20,123 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, a rookie whose brother, Jordan, pitches in the
Mariners' minor league system, was impressive enough in his major
league debut Tuesday, striking out four in 12/3 shutout innings.
Last night, he retired all eight batters he faced from the fifth
inning to the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, in contrast, got little relief from Jose Paniagua
and Jose Mesa. Starter Butch Henry handed Paniagua a 4-3 lead with
the bases loaded and one out in the sixth. A Juan Gonzalez
sacrifice fly tied the score, and a run-scoring single by Tom
Goodwin put Texas ahead an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa failed to keep things close in the ninth, allowing four
runs on four hits and a walk in two-thirds of an inning. One of the
hits was an opposite-field homer to the seats by Lee Stevens _ the
third homer Seattle's closer has allowed in less than five innings
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got their lead off Zimmerman, who allowed a
sacrifice fly to Jay Buhner that made it 4-3 Seattle in the fifth.
But the right-hander followed by getting John Mabry to ground out,
then went 1-2-3 through the sixth and seventh. Only two of the
eight hitters he retired had faced him Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's game-tying sacrifice fly could have caused much more
damage. Gonzalez greeted Paniagua with a drive to the center field
warning track. Ken Griffey Jr. raced it down, turning his back to
home plate for an over-the-shoulder catch to make another No. 24,
Willie Mays, proud.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua escaped by getting Rodriguez to pop out, but Goodwin's
single, which followed a walk, a hit and a pop out, gave Texas its
5-4 seventh-inning advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Henry threw 120 pitches over 52/3 innings, allowing four runs on
10 hits and five walks. He got out of trouble in the first after
loading the bases on two hits and a walk. He followed by striking
out Gonzalez and getting Rodriguez to bounce into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners shortsop Giomar Guevara teamed with second baseman
David Bell for that double play, plus another with a runner in
scoring position that got Paniagua out of the seventh. Russ Davis
and Bell turned a double play to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara figured in several other scoring opportunities. After
Dan Wilson walked to lead off the third, Guevara surprised Texas
left fielder Rusty Greer by lining a gapper that got past Greer and
went to the fence. Wilson scored, tying the game 1-1, and Guevara
advanced to third on Bell's ground out.
</P>
<P>
   But David Segui struck out looking _ protesting that the third
strike was inside _ and Griffey also struck out, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Texas regained the lead in the fourth, when Zeile led off with
an infield single and scored after a single by Stevens and a double
by Royce Clayton. A sacrifice fly by McLemore scored Stevens, but
Guevara prevented further damage by ranging far to his right for a
grounder and throwing out Roberto Kelly from deep in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   In their half of the fourth, the M's cut the Rangers' lead to
3-2 when Davis singled home Edgar Martinez, who had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Doubles by Bell, Segui and Griffey keyed a two-run ninth for
Seattle, which tied a club record with eight doubles on the night.

SONICS HAVE HOPE IF MISMATCHED PARTS GET THEM INTO MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Much has been made of the athletic schizophrenia
enveloping the Sonics. Beat a good team one day, blow one to a bad
team the next.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of fans have forgotten that's how it works for average
teams. But the memory lapse is understandable. Not since the
1989-90 and 1990-91 seasons, when the Sonics finished 41-41 each
time, have Seattle fans witnessed such annoying mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   My little theory on the Sonics is that this outfit was
ill-designed from the git-go, owing to four things:
</P>
<P>
   Too old.
</P>
<P>
   Too young.
</P>
<P>
   Too fat.
</P>
<P>
   Too broke.
</P>
<P>
   Although being too old and too young at the same time sounds a
bit difficult, the Sonics have in this aspect managed the
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is the Sonics have only two important players, Gary
Payton and Vin Baker, in their mid-career primes.
</P>
<P>
   In Dale Ellis, 38, Detlef Schrempf, 36, Olden Polynice 34, and
to a lesser extent, Hersey Hawkins, 32, the Sonics have four
players on the downside bound to be impacted more seriously by the
compressed schedule of this cockeyed season. They'll deny it, of
course. What else can they say? If they complain, they will look
even more foolish because it was their contributions to the work
stoppage that helped create this abysmal season.
</P>
<P>
   The roster also includes three rookies _ Rashard Lewis, Vladimir
Stepania and Jelani McCoy _ who combined have three years of
college ball (all McCoy's, at UCLA) and no pro summer league or
exhibition experience. They all have shown enough talent to
indicate they will have decent to good NBA careers, yet at the
moment are of almost no help.
</P>
<P>
   Have I missed anybody who's currently contributing?
</P>
<P>
   An awkward mix, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that was something we were going to have to deal
with,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal, not wishing to question
the architect of this hasty construction, club president Wally
Walker. ``Det and Dale have extended their careers beyond the
normal range and have helped the franchise stay strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for occasions such as the one this week. Wednesday
night's game at KeyArena was the first of five games in six nights.
It's the second time this season the Sonics have endured so
ridiculous an itinerary. Anyone who suggests that 10-year vets have
no problem recovering from such a stretch also probably believes
that pro rasslers actually hurt each other.
</P>
<P>
   The too-fat aspect has been well-chronicled and even more
ruthlessly mocked. In Baker and free agent signee Billy Owens, the
Sonics had two of the worst examples of the self-indulgence that
was such a disgusting feature of the lockout. Owens' extra baggage
contributed to the knee problem that has him on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   The too-broke argument is less well-known but no less important.
It's not that the Sonics lack payroll funds, it's  &UR; rr &LR; just that
they have squandered a big chunk against the NBA salary cap. Call
it the ghost of Jim McIlvaine.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sonics unloaded the 7-foot stiff to New Jersey, they
had to take back Don MacLean and Michael Cage in order to balance
salaries. Cage retired and Westphal refuses to play MacLean,
meaning their nearly $5 million in salaries counted against the cap
are worth nothing in terms of basketball production.
</P>
<P>
   The McIlvaine mistake may someday threaten Bobby Ayala in the
Seattle Hall of Sports Infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Being too old, too young, too fat and too broke is a fairly
impressive collection of boondoggle for one team. Yet having said
that, all they have to do is win three games in May and the season
will be a modest success.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: That's the best former coach George Karl
accomplished in his last two seasons. With regular-season win
totals of 57 and 61 in those years, the Sonics barely survived
first-round death matches in '97 (beating Phoenix 3-2) and '98
(beating Minnesota 3-2), despite having the homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In beating Portland, Houston and the Lakers in one week, the
Sonics have at least established the plausibility of a first-round
upset. Additionally, Baker's recent return from injury and
corpulence means the Sonics have a low-post threat for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The methodology was a little unorthodox: An oral headslap from
his pal Payton in practice last week finally drew Baker's attention
to the fact that his wuss ways were taking down the team and his
future.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Payton's technique wasn't so unusual: How many times have
you smacked the toaster, TV or computer to get it to work?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment _ particularly after witnessing Wednesday's
desultory 101-94 home loss to the equally mediocre Suns _ it seems
unlikely the Sonics could do three times in a five-game series what
they did to the Lakers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't take into account how truly awful and
inconsistent the quality of play has been throughout the NBA. And
if there are any fans who recognize the meaninglessness of a
regular season, it is the legions trained by Karl in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of a season that should never have been, the
Sonics were doomed by design to never go far in the postseason. But
three wins in May, when age won't count as much as experience, when
conditioning won't be an issue, when the schedule is moot, will
salvage something from what otherwise has been utterly forgettable
and regrettable.

TOWN'S HEART RIPPED OUT BY DEATH OF FIVE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE AND MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EPHRATA, Wash. _ It was an outing to enjoy the simple pleasures
of spring. Instead, it ripped the heart out of this little farming
town.
</P>
<P>
   Rosio Curiel and Maria Chavez packed their five sons _ all but
one a preschooler _ into the car Tuesday night and headed out on a
sun-dappled evening to look at wildflowers sprouting on the
hillsides east of here.
</P>
<P>
   They never made it.
</P>
<P>
   Curiel's car plunged into an irrigation canal gorged with swift,
chilly water. Only the women got out alive. The five children
drowned, submerged in 15 feet of murky water.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of the five children _ ranging in age from 2 to 11 _
left people in Grant County nearly speechless in their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, about 120 people attended a rosary for the
children that was previously scheduled for a man who died in a car
accident last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died in innocence. We're here to assure support for the
families in their great sorrow at this time,'' Monsignor Martin
Skehan said at St. Rose of Lima Church, where the rosary was held.
</P>
<P>
   In the community, the sentiment was similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't believe this happened,'' Art Guerrero, who works
with Curiel's husband at a spearmint farm. ``Especially the five
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero stood atop the bank of the canal Wednesday near the
spot where the car went in.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers and locals alike couldn't comprehend the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't understand it,'' said Jery Summers, who had driven
from Moses Lake to see where the accident occurred. ``We just had
to see for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Added her companion, Leo Howell, ``They didn't even get a chance
at life.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed were brothers Alexis Curiel, 2, and Jose Curiel Jr., 4;
and brothers Victor Eduardo Chavez, 11, Jose Guadalupe Puga Chavez,
3, and Martin Puga Chavez, 2.
</P>
<P>
   They were victims of cruel circumstances. It was an accident,
Grant County Sheriff Bill Wiester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose people every year in those ditches,'' the sheriff
said. ``But not five children.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Chavez, 32, father of the three Chavez children, said, `I
feel that my children will be with me always. And they are in
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, said his wife, who is six months pregnant, is doing fine
and is with relatives in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   The two women had decided to take their children for a drive,
said Linda Catlin, who later comforted the women on the canal bank
and in Columbia Basin Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Curiel drove her 1987 Chevy Spectrum off a narrow blacktop and
up the embankment of the canal. It's common in Grant County, which
has hundreds of miles of canals, for people to drive on the flat
embankments above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Something happened as the car reached the top of the embankment.
Curiel had intended to drive over the bank and bridge that spans
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, Curiel hesitated at the last moment,
Wiester said.
</P>
<P>
   Catlin said the women, who don't speak English, may have been
confused by signs on a nearby bridge across the canal. The signs
warn of a primitive road and a 5-ton limit over the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The signs are in English.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Chavez, who was sitting in the front passenger seat,
mentioned the signs, Catlin said she was told. The women wondered
if they meant that they could go no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was enough to distract Curiel. From the gravel of
the embankment, her car plunged into the canal and overturned,
Wiester said.
</P>
<P>
   A window open to let in spring air allowed water to rush in.
Chavez and Curiel managed to get out the opened window.
</P>
<P>
   Rosio Curiel told Catlin that she saw her little children, their
arms extended to her, screaming ``Mommy.'' Maria Chavez yelled to
her oldest, Victor, to help his little brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing she heard was Victor telling her that he could
not swim, Catlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Curiel managed to scramble up the bank, her knees and elbows
torn of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambro, who lives nearby, was alerted about 6:50 p.m. by a
teenage neighbor. He and his sons, ages 16 and 15, rushed to the
bank with an extension cord.
</P>
<P>
   They found Chavez 400 yards away from where the car went in. She
grabbed the cord and pulled herself up the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was cold,'' Lambro said. ``She was as blue as your
jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiel walked up and down the bank, saying the word ``five.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought maybe there was a 5-year-old down there. We didn't
know she meant five people,'' Lambro said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiester said the women could not have gone back into the water
and pulled their children out of the overturned car.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go out and look at that bank, there is no way for a
person to go back in and rescue someone,'' he said. ``There is no
human being that I know who could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The current pulled the car 150 yards downstream. It sank in 15
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   On the bank, Rosio Curiel refused to be comforted. ``She was so
torn and shaking from the cold. But she wouldn't take a blanket.
She wanted us to go out there and get her kids,'' Catlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grant County Sheriff's Office sent divers and other
emergency personnel rushing to the embankment. It took an airplane
to spot the submerged car, Wiester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosio couldn't see the children when she found out they were
dead,'' Linda Catlin said. ``It hurt too much. She said, `My
children are dead. I might as well be dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, the news of the deaths spread throughout
the little shops of this community of 3,500 and the fields that
surround it. By early afternoon a memorial fund was being set up at
U.S. Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial and funeral arrangements had not been planned last
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Nava, 26, a friend of Chavez, said she is especially
concerned because Chavez is pregnant. Nava said Chavez is from
Wenatchee and works at JR Simplot in Quincy, and was with relatives
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry for the loss,'' Nava said. ``I have five children
myself. I've had my moments today to cry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was slowly making its way by word of mouth, said Allen
Dixon of Pioneer Muffler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sad; that's a lot of children. The currents are
swift up there. It's lucky the two women survived in it. You can't
blame the mothers. It was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia Ridge Elementary, Principal Debbie Beaudry gathered
her staff to talk about what had happened. Victor Chavez was a
fifth-grader there. A smile never seemed to leave his face, Beaudry
said. And he loved a chance to play soccer at recess.
</P>
<P>
   In his classroom Wednesday, his fellow students solemnly wrote
letters to his mother. They will be translated into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victor came here in first grade right out of Mexico,'' Beaudry
said. ``It was wonderful to watch him grow.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of town, Grant County Head Start was missing a
student. Jose Curiel had started going to the preschool in
September and was learning English.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a great little kid,'' said Julie Saunders, a
family advocate at the preschool. ``He was always happy and had a
lot of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   They were children of poverty whose parents left Mexico several
years ago to chase work in a new land.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, people grieved as if they had known them all their
lives. Many people simply walked atop the embankment, looked down
at the water and left.
</P>
<P>
   Someone left several brightly colored stuffed animals in a
cardboard box.
</P>
<P>
   ``In memory of five little angels,'' an inscription on the side
read.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinook Apartments, where Curiel and Chavez lived
next-door to each other, 4-year-old Jose Curiel's shiny red bike,
its silver, well-used training wheels jutting from the sides, was
still chained to the iron railing outside the apartment where he
had left it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recently enlarged sandbox in the tiny complex's courtyard,
normally full of children, was empty. A few kids rode bikes, but
mostly the toys and plastic push cars remained idle in the
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw either of the women yell at their kids,'' said
Janeen Costello, who manages the 12-unit apartment complex with her
husband. ``They were wonderful mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Costellos said Curiel had lived in her apartment for two
years, Chavez in hers for about four months. Curiel, known to her
friends as ``Rosie,'' was excited after the Costellos hired her to
help clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was teaching her English and she was teaching me Spanish,''
Costello said. ``She was really proud to be working, and her little
Pepe was always helping her with his brother Alexis.''

BENEFITS OF STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS FOR BREAST CANCER QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
 MARROW-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On Thursday, Jody Starr will learn from prestigious
scientific organizations that major studies indicate she could have
done just as well without the bone marrow transplant she had in
hopes of curbing her breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said Starr, a 34-year-old mother of two
who last week received a refined version of the bone marrow
transplant _ called a stem cell transplant _ after undergoing
high-dose chemotherapy and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the only chance I have,'' Starr said. ``Even if
I only get to live two more years, that's two more years with my
family.... I've got the breast cancer gene and, if one of my kids
gets that gene, I can at least be a guinea pig for developing a
treatment that might help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had already received standard chemotherapy, radiation and
surgery when the cancer returned last summer. Her oncologist said
her only chance for survival was a stem cell transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the
National Cancer Institute will release preliminary findings from
four large-scale studies of the effectiveness of high-dose
chemotherapy and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation as a
treatment for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer researchers and patient advocacy groups expect the
findings to show that the transplant procedure offers no
significant advantage over standard chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the debate that first greeted bone marrow
transplantation as a treatment for advanced breast cancer a decade
ago is expected to resume again on Thursday, loudly and perhaps
with more at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that some insurers will use this as an excuse
to quit paying for this,'' said Dr. William Bensinger, director of
the stem cell transplant program at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6,000 breast cancer patients received the transplant
in the United States last year. About 175,000 people are diagnosed
with breast cancer every year and 43,000 die from it, according to
the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation has been regarded as
the treatment of choice for high-risk women with advanced cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the data yet, but we've been told they
basically found no significant difference between transplantation
and routine chemotherapy,'' said Dr. E. Donnall Thomas, the former
clinical director at Fred Hutchinson who won the 1990 Nobel Prize
in medicine for pioneering the bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be premature to draw any conclusions,'' Thomas said. He
noted one study followed women for only a few years, which he
contends is not long enough when testing a therapy's effect against
a disease such as breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It took researchers decades to demonstrate that bone marrow
transplantation could cure leukemia, Thomas said, and it was
adjustments in methodology over time that led to today's 75 percent
cure rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still have the problem of women dying from breast
cancer,'' he said. ``If these studies are correct and if they show
the transplant isn't an improvement, it just means we may have to
try a different approach.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries physicians such as Thomas and Bensinger is that
this could also mean they may have to try harder to get insurance
companies to cover transplantation for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers have already said they will refuse to pay for the
transplant if these studies fail to show it is more effective than
standard chemo.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bruzzo, spokesman for Washington state's largest health
insurer, Regence Blue Shield, said he doubts his company would
change its policies based on the new reports. Regence, like most
insurers in Washington state today, covers stem cell
transplantation for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced five years ago and are convinced today that
there is enough evidence pointing to the potential benefit of this
treatment for some women,'' Bruzzo said. ``That's not going to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers have long complained that bone marrow transplantation
for breast cancer was forced on them by threat of litigation and
politics rather than by virtue of scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislating without the scientific evidence is a very
high-risk enterprise,'' said Karen Ignagni, president of the
American Association of Health Plans, the nation's largest trade
organization of managed care and health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the preliminary data released Thursday indicate
transplantation is no better than standard chemotherapy for
advanced breast cancer, Ignagni said it would be premature for
anyone to take action based on those reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very important for physicians, patients and
everyone interested to really look carefully at the full report
when it's released in mid-May,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states have already passed legislation requiring insurers
to cover bone marrow transplantation for people with breast cancer,
Ignagni noted. Those were actions taken because of the politics
that grew out of the battle among patients, doctors and insurers,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be quite a lot of discussion of all this as
a case study about how not to do it in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Livingston, a spokeswoman for the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, said the organization of cancer doctors decided
to release the findings early because of rumors and pressure from
patient-advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was speculation on what the findings were, and incorrect
information was getting out to the public,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary results of two U.S. studies and two
international studies of the therapeutic effect of bone marrow or
stem cell transplantation in breast cancer will be made available
Thursday through the organization's Web site, www.asco.org, and
through a link with the National Cancer Institute's Web site
(www.nci.nih.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those studies show, Fred Hutchinson's Bill Bensinger is
already convinced stem cell transplantation for people such as Jody
Starr is better than standard chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the cure rate for patients like her with standard
therapy is less than 10 or maybe 15 percent,'' Bensinger said.
``Our data here already shows a third of these patients may be
cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers once complained it would be impossible to study the
effectiveness of the transplant if they were forced to cover it, he
noted. They were forced to cover it, and the studies were still
carried out. Further studies should continue, he said, and insurers
should help pay for the research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we're going to make progress is through
continuing these clinical trials,'' Bensinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried all the conventional therapies,'' Starr said.
``This is my only alternative.... It's worked for some people
already. I'm hoping it works for me.''

GOOD NEWS EXPECTED IN BOEING EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co.'s stock surged 10 percent to a
four-month high Wednesday, partly because of expectations that the
company will deliver some good news when it reports first-quarter
earnings on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the stock market away from technology also led
investors back to Boeing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the aerospace giant rose 3 and three-eighths to close
at $38. At one point, the stock traded at more than $39 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will release its first quarter numbers before the stock
market opens Thursday, and the company is expected to report that
net income rose 43 cents a share, according to the average estimate
of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., a research company
that tracks analysts' estimates of corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think Boeing's earnings could be as much as 50
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, it will be several times higher than the 5
cents a share Boeing earned in the first quarter last year when it
struggled with production problems in its Commercial Airplanes
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that Boeing must continue to show improvement going
forward,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen Mackenzie firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year Boeing has taken a number of steps to turn its
core airplane business around. It has cut overtime on the next
generation 737 model. Production lines are more efficient and work
force is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial business will still fall well short this year
of posting the profits it once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing 1997 and 1998, analysts were hoping for
better news this year. Then on Dec. 2, Boeing surprised Wall Street
by cutting earnings projections for 1999 and 2000. Its stock, which
had traded at $40.50 a share the day earlier, fell 17 percent in
one day.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial group has forecast profit margins of 2 percent to
3 percent this year, and 1 percent to 3 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said they want to see margins of more
than 7 percent in the commercial division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing earned $1.1 billion, or $1.15 a share, on
revenue of $56.2 billion. That was significantly better than 1997,
when charges related to jetliner production problems resulted in a
loss of $178 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $45.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 559 airplanes in 1998, and made zero
profit on those planes, though it did show a small commercial
profit in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Boeing plans to deliver 620 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts on Thursday morning will be looking closely at how well
Boeing's commercial margins for the first quarter compare with the
1.9 percent commercial margins the company posted for the fourth
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   That will indicate whether Boeing's performance is continuing to
improve.

HONORING A GREAT COLUMNIST, BUT NOT FOR HIS PERSONAL LIFE

<P>
   Ernie Pyle, an authentic giant in column-writing, died 54 years
ago today(4-18) at age 44. While serving as a war correspondent on
the little Pacific island of Ie(CQ) Shima off Okinawa, he took a
Japanese bullet in his left temple. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pyle, who wrote about World War II from the perspective of men
in the trenches, did many things well as a columnist. He got out of
the office and did real reporting. He avoided the trap of writing
only about big-name personalities or quoting only muckety-mucks.
Beyond that, he was smart enough to tell obtuse editors who wanted
him to cover breaking news to go to hell. If they didn't recognize
his strengths, he did. (James Tobin notes all this in his book
``Ernie Pyle's War: America's Eyewitness to World War II.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those were enough reasons for the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists to have selected Pyle's death date to be National
Columnists Day. I feel a little responsible for that. When I was
NSNC president a few years ago I asked one of our members to find
an appropriate date for my idea of having such a day, and he
recommended April 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So today I honor Pyle as well as all good columnists _ the ones
who understand that their job is not to get famous enough to be a
talking head on TV but, rather, to make readers think in fresh
ways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I hope nobody imagines that columnists _ or anyone
else _ should seek to imitate Pyle's life. Even if Pyle had not
been killed while trying to hide in a ditch thousands of miles from
his native Indiana, he already had paid much too high a price for
the work he did. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider: He was on the road relentlessly. His married life
usually was in shambles. He was childless, partly because of his
own sexual dysfunction. He drank too much. His wife, whom he
eventually divorced in great angst, was mentally ill and also
consumed far too much alcohol and medication. Pyle, not a brilliant
craftsman of words _ but nonetheless direct and clear in his
writing _ often struggled with whether he could produce even one
more word. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some role model. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having someone say of you what Lee G. Miller, one of
Pyle's editors and author of ``The Story of Ernie Pyle,'' wrote of
Pyle and his wife Jerry (Geraldine): The mental distresses she
suffered may have been because of ``something in her relationship
with Ernie; during some of their years together theirs was a
non-physical union, due to a functional incapacity on Ernie's part
which was eventually redressed. Conceivably Jerry was affected by
an unrealized jealousy of Ernie's growing importance. . . Whatever
the cause, something malevolent was gnawing at her.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, in fact, had been reluctant to get married at all and
later insisted they tell none of their friends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having someone say of you what Pyle said of himself and
Jerry before he left to cover the war: ``Our visits to Washington
seem almost like dreams. When people over the country ask us where
we live, we say Washington, D.C. . . . Yet we really have no home
at all. . . (O)ur visits to Washington are so infrequent and so
brief that each one is like a daze. . . We realize at the end that
we have talked to lots of friends, yet individually we have talked
to nobody. . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Always, after we leave Washington, we have a little talk to
ourselves, and we visualize the day when disappointment in us will
have wearied all of our old friends, and we see ourselves
eventually returning to Washington with nobody at all to speak to
us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or imagine writing this, as Pyle did about himself: ``. . .my
life is purposeless and tortured, and soon my ability to carry on
and make a living will be impaired, and that will be the beginning
of the end.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or this: ``. . .I feel that my capacity ever to produce the
column again has died.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What column is worth that? None. What career of any kind is
worth that? None. Pyle told much truth and we honor him for that.
But English man of letters Cyril Connolly was right: ``Better to
write for yourself and have no public,'' he said, ``than to write
for the public and have no self.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite what our culture would have us believe, throwing oneself
on the pyre of personal sacrifice in pursuit of professional
advancement in any field is not honorable at all. Rather, it is
distressing evidence of a sad confusion between what is of lasting
value and what is ephemeral. &QL;

   1. 'GET OUT, YOU'D BETTER SAVE YOUR OWN NECK' : PRISTINA DIARY
Despite requests to leave the country immediately, and death
threats and hostile treatment from Serb ultras, Der Spiegel
magazine's Belgrade correspondent Renate Flottau, 54, remained at
her observation post in Kosovo after the start of the NATO bombing
of Yugoslavia. Her contact with the Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,
who gave her his last uncensored interview before his enforced
preventive detention in Serbian police custody, put Flottau in a
dangerous situation. Der Spiegel. 2,700 words. (In German.) 2.

THE REAL DIVIDE It is said that in the battle over President
Clinton and his scandals this past year, the culture wars reached a
grand finale, and decades of controversy over the sexual and moral
ideas of the 1960s neatly exploded into a full-sccale political

outsider, as Bill Clinton keeps learninjg. By Paul Berman. From The

TRANSPLANTATION - SUCCESS AT SIX MONTHS The first human hand
transplantation was carried out in France last September. The
recipient was given new combinations of immunosuppressive drugs.
Six months after the operation, the limb has not been rejected and
the recipient has movement in the hand and some sensation. The
findings indicate that, in the light of new combinations of
immunosuppressive drugs, hand transplantation is technically
feasible. By Sally Hargreaves. The Lancet News Service. 1,000

senses - as in feeling pain in a limb that is not there or a taste
that deviates vastly from the norm - have traditionally been
regarded as annoying side effects of injuries or dismissed as
neurotic symptoms. In recent years, however, a surge of scientific
interest in the mechanisms of human taste and olfaction has focused
new attention on the ways in which thse senses can become
disordered, and phantom sensations are receiving greater scrutiny.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY:
 &HT;    Court-church controversy:
 &HT;    Which Ten Commandments?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skirmishing and random small-arms fire continues around the
church-state issue of posting the Ten Commandments in courthouses
and schools.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Asheville, N.C., though already twice
overruled in the case by appellate courts, has said again that the
commandments can stay up in the Hayward County courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County in Georgia blew $100,000 in a losing legal battle to
keep a commandments plaque in its courthouse four years ago. So,
recently challenged on the same point, nearby Lumpkin Country
decided to take down its plaque, fiscal discretion being the better
part of theocratic valor.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Supreme Court decided in '95 that the Ten
Commandments monument on the state capitol grounds is historical,
not religious, which would be news to Moses.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, a fellow who set up the Center for Phallic Worship
somehow failed to persuade the Adams County school board to install
six-foot marble male sex organs on the grounds of the four high
schools that display Ten Commandments tablets, as a sort of
fair's-fair gesture.
</P>
<P>
   So, you could say, the case law is mixed. (That, and it's
unclear whether Priapus is making a comeback.)
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't the issue of whether the commandments are religious
or only historical become clear when you ask the question: Which
Ten Commandments? That the question even exists makes the religious
nature of the displays obvious.
</P>
<P>
   There are three basic versions _ Jewish, Catholic-Lutheran and
Protestant _ and the differences proliferate with various
translations: New American Standard, King James, Douay and more.
Broad agreements in principle may mask but don't moot the
implications of differences over particulars, and those differences
can seem trivial only to the religiously indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish reading begins ``I the Lord am your God who brought
you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage.'' The second
commandment says ``You shall have no other gods besides Me.'' The
Protestant version uses similar language but combines the two
commandments. The Catholic-Lutheran reads instead: ``I am the Lord
your God; you shall not have strange Gods before me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some differences have subtle implications. Christian versions
caution against taking the name of God in vain. The Jewish version
admonishes, ``You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord
your God.'' Other differences have stronger implications. The
commandment Christians read as ``You shall not kill,'' Jews read as
``You shall not murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Robert S. Alley of the University of Richmond testified in
a South Carolina case: ``Among faith groups there are wide
differences concerning language, order, verse division, and content
. . . The very act of choosing a single version of the commandments
reflects a sectarian preference to the exclusion of others.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence done by posting the Ten Commandments in government
buildings is not only to the principle of church-state separation
but to the respect religious differences deserve. (For the contrary
view, see ``Yugoslavia.'')

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: RE-INVENTING THE WORLD WIDE WEB
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Unlike Vice President Al Gore, Tim
Berners-Lee hasn't claimed to have invented the Internet. But he
did invent the World Wide Web, which has made the Internet truly
useful to people.
</P>
<P>
   In his initial research paper, written in 1991 for his employer
at the time, the CERN physics lab in Geneva, Switzerland, he
summarized what he had in mind:
</P>
<P>
   ``The WWW project merges the techniques of networked information
and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information
system. The project represents any information accessible over the
network as part of a seamless hypertext information space.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as millions of users have gone on line, that early
vision hasn't changed. ``It's all about human communication though
shared knowledge,'' Berners-Lee said the other day in a talk at
Laboratory for Computer Science on the campus of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where the English-born scientist has
worked since 1994. ``In universal space,'' he noted, ``anything can
refer to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, Berners-Lee serves as director of the W3 Consortium, the
official body that coordinates Web standards. At 43, his creative
juices still flow. But Berners-Lee wonders whether the world is
making the most of his brainchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you own a digital camera?'' he asked a luncheon guest
before giving his lecture. Thereupon, he pulled out his camera,
inserted a memory chip and snapped away at his companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought about putting the pictures of your kids on a
Web page where their grandparents can see them and link them to
their own pages?'' he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   If Berners-Lee had his way, the White House Web pages and other
such vital sites would be interactive in ways that go well beyond
leaving an e-mail message for the president _ a message unlikely to
be read.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to change the home page by adding your
comments, to which others would add their comments and so on, with
all of it being tied together through links,'' he says, adding:
``As you can read, so can you write. If you notice a connection,
make a link.''
</P>
<P>
   Berners-Lee calls this process _ which has little to do with the
current big push for more multimedia bandwidth _ ``being creative
with others.'' He recognizes that it needs ``a stable
infrastructure.'' (The consortium places a high priority on
improving Web security, striving to devise ``digital signatures''
that create ``a web of trust.'')
</P>
<P>
   As Berners-Lee puts it: ``When you turn on your computer, what
you should see is information, what you should deal with is
information. You should be able to create it, to absorb it; you
should be able to exchange it freely in the informational space.
The computer should just be your portal into the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that will be in the form of documents, such as poetry,
to which only human beings can relate, while some of it will be in
structured tables, best digested by fast machines. His point is
that all of it should work seamlessly together, along with the
digital photos that he took during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be on a Web site,'' Berners-Lee promises, ``but not
one that you'll have access to.''

   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to host his
counterparts in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization here next
weekend, marking the 50th anniversary of the security structure
that has stood sentry over Europe throughout the Cold War, all are
aware that there is far more history shared than the immediate
crisis situation in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The following is a detailed timeline of that storied history,
from NATO's creation to arguably its greatest challenge:

   WASHINGTON _ Many had been warning NATO, that by admitting
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that the West risked being
dragged into the Eastern European melting pot of ethnic atrocities
and centuries-long quarrels.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody told the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians that we would
be at war just weeks after joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   What makes matters worse, is that our enemy seems not to be some
dictator in the Middle East, but a former ally and president of the
country formerly considered the only Communist bloc member with at
least some level of prosperity established. Poles and Yugoslavians
have a similar history, and are connected by friendships and
families. Even our respective national anthems sound similar.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Poles are afraid of fighting for a right cause. We
have been fighting wars for the last few hundred years -- first for
freedom of our own homeland, then for someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   An old Polish saying goes: ``For our freedom and yours.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Poles do not believe that NATO is fighting in
Kosovo for a right cause. It's just that we did not expect that we
would be called upon to fight for the Alliance so quickly. The
primary basis for the NATO enlargement process was about the
Alliance fighting for us.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish campaign to join NATO was the most brilliant
diplomatic action myself and my colleagues in the Polish press have
covered in Poland's post-Communist period.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the amazing solidarity among differing Polish
political forces -- from liberal to conservative -- and unwavering
support of Polish public opinion for NATO membership, a succession
of Polish presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers were
able to push hard for crucial United States support for NATO
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was so intense, that two years ago a high-ranking
NATO official told me jokingly, ``I can't stand you, Poles, anymore
coming to my office to talk about enlargement -- if it was up to me
you would be already in NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   But what even the supporters of the enlargement in Washington
could not understand for a long time, was that NATO membership was
much more than just another foreign policy issue in Poland. Because
we had to fight too many wars to defend ourselves, we do understand
what the feeling of security means.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of being under the control of others -- most
notably the Soviet Union -- we had at last the chance to choose,
independently, our allies and our friends. That was not about
foreign policy or national interest, that was about our future as a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   I started covering NATO enlargement while on assignment from my
newspaper in Moscow in 1992. Back then, just months after the death
of the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union, only a few people in Warsaw
would openly discuss NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration -- I was told by then-National Security
Advisor Brent Scowcroft -- did not discuss it even in theory.
</P>
<P>
   Then, President Bush lost the November election to the young
governor of Arkansas, who -- in the opinion of many Central
Europeans -- did not care much about foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO enlargement looked bad, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   But a complicated play of diplomacy and lobbying by the
Polish-American community a few years ago, helped the Clinton
administration to change its position, or rather lack of interest,
about NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton publicly promised NATO would enlarge
by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans didn't appear to be very interested in the
issue, public debate was still very intense. Many things said by
opponents of enlargement were simply not true. I can't tell how
many times while covering NATO enlargement-related events in
Washington, that I was confronted by a surprising amount of false
information being spread.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in the United States, after the fierce debate in the
Congress, the right cause prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   I will remember the night of April 30, 1998, for the rest of my
life. Exactly at 10.27 p.m. (EST) the U.S. Senate voted to ratify
NATO enlargement by large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Polish Ambassador Jerzy Kozminski, who was the chief mastermind
behind the Polish diplomatic campaign, was in the diplomatic
gallery. I swear I saw tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I told to my Polish colleague: ``Hey, look, I think the
ambassador is crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look better at yourself,'' he said to me.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For four decades, NATO stood sentry at Europe's
eastern doorstep, poised to unleash massive tanks, intercontinental
bombers and, if need be, nuclear warheads to thwart the military
threat of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Deterrence worked. The Soviet Union collapsed and NATO won,
without firing a shot, the only war it ever planned to fight.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the largest summit of world leaders ever assembled
here gathers next weekend to mark NATO's 50th anniversary, that win
has been eclipsed. Suddenly NATO is being tested by a symptom of
its own success.
</P>
<P>
   It was the victory of NATO-allied Western capitalist democracies
over Soviet-bloc communism, after all, that set the stage for
Yugoslavia to explode. It's been left for NATO to pick up the
pieces, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo, the seat of a campaign of
atrocities that triggered the largest combat mission in NATO's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now confronting here, I think, the last battle for the
soul of Europe,'' said former U.S. diplomat David Gompert, director
of the National Defense Research Institute at the Rand Corp., a
non-profit research and policy group. ``It's a battle that needs to
be won.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, though, was never designed to fight the sort of battle
being waged in Kosovo. Since March 24, the alliance has been flying
by the seat of its pants on a mission it has stumbled into largely
by default.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a way out is certain to hijack the otherwise
meticulously-planned agenda next Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when
President Clinton hosts the heads of state, defense ministers and
foreign ministers from the 19 NATO members and 25 other countries
across Europe and North America for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a NATO failure in
Kosovo would, fairly or not, raise questions in the minds of many
about the relevance, perhaps even the viability, of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO is judged to fail, there will be a lot of
handwringing,'' said European affairs specialist Joseph Lepgold,
associate professor of government at Georgetown University. ``A lot
of people will say that it's worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created on April 4,
1949 _ to counter mounting fears of Soviet expansion in Europe _
with the signing in Washington of the treaty forging a formal
military alliance among the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and nine other Western European powers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the alliance was actually poured by British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in August 1941, four months before the United States
entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for four days aboard U.S. and British warships anchored
off the coast of Newfoundland, the two leaders signed the
eight-point Atlantic Charter. Essentially a call for respect for
democratically-elected governments, sovereign borders,
international law, human rights, global cooperation and free trade,
the charter became the cornerstone for the U.S. and British
alliance against Nazi Germany and Japan and, later, formed the
basis for the charter establishing the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, in other words, is a security alliance that has its roots
in a set of common ideals. If the heart of NATO is embodied in
Article 5 of the treaty -- obligating each member to go to war to
defend any other member against armed attack -- the soul of the
alliance has always been something more, a set of core principals
that have helped knit together a peaceful and cooperative Europe
and have become the yardstick for measuring social and political
progress around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not only celebrating the history of the world's
strongest military alliance,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright explained in a recent speech, ``but the history of an
alliance that has belief in the right values.''
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the dissolution of
the Soviet Union two years later, those values swept across the old
Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe in one democratic
revolution after another, as Communist dictatorships tumbled like
dominos from Poland to Hungary, from Romania to the Czech Republic
and even to Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one troubling holdout. His name is Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swimming against the tide of history,'' said Robert
Soofer, professor of national security policy at the National War
College in Washington. ``The big question is whether it warrants
spending lives and treasure in order to solve, or should you just
isolate the problem and hope it goes away eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years leading Serb nationalist movements the United
States blames for starting wars in the former Yugoslav republics of
Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Milosevic has yet to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Having backed efforts that resulted in the deaths
of more than 200,000 civilians in Bosnia -- and more than 10 times
that number left homeless -- Milosevic has extended his campaign of
repression into the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. There, Serb troops
and police under Milosevic's command have killed at least 3,000
ethnic Albanians and forced up to 1.4 million more to flee their
homes, thousands of which were then destroyed, according to NATO
officials.
</P>
<P>
   It took three and a half years for the Bush and Clinton
administrations to figure out that neither Europe nor the United
Nations, nor the two of them together, could bring peace to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting ended only after NATO air strikes -- in the first
combat mission in the alliance's history -- combined with Croat and
Bosnian-Muslim troops on the ground to force Milosevic to the peace
table at Dayton, Ohio in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, it has been NATO peacekeepers that
have held the fragile peace together in Bosnia, and no one is under
any illusions about how quickly tensions would reignite there
should those troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bosnia debacle, Clinton decided that there was no real
alternative to NATO force to counter Serb atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a taste of divided labor in the early years of this
decade in Bosnia,'' said Albright. ``We will not go down that road
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO mission, though, has come at a price. NATO's governing
body, the North Atlantic Council (NAC), makes decisions based on
unanimous consent among all 19 alliance members. A simple majority
vote isn't good enough, because security matters are sovereign
issues for each member state. Everybody agrees, or nothing gets
done.
</P>
<P>
   Holding together NATO consensus on the subject of the Kosovo
campaign hasn't been easy. Greece has historical and cultural ties
to Yugoslavia. Italy has been concerned that air strikes could
destabilize the region. Even France has internal political problems
associated with dealing severely with Milosevic and his Serb
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the essential NAC cohesion has required a carefully
tailored and gradually escalating air war waged in the hope -- and
that's the word for it -- of coercing Milosevic to make a political
decision. NATO's terms are that he pull his troops out of Kosovo,
permit autonomy for the majority ethnic Albanians there, allow a
NATO-led peacekeeping force into Kosovo and guarantee safe passage
for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus of calibrated incrementalism hasn't produced the
desired effect in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic ordered his troops on a blitzkrieg across the tiny
province -- as Clinton cautioned from the outset that he might --
and the result has been the very humanitarian nightmare the
president had hoped to avert through air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the air raids began, NATO has more than
doubled the warplanes devoted to the campaign. The number stood at
roughly 800 by week's end, half of which are American.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the strikes became intensive enough to begin
challenging Yugoslav forces on the ground, those troops had
accomplished much of the mission of terror assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO consensus in this case has been far behind the curve,
and, we hope, not fatal,'' said David Acheson, president of the
Atlantic Council of the United States, a non-partisan foreign
affairs think tank.
</P>
<P>
   After decades spent training to fight an all-out war against
Soviet might, moreover, NATO has defined its post Cold War role
largely as one of deterrence and peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where NATO failed, in my view, to keep pace with the changes
in the security environment was in not recognizing that it might
have to take forces into warfare, into high-intensity conflict,''
said Gompert, who handled European affairs on the National Security
Council in the Bush administration. ``There has been insufficient
planning and preparation on an alliance capability to be able to
fight actual wars -- shooting wars -- and all of the old planning
is of very little value because it was against an entirely
different requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly as far as Kosovo's concerned, there's been no pretense
of NATO support for putting troops on the ground to fight the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Historians may differ over how much NATO's campaign has amounted
to war by consensus, and to what extent, if any, that has hampered
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts, however, have been clear from the start on
the more fundamental point: smart bombs and cruise missiles offer
no assured defense against small groups of marauding paramilitary
thugs killing people with rifles, tossing hand grenades into homes
and setting fire to villages.

   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to host his
counterparts in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization here next
weekend, marking the 50th anniversary of the security structure

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many had been warning NATO, that by admitting
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that the West risked being
dragged into the Eastern European melting pot of ethnic atrocities
and centuries-long quarrels.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody told the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians that we would
be at war just weeks after joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   What makes matters worse, is that our enemy seems not to be some
dictator in the Middle East, but a former ally and president of the
country formerly considered the only Communist bloc member with at
least some level of prosperity established. Poles and Yugoslavians
have a similar history, and are connected by friendships and
families. Even our respective national anthems sound similar.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Poles are afraid of fighting for a right cause. We
have been fighting wars for the last few hundred years -- first for
freedom of our own homeland, then for someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   An old Polish saying goes: ``For our freedom and yours.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Poles do not believe that NATO is fighting in
Kosovo for a right cause. It's just that we did not expect that we
would be called upon to fight for the Alliance so quickly. The
primary basis for the NATO enlargement process was about the
Alliance fighting for us.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish campaign to join NATO was the most brilliant
diplomatic action myself and my colleagues in the Polish press have
covered in Poland's post-Communist period.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the amazing solidarity among differing Polish
political forces -- from liberal to conservative -- and unwavering
support of Polish public opinion for NATO membership, a succession
of Polish presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers were
able to push hard for crucial United States support for NATO
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was so intense, that two years ago a high-ranking
NATO official told me jokingly, ``I can't stand you, Poles, anymore
coming to my office to talk about enlargement -- if it was up to me
you would be already in NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   But what even the supporters of the enlargement in Washington
could not understand for a long time, was that NATO membership was
much more than just another foreign policy issue in Poland. Because
we had to fight too many wars to defend ourselves, we do understand
what the feeling of security means.
</P>
<P>
   After 50 years of being under the control of others -- most
notably the Soviet Union -- we had at last the chance to choose,
independently, our allies and our friends. That was not about
foreign policy or national interest, that was about our future as a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   I started covering NATO enlargement while on assignment from my
newspaper in Moscow in 1992. Back then, just months after the death
of the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union, only a few people in Warsaw
would openly discuss NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration -- I was told by then-National Security
Advisor Brent Scowcroft -- did not discuss it even in theory.
</P>
<P>
   Then, President Bush lost the November election to the young
governor of Arkansas, who -- in the opinion of many Central
Europeans -- did not care much about foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO enlargement looked bad, very bad.
</P>
<P>
   But a complicated play of diplomacy and lobbying by the
Polish-American community a few years ago, helped the Clinton
administration to change its position, or rather lack of interest,
about NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, President Clinton publicly promised NATO would enlarge
by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans didn't appear to be very interested in the
issue, public debate was still very intense. Many things said by
opponents of enlargement were simply not true. I can't tell how
many times while covering NATO enlargement-related events in
Washington, that I was confronted by a surprising amount of false
information being spread.
</P>
<P>
   As usual in the United States, after the fierce debate in the
Congress, the right cause prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   I will remember the night of April 30, 1998, for the rest of my
life. Exactly at 10.27 p.m. (EST) the U.S. Senate voted to ratify
NATO enlargement by large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Polish Ambassador Jerzy Kozminski, who was the chief mastermind
behind the Polish diplomatic campaign, was in the diplomatic
gallery. I swear I saw tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I told to my Polish colleague: ``Hey, look, I think the
ambassador is crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look better at yourself,'' he said to me.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For four decades, NATO stood sentry at Europe's
eastern doorstep, poised to unleash massive tanks, intercontinental
bombers and, if need be, nuclear warheads to thwart the military
threat of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Deterrence worked. The Soviet Union collapsed and NATO won,
without firing a shot, the only war it ever planned to fight.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as the largest summit of world leaders ever assembled
here gathers next weekend to mark NATO's 50th anniversary, that win
has been eclipsed. Suddenly NATO is being tested by a symptom of
its own success.
</P>
<P>
   It was the victory of NATO-allied Western capitalist democracies
over Soviet-bloc communism, after all, that set the stage for
Yugoslavia to explode. It's been left for NATO to pick up the
pieces, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo, the seat of a campaign of
atrocities that triggered the largest combat mission in NATO's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now confronting here, I think, the last battle for the
soul of Europe,'' said former U.S. diplomat David Gompert, director
of the National Defense Research Institute at the Rand Corp., a
non-profit research and policy group. ``It's a battle that needs to
be won.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, though, was never designed to fight the sort of battle
being waged in Kosovo. Since March 24, the alliance has been flying
by the seat of its pants on a mission it has stumbled into largely
by default.
</P>
<P>
   The search for a way out is certain to hijack the otherwise
meticulously-planned agenda next Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when
President Clinton hosts the heads of state, defense ministers and
foreign ministers from the 19 NATO members and 25 other countries
across Europe and North America for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a NATO failure in
Kosovo would, fairly or not, raise questions in the minds of many
about the relevance, perhaps even the viability, of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO is judged to fail, there will be a lot of
handwringing,'' said European affairs specialist Joseph Lepgold,
associate professor of government at Georgetown University. ``A lot
of people will say that it's worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created on April 4,
1949 _ to counter mounting fears of Soviet expansion in Europe _
with the signing in Washington of the treaty forging a formal
military alliance among the United States, Canada, the United
Kingdom and nine other Western European powers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation for the alliance was actually poured by British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt in August 1941, four months before the United States
entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for four days aboard U.S. and British warships anchored
off the coast of Newfoundland, the two leaders signed the
eight-point Atlantic Charter. Essentially a call for respect for
democratically-elected governments, sovereign borders,
international law, human rights, global cooperation and free trade,
the charter became the cornerstone for the U.S. and British
alliance against Nazi Germany and Japan and, later, formed the
basis for the charter establishing the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, in other words, is a security alliance that has its roots
in a set of common ideals. If the heart of NATO is embodied in
Article 5 of the treaty -- obligating each member to go to war to
defend any other member against armed attack -- the soul of the
alliance has always been something more, a set of core principals
that have helped knit together a peaceful and cooperative Europe
and have become the yardstick for measuring social and political
progress around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not only celebrating the history of the world's
strongest military alliance,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright explained in a recent speech, ``but the history of an
alliance that has belief in the right values.''
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and the dissolution of
the Soviet Union two years later, those values swept across the old
Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe in one democratic
revolution after another, as Communist dictatorships tumbled like
dominos from Poland to Hungary, from Romania to the Czech Republic
and even to Russia itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one troubling holdout. His name is Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swimming against the tide of history,'' said Robert
Soofer, professor of national security policy at the National War
College in Washington. ``The big question is whether it warrants
spending lives and treasure in order to solve, or should you just
isolate the problem and hope it goes away eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years leading Serb nationalist movements the United
States blames for starting wars in the former Yugoslav republics of
Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Milosevic has yet to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Having backed efforts that resulted in the deaths
of more than 200,000 civilians in Bosnia -- and more than 10 times
that number left homeless -- Milosevic has extended his campaign of
repression into the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. There, Serb troops
and police under Milosevic's command have killed at least 3,000
ethnic Albanians and forced up to 1.4 million more to flee their
homes, thousands of which were then destroyed, according to NATO
officials.
</P>
<P>
   It took three and a half years for the Bush and Clinton
administrations to figure out that neither Europe nor the United
Nations, nor the two of them together, could bring peace to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting ended only after NATO air strikes -- in the first
combat mission in the alliance's history -- combined with Croat and
Bosnian-Muslim troops on the ground to force Milosevic to the peace
table at Dayton, Ohio in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, it has been NATO peacekeepers that
have held the fragile peace together in Bosnia, and no one is under
any illusions about how quickly tensions would reignite there
should those troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bosnia debacle, Clinton decided that there was no real
alternative to NATO force to counter Serb atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a taste of divided labor in the early years of this
decade in Bosnia,'' said Albright. ``We will not go down that road
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO mission, though, has come at a price. NATO's governing
body, the North Atlantic Council (NAC), makes decisions based on
unanimous consent among all 19 alliance members. A simple majority
vote isn't good enough, because security matters are sovereign
issues for each member state. Everybody agrees, or nothing gets
done.
</P>
<P>
   Holding together NATO consensus on the subject of the Kosovo
campaign hasn't been easy. Greece has historical and cultural ties
to Yugoslavia. Italy has been concerned that air strikes could
destabilize the region. Even France has internal political problems
associated with dealing severely with Milosevic and his Serb
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the essential NAC cohesion has required a carefully
tailored and gradually escalating air war waged in the hope -- and
that's the word for it -- of coercing Milosevic to make a political
decision. NATO's terms are that he pull his troops out of Kosovo,
permit autonomy for the majority ethnic Albanians there, allow a
NATO-led peacekeeping force into Kosovo and guarantee safe passage
for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus of calibrated incrementalism hasn't produced the
desired effect in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic ordered his troops on a blitzkrieg across the tiny
province -- as Clinton cautioned from the outset that he might --
and the result has been the very humanitarian nightmare the
president had hoped to avert through air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the air raids began, NATO has more than
doubled the warplanes devoted to the campaign. The number stood at
roughly 800 by week's end, half of which are American.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the strikes became intensive enough to begin
challenging Yugoslav forces on the ground, those troops had
accomplished much of the mission of terror assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO consensus in this case has been far behind the curve,
and, we hope, not fatal,'' said David Acheson, president of the
Atlantic Council of the United States, a non-partisan foreign
affairs think tank.
</P>
<P>
   After decades spent training to fight an all-out war against
Soviet might, moreover, NATO has defined its post Cold War role
largely as one of deterrence and peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where NATO failed, in my view, to keep pace with the changes
in the security environment was in not recognizing that it might
have to take forces into warfare, into high-intensity conflict,''
said Gompert, who handled European affairs on the National Security
Council in the Bush administration. ``There has been insufficient
planning and preparation on an alliance capability to be able to
fight actual wars -- shooting wars -- and all of the old planning
is of very little value because it was against an entirely
different requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly as far as Kosovo's concerned, there's been no pretense
of NATO support for putting troops on the ground to fight the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Historians may differ over how much NATO's campaign has amounted
to war by consensus, and to what extent, if any, that has hampered
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts, however, have been clear from the start on
the more fundamental point: smart bombs and cruise missiles offer
no assured defense against small groups of marauding paramilitary
thugs killing people with rifles, tossing hand grenades into homes
and setting fire to villages.

&HT;        THREE ALBANIAN REFUGEES TELL SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE HARROWING
TALES OF LIFE, DEATH AND SURVIVIAL IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By C.J. Karamargin  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 14 - Vjosa Dobruna is a human rights activist
and an ethnic Albanian. Until about two weeks ago, she lived in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That's when when her name appeared on a Serbian hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Dobruna was beaten and robbed and, along with hundreds of
thousands of others, ultimately forced out of Kosovo by Serbian
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   But by her own admission, she was one of the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Kelmendi was also on the list. He too was a human rights
activist and an ethnic Albanian who until about two weeks ago lived
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Serbian forces took Kelmendi and his two sons into
custody. According to Dobruna, they were shot repeatedly in the
head and their bodies were left by the side of a road near a gas
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions inside Kosovo are completely desperate and full of
terror,'' Dobruna said Wednesday in emotional testimony before the
Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summary executions, mass killings, the forced expulsion of
civilians from their homes - these continue everyday throughout
Kosovo.'' Dobruna was one of three ethnic Albanians from Kosovo to
recount their experiences to the subcommittee, which is examining
the monumental refugee problem now unfolding in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee chairman Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., said the hearing
was intended to dispell any doubts about ``the extent of the
atrocities being committed in Kosovo.'' He called the refugee
crisis ``a tragedy that constitutes the single largest humanitarian
disaster in Europe since the end of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dobruna, a physician and who operated a women's and
children's clinic in the Kosovo capital of Pristina, objected to
being called a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deportees,'' she calmly told the committee. ``We have
been forced from our homes. We did not choose this. We did not run,
even though conditions were very bad. We stayed until we were
forced out.'' Aferdita Kelmendi, the director of a Kosovo
radio-television station (not related to Bajram Kelmendi), made the
same point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a refugee,'' she said, struggling to hold back tears.
``I did not leave Kosovo by choice. I was forced to leave and my
family was forced to leave. I am not running from a civil war. I am
a deportee. I was forced to leave by men with black caps and guns
who came specifically to make me leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi told the committee how she and six others spent three
days huddled in a car at the Macedonian border. With no food and
little water, they waited until it was safe to cross into a muddy
field.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi thanked NATO for the bombing campaign, saying ``only
when we hear the bombs dropping do we know they will not come for
us.'' But, she added, ``bombs cannot make it safe for me and my
family to return to our homes. We must have protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dobruna's case, she said she was forced to spend 56 hours at
the Macedonian border hiding under a sheet in the backseat of a car
packed with six other adults and two children, before being allowed
to cross to a camp located in ``an enormous muddy pit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no proper medical care, and international aid
organizations were not permitted access to the camp by the
Macedonian police,'' Dobruna said. ``I was personally kept from
providing immediate aid to a 17-day-old infant suffering from
dehydration. The baby died.'' ``Humanitarian aid for the camps is
badly needed,'' she said, ``but does the world expect to care for
these people forever in border camps? Clearly, the only solution is
for them to return to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Nimani, a 26-year-old lawyer involved in human rights
issues in Kosovo, told the subcommittee how he hid in Belgrade, the
Serbian capital, for three days before he fled to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question from Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Ma.,
Nimani said he believes there is ``more than enough'' evidence to
indict Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for population,
refugees, and migration, told the subcommittee that nearly 700,000
Kosovar Albanians have been expelled from the southern Yugoslavian
province over the past year. An equal number remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Housing refugees at the American military facility in
Guantanamo, Cuba is a ``last resort,'' Taft said. The United States
is focusing its efforts on finding temporary shelter for the
Kosovars in Europe and the Middle East.

A JEW WHO SURVIVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They were nice to my father the second time he went to
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   It was in September 1997, during a trip he'd always insisted he
wouldn't take. He never wanted to go back to his native
Czechoslovakia, he'd said; never wanted to revisit Auschwitz, where
his parents, his brothers, and his two younger sisters were
murdered by the Germans in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years the hard line softened. He began to talk
about showing us the world he had come from. So here he was, back
at Auschwitz, arriving not in a sealed boxcar but in a rented van
with a driver, accompanied not by his father and mother and
hundreds of dazed and famished Jews but by his wife, three of his
children, and a guide.
</P>
<P>
   We entered the main administration building, where we hoped to
find some documentation of my father's entry into Auschwitz. But
Krysztof Antonczyk, head of the computer unit, had bad news _ his
staff hadn't been able to locate any records for Markus Jakubovic,
as my father was called in 1944. Disappointing. Suddenly we
remembered something. Immediately after the ``selection'' at the
train platform in Auschwitz, those who were not sent to the gas
chambers _ the lucky ones, the ones who were merely going to be
starved and enslaved _ were registered and tattooed with a number.
And on an impulse, my father at that moment gave a last name that
wasn't his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try looking up his number,'' we said to Antonczyk.
``A-10502.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon my father, to make sure we'd gotten it right, rolled
up his sleeve, put on his glasses, and peered at the number in his
familiar farsighted way. ``Mmm _ yeah _ A-1-0-5-0-2.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he needed to look.
</P>
<P>
   A staff member went to chase down A-10502. We were ushered into
a little room to wait. There was a table and some chairs, a
colorful tablecloth, framed pictures of kittens and puppies on the
wall. A woman poked her head in and asked if we we'd like some tea
or coffee. Sure, my father said, he'd have some coffee, and she
returned with it a few minutes later. And as he sat there, sipping
his coffee in the cheery room with kittens and puppies on the wall,
I got up restlessly, walked over to the window, and peered out.
Below me was the main entrance, and the words over the gate said:
ARBEIT MACHT FREI.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Antonczyk wasn't able to find documentation of my
father's arrival at Auschwitz. But he did turn up evidence of his
departure: a page from one of the long lists of Jews who were
herded out of Auschwitz on death marches in January 1945. Page 630,
Line 21: ``Jakubovic, Markus _ Slovak Jude.'' And something more: a
copy of the card recording my father's entry into Mauthausen, a
concentration camp in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Written evidence. Markus Jakubovic of Legina, Slovakia, had been
in Auschwitz; on a death march; at Mauthausen. There it was, in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years, we had a piece of paper. What we never had,
my siblings and I, was a grandfather and a grandmother. What we
never had were two uncles and two more aunts. What we never had was
a family tree with living branches instead of withered stumps. What
we never had was the cousins who would have been born, the stories
that would have been told, the memories that would have been
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   What we never even had was graves to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1938 and 1945, while the world looked the other way, the
Germans and their collaborators murdered one-third of all the Jews
on earth, 6 million of them. And my father's family _ David and
Leah Jakubovic and their children Franceska, Zoltan, Yrvin, and
Alice _ accounted for 1 one-millionth _ 0.000001 _ of the total.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once I asked my father what had been uppermost in his mind when
he was in the camps. Had there been something he always
concentrated on, a mantra he clung to, a goal he never lost sight
of?
</P>
<P>
   I was hoping, I suppose, for something lapidary. Something like
the exhortation of Simon Dubnov, a renowned Jewish historian, who
was murdered by a Latvian guard in the Riga ghetto in 1941.
Dubnov's last words were, ``Yiddin, schreibt un farschreibt'' _
``Jews, write it all down.'' Perhaps my father would say that he
never stopped thinking about one day bearing witness to what he had
seen. Or that he was always looking for ways to sabotage the Nazis.
Or that he dreamed of revenge. Or that every morning and evening he
whispered the Sh'ma, the Jewish credo _ ``Hear, O Israel, the Lord
is our God, the Lord is One.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what my father told me: ``I was always careful to watch
my shoes. I slept with my shoes under my head, because if you lost
your shoes you wouldn't survive for long.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the answer I had imagined. Shoes? He's in the
middle of the Holocaust, and he's thinking about his shoes?
</P>
<P>
   But my father was right. If shoes were absolutely essential _
and when you are force-marched from Poland to Austria in the middle
of winter and you will be shot dead if you fall or lag, they are _
then shoes were precisely what he had to think about. The Jakubovic
family, awash in blood, was nearly extinct. My father had to
survive. The Jews had to survive. Somehow, despite everything, they
had to go on, and if shoes could keep this Jew alive, then nothing
was more important than shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My father, God willing, will turn 74 this year. He has five
children and _ so far _ 13 grandchildren. He keeps the Sabbath and
fasts on Yom Kippur and eats matzo on Passover. Every morning and
every evening, he says the Sh'ma. He is a Jew who survived, and who
survived as a Jew. May the memory of those who perished be a
blessing.

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ East Asia's current distress over moral
and economic choices is reminiscent of the crisis that gripped
Europe and America about three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Germany and the United States took different paths out
of the Great Depression. Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated
president and promised a New Deal. In Germany, Hitler and the Nazis
became a legitimate force in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There is much for Asians to learn from that chapter of Western
history. The economic crisis that began in July 1997 has brought
about our own Great Depression. And economic troubles have
engendered a political crisis of confidence, pitting ancient
regimes against a generation eager for change as it looks forward
to a truly democratic Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have already chosen their paths. South Korea has
decided to go with President Kim Dae Jung's Rooseveltian reforms.
In Indonesia, an aged dictator has been forced out, and new leaders
will be chosen in the first free elections in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand too is reforming, and its democracy is strengthening.
And President Joseph Estrada confounds his critics as he keeps the
Philippines on track toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it is in Malaysia, once the most stable of Southeast
Asian nations, that a power-crazed prime minister is trying to
block the tide. Mahathir Mohamad, 73, sees himself as the only
person alive who can lead Malaysia out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to his reasoning, there was absolutely nothing wrong
with his policies; things were perfect before ``outside forces'' _
George Soros, Jews, the International Monetary Fund, Washington,
Wall Street _ jealous of Asian success and hungry for new colonies,
came and spoiled it all. And those who disagreed and called for
reform were denounced as traitors and lackeys of Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   I became dangerous because as finance minister I would not do
Mahathir's ``business as usual'' and as a politician I had
widespread support for my work toward democracy and civil society.
So I was accused of sex crimes, treason and corruption and expelled
from government and party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scorning me, as they were meant to, many Malaysians
were outraged and began to see in Mahathir a has-been leader who
had descended to cruelty in a desperate bid to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on Sept. 20, 1998, Mahathir ordered me arrested.
That night, blindfolded and handcuffed, I suffered Gestapo-style
violence at the hands of the inspector general of police, who aimed
his punches and karate chops at lethal areas. I was then abandoned
for nearly a week, part of it in a dungeon, without medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after I appeared in public with my wounds, which
Mahathir said could have been self-inflicted, the inspector general
confessed to his crime. That this criminal still walks free, while
I am jailed for ``abuse of office,'' shows just how far Mahathir
has taken Malaysia down the abyss of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Our judiciary was once among the most independent in the
developing world, but the farce that was my trial and the
persecution of the opposition lawmaker Lim Guan Eng, among other
cases, have confirmed suspicions that it has since become a mere
adjunct of the executive arm of the government.
</P>
<P>
   I had to be demolished so that Mahathir's slide from power could
be stopped. Falsely accusing me of sex crimes alone might not have
worked, so he threw in ``puppet of Washington'' and ``CIA agent.''
The American defense secretary, William Cohen, unwittingly inspired
this spy fiction by greeting me with a 19-gun salute when I went to
Washington in the spring of 1998. The event is cited as proof that
I am an American mole.
</P>
<P>
   Given Malaysia's political culture, it was just a matter of time
before ambitious politicians jumped onto the bandwagon of
xenophobia. But so far nothing has matched the bizarre claims of
two Cabinet members that the United States or some other foreign
power waged biological warfare by introducing into Malaysia a
deadly virus that is wreaking havoc in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such insults to the public's intelligence are a major reason for
the increasing popularity of the ``reformasi'' movement, which
emerged spontaneously upon my sacking and recently gave birth to a
multiracial political organization that my wife heads.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the new party, in cooperation with other
opposition groups, will help pull Malaysia out of the morass and
pave the way toward civil society.

two Cabinet members that the United States or some other foreign
power waged biological warfare by introducing into Malaysia a
deadly virus that is wreaking havoc in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such insults to the public's intelligence are a major reason for
the increasing popularity of the ``reformasi'' movement, which
emerged spontaneously upon my sacking and recently gave birth to a
multiracial political organization that my wife heads.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the new party, in cooperation with other
opposition groups, will help pull Malaysia out of the morass and
pave the way toward civil society.

 &HT;    Graduates from nontraditional high schools face stricter
admissions criteria
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gabriel Perez and Melissa Mason had high school
diplomas when they applied to college, but the University of Texas
still asked them to take extra tests before offering them
admission.
</P>
<P>
   The two students were home-schooled and experts say many more
like them are beginning to show up at the nation's campuses. Over
the next decade, as many as one million home-schooled students
could be knocking on the doors of four-year colleges and
universities, said Sean Callaway, director of college placement at
the Center for Urban Education at Pace University in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of applicant pool begins to have an impact,''
Callaway said.
</P>
<P>
   For many home-schooled students, getting into college can
require more than a high school transcript and letters of
recommendation. Some college admissions representatives _ skeptical
of the quality of education given to a student by Mom or Dad who is
also Teacher and Counselor _ place more emphasis on standardized
test scores. Admissions officers also are likely to interview
home-schooled students and often require those students to take
extra achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
   UT requires home-schooled students to take three SAT2 tests,
achievement tests in subjects such as math or science that many
students use to place out of college classes. Perez, like other
home-schooled students, earned his high school diploma through
correspondence courses from an unaccredited private school, and did
well enough to earn scholarship worth about $16,000 from UT. Perez
said he didn't like having to take the additional tests. In the
end, he chose Texas A&AMP;M University because he wanted to attend his
father's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, however, agreed to take achievement tests in math,
writing and chemistry and is completing her first year at UT.
</P>
<P>
   Because the home-school movement is a mostly informal network of
parents and their children, an exact number of students involved is
unknown. But advocates estimate that about 30,000 home-schooled
seniors are applying for college admission for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the coming masses, colleges and universities are
beginning to adjust the admissions process for home-schooled
students. Although no Texas schools are currently doing so, some
colleges and universities are developing recruiting programs to
cater to home-school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, they were taking one student every couple of
years. Now there are several each year,'' said Mike Farris,
president of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
</P>
<P>
   John Lind, Southwestern University's vice president of
enrollment management, said the liberal arts college in Georgetown
admitted a record 10 home-schooled students last fall. Other Texas
schools such as St. Edward's University and Texas A&AMP;M also are
steadily admitting home-school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The home-school movement is not solely responsible for the surge
in nontraditional applicants. The drive to find better educational
systems has spawned charter and magnet schools and alternative
schools within traditional high schools.
</P>
<P>
   But many educators say home-schooling raises the most questions
about quality. Charter, magnet and alternative schools, in general,
must pass some sort of accreditation checkpoint. Home-school
programs operate almost entirely on their own. Even the Texas
Education Agency _ which is responsible for accrediting many
schools _ does not keep track of home-school students.
</P>
<P>
   As the home-school movement matures and infuses more students
into higher education, educators have to assess what's going on in
home lessons. For that reason, educators say they have more
stringent requirements for those students. That has prompted debate
over whether home-schooled students must meet a higher set of
standards to get admission. ``There could be questions on how
objective the grading process is, on what does a grade mean for the
`only' student in school,'' said Gary Engelgau, executive director
of admissions and records at Texas A&AMP;M. ``On what basis do you set
those students up for comparison?''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, president of the Texas Home School Coalition in
Lubbock, said higher standards for home-schooled students are
unfair. Lambert said UT requires home-schooled students and others
with nontraditional educations to make at least an 1180 on the
Scholastic Assessment Test or a 26 on the American College Test.
Most traditionally educated students are not required to meet a
minimum score at UT. ``If you have an SAT or ACT score for
admission, you ought to have one standard,'' he said. ``We don't
have a problem with standards. We don't support double standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Walker, UT's director of admissions, said the SAT score
requirement for home-schooled students is being reviewed and that
``once it goes through the review process, it's fair to say that we
will no longer have a minimum score.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that UT will continue to require home-schooled students
to take the SAT2 tests ``to know the quality of what's going on
around the kitchen table.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of home-school advocates, state Rep. Phil King
(R-Weatherford) has filed legislation that would require colleges
and universities to hold all students to the same admission
standards. The bill has yet to have a committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pursuing legislative change, home-school
supporters are compiling records of current admissions policies.
Educators also want to know how home-schooled students fare in a
college environment. But Walker said concerns that home-schooled
students may lack social skills have largely proven to be
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, a 17-year-old UT student with a 4.0 grade point average,
has pursued a variety of interests from working at the Daily Texan
student newspaper to joining the advisory council at Littlefield
dormitory, where she lives. She said attending classes at the
nation's largest public university has not scared her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having not grown up in a traditional `cliquey'
atmosphere like regular high schools made it easier for me to be on
the outside,'' she said. ``I don't feel some of the pressures to be
like everyone else or dress like everyone else.''

 &HT;    Long arm of the lawmaker
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He's the highest-ranking Democrat in Texas, a
man with far-reaching powers who could kill Republican bills and
derail Gov. George W. Bush's legislative agenda in a year when the
whole country is watching how the GOP's presidential front-runner
fares in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Pete'' Laney says being speaker of the Texas House is
his dream job. But the 55-year-old cotton farmer from tiny Hale
Center, who has been speaker since 1993, isn't exactly puffed up by
his status as the last-standing Texas Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't buy you a cup of coffee unless you put a dollar with
it,'' Laney joked.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, who became the state's top Democrat when Republicans
swept all the major statewide offices last fall, is a big believer
in the Texas Legislature's nonpartisan tradition. To the
consternation of some Washington, D.C., Democrats, the speaker
won't kill Bush initiatives just to dim the governor's presidential
hopes. And unlike many of his predecessors, Laney rarely uses his
substantial powers to promote or block individual bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney does have strong views on some prominent issues _ he
vehemently opposes school vouchers, for example _ and he's shown
that his deft touch on the levers of power can be just as effective
as strong-arm tactics. With the fiery former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock
gone, Laney may be poised to play a more active role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laney has always been one who has let things evolve. He's an
old, shrewd cotton farmer, and they kind of let things grow and
then decide when it's time to take in the harvest,'' said Rep. Kim
Brimer (R-Arlington). ``He has been more vocal, and he has to be,
because he's got to lead when there's no one else who's out there
trying to set an agenda like Bullock did.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kenny Marchant (R-Coppell) sees Laney's delicate hand
behind the progress of a bill that would require parental
notification before minors get abortions, and said the speaker
worked with House budget writers to ensure that the budget approved
Tuesday set aside $3 billion for tax cuts and for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has, through his staff, brought some of these
things along faster than they've been brought along in previous
sessions,'' said Marchant, who heads the House Republican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Position of power
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Laney has tremendous influence over the day-to-day
workings of the House _ and the fate of individual bills.
</P>
<P>
   He can send bills to committees that will give them a favorable
hearing _ or to panels where they are likely to linger and die. He
can deny members the right to speak on the floor, so he can prevent
them from offering certain amendments or expressing unwanted views.
And when the House and Senate pass different versions of bills, he
assigns the representatives who will meet with senators to hammer
out a final version.
</P>
<P>
   But Laney says he doesn't believe in imposing his views on the
House. At a meeting of the State Preservation Board on Tuesday
morning, he refused to sign off on an official lapel pin for House
members without first consulting his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone is able to persuade a majority of the members that
something is good or something is bad, I think it ought to go that
way,'' Laney said. ``I think you've got to let the system work.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Laney has enacted reforms that make it more difficult
for a speaker to exert his will _ at least secretly. The House
Calendars Committee, which schedules bills for floor debate _ or
doesn't, effectively killing them _ now deliberates openly.
Lawmakers are no longer forced to vote on bills or amendments
before they have a chance to read them, and there are fewer
late-night decisions after marathon floor sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans say Laney rarely acts directly to kill a
bill or push it through the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been my experience that he's that hands-on on
particular bills,'' said Marchant. ``It's always been my experience
that he gives the committee chairman the right and the ability to
report out the bills the committee chairman wants to report out.''
Marchant says Bush's presidential run and Laney's new role as the
state's highest-ranking Democrat haven't changed the speaker's
nonpartisan ways, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm monitoring the Republican bills in Calendars and the
Republican bills out of committee, and we're getting our fair share
of bills right now out of committee and on the floor,'' Marchant
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that it continues, and if it doesn't, he and I will
talk about it. But so far I don't see any bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Craddick (R-Midland), who led the Republicans'
unsuccessful effort to take control of the House, had a similar
take on Laney's actions during the current session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him participating in the bill activity any more
than ever before, and I really don't anticipate he'll do that,''
Craddick said. ``I don't see him either trying to get bills passed
or kill bills on a partisan vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming test
</P>
<P>
   Craddick cautioned, however, that the real test will be in the
coming weeks as the House debates major education and tax
legislation. The Senate has been cranking out bills _ 481 as of
Wednesday _ but the House has approved only 202, most of them minor
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, both Craddick and Marchant are all-too-familiar
with Laney's subtle power. Two years ago, the speaker helped Bush
fulfill his goal of cutting school property taxes by creating a
special school finance committee that did an end-run around a
skeptical Craddick, who was then chair of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee. Laney replaced Craddick as chairman after
the Midland Republican tried a little too hard to unseat the
speaker last November.
</P>
<P>
   Marchant's effort to bring home equity lending to Texas stalled
four years ago, when Laney opposed the bill. Last session, Marchant
pushed the bill through _ but only after he included consumer
safeguards Laney favored.
</P>
<P>
   Laney has a reputation for reticence and doesn't often expound
on his personal views in public. But he broke with that philosophy
last month at a meeting of the Texas Daily Newspaper Association,
when he vehemently expressed his opposition to the use of tax
dollars to pay for private school vouchers. Laney said vouchers
would drain money from the public schools and do particular damage
to school districts in rural areas such as his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with telling people what I think
about an issue and the reasons behind it. But I think the members
know that I represent a district just like they do,'' he said this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But members of both parties note that Laney isn't just any
representative, and that such pronouncements _ though short of
direct involvement _ carry a lot of weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who are opposed to vouchers, you know that
you're standing with the speaker on this issue, and for those who
are somewhat ambivalent on the issue of vouchers, I certainly think
you'll take note of the speaker's position,'' said Rep. Sylvester
Turner (D-Houston). ``And for those who are in favor of vouchers, I
think you will walk very cautiously on the issue.''

 &HT;    Sadler at center of key issues
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the Texas House, the word methodical often is
used to describe Rep. Paul Sadler, a 43-year-old Democrat who, like
Speaker Pete Laney, is at the top of his political game this
session.
</P>
<P>
   For the second session in a row, the soft-spoken lawyer is at
the center of the Legislature's hottest issues. But this time the
stakes, including a potential presidential bid, are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the pressures and exhibiting a steely personality,
Sadler plans on taking his time with the key matters, which will
likely play into Republican presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler is chairman of the House Public Education Committee. In
that job, he has control over five of Republican Gov. George W.
Bush's top priorities: ending social promotion in schools, cutting
local school property taxes, paying teachers more, increasing the
amount Texas pays for public education and enacting a test program
for publicly funded vouchers for private schools. Those are core
proposals in Bush's legislative agenda and issues the governor is
likely to carry into a bid for the Republican presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says having Sadler in charge of those issues in the House _
where they must pass before the governor can declare victory _
doesn't worry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think one governor can dictate a session and I think
Paul would tell you that one person doesn't make the decisions
because he has a committee to deal with and a floor to deal with,''
Bush said last week. ``He's obviously got a lot of influence and I
believe we can work together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Sadler has had major influence over key
Bush proposals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sadler helped craft changes to the way the state
oversees education. That was one of several goals Bush laid out in
his 1994 race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1997, Sadler held court over Bush's proposal to force
local school property taxes down by kicking in $3 billion more in
state education money.
</P>
<P>
   In both years, Sadler took his committee and observers through a
nearly line-by-line review of state law regarding education
funding. In 1997, he also led an exhaustive look at the state's tax
structure. By the time the committee was done, Bush's $3 billion
proposal had been expanded to put $5 billion more into school
funding.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lawmakers approved only $1 billion in local school
property tax cuts. Those went largely unnoticed by homeowners
statewide because of higher property values and tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his history with Sadler gives them a strong foundation
on which to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view Paul not only as a very capable member of the House and
a person of strong convictions,'' the governor said. ``But I view
him as a person with whom I can have good, straightforward talk,
and I think that's an important beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his deputies and Sadler have been doing quite a bit of
talking and have quite a bit of ground to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler has indicated that he's hesitant to bar social promotion
in schools without first making kindergarten a requirement in
Texas. Republicans have said that could be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sadler said he won't support a Republican Senate plan
to increase teachers' take-home pay by requiring the state to take
over their mandatory retirement contributions. Bush has proposed
giving $1 billion to school districts to distribute among teachers,
but adds that he's more concerned about getting more to teachers
than how it's accomplished. Though the session is more than halfway
over _ it ends May 31 _ Sadler says it's really only beginning. His
committee has not started formal work on the bills key to the
governor's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed by Bush, local school property taxes would be cut by
$2 billion over the next two years, the state's school districts
would be given $1 billion for teachers, and the state would add
more than $500 million to the amount it spends on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   House budget leaders, however, have proposed a plan to give
Sadler and his committee authority to divide $3 billion between
teachers, property tax cuts and school funding. That plan is
expected to be before the full House this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House votes to make the determination that 'X' dollars
are available, then we'll start,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Of his position at the center of the debate, Sadler said only,
``If I'm going to come down here, I want to do important stuff.''

 &HT;    An 1836 murder in New York has a Texas connection
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ On April 9, 1836, just two weeks before
Texas gained its independence in the Battle of San Jacinto, a young
prostitute was found dead in her New York City boudoir, her head
bloodied and her body partially burned from a fire that had been
started in her bed.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Helen Jewett and arrest a few days later of her
young lover soon dominated the pages of newspapers not just in New
York, but across the nation. Jewett, from a respected New England
family, had become a highly paid courtesan. Her lover/customer was
a shipping clerk named Richard Robinson, also from a respected
family. Both were in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the story would have a connection to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Patricia Cline Cohen in ``The Murder of Helen Jewett:
The Life and Death of A Prostitute in Nineteenth-Century New York''
has done a remarkable job of ferreting out this long-forgotten
story. With meticulous research she recreates New York City in the
1830s, recounts the couple's tempestuous relationship and what
happened at the trial, and delves into the background of the two
main characters, and, in the case of Robinson, what happened to him
after the trial. It makes for fascinating reading.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen concludes that Robinson indeed did kill Helen Jewett
because she had become too dependent on him. The cloak and hatchet
found at the scene were traced to him. Eyewitnesses put him at the
house of ill repute on the night of Jewett's death. There were no
other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Robinson was acquitted. The verdict spurred outrage from New
York City editorialists and the entire episode helped spawn a
backlash that drove prostitution, then widely tolerated in the
city, largely underground.
</P>
<P>
   But much like O.J. Simpson, Robinson could find little peace
after acquittal, largely for the same reason: Most everyone thought
he was guilty. So, like so many of the state's settlers, he came to
Texas in August, 1836. After a brief stint in the Republic of Texas
Army _ one week to be exact _ he was discharged from the military
and came to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Robinson, still hoping to escape the notoriety of
his past life, changed his name to Richard Parmalee, the surname
being his mother's maiden name. He would live out the rest of his
days under this name, though as years passed his real identity
became known to a select group.
</P>
<P>
   Parmalee by 1837 was running a saloon near downtown Nacogdoches,
and though not proven, it is highly possible that he was the
proprietor of the Old Stone Fort Saloon, a replica of which now
stands on the Stephen F. Austin campus. He bought a farm, joined
the Masons and became a deputy district clerk. One of his closest
friends became Adolphus Sterne, a well-known businessman whose home
here is now a museum. Sterne almost certainly knew Parmalee's real
identity and background, as did Bennett Blake, a prominent judge
and lawyer who signed an affidavit after Parmalee's death that
acknowledged the deceased's real identity.
</P>
<P>
   Nacogdoches historian Lois Foster Blount in the early part of
this century wrote a 12-page pamphlet about Robinson-Parmalee,
entitled ``The Man Who Came Back.'' No doubt the version Blount
recounted originated with Robinson himself, since it's highly
self-serving and portrays the young clerk as unfairly accused and
forced to flee because of the undeserved ostracism after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Parmalee lived a quiet life in Nacogdoches, as Cohen
writes. He married a widow in 1845, built a home on a lot that is
where the courthouse stands now, and inherited a farm southwest of
town from his wife's family, along with more than 20 slaves.
</P>
<P>
   He got in a minor scrape the next year and pleaded guilty to
assault, paying a fine of thirty-three-and-a-third cents.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Parmalee returned East several times, and on one such
trip in 1855 he caught yellow fever and died. An elderly black
woman hired to tend to him as he lay dying said he kept ranting and
raving in his delirium about a woman named Helen Jewett, who she
assumed was his wife.
</P>
<P>
   His death made news, giving newspapers the opportunity to rehash
the case, now nearly 20 years old. It took three months to get his
body back from Louisville, Ky., where he died, and he received a
full Masonic funeral. He is buried in Nacogdoches under his assumed
name. The courthouse has no record of where Richard
Robinson-Parmalee is buried. He could be under the present
courthouse, for all anyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Murder of Helen Jewett'' is available from Knopf
publishers.

Sentinel. His e-mail address is gborders(at)coxnews.com.

 &HT;    There is no end to David Crockett's story
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My idea of good time is arguing with a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Please allow me to explain. Sometime back, my friend Bob
Perkins, the state district judge, and I had a friendly
disagreement about the veracity of Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la
Pena's account of David Crockett's final hours. De la Pena claimed
to witness the surrender and subsequent execution of the legendary
frontier politician and adventurer. The account is contained in a
journal penned in 1838-39, while de la Pena was imprisoned on
political charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Crockett passage is a brief one, but the one that propelled
the book into a spotlight that still follows the gentleman from
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   What got the judge stirred up was a passing comment I made one
evening about how the journal rang true. Turns out the judge,
another history buff, has studied Crockett and doesn't believe the
Crockett he knows would surrender.
</P>
<P>
   So we argued. It was so much fun that a couple of months later,
we argued about it again. And the odds are good that we're going to
have at it yet again _ most likely right after Judge Perkins reads
this.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett had an extraordinary gift for self-promotion, and if he
is in a position to know that he is still making news 163 years
after his death, he is probably beyond tickled by it. He loved
attention.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach San Jacinto Day on April 21, Crockett is a most
appropriate example of a Texas history figure so enshrouded in myth
that it has become impossible to separate the individual from the
legend. He is also a great example of the void that exists in the
study and use of history.
</P>
<P>
   The real Crockett would wince at being called ``Davy'' and used
his gift as a raconteur extraordinaire to both display and mask a
rather broad sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   The Crockett most know, however, was created by Walt Disney and
John Wayne. The powerful images they created are the spark of the
controversy surrounding the de la Pena account of Crockett's death.
</P>
<P>
   It is a controversy that is likely to rage on for some time and
will be revived when Paul Hutton, a historian who is a familiar
face to watchers of the History Channel, finishes his biography of
Crockett to be released next year. Hutton, a professor at the
University of New Mexico, believes the de la Pena diary is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hutton is the bearer of bad news to the keepers of the
traditional Crockett flame. And he will be walking into a lion's
den to deliver it. Hutton is scheduled to speak today (Friday,
4/16) at the Friends of the Texas Tech University Library/Southwest
Collection banquet in Lubbock _ not the best place in Texas to
challenge a legend. But then, there is no good place in Texas for
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biography focuses on the historical authenticity of many
'scholarly' works because many authors have unknowingly combined
historical fact and fiction,'' Hutton wrote. ``As such, future
generations need to know that if the journal is true, as I believe
it is, Crockett was captured and subsequently executed at the
Alamo. That manner of death in no way diminishes Davy Crockett's
sacrifice, though it does contradict the image of Crockett as
popularized by Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hutton laments, Hollywood is where too many
people come by what little knowledge they have of history.
</P>
<P>
   Texans say they revere the Alamo and its gallant defenders, but
whatever they know from whatever source doesn't stick _ at least
according to one study.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the Dallas Morning News sponsored a test on
Texas history. Of those responding, more than a third couldn't name
a single Alamo defender _ not even Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, more than half of the test takers were native
Texans, according to the Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   That should put a dent in our notions of Texas pride and maybe
stir some long-needed action. History is done a disservice by those
who think teaching it means making kids memorize dates. Dates are
important but their meanings are even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the most popular topic of conversation around the
Capitol these days. People get excited about kids learning math and
science, but rarely does anyone talk about history. History
deserves a seat at any discussion about education and the future.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   People who don't know where they've been can't possibly know
where they are going.
</P>
<P>
   OK, judge, I'm ready.

 &HT;    `Hail to the Chief' plays in background of budget dance
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush announced a specific
dollar figure for a tax cut in his State of the State message in
January, some of his Democratic friends in the Legislature winced.
</P>
<P>
   Why, they wondered, would the governor again pin himself to a
number, be it $2.6 billion or something else, when the money
available for extra spending could be considerably different by the
time the final appropriations bill is written? And particularly,
when Texas teacher salaries rank 38th in the nation?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing most legislatures do is redistribute money,
and Texas is no exception. Deciding where it comes from, how much
there is and where it goes is an enormous part of the legislative
process. It reflects the priorities of the state's leaders, and a
huge number of interests try to affect both where the money comes
from and where it goes.
</P>
<P>
   So now, as the Legislature gets down to the crunch time of its
session, the House and Senate spending bills will take center
stage. Education spending _ particularly teacher compensation _
will compete with tax cuts, whether the governor likes it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked last week whether a tax cut or a more hefty teacher
pay increase was more important, replied ``I think we can do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   In the appropriations bill, the House will designate about $3
billion for the House Education Committee to divide among teacher
pay and retirement benefits, social promotion and a potential tax
cut. The amount designated for the Ways and Means Committee to play
with on taxes is $500 million to $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be surprised if the Education Committee, led by Rep. Paul
Sadler (D-Henderson), puts a lot more emphasis on teacher
compensation than a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's a close friend of the governor, Sadler is among the
apparently growing number of lawmakers who thinks it makes
considerably less sense, and is far less important, to cut property
taxes for people who may not notice it than to vote a pay raise for
teachers who will.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler doesn't say so, but more than a few legislators and
onlookers think the governor's insistence on the tax cut is about
the Republican presidential primary more than state fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats in both houses of the Legislature realize the
national spotlight is increasingly trained on Texas because of the
Republican Bush's presidential race. They'll try to take maximum
advantage of that leverage to put state money behind their
contention that Texans and their children will be better served by
spending more on education than by cutting property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor undoubtedly remembers the divisive, hard-fought
battle over his tax cut proposal of two years ago. After House
Speaker Pete Laney and Sadler took Bush's proposal and pushed it
with some extra topspin, the Republican-dominated Senate finally
killed it.
</P>
<P>
   The fight produced an ugly, mean legislative session that
resulted in a $1 billion tax cut that no one noticed _ partly
because it was small, and partly because rising property values
raised taxes anyway. Some legislators won't be too surprised if the
governor backs off his bigger tax cut and takes credit for some
selected sales tax cuts, including items like school clothes.
</P>
<P>
   For purposes of his presidential campaign, that would probably
be preferable to a possible special session that could result if
the battle over a teacher pay raise vs. tax cuts goes on too long.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other issues, even some with considerable lobby
pressure like electric deregulation, may be stacked up until the
chess game ends over the taking and spending of money.
</P>
<P>
   This session, said veteran Sen. Ken Armbrister (D-Victoria),
``there are no major issues other than the budget.''

 &HT;    Remembering the day he _ who? _ signed a boy's ball cap
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Is Willie Mays dead?''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old in our house was asking it. The answer is no.
Willie is very much with us, and forever we should hope.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed as to why he asked, he revealed it to be a matter of
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much is your Willie Mays autograph worth?''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago Mays signed a poster of mine featuring a
drawing of Candlestick Park. He was jabbering with Leo Durocher in
the Arlington Sheraton when he signed it. It's the only autograph I
ever wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it worth $75?'' asked my son.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, it's worth more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he's not dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, spring, when a young boy's fancy turns to investment margins
in sports collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why this subject came up, necessarily. Robert is no
autograph hound. He has trading cards and such, but not much more.
</P>
<P>
   That is, except his autographed Colorado Rockies cap. He wore it
to a game two summer ago: Rockies vs. Braves. He hung out near the
dugout with all the other kids and, miracle of miracles, one of the
Rockies signed his cap.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem: From the autograph we couldn't tell which of
the Rockies it was.
</P>
<P>
   The player had a warmup jacket on. His number was obscured. His
scrawl was no help.
</P>
<P>
   We pored over the game program to piece the puzzle together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starts with a J, I think. Or an I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake? Jeffrey? Ike?''
</P>
<P>
   We were already into the bottom half of the first and nearly out
of roster when we solved the puzzle: Jerry Dipoto. ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   I know my baseball, but I knew nothing about Jerry Dipoto. He's
a pitcher, said the program.
</P>
<P>
   But he's a special pitcher. He signed my kid's ball cap. And not
only that.. .
</P>
<P>
   ``What you think my cap's worth?'' Robert asked.
</P>
<P>
   I said I wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you touch Willie Mays when he signed your autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't think so. Willie was too busy lipping with Leo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Dipoto gave me a high five,'' Robert said, re-enacting.
</P>
<P>
   The implied question, as I read it, was whether an actual
hand-to-hand touch from a major leaguer, however obscure, made a
collector's item more collectable.
</P>
<P>
   At first I dismissed this. Then I thought about it for a while,
about who had touched Jerry Dipoto.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the Rockies have a first-base coach, Clint Hurdle, who
used to be a can't-miss outfielder who missed with the Kansas City
Royals. He's touched Jerry Dipoto. And when Hurdle was with the
Royals he played alongside, and no doubt touched, Darrell Porter, a
not-too-prominent catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Porter also played for the St. Louis Cardinals, who at
the time had a flash-in-the-pan outfielder named David Green. I bet
they touched. And it's likely Green high-fived little-known Jose
Uribe once or twice when both were on the San Francisco Giants for
a short time.
</P>
<P>
   And Uribe succeeded a no-hit, can-field shortstop named Johnnie
LeMaster. I bet they shook hands at least once. And LeMaster took
that position from Chris Speier. Unless you're hard-core baseball,
you've not heard of Chis Speier. But he lined up on the field with
the Giants and a guy named Willie Mays. This means in virtual
certainty that they shook hands, slapped backs or dragged cleats
through the same dugout spittle.
</P>
<P>
   Which, my son, makes that cap _ and a hand touched by Jerry
Dipoto, pretty darn valuable. Don't you ever wash it.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Classroom clairvoyance
 &HT;    For release April 18, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not with just mild interest when I note that the high
school art teacher for Kurt Cobain retained some of his paintings
and sketches. Cobain, of course, is the rocker who became
near-deified after his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the teacher have the foresight to know that Cobain
would turn into a cult personality (rockers who either commit
suicide or die from drug overdoses have that effect on young
people) but he also thought he could fetch a pretty good buck for
the stuff through a Christie's auction.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of dollars expected in the bidding, Cobain's
family stepped in and caused the teacher to relent and offer the
material to the family. The story that alerted me to this did not
say if the family was going to pay the old high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Time Magazine ran two of Cobain's sketches, and they were pretty
good. But one has to wonder about the teacher. How was he able to
detect, while Cobain still was a high school student, that Kurt was
going to become famous as a rock star and take his life at an early
age _ the only reason the paintings have any value?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he have saved the work? Does he save the work of
all his students, or just his better students? How big a warehouse
does he have for former students' work? Cobain's teacher was so
impressed with him as an artist that he apparently also held on to
his notes to Cobain, including his gradings: ``Kurt, your
caricatures are outstanding. 10/10, A.''
</P>
<P>
   This opens an entirely new field: Teachers stashing the work of
students they think will do more than just make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   What if Ernest Hemingway's high school English teacher came
forth with the original manuscripts of young Ernest that led to his
first two publications in the school annual? How much would they
have fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Germany, perhaps there was a high school teacher
who passed on to his family scraps of paper of one of his brighter
students containing myriad doodles: E &QC; ma, E &QC; cam, E &QC; MCI . . .
</P>
<P>
   Would some high school teacher in Arkansas have in his or her
hands a randy note taken from a future president as he tried to
pass it across the aisle to a pretty girl? How much for that? Ask
Paula.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a long-secretly-held practice of the teaching profession
just now coming to light? Are beginning teachers being trained to
spot potential celebrities and to squirrel away their class work
until such time it can command big dollars and, thus, supplement
their pathetically paltry salaries?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Miss Sugar ever took notice of my potential? Miss
Sugar was my junior high school geography teacher. It was in her
classroom that I carved around the desk opening in which the ink
bottle was placed: ``Jump In Here!''
</P>
<P>
   It got me into the principal's office, then back to the desk
with sandpaper and varnish, but do you think Miss Sugar ever
thought I would amount to anything other than a wood carver? Had
she known that I actually would graduate high school and be able to
locate China on a map and to be able to spell Chechnya in a
widely-distributed newspaper column, do you think she might have
taken the desk home for future financial consideration?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not; I wasn't successful enough, didn't commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a world of collectibles for big dollars:
baseball cards, stuffed dolls and, now, even old school projects.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, billions of collectibles are freshly created in Mainland
China assembly lines just to succor our craving for them. And when
an original comes along, a sketch by a dead rocker no less, you can
well understand why the perceptive teacher placed a call to
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to today's students: Make all your teachers sign release
forms saying they are not squirreling away your work for future
sale or, failing that, get a clause in there giving you or your
successors a piece of the action.

 &HT;    Rhyme renaissance under way
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not so long ago, poetry seemed headed for oblivion,
doomed to be published in slim volumes by university presses and
recited in intimate groups on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Now things have gone from bad to verse.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry readings are regular events at bookstores and
coffeehouses, a book of poems makes the best-seller lists, magnetic
poetry is stuck to more than a million refrigerators, and sales of
poetry have increased by 55 percent in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason behind the rhyme renaissance is the Academy of
American Poets' campaign that was launched in 1996 designating
April as National Poetry Month. To spread the word, volunteers gave
away copies of poetry books on subways and Amtrak trains and placed
anthologies in hotel rooms next to Gideon Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Carroll, director of the American Poetry and Literacy
Project in Washington, became a sort of literary Johnny Appleseed,
crisscrossing the country, handing out books of poems from the back
of his rented truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is not just to promote poetry in all the usual
venues such as poetry readings,'' Carroll says. ``We want to get it
to truck drivers and prisoners and people in the supermarkets,
people from all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Volkswagen will put copies of poetry books in the
glove compartments of 40,000 new cars, Amtrak will distribute
thousands of volumes, and 3,500 Peace Corps volunteers going
overseas will receive anthologies to take with them.
</P>
<P>
   The books are titled ``Songs for the Open Road: Poems of Travel
and Adventure.'' ``It's a 66-page book with 98 poets,'' Carroll
says. ``Some of the poems are Robert Frost's `The Road Not Taken,'
Walt Whitman's `Song of the Open Road' and Emily Dickinson's `There
Is No Frigate Like a Book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many people suddenly embracing poetry? Carroll sees
the trend as an antidote to a high-stress, technological life
crowded with faxes, cell phones and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry encourages us to slow down and focus on what's
meaningful in life. It's like a little break. It doesn't take long
to read a poem. When you're on the road, sometimes it's hard to sit
down and open up a whole novel. You want just a little snapshot of
an emotion or an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Poetry also taps into a spiritual need, especially among baby
boomers, says Edward Hirsch, author of ``How to Read a Poem and
Fall in Love With Poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of hunger in people that isn't fulfilled by the
mass media,'' Hirsch says, ``and so people are turning to poetry.
What one hopes is that this interest is not ghettoized in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, who began writing poetry in high school ``out of
emotional desperation,'' blames schools for the previous decline in
poetry. ``Mostly, schools have not been doing their jobs initiating
students as poetry readers. We need to learn the classics, but we
need to give people poems they recognize themselves in. There's
plenty of poetry for all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, national poet laureate Robert Pinsky has initiated
``Favorite Poem Project'' to assemble an audio-video archive of
1,000 Americans reading their favorite poems. ``Poetry is part of
our shared culture that holds us together,'' Pinsky says.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last April, the Favorite Poem Project picked up support
in schools and libraries and at a White House gathering where
President Clinton recited Ralph Waldo Emerson's ``Concord Hymn,''
and Hillary Rodham Clinton read ``The Makers'' by former poet
laureate Howard Nemerov.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, films such as ``Il Postino'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' have helped popularize poetry, says Jonathan Galassi, poet
and editor-in-chief at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux (he edited Tom
Wolfe's ``A Man in Full'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a renaissance, but it's a sort of a fragmented
situation,'' Galassi says. ``There are poetry readings and poetry
slams everywhere. If you look at TV, a few years ago there were
only a few channels and now there are hundreds of channels. The
poetry community is a lot like that. It's a very active part of
book stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are showing up at cash registers as well. Last year,
Galassi's company sold more than 100,000 copies of Ted Hughes'
``Birthday Letters,'' a New York Times best seller that dealt with
his stormy relationship with his wife, poet Sylvia Plath. And pop
singer Jewel's book of poetry, ``A Night Without Armor,'' became a
best seller for HarperCollins.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel's book was expected to do well because of her built-in
audience, but young people in general are becoming more interested
in poetry, says Bill Wadsworth, executive director of the Academy
of American Poets. In the past four years, membership in his
organization has grown from 2,000 to 8,000, and participation by
young people in poetry slams _ poetry as performance art _ is up
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   That trend holds true in metro Atlanta, where there are poetry
readings somewhere every week. At Borders in Buckhead on Sunday, a
reading in the afternoon by award-winning Atlanta poet Memye Curtis
Tucker was followed by an open-mike ``tongue lashing'' in the
evening where a couple of dozen local poets showed up to read from
their works.
</P>
<P>
   With the sound of the cappuccino machine hissing and steaming in
the background, 24-year-old poet Ayodele Heath walked to the
microphone, stood motionless for a moment, then began swinging his
arms in a huge arc to illustrate the motion of a pendulum while
reciting lines from his poem about a girl on a swing watching the
movement of a grandfather clock through the window.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Lane Young, 31, a medical transcriptionist,
reads a poem about young liberals from college ``writing letters
for Amnesty International,/ organizing Central America Action
Groups;/acting on intention without pause;/ eating vegetarian,
doing without.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatherings like this are spreading every year, Young says later.
``It's like when rock music started, there were just a few
major-league bands like the Beatles. Now there are lots of bands
and lots and lots of poets.''
</P>
<P>
   And more women poets, as well. Tucker says there has been an
explosion of women's voices in poetry. ``This has added whole areas
of subject matter that previously was not considered serious or
interesting. The tone of poetry has been changed and enriched to
one that is more intimate or more casual.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about the proliferation of poets
and poetry. Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Charles Wright of Virginia
bemoans the multitudes of bad poets and bad poems produced by all
the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against the popularization of it,'' Wright says. ``I don't
think poetry is a popular sport; it's definitely an elitist art.
People who commit to it are on the periphery.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are more poets writing today, none has ascended to
the heights of a Robert Frost or Carl Sandburg. There is no Michael
Jordan of poetry. Atlanta native James Dickey became a
larger-than-life literary celebrity, but his fame was associated
more with his novel ``Deliverance'' than his poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity is a relative term,'' says Atlanta poet David
Bottoms, one of the editors of the literary magazine Five Points.
``Look at this woman, Jewel, who has a best-selling book of poems.
There's nothing about this book you could call art. We do have a
lot of extraordinarily good poets in America right now, people like
Seamus Heaney and Philip Levine. It's not movie-star celebrity, but
they are famous in literary circles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with poets as talented as Heaney, it is difficult to
achieve fame and prestige at the same time, says Fred Chappell, an
award-winning North Carolina poet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry has found two or three rather different audiences, and
there aren't many poets who can bridge the gap between the
coffeehouse and the academy to the great cadre of secret readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chappell says, poetry is more consequential in our lives
than ever before because more people are involved in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have all kinds of street poets, coffeehouse poets and bar
poets. And then you have the academic poets who are published in
volumes that nobody hears of or reads. There is so much of it, it
is a powerful force. We don't have anyone speaking for our nation
as Robert Frost or Walt Whitman did. We don't have anybody right
now, but if the moon is right, maybe we will.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, says Galassi, it's poetry itself rather than the
poet that matters most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our most authentic kind of speech,'' he says. ``It's
language in its most concentrated form and it's not commercial.
It's people talking when they're not trying to sell you
something.''

 &HT;    New sounds offering familiar emotionsBy Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll, Too Young to Die''
is more than the title song from a long-forgotten Jethro Tull
album. It's the description of a musical malady that has become a
cultural epidemic. As the generations that were raised on rock grow
older, the marketplace continues to skew younger. If you're too old
for Marilyn Manson, but too young for Johnny Mathis, where do you
turn?
</P>
<P>
   New albums by Beth Orton and Cassandra Wilson are among those
that provide relief from the malaise, combining the sort of
challenge and revelation that once made rock such a life-altering
experience with an artistic maturity that transcends the raging
hormones and personality crises of music aimed at teen-agers.
Neither Orton's ``Central Reservation'' (Arista/Deconstruction) nor
Wilson's ``Traveling Miles'' (Blue Note) could be even tangentially
classified as rock, yet neither do they settle into the numbingly
familiar predictability of so much adult music (and adult life, for
that matter). This is music that refreshens the ears and rearranges
the mind; that it does so at a lower decibel level merely means
that one has to listen more closely. Austin radio and record store
patrons apparently like what they're hearing with Orton and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our core audience is from age 35 to 45, and I'm often told
that the majority of our listeners have families and jobs and
they're not going to be scouring the music magazines looking for
the next big thing,'' said Jody Denberg, program director and
afternoon disc jockey for KGSR (107.1FM), the local ``adult album
alternative'' station most dedicated to introducing newer artists
to older ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a large segment of that audience that grew up on
rock radio and wants to hear something different,'' he continued.
``Beth Orton hits me where I emotionally live. She harkens back to
Nick Drake and Sandy Denny (two beloved British folksingers of the
'70s), yet she brings other textures to the table. She fits just as
comfortably next to Sheryl Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What people still get most excited about is that sense of
discovery,'' said John Kunz, owner of Waterloo Records, where
Orton's album has been a brisk seller. ``Beth Orton has been
cutting across from buyers in their late 20s to early 50s. Why?
Because she's got a beautiful voice, writes great songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Transcending boundaries of musical genre and generation, the
28-year-old from England has a sound that is invitingly familiar on
the surface. Yet the closer one listens, the more she seems to
resist the soothing sensitivities of the 1970s singer-songwriter.
Within the prickly, sensual confessionalism of ``Central
Reservation's'' title song (''I can still smell you on my fingers
and taste you on my breath'') and the stark sense of forboding in
``Devil's Song,'' Orton raises the stakes of personal risk beyond
the typical troubadour cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the album is even more adventurous than the songs,
offering an aural feast in which trip-hop rhythm loops season the
familiar strum of acoustic guitars. The latitude of the
arrangements offers Orton plenty of room to soar, from the
supper-club torchiness of ``Sweetest Decline,'' with Dr. John
providing the piano filigree, to the high-tech distortions of
``Stolen Car,'' with the guest guitar of Ben Harper channeling Jimi
Hendrix, to the chamber strings that enhance her otherwise solo
performance of ``Blood Red River.'' In a manner reflective of
Orton's songcraft, the tracks are typically shimmering at their
center, and a little rougher around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cassandra Wilson, while her new album pays tribute to
Miles Davis, both in evocation of his spirit and interpretation of
his music, the creativity reflects as much personal investment as
Orton's album. Just as Davis was a gateway artist who introduced so
many rock fans to jazz through the '70s (and whose electric alumni
generated almost the entirety of the era's jazz-rock fusion),
Wilson has been breaking down the walls separating jazz from the
more popular musical strains of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Her previous two albums _ 1993's ``Blue Light 'til Dawn''
breakthrough and 1997's ``New Moon Daughter'' follow-up _
established her as one of the decade's most significant artists and
its foremost vocal interpreter, as she put her personal stamp on an
impossibly eclectic selection of material ranging from U2 to Van
Morrison to Hank Williams to the Monkees. She was widely hailed as
a new generation's Billie Holiday, though her languidly dusky tone
has more in common with Roberta Flack and her acoustic-guitar-based
arrangements suggest the inspiration of Joni Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Following such adventures in musical direction, under the
production of Craig Street, ``Traveling Miles'' is Wilson's
self-produced, bringing-it-all-back- home album, her homage to the
trumpeter whom she considers the spiritual father of her artistry.
It is plain from the breathy minimalism of her vocals just how deep
runs the influence of Davis, both in terms of tone and in the
eloquence of the space between those tones. Yet the arrangements
all but reinvent his musical dynamic, exchanging the electric
keyboard and guitars that were so characteristic of his
rock-influenced progressions for marimba, harmonica, violin and
acoustic slide guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's stripped-down, string-driven invocation of Davis taps
into the music's Afro-bluesy source, with her lyrics recasting the
album-opening ``Run the VooDoo Down'' (a highlight of 1970's
``Bitches Brew'' as ``Miles Runs the Voodoo Down'') into a feminist
response to the call of Muddy Waters' ``Hoochie Coochie Man.''
Bringing the musical progression full circle, the album-closing
reprise of the same number traces that voodoo from Wilson's native
Mississippi to Africa, in duet with the Yoruban-singing Angelique
Kidjo.
</P>
<P>
   It would be as much of a disservice to marginalize Wilson as a
jazz singer as it would be to brand Orton as some sort of
neo-folkie. What's surprising is how much the art of these two have
in common, how an African-American vocalist with a background in
avant-garde jazz and a British singer-songwriter with earlier
credits from techno and dance-music sessions can arrive at such
similar places in their music. Sharing a creative daring that
transcends categorical convention and a bittersweet strain of vocal
expression that resists virtuosic displays of technique, the two
intersect at the point where the sophisticated strains of Orton's
``Sweetest Decline'' meet the buoyant melodicism of Wilson's
``Right Here, Right Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such albums remind of how amazing it once felt to have your
world transformed by a Bob Dylan, a Jimi Hendrix, a Joni Mitchell,
a Miles Davis. And how it can still feel, for those who keep their
ears open.

   POETRY _ Ted Hughes, Robert Frost and all of the superstar poets
are dead, but poetry is alive and thriving. Young people are
reading their verse in poetry slams and coffeehouses, Poet Laureate
Robert Pinksy is collecting poetry submissions for a national
archive, and Andrew Carroll _ dubbed the Johnny Appleseed of Poetry
_ is heading a campaign to put poetry anthologies in hotel rooms
and in the glove compartments of every Volkswagen sold in April. We
talk to some of the best and brightest poets about the state of
poetry today and the need for a Michael Jordan of poetry. Among

   TRAVEL-CANCUN _ CANCUN Cancun for $399. We went on one of those
too-good-to-be-true package deals to Mexico's ultimate tourist town
and found things are not as cheap as they first appear, but the
experience was pretty rich anyhow. Everywhere you go, the city
nervily thrusts its collective hand into your pocket. In the crafts
markets, where trinket peddlers beckon you with cries of ``Come
into my shop, just for the hell of it!'' and, most oddly, ``Buy
something for your neighbor's wife!'' In the discos, where hotsy
cocktail waitresses grab you by the face and try to force $2 shots
down your throat. But we also rode a horse in the shocking-blue
Caribbean surf the beach and went parasailing - despite our fear of
heights and water. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   CHICKEN-SOUP _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Peter Vegso was sitting
in an airport when his life changed. It was just another manuscript
submitted to his publishing company, but this one provoked an
unusual response _ it made Vegso cry. Vegso did not know that
`Chicken Soup for the Soul' by Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen
had been turned down by 33 publishers, i.e. everybody in New York.
He did not know that his Health Communications, Inc. of Deerfield
Beach was the the 34th firm to peruse the manuscript, nor would he
have cared. The book worked for him, therefore he would publish it.
Six years later, read the statistics and wonder: `Chicken Soup for

 &HT;    Author explores Hispaniola
 &HT;    By Michael Shashoua
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Americans may not know very much about
Hispaniola, but they're starting to, says Michele Wucker, author of
a new book about the island, ``Why the Cocks Fight: Dominicans,
Haitians and the Struggle for Hispaniola'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, $27.50,
281 pages).
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Dominican Republic goes, this will give people
some image of it at all,'' Wucker said. ``With Sammy Sosa and the
relief efforts for Hurricane Georges last year, Americans got some
idea of it. I'm surprised they haven't gotten more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in my family asked me if I was going there to eat
tacos. Really, you couldn't get tacos except as some delicacy
imported from Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   With the United States having sent troops to both Haiti and the
Dominican Republican twice in this century, and one million of each
nationality living in United States, the island has a bigger effect
on America than many Americans realize, Wucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a huge impact in Florida and the Northeast, but a
lot of Americans aren't as aware of how big an impact the island
has,'' she said. ``I hope the book gives a human face to both
countries. I also hope by looking at how two countries in unusual
circumstances share an island, it can be a model for issues we're
facing in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Wucker first became interested in the island's culture as an
international relations student at Rice University. She first
visited the island in 1988 on a grant from the school to study the
effect of language on relations between its two countries, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti. Her interest in this particular topic
came from her own background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was through Belgium, of all things,'' Wucker said. ``My
family's from there, and we're split between French and Flemish.
Going out to market every day, you had to figure out what language
to use. Through my experience, I wanted to see whether getting
through cultural and language differences made it possible to get
past political differences.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to the island several times in the past decade to
report stories as a journalist for a Dominican newspaper in New
York City and for publications including Newsweek and the Christian
Science Monitor. Over the years, she came to see the challenges the
island faces as similar to those faced by the United States. The
way the island nations contend with these challenges is different,
Wucker found.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk much more openly about race,'' she said, describing
the tensions between Haiti's darker-skinned black people and
Dominicans, who have a lighter complexion. ``It's not like in the
Midwest (where Wucker grew up), where you don't mention `difficult'
things. People accept it and acknowledge it, unlike in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the Cocks Fight'' and its analysis of Hispaniola history
sprang from gaining a deeper understanding of their cultures,
Wucker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was looking at language and culture as part of the
reasons. The longer I spent, the more I realized it was just a
mask,'' she said. ``It was a symptom, not a cause. The real issues
affecting them were immigration, poverty and the strongman
governments they had. I started to see it as similar to things
going on in the U.S., like the controversy over Proposition 187 in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both here and there, when an immigration issue comes up, it
usually coincides with politicans exploiting a weakness for their
own ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wucker's book ties together Hispaniola history of the last two
centuries with very recent events, such as Haiti's 1991 coup and
the ensuing effects of U.S. refugee policy toward the country. Even
100-year-old conflicts between Haiti and the Dominican Republic
still are fresh in the minds of many, she found.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was covering Haiti for the Spanish-language paper, just
mentioning Haiti you would have someone going ballistic about
something that happened in 1822, like it was yesterday,'' Wucker
said. ``In Haiti, people hear the word `Dominican' and they get
very defensive. It boils under the surface. It's such a good story
_ the history, the wild characters in both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those characters include men who participate in cockfighting,
training stables of roosters like prize racehorses. Wucker shows
how, for example, in the Dominican Republic, it's a metaphor for
the country's political history; and how it's also a metaphor for
the rivalry between that country and Haiti. Yet she also carries
that history forward by exploring the current politics and
economics of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``History does repeat itself. They have the colonial legacy of a
strongman leader who's above everyone else and that myth is very
damaging,'' Wucker said. ``But they're at a turning point. Both
countries have freely elected leaders. I don't want to sound too
American by saying elections fix everything, but I have seen a new
openness and diversity in people allowed to express themselves
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between the two countries, once unheard of, has
begun in order to further economic interests. Wucker points to
their joint application to Europe's Lome Convention, a trade
agreement, which other Caribbean nations who joined desired for
political reasons. With business interests such as these, and
economic exchange occasioned in part by contributions to political
campaigns and hurricane relief in their home countries, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti are also gaining perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking engagements in major U.S. cities this winter
coinciding with the publication of her book, Wucker is still
learning about the two countries and the two peoples, both in their
home countries and here in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the adults it's much better,'' she said, describing how
Haitian-Americans and Dominican-Americans get along. ``One woman
told me, `I'm a teacher, and the school kids from each culture
insult each other.' But kids will always find ways to insult each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wucker's audiences marvel at her ability to moderate
fervent discussions that occur when Dominicans or Haitians speak or
ask questions at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm this little `gringa,' you know,'' she said. ``But my
Dominican friends call me `apatanada,' which means `affected by the
plantains' or `addicted to the plantains,' which are a staple of
their diet.''

   POETRY _ Ted Hughes, Robert Frost and all of the superstar poets
are dead, but poetry is alive and thriving. Young people are
reading their verse in poetry slams and coffeehouses, Poet Laureate
Robert Pinksy is collecting poetry submissions for a national
archive, and Andrew Carroll _ dubbed the Johnny Appleseed of Poetry
_ is heading a campaign to put poetry anthologies in hotel rooms
and in the glove compartments of every Volkswagen sold in April. We
talk to some of the best and brightest poets about the state of
poetry today and the need for a Michael Jordan of poetry. Among
those interviewed is Ed Hirsch, author of a new book, ``How to Read
a Poem,'' who will be in town April 15. Also upcoming is a

   TRAVEL-CANCUN _ CANCUN Cancun for $399. We went on one of those
too-good-to-be-true package deals to Mexico's ultimate tourist town
and found things are not as cheap as they first appear, but the
experience was pretty rich anyhow. Everywhere you go, the city
nervily thrusts its collective hand into your pocket. In the crafts
markets, where trinket peddlers beckon you with cries of ``Come
into my shop, just for the hell of it!'' and, most oddly, ``Buy
something for your neighbor's wife!'' In the discos, where hotsy
cocktail waitresses grab you by the face and try to force $2 shots
down your throat. But we also rode a horse in the shocking-blue
Caribbean surf the beach and went parasailing - despite our fear of
heights and water. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

the tankini _ the hot new swimsuit that's part tank top, part

shawl or stole, the cropped shrug doesn't require constant
attention to keep it on your shoulders. (Johnson, Atlanta

forecast more contemporary looks, with the clean, simple lines of
Asian themes; an emphasis on French country, especially gardening
motifs; and as we close the book a century of design, a nostalgic
revival of the curvy shapes and sleek finishes of Art Moderne.
Those are just a few predictions as the world's largest biannual

gasoline tanks, transmissions and even portable toilets, smugglers
have opened what one federal official called ``a drug-cash pipeline
from New York to Texas'' in an effort to get their profits out of
the country. As a result, Customs inspectors nationwide are finding
more cash than ever and are poised for yet another record year of
seizures of undeclared money. By DANE SCHILLER.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs-PARTNERS (Sacramento) _ The California Assembly's Health

   NEWSPAPERS-CITIES (San Francisco) _ If newspapers are searching

(Photo available on the NYT photo service.)
</P>
<P>
   WOMENSWEAR (Undated) _ Scada, Munich's finest design house,
produces the kind of clothes that talk in bold-face caps. These are
not the whisperingly polite unconstructed draperies of Giorgio
Armani or the luxuriously quiet classics of Oscar de la Renta or
Bill Blass. These are big, bold, bawdy, obvious clothes for women
who are exceedingly happy with their bodies and sure of themselves.

Titanic that so fascinates late 20th century America? And what does
this fascination say about us? By CYNTHIA BASS.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKETTE (Houston) _ For as long as she can remember, Michelle

Through the years, Hames considered auditioning for the Rockettes,
but she didn't muster the courage until she toured Radio City Music

   DAMNATIONS-TX (Undated) _ It's probably not fair to say that a

sites, great bike trails, a dozen hidden ponds and interesting
wildlife. By TOM STIENSTRA.

</P>
<P>
   SCONES (Undated) _ Scones and biscuits are both breakfast breads
made in single-size servings and taste dandy topped with butter and

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ I did my bit for the war effort.
I just paid for 1/100 of a cruise missile or 1/4,500 of a so-called

there were but 3 billion of us, we are talking about cataclysmic
acceleration. By STEPHANIE SALTER.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Classroom clairvoyance
 &HT;    For release April 18, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not with just mild interest when I note that the high
school art teacher for Kurt Cobain retained some of his paintings
and sketches. Cobain, of course, is the rocker who became
near-deified after his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the teacher have the foresight to know that Cobain
would turn into a cult personality (rockers who either commit
suicide or die from drug overdoses have that effect on young
people) but he also thought he could fetch a pretty good buck for
the stuff through a Christie's auction.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of dollars expected in the bidding, Cobain's
family stepped in and caused the teacher to relent and offer the
material to the family. The story that alerted me to this did not
say if the family was going to pay the old high school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Time Magazine ran two of Cobain's sketches, and they were pretty
good. But one has to wonder about the teacher. How was he able to
detect, while Cobain still was a high school student, that Kurt was
going to become famous as a rock star and take his life at an early
age _ the only reason the paintings have any value?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he have saved the work? Does he save the work of
all his students, or just his better students? How big a warehouse
does he have for former students' work? Cobain's teacher was so
impressed with him as an artist that he apparently also held on to
his notes to Cobain, including his gradings: ``Kurt, your
caricatures are outstanding. 10/10, A.''
</P>
<P>
   This opens an entirely new field: Teachers stashing the work of
students they think will do more than just make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   What if Ernest Hemingway's high school English teacher came
forth with the original manuscripts of young Ernest that led to his
first two publications in the school annual? How much would they
have fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Germany, perhaps there was a high school teacher
who passed on to his family scraps of paper of one of his brighter
students containing myriad doodles: E equals MC1, E equals cam, E
equals MCI . . .
</P>
<P>
   Would some high school teacher in Arkansas have in his or her
hands a randy note taken from a future president as he tried to
pass it across the aisle to a pretty girl? How much for that? Ask
Paula.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a long-secretly-held practice of the teaching profession
just now coming to light? Are beginning teachers being trained to
spot potential celebrities and to squirrel away their class work
until such time it can command big dollars and, thus, supplement
their pathetically paltry salaries?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if Miss Sugar ever took notice of my potential? Miss
Sugar was my junior high school geography teacher. It was in her
classroom that I carved around the desk opening in which the ink
bottle was placed: ``Jump In Here!''
</P>
<P>
   It got me into the principal's office, then back to the desk
with sandpaper and varnish, but do you think Miss Sugar ever
thought I would amount to anything other than a wood carver? Had
she known that I actually would graduate high school and be able to
locate China on a map and to be able to spell Chechnya in a
widely-distributed newspaper column, do you think she might have
taken the desk home for future financial consideration?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not; I wasn't successful enough, didn't commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in a world of collectibles for big dollars:
baseball cards, stuffed dolls and, now, even old school projects.
</P>
<P>
   Daily, billions of collectibles are freshly created in Mainland
China assembly lines just to succor our craving for them. And when
an original comes along, a sketch by a dead rocker no less, you can
well understand why the perceptive teacher placed a call to
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to today's students: Make all your teachers sign release
forms saying they are not squirreling away your work for future
sale or, failing that, get a clause in there giving you or your
successors a piece of the action.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Trying to imagine what war in Kosovo might be like, I've been
unable to resist images from the vivid battle epics of the past
season, ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line.''
 &HT;    It may be sheerest coincidence that a real war has arrived right
in the midst of a nationwide vogue for a bygone war. But one way or
the other, the depiction of World War II in these two films, as
well as in Tom Brokaw's best-selling oral history, ``The Greatest
Generation,'' is subtly influencing the way I and most other
Americans think about the crisis in the Balkans.
 &HT;    Do these representations of war in the '40s make us more eager
to fight in the late '90s, or more reluctant? They do sober us to
the physical reality of war, but they are nonetheless deeply
nostalgic.
 &HT;    They recall combat in Europe and the Pacific as the proving
ground of manhood, an ultimate test of character, our last national
bonding experience. (In the case of the mystifying ``Thin Red
Line,'' which may otherwise simply be a nature documentary with
soldiers, I'm referring only to the battle sequences.)
 &HT;    Presenting the horrible adventure of war as the antithesis of
trivial contemporary life, the '90s version of World War II makes
combat a far more tolerable concept, evoking a sentiment that might
be called GI Envy. Given recent events, such feelings bring to mind
the old saw about being careful what you wish for.
 &HT;    The bluff has been called; our country finds itself enmeshed in
a rapidly escalating European conflict and faced with dire choices
about just how much sacrifice we are willing to make. Do we really
desire the moral cauldron of war? Or do we just like the way it
looks at the cineplex?
 &HT;    Even in its first days, the conflict presented itself as a
miniaturized and modernized version of what we've seen on the
screen. Early reports were peppered with distinctly Spielbergian
plot lines and references: the rescue mission behind enemy lines
that endangers many to save one, the lumbering B-52 bombers still
in service after all these years.
 &HT;    But the most significant connection may be the way World War II
creates a rationale for involvement in Kosovo. Many people, both
inside and outside the Clinton administration, have drawn the
parallel: Once again we're fighting alongside our allies to stop an
expansionist power and forestall the mass murder of a helpless
ethnic minority.
 &HT;    In the analogy, Milosevic is a low-rent Hitler; his ethnic
cleansing, a B-movie Holocaust.
 &HT;    Of course, the suggestion that America's main goal was to save
Jews from Hitler is the revisionist product of a post-Holocaust
consciousness. But the larger image is not irrelevant. Because in
many ways our involvement in Kosovo is an expression of the same
theme that informs Brokaw's book and Spielberg's movie.
 &HT;    Just beneath the surface, these works simmer with the self-doubt
of the children of the World War II vets, who never heard a simple
call for sacrifice, even when their turn came in Vietnam. As baby
boomers and as Democrats, Clinton and his contemporaries _
Spielberg among them _ are still looking for a chance to show their
bona fides, to prove that it was the Vietnam War that they objected
to, not the risk and sacrifice of war per se.
 &HT;    In this sense, nostalgia for World War II seems less an
expression of regret about the past than a yearning for the clear
moral imperative their generation never faced.
 &HT;    As powerful as these feelings are, however, it's important to
resist imagining Tom Hanks in Pristina or viewing Kosovo as the
antidote to Vietnam. Involvement in a war in the Balkans is not
likely to resemble the World War II either in the scale of the harm
it does to the United States or in the morally uplifting fringe
benefits it offers.
 &HT;    For one thing, America's Army has changed. Instead of a draft,
which distributes risk fairly, we have a volunteer force that hires
mainly minorities and working-class whites to bear the burden on
behalf of those with brighter prospects. Random sample: Two of
three soldiers captured on the Macedonian border last week had
Hispanic surnames.
 &HT;    For another thing, war itself has changed. Even fighting on the
ground can no longer be expected to involve the tests of courage
and endurance we recall from the movies. Ground wars are now
mechanized and anonymous, more likely to risk dozens of lives than
tens of thousands.
 &HT;    Finally, and most important, the country is a far different
place than it was in the '40s. After Vietnam, a nondefensive war
that costs many American lives is likely to be more socially
divisive than unifying.
 &HT;    These aren't arguments against intervention in the Balkans.
They're arguments against a sentimental intervention. Even more
than people Bill Clinton's age, those of us born after the 1950s
lack any kind of personal relationship to war.
 &HT;    My generation's knowledge of what war means comes mainly from
popular culture. And when you have no fixed point of experience and
plausible arguments are being made on all sides, popular narratives
take on an even greater persuasive power.
 &HT;    There's a saying that the generals always fight the previous
war. We erred in Vietnam by thinking of ourselves as the omnipotent
victors of World War II. After Vietnam, the military tried to avoid
exposing troops to danger under any circumstances.
 &HT;    We may already have misjudged the battle with Milosevic by
assuming his forces would immediately collapse under strategic
bombing, as in the gulf war. But lacking a firsthand sense of what
war could mean for our country may actually be an advantage when it
comes to trying to think clearly about Kosovo.
 &HT;    Americans for whom the experience of massive conflict is
increasingly remote just need to resist the temptation to fight the
last war movie.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    So this was it, then, the moment Dan Quayle had been working
toward just about every second of the six years since he turned the
house keys over to Al Gore.
 &HT;    With Richard Nixon as his guiding spirit, the former vice
president had been in political rehab _ writing to set the record
straight, reading as if the final exam were tomorrow and speaking
wherever he got invited by the conservatives who admire him above
all because he is still standing.
 &HT;    Now at last, he hoped, his comeback could begin. And there he
was on ``Larry King Live,'' a little grayer and a lot more intense,
speaking with great ferocity even through a meandering account of
his day: He had been on his way to Washington, but then the plane
had to circle for the longest time and then it got rerouted and
then. ...
 &HT;    Finally, even Larry King, whose interview subjects can generally
count on the same kind of grilling they'd get from a friendly cabby
on the way to the airport, asked if there wasn't something he
wanted to announce. Yes, Quayle said, he was running for president.
 &HT;    ``I love proving people wrong, and I am going to do it again,''
he told King, who observed that while Quayle's chances seemed poor,
the news was not all bad: ``You're not a joke like you once were.''
 &HT;    Quayle looked almost pleased. All good politicians are
congenital optimists. And Quayle is good at politics. Before he was
a punch line, he was a prodigy, taking out a popular incumbent
congressman in 1976, at age 29, and unseating Sen. Birch Bayh of
Indiana four years later.
 &HT;    He was on such a roll that he briefly thought of running for
president himself in 1988. During a brazen campaign to get George
Bush to choose him as his running mate, he used to fantasize about
the headline, ``Bush Picks Hoosier Rising Star.''
 &HT;    Then, of course, he blew himself up. In the first moments of
what he now calls the ``fateful week'' after he was asked to join
the Republican ticket, he overheated in plain sight, jumping around
the stage when Bush introduced him like an overexcited game-show
contestant. The next day, he seized up when asked about his
National Guard service and set off a controversy about whether
family connections had kept him out of Vietnam.
 &HT;    That evening, he told Dan Rather that he had never slept with
Paula Parkinson. Which was all to the good, except no one had
asked. Rather even had to explain to viewers who she was _ a
lobbyist who claimed Quayle had flirted with her during a golf
weekend years earlier.
 &HT;    (The incident is mostly memorable for Marilyn Quayle's response,
which pretty much retired the trophy for wifely put-downs: ``Anyone
who knows Dan Quayle, knows he'd rather play golf than have sex any
day.'')
 &HT;    As vice president, Quayle lighted the fuse on the ``family
values'' debate with his ``Murphy Brown'' speech. But he is better
remembered for P-O-T-A-T-O-E, the faux pas that convinced America
the man really must be D-U-M.
 &HT;    Today, it is tough to find a Republican who doesn't say a) that
Quayle was treated unfairly, b) that Quayle is one heck of a nice
guy and c) that Quayle can't win _ and would it be so bad to pick
someone who might?
 &HT;    Like, maybe, the son of his former boss. Mostly, Quayle is stoic
about all the hoopla surrounding George W. Bush, who has been
running a Rose Garden campaign from the Governor's Mansion in
Austin, Tex., while Quayle has been up at dawn doing ``Good
Morning, Wherever'' and hitting every fish fry, bean feed and pork
roast that will have him.
 &HT;    Several times a day, Quayle is asked, essentially, ``How weird
is it, going up against Junior?'' His standard answer is, ``It is a
great story, the former president's son versus his handpicked
successor'' _ that's Quayle, as he sees it. ``But I'm not looking
at the rest of the field.''
 &HT;    In fact, sizing up the competition is one of the things Quayle
does best. He sums up the essential problem of being Al Gore, whom
he calls ``Mr. Perfect,'' this way: ``He's the opposite of Clinton.
Clinton, you know in your heart you shouldn't trust him and you
shouldn't like the guy, but you just do. With Gore, it's the
opposite.'' (As for Al Gore, politician-inventor, Quayle says, ``If
he invented the Internet, I invented Spellcheck.'')
 &HT;    And he might be forgiven one or two tiny swipes at Bush the
younger: ``I don't know where he's going to come down on issues.
He's said he'll let us know.''
 &HT;    Asked about their relationship, Quayle recalls that when he was
vice president, George W. ``was in and out. Jeb Bush was the one
who was very interested in policy, in education and in what was
going on in Nicaragua. He had keen insight into both foreign and
domestic affairs. George was more interested in sizing up the
political landscape.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, I'm rather bemused'' by all the attention Bush is
getting, Quayle added with a chuckle in his voice.
 &HT;    He seemed to mean amused, rather than bewildered. Then again,
maybe not.
 &HT;    Often, Quayle makes the point that Americans love an underdog.
But what they really love is ``poor boy makes good.'' ``Good boy
does poorly''? Not quite so snappy.
 &HT;    The kind of second chance Quayle is looking for would make
Nixon's resurrection in 1968 look like a cheap card trick _ and not
only because he's polling in the single digits.
 &HT;    ``It's one thing to have people think you're wrong or even
dangerous,'' said one old friend, who believes those kind of
negatives can be turned around. ``But to have people think you're a
buffoon?''
 &HT;    Still, some revisionism might be going on. The head of
Colorado's Republican Party, Bob Beauprez, recently referred to
Quayle as ``actually a cerebral sort of a candidate.'' And members
of the media seem at least theoretically prepared to play along.
 &HT;    Following Quayle on Larry King that night in January was a panel
of smart guys brought on to assess him and his chances, and they
seemed to agree that he is, after all, a pretty smart guy too:
 &HT;    David Gergen: ``Could be the surprise candidate of the race.''
 &HT;    Larry King: ``A lot of fire in him. ... Were you surprised at
his fire tonight?''
 &HT;    Bob Woodward: ``He had that spark.''
 &HT;    Steve Kroft: ``As Bob and other people would acknowledge, and
reporters in Washington have for a long time, he's different when
you talk to him in person. He's very intelligent, very smart, very
responsive, well read on the issues, knows what he wants to do. And
it's really a stark difference between the projected image that
you've seen of him while he was vice president and what he is
really like.''
 &HT;    The next day, when I saw Quayle after a speech he gave in
Washington, he was still flushed from the thrill of being taken
seriously. ``Different from when the first thing you heard was
questions about the National Guard, huh?'' he said when we shook
hands. Then he mentioned that someone had suggested to him that the
humiliations of his vice presidency were behind him now, that
``Senator Quayle is back.''
 &HT;    ``Senator Quayle is back!'' he repeated, fairly shouting. ``He's
been in hibernation, but he's back!''
 &HT;    It would be wrong to say Quayle isn't running to win. To get up
every morning and rush off to three breakfasts where you don't get
to eat, then hurry away to say the same things over again, at every
stop hoping there will be lots of opportunities to take more dim
questions from reporters who then have the temerity to behave as
though you're a dummy _ hey, you gotta want it. But friends say
privately that while he wants to win, he needs to win respect. And
ultimately, the race seems driven by that need for personal, as
much as political, redemption. ``Even if he doesn't know it,'' says
someone who has advised him informally, ``the largest chunk of
psychic justification for all of this is that he can't end the book
with what's now the last chapter.''
 &HT;    You can't say Quayle doesn't know what he's up against. When I
first saw him last summer, he was standing on the back of a flatbed
truck on a steamy airport tarmac in Harlan, Iowa. The man who
introduced him, Shelby County's Republican chairman, Dave Best,
began by telling the crowd he just couldn't help remembering the
sad debacle of Bush introducing Quayle as his running mate.
 &HT;    ``Think back to 10 years ago this month in New Orleans,'' Best
said. ``Now that's something I can really remember. I was in
Portland, Ore., with my family. There's been a lot of things like
that over the 10 years.''
 &HT;    Quayle thanked him for the ``warm Midwestern welcome'' and
suggested that he is older and wiser these days. ``Marilyn and I
are empty-nesters now,'' he said. ``We're at a different stage of
life.''
 &HT;    He had made a little news that week as the first prominent
Republican to ask Clinton to resign, and some were still hoping the
whole mess might benefit a guy like Quayle, so clean and so
married. But he couldn't quite bring himself to bash Clinton, who
doesn't seem to make him angry, just perplexed. How could the
president risk it all over a girl?
 &HT;    And ever eager to show his foreign-policy smarts, he gave
Clinton only a light dusting on the personal front before moving on
to attack his Iraq policy. Then he told the crowd they need a
president who has visited 47 countries and knows world leaders
personally. (Hint, hint.)
 &HT;    But this plus two electric fans set up on a picnic table were
not enough to keep the audience invigorated in 97-degree heat, and
the one big applause line was in praise of the farmer. Whenever
Quayle's focus strayed too far from his own predicament, he seemed
unable to resist coming back to pick at it. He wrapped up by saying
America wants ``a leader who has been tested, weathered, criticized
but had the courage to stand there and stand for our values.''
 &HT;    When he stepped down from the truck to meet his public, they
seemed to like him, no question, but also to feel sorry for him.
One woman told him he sure deserved a break after all he'd been
through. Then along came a reporter for KMTV, Omaha's CBS
affiliate, who was wearing a toe ring and looked about ready to
expire in a heavy tunic in basic black.
 &HT;    She spoke to Quayle slowly, as if he might not know English. ``I
promise, this will be quick and easy,'' she said. ``Don't worry, it
will all be stuff that you know well.''
 &HT;    She began, ``Great start for maybe a presidential run in Iowa?''
Next, apparently referring to the Lewinsky scandal: ``You've been
in the White House. How does something like this happen?'' Finally,
``This is kind of a silly question, but if you could be a fly on
the wall, where would you want to be?''
 &HT;    Even Quayle blinked at this, but then went on gamely: ``Uh, the
Oval Office. That's where it's all going on.''
 &HT;    KTIV in Sioux City, meanwhile, had phoned to say it didn't look
as if its crew would be catching up with Quayle after all; house
fire to cover. Though he suffered all this with a smile, Quayle
does not seem to have worked out his feelings about what he's been
through with reporters. But he isn't nursing grudges, either, and
asked me pleasantly about colleagues who'd made his life a misery
when he was vice president. And he is not hiding; on that same trip
to Iowa, he even let me tag along with him to the golf course.
 &HT;    ``It's a great release,'' he said, sitting in a golf cart after
the event, a Des Moines benefit for a local Republican. ``That's
one of the things I approve of about Clinton, not how he plays but
that he plays. He ought to play more. He's set a standard for the
amount of golf that a president can play. I think every president
should play at least as much golf as President Clinton.''
 &HT;    In fact, Quayle is likable _ funny, good-natured and obviously
not a hater. He is also a man of serious concerns; he churns over
military preparedness and seems most turned on blasting Clinton for
failing to make anti-terrorism a priority or worrying about China,
``the Germany of 100 years ago, just coming into its own.'' At
home, he'd like to cut taxes 30 percent and defend against ``the
assault on middle-class values.''
 &HT;    He isn't too pure to compete in the political arena; after a
media-bashing speech in Fort Wayne, I asked him if he really
believes what he said about how he couldn't wait to see Tom Brokaw
and Dan Rather in anguish, announcing Republican wins on Election
night. Does he really think journalists are partisan on that level?
He laughed: ``Republicans believe it, and that's good enough for
me.''
 &HT;    As a campaigner, he is affable, but tends to float above the
faces in a crowd rather than locking in on each one. Sometimes, he
not only forgets he's just met someone but also lets it show. And
he does not always tend professional relationships as carefully as
he might. As one Indiana Republican puts it, ``He was always there
when he needed me.''
 &HT;    There are also any number of new ``old Quayle'' moments _ not
gaffes exactly, but examples of the slack, roundabout way he has of
expressing himself. On the public's growing cynicism, for example:
``You can't take anything at face value anymore, which is
unfortunate.''
 &HT;    Yet in an age in which to be off camera is to be barely alive,
Quayle is apparently unbothered by his communication deficit. ''If
people listen, they know what I'm saying,'' he said. ``People know
what's important and what's not.''
 &HT;    Behind the decision to let a reporter close enough to hear the
rhythms of the unrehearsed Dan Quayle is the conviction that he is
fine the way he is; it is others who need to change and learn to
look at him differently.
 &HT;    And the larger problem than his sometimes twisted tongue is that
he knows he needs reinventing but has decided against it. ``He
bristles at the notion,'' said a Republican strategist who knows
him well. ``He doesn't want it written, 'He was a dunderhead, but
now he's changed.'''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, reporters ask, ``Is this a different Dan
Quayle?'' He answers: ``You bet! You're going to see the real Dan
Quayle.''

through with reporters. But he isn't nursing grudges, either, and
asked me pleasantly about colleagues who'd made his life a misery
when he was vice president. And he is not hiding; on that same trip
to Iowa, he even let me tag along with him to the golf course.
 &HT;    ``It's a great release,'' he said, sitting in a golf cart after
the event, a Des Moines benefit for a local Republican. ``That's
one of the things I approve of about Clinton, not how he plays but
that he plays. He ought to play more. He's set a standard for the
amount of golf that a president can play. I think every president
should play at least as much golf as President Clinton.''
 &HT;    In fact, Quayle is likable _ funny, good-natured and obviously
not a hater. He is also a man of serious concerns; he churns over
military preparedness and seems most turned on blasting Clinton for
failing to make anti-terrorism a priority or worrying about China,
``the Germany of 100 years ago, just coming into its own.'' At
home, he'd like to cut taxes 30 percent and defend against ``the
assault on middle-class values.''
 &HT;    He isn't too pure to compete in the political arena; after a
media-bashing speech in Fort Wayne, I asked him if he really
believes what he said about how he couldn't wait to see Tom Brokaw
and Dan Rather in anguish, announcing Republican wins on Election
night. Does he really think journalists are partisan on that level?
He laughed: ``Republicans believe it, and that's good enough for
me.''
 &HT;    As a campaigner, he is affable, but tends to float above the
faces in a crowd rather than locking in on each one. Sometimes, he
not only forgets he's just met someone but also lets it show. And
he does not always tend professional relationships as carefully as
he might. As one Indiana Republican puts it, ``He was always there
when he needed me.''
 &HT;    There are also any number of new ``old Quayle'' moments _ not
gaffes exactly, but examples of the slack, roundabout way he has of
expressing himself. On the public's growing cynicism, for example:
``You can't take anything at face value anymore, which is
unfortunate.''
 &HT;    Yet in an age in which to be off camera is to be barely alive,
Quayle is apparently unbothered by his communication deficit. ''If
people listen, they know what I'm saying,'' he said. ``People know
what's important and what's not.''
 &HT;    Behind the decision to let a reporter close enough to hear the
rhythms of the unrehearsed Dan Quayle is the conviction that he is
fine the way he is; it is others who need to change and learn to
look at him differently.
 &HT;    And the larger problem than his sometimes twisted tongue is that
he knows he needs reinventing but has decided against it. ``He
bristles at the notion,'' said a Republican strategist who knows
him well. ``He doesn't want it written, 'He was a dunderhead, but
now he's changed.'''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, reporters ask, ``Is this a different Dan
Quayle?'' He answers: ``You bet! You're going to see the real Dan
Quayle.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Are the culture wars still upon us? It is always being said they
are, and that they have got nastier with time.
 &HT;    It is even said that, in the battle over President Clinton and
his scandals this past year, the culture wars reached a grand
finale, and decades of controversy over the sexual and moral ideas
of the 1960s neatly exploded into a full-scale political crisis.
 &HT;    All of which sounds entirely plausible. But is it true?
 &HT;    In a good many conservative eyes, Clinton has always seemed a
man of the '60s counterculture, and the counterculture has always
seemed a calamitous assault on ordinary decency, and the battle
against the president has always been a moral crusade to roll back
the calamity. In that sense, the culture wars are real enough, and
last year's scandals were definitely a climax.
 &HT;    Yet that interpretation, for all its pleasing simplicity, has
never been able to account for one very large anomaly in the year's
events. Some of Clinton's fiercest opponents _ his most scathing
critics on television, in the national press and in the Washington
elite _ came from backgrounds that were distinctly liberal.
 &HT;    Some of those people were graduates of the elite universities,
where the counterculture was always strong. Some were honored
veterans of progressive movements of the past. They were people who
had almost never agreed with conservatives, and certainly not about
the evils of the counterculture. Yet when those people gazed in his
direction, they too felt a keen revulsion, and felt it in the pits
of their stomachs.
 &HT;    What accounts for such a thing _ an emotional confluence of
conservatives and a number of elite liberals? The explanation, it
seems to me, has to do with the countercultural values that
everyone is said to be fighting over. Anyone can natter on about
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
 &HT;    But the counterculture, it ought to be remembered, had a
spiritual side too. It was a cult of truth _ a cult that got its
start among the Puritans of New England long ago and came down to
modern times through the writings of people such as Henry Thoreau
and the cultural atmosphere of the Unitarian Church and innumerable
other ways. It was an impulse to rebel against everything false,
tricky and hypocritical, in favor of everything direct, unvarnished
and authentic.
 &HT;    That kind of impulse was never going to look kindly on a man
such as Clinton, with his wiles and his hidden love life. And so,
during the past year conservatives loathed Clinton because they
were anti-'60s, and a number of elite liberals loathed Clinton
because they were, in some respects, pro-'60s. And their loathing
was the same.
 &HT;    Plainly something divided the country this past year, something
powerful enough to set off a political crisis. But the divisive
something cannot have been the culture wars from the 1960s. Here is
what it was.
 &HT;    This country has always been divided into two enormous cultural
blocs, which can be named. They are the insiders and the outsiders.
The difference between them has nothing to do with power or lack of
power. It is a spiritual difference, and it comes out of the
churches and religious tradition.
 &HT;    The original insiders, from the early years of the Republic,
were people who could trace their roots back to East Anglia and
northern England. But most of all they were Puritans or their
descendants _ people who adhered to the Calvinist theological
traditions of Harvard and Princeton and a few other colleges, where
the old Congregationalist and Presbyterian ideas had left their
mark.
 &HT;    Those people upheld the doctrine that man and God stand in
direct relation, and that man's duty is faithfulness to God, and
that faithfulness means truth. Therefore the insiders hated
hypocrisy, falseness and ornament, and they admired directness,
plainness and sincerity.
 &HT;    In the early Republic, some of the insiders were wealthy
merchants, and some were highly educated divines, and still others
were pious, back-country, straitlaced strivers. But whatever their
social class, they felt themselves to be a group, and they felt
that America had been founded by people like themselves, and they
felt that America was supposed to be a place that conformed to
their own ideas about man and God.
 &HT;    The insiders recognized that America contained other people too,
with very different religious beliefs and values. But when the
insiders gazed on those other beliefs, they suspected immorality or
a shakiness of values, and they worried.
 &HT;    And so, the spiritual insiders gathered together in a political
party to promote their own stern convictions _ in the Federalist
and Whig parties during America's earliest years, and later,
beginning in the mid-19th century, in the Republican Party. And the
achievements of those parties were enormous.
 &HT;    Who were the outsiders, the original ones, from the early years?
They were everyone else: people from other parts of England and
from more distant places _ Scotch-Irish, Dutch, Germans, later on
Catholic Irish, then other immigrants also. (As for Indians and
blacks, they were outside even the outside, until they too gained
outsider status.)
 &HT;    The outsiders did not adhere to any one church or tradition.
They were Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans and Catholics and even
Jews, after a while. What did the outsiders believe about truth,
hypocrisy, God and man? No one thing. Each little subgroup
entertained its own ideas.
 &HT;    But when the outsiders gazed on the insiders, they shared a
single worry, which was about the smugness of the insiders. They
worried that, given the chance, the insiders would impose their own
doctrines about Sabbath laws and banning alcohol and other moral
issues. And the outsiders gathered together in a party of their
own.
 &HT;    It was the party of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson _ the
party that came to be known as the Democrats. Which had
achievements of its own. Those two blocs, the insiders and the
outsiders, have changed shape quite a few times over the centuries.
Whole ethnic groups began as outsiders and then assimilated into
the insider bloc, and new groups took their place.
 &HT;    The lines between Protestant denominations softened, and then
the lines between Protestants and Catholics _ sometimes even the
lines between Christians and Jews. The separate cultural styles of
the Republicans and Democrats grew fuzzier. Outsiders sometimes
joined the Republicans, and insiders joined the Democrats, and
everything got topsy-turvy, as happens in politics.
 &HT;    In recent years you might even have suspected that insiders and
outsiders were a thing of the past. But they are not a thing of the
past. Insiders and outsiders turn out to be permanent categories of
American life. We know that now.
 &HT;    Just look at clinton's year of scandal and controversy. To
anyone who supposes that the culture wars from the 1960s still
dominate American life, it must have seemed wonderfully strange to
watch Christian conservatives and elite liberals from Washington
and the national press revile the president in more or less the
same unforgiving terms.
 &HT;    But nothing was strange. The old insider bloc simply re-emerged,
in a suitably modern version.
 &HT;    For who are the elite liberals of today if not the modern-day
heirs of the Ivy-educated divines (granted a few ethnic shifts over
the centuries and a slide from sacred to secular)? And who are the
Christian conservatives of today if not the heirs of the pious,
back-country, straitlaced strivers from the past (granted a few
twists and turns in American Protestantism over time and the long,
slow softening of the old sectarian lines)?
 &HT;    They are people who naturally feel themselves to be, in a
telling old phrase, the ``moral majority,'' people who simply
assume, as the spiritual insiders have always assumed, that their
own ideas about man and God are America's.
 &HT;    What was it, meanwhile, that united the rest of the country
during this past year? The people who gave Clinton his unshakable
approval ratings _ what were they thinking? They were thinking no
one thing.
 &HT;    There were people who felt dismayed by Clinton, yet drew a line
between the man's personal failings and his public successes. There
were people who figured that marital stability trumps honesty, and
that lying was a sensible thing to do. There were people who
figured it was none of their business to judge Clinton's sex life,
or even to know about it.
 &HT;    Mostly there were people who gazed at the insiders, and worried
about smugness, and at how far the insiders might go in imposing
their own moral values. Who were those people? They were the
outsiders, and their behavior too was absolutely traditional.
 &HT;    The division between America's political parties is famously
hard to define, in ordinary times. We like to put the Republicans
on the right and the Democrats on the left, even though we
recognize that right and left are European labels and never really
did fit the American system. But this past year we began to glimpse
a different division _ the division that was neither right and
left, nor pro-'60s and anti-'60s, but followed instead the American
lines of spiritual insider and spiritual outsider.
 &HT;    Everyone began to notice, wide-eyed, that as Clinton sank deeper
into disgrace his party seemed to grow only stronger. The attacks
on the president's moral character brought out the old, hidden
division between insiders and outsiders.
 &HT;    And once that divide was in the open, there were people who
instinctively recognized the Democrats as the natural refuge of the
spiritual outsiders _ who flocked to the Democrats because the
party's deepest purpose suddenly became more clearly defined than
it had ever been in recent decades.
 &HT;    People will go on talking about the culture wars. But I think
that, even so, we are going to discover soon enough that, on a
national scale, the culture wars have already slipped into the
past, in favor of something infinitely deeper and more portentous.
 &HT;    For if the battle of insiders and outsiders hasn't gone away by
now, when will it go away? Today the answer, for better and for
worse, is obvious: never.

 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    In July 1995, a young man died suddenly in a California
hospital. Within hours, his wife's family was on the phone to Cappy
Rothman, a urologist at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    They asked him to meet her at the morgue to collect sperm from
her late husband's corpse. Thirty hours after his death, the man
produced the sperm that now, four years later, has resulted in his
wife's pregnancy. She is due to deliver the baby this month.
 &HT;    Assuming all goes well (she had not given birth at the time this
article was printed), she will be the first woman known to have
procreated using sperm collected after the father's death.
 &HT;    But many other people have tried. According to a 1997 survey
conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics,
14 clinics in 11 states had retrieved sperm from dead loved ones,
usually within a day after death.
 &HT;    The men, as old as 60 and as young as 15, had died in automobile
or motorcycle accidents, from lightning strikes, in construction or
farming accidents, from falls. The requests for their sperm came
from wives, girlfriends and parents.
 &HT;    In fact, retrieving sperm from the dead is now so common that
the American Society of Reproductive Medicine has developed a
protocol, ``Posthumous Reproduction,'' for dealing with it. And one
bioethicist, Timothy Murphy of the University of Illinois College
of Medicine, has coined a term for this new kind of father: the
sperminator.
 &HT;    A few years ago, a physician at an elite Midwest teaching
hospital asked me to consult on the propriety of another kind of
involuntary sperm donation. ``We have six men in comas whose wives,
girlfriends or parents want their sperm,'' he told me over the
phone, inviting me to visit. ``What do we do?''
 &HT;    As a lawyer specializing in genetic and reproductive
technologies, I am frequently called in when scientists and doctors
are proposing some strange new thing and asked to sort out the
rights and responsibilities, the liabilities and the commercial
potential.
 &HT;    This time, it seemed to me, the idea was a radical one _
procreation without permission. Should it be allowed even if a
lawyer like me could come up with a scheme to deal with it?
 &HT;    The incentives for disturbing the comatose _ or the dead _ are
high. Grieving survivors may simply want to hold on to a part of
their loved one, of course, but in addition, doctors are always
looking for new technical challenges, and the financial
opportunities for a wife who creates children after her spouse's
death can be quite compelling.
 &HT;    Edward Hart's widow, Nancy, used his previously frozen sperm to
create a daughter, Judith. She then sued the Social Security
Administration for death benefits for the little girl. The media
put pressure on the agency (``Miracle' Baby Denied Death
Benefits''). The agency agreed to pay the girl $700 a month and
similar benefits to her mother.
 &HT;    Legally, the Social Security Administration was not obligated to
support Judith. The law requires that children be compensated to
the extent that the award replaces support their father gave them
while he was alive, but this father had never supported Judith.
 &HT;    Yet the fascination with reproductive technologies, it seems,
enchanted even the stodgy Social Security Administration into
paying for their use. And Nancy Hart decided to use the benefits
awarded her as mother to enroll in South Texas College of Law to
specialize in reproductive technology law.
 &HT;    Boarding the plane for the Midwest, I thought about John
Irving's novel ``The World According to Garp,'' in which the
central character is the product of a liaison between a nurse and a
comatose patient. The nurse in that case knew exactly what she
wanted. But I was skeptical that the six women involved with this
hospital had independently come to the conclusion that they wanted
their loved one's sperm.
 &HT;    I suspected that, as with many new high-tech maneuvers, I would
find a researcher who saw a medical journal article waiting to
happen.
 &HT;    Sure enough, the urologist already had his slides prepared for
medical meetings once he got the go-ahead to do the procedure. He
proposed to collect sperm from comatose men in the same way it is
collected from paraplegic men _ through a technique called
electroejaculation.
 &HT;    An instrument that looks like a cattle prod would be inserted
into the man's rectum. An electric shock would then cause an
involuntary ejaculation. Sperm can also be collected manually,
surgically or by drug-induced convulsion.
 &HT;    The urologist went on to tell me about his ``patients.'' One was
a 25-year-old man who had been trying to father a child before a
car accident put him in a coma with a poor prognosis for recovery.
His wife wanted his sperm.
 &HT;    Another was a 40-year-old man who had sustained a severe head
injury, also in a car crash. He had a child from a previous
marriage, but none with his second wife, a woman in her mid-20s. He
had told friends that he did not want to have additional children.
The wife claimed that in the week before the man's accident he had
changed his mind.
 &HT;    While the collection of sperm from unconsenting men is novel,
there is plenty of precedent for the use of willed sperm. Although
conception by men in comas is a new wrinkle in reproductive
technology, we've had two decades of experience with posthumous
pregnancy using sperm that men have frozen before their deaths.
 &HT;    In 1977, Kim Casali, the cartoonist who drew the syndicated
``Love Is'' cartoons, became pregnant with sperm her husband,
Roberto, had frozen when he underwent treatment for cancer. After
her husband's death, Kim successfully used the sperm. The birth
announcement listed the parents as ``Kim and Roberto
(posthumously).'' Casali herself died in 1997.
 &HT;    In 1991, William Kane, a Yale-trained lawyer, froze 15 vials of
sperm specifically intending that his girlfriend, Deborah Hecht, be
inseminated after he committed suicide. Kane and Hecht chose a name
for the baby, Wyatt, and Kane wrote a letter to the unborn child:
``I have loved you in my dreams, even though I never got to see you
born. ... I'd rather end it like I lived it _ on my time, when and
where I will, and while my life is still an object of
self-sculpture _ a personal creation with which I am still proud.
In truth, death for me is not the opposite of life; it is a form of
life's punctuation.''
 &HT;    He took his life in October 1991 after bequeathing in his will
``all right, title and interests'' to his sperm to Hecht, saying
she should use it to become pregnant.
 &HT;    His two adult children by a previous marriage were not at all
thrilled with the possibility of a baby half-brother or -sister.
Even though Hecht signed a release saying that neither she nor the
resulting offspring would make an inheritance claim against the
estate, the existing children _ arguing through their
attorney-mother, Kane's ex-wife _ sued to have the sperm destroyed.
 &HT;    The children, whose parents divorced 16 years earlier,
characterized their father's desire to create children after his
death as ``egotistic and irresponsible.'' They said destroying the
sperm would ``prevent the disruption of existing families by
after-born children'' and prevent ``emotional, psychological and
financial stress on those family members already in existence.''
 &HT;    It seemed to me that, if accepted, the argument would mean that
any firstborn could sue her parents if they depleted her resources
(or future inheritance) by having another child. The judge, though,
accepted the childrens' plea and ordered the sperm destroyed.
Deborah Hecht appealed the decision _ and won.
 &HT;    The appellate court scolded the trial judge for his precipitous
decision, saying that Kane ``had an interest, in the nature of
ownership, to the extent that he had decision-making authority as
to the sperm within the scope of policy set by law.''
 &HT;    The appellate court ordered the trial judge to reconsider the
case. Since Hecht had inherited 20 percent of the estate, the judge
gave her 20 percent of the sperm _ three vials _ which she used to
no avail. She sued again, and in 1997, when she was 42, she won the
rest of the sperm.
 &HT;    As of early 1999, she was trying once more to get pregnant.
Meanwhile, William's existing children have sued her again, this
time for emotional distress.
 &HT;    Hecht was actually an easy case. William Kane clearly intended
the posthumous use of his sperm in precisely the manner in which
Deborah Hecht intended to use it. But the comatose men at the
Midwest hospital had no wills stating they wanted to have children
via electroejaculation. Nor was it likely that any had talked to
their friends about that possibility.
 &HT;    In the first case, the urologist said, there was evidence that
the 25-year-old man and his wife had been trying to have children
in the months preceding the accident. However, I had trouble
imagining that a man's wishing to have children whom he would
actually rear necessarily indicates consent to have children whom
he will never see, touch or interact with. In the second case, the
man had told people he didn't want children with his second wife at
all.
 &HT;    The law is clear that if a woman wants an abortion, her husband
can't force her to have a child. Why should she be able to force
her husband to become a father? Some men in comas do wake up, after
all. How would a man feel to learn he had become a father, through
no effort of his own, while comatose?
 &HT;    The urologist argued that doctors have been harvesting sperm
from dead men for years. California is the epicenter of dead men
procreating (or at least having the potential to do so), owing
largely to Cappy Rothman, a co-owner of the California Cryobank and
broker to the child about to be born in California.
 &HT;    Rothman has been performing the procedure since 1978, when he
retrieved sperm from an unmarried 19-year-old for the benefit of
his parents, who wanted to continue their lineage.
 &HT;    In October 1997, Rothman and I both testified in a New York
Legislature hearing where the question on the table was, Should a
dead man's sperm be used without his previous consent? Rothman
claimed there is less grief for the wife and other family members
if some of the dead man's sperm is saved.
 &HT;    He told legislators: ``In one case where a man died by gunshot
and I collected his sperm, his family followed me to the sperm bank
and were consoled by seeing motile sperm under the microscope. To
console families in that way at a time of grief and tragedy is
clearly part of my responsibility as a healer.''
 &HT;    But short-term consolation may lead to long-term psychological
or social consequences. The net effect may be simply to prolong the
grieving process. What happens to the wife who remarries and
decides to have a child? Will she feel guilty if she doesn't use
sperm from her dead husband?
 &HT;    Further, different family members grieve in different ways. As
the Kane case showed, some family members might not be pleased by
the idea of fathering from the grave. And what if the wife didn't
want to use her dead husband's sperm, but the man's parents did,
offering to hire a surrogate mother?
 &HT;    These are just some of the complicated questions raised by
posthumous procreation, many of them about family relationships,
not to mention concerns about the psychological impact on the
child. Yet doctors do not need to request permission from an ethics
committee to undertake the procedure. Physicians can make their own
ad hoc decisions about whether or not to harvest sperm and create
their own criteria for determining which requests should be
honored.
 &HT;    Rothman, for example, will not collect sperm from dead men who
have had vasectomies; he figures they clearly did not want kids.
 &HT;    Our unregulated approach contrasts greatly with the system in
England, where the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, a
government agency, passes judgment on which fertility techniques
are beyond the pale. They have nixed human cloning, creating babies
from eggs from aborted fetuses and using dead men's sperm without
their prior consent. In the United States, we have no such
deliberative body.
 &HT;    Nor does existing law provide clear guidance on when, or
whether, sperm should be retrieved after a man is incapacitated or
dead.
 &HT;    Once comatose men are turned into objects from which tissue can
be harvested by their wives, what's to keep men from arguing for
equal rights? If the wife was comatose, could her husband ask for
eggs to be retrieved? Could he argue he had a constitutional right
to impregnate her and keep her alive on a respirator for nine
months until the child could be delivered by Caesarean section?
 &HT;    Reproduction is an individual, personal matter. We cannot assume
that a man pursuing parenthood while alive would have wanted to
father children from the grave. If men do want to give wives or
other relatives a right to their sperm after their deaths, they can
fill out a donation card, as they do to donate organs.
 &HT;    After I mentioned this to my law students, several women in the
class got their husbands to give them power of attorney over their
sperm.
 &HT;    If we start down the path of procreation without permission,
where do we draw the line? Could a mortician retrieve sperm from a
dead celebrity to create souvenir babies? If a good-looking John
Doe is admitted to a hospital in a coma, can the hospital sell off
some of his sperm to pay his medical bills?
 &HT;    In 1998, a British woman, Diane Blood, gave birth to a son,
Liam, with sperm collected while her husband, now dead, was
comatose. She had to go to Belgium for the insemination, though,
since she was violating British law.
 &HT;    Collecting sperm from comatose or dead men is perilously close
to rape. Unless the man has previously consented, his sperm should
not be used to create a child. The U.S. Supreme Court is clear that
comatose individuals cannot be forced to accept life-sustaining
treatments. Neither should they be forced to contribute to
life-creating ones.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (Lori B. Andrews is a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of
Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This article is
adapted from her book, ``The Clone Age: Adventures in the New World
of Reproductive Technology,'' to be published by Henry Holt in
May.) 
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    In July 1995, a young man died suddenly in a California
hospital. Within hours, his wife's family was on the phone to Cappy
Rothman, a urologist at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    They asked him to meet her at the morgue to collect sperm from
her late husband's corpse. Thirty hours after his death, the man
produced the sperm that now, four years later, has resulted in his
wife's pregnancy. She is due to deliver the baby this month.
 &HT;    Assuming all goes well (she had not given birth at the time this
article was printed), she will be the first woman known to have
procreated using sperm collected after the father's death.
 &HT;    But many other people have tried. According to a 1997 survey
conducted by the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics,
14 clinics in 11 states had retrieved sperm from dead loved ones,
usually within a day after death.
 &HT;    The men, as old as 60 and as young as 15, had died in automobile
or motorcycle accidents, from lightning strikes, in construction or
farming accidents, from falls. The requests for their sperm came
from wives, girlfriends and parents.
 &HT;    In fact, retrieving sperm from the dead is now so common that
the American Society of Reproductive Medicine has developed a
protocol, ``Posthumous Reproduction,'' for dealing with it. And one
bioethicist, Timothy Murphy of the University of Illinois College
of Medicine, has coined a term for this new kind of father: the
sperminator.
 &HT;    A few years ago, a physician at an elite Midwest teaching
hospital asked me to consult on the propriety of another kind of
involuntary sperm donation. ``We have six men in comas whose wives,
girlfriends or parents want their sperm,'' he told me over the
phone, inviting me to visit. ``What do we do?''
 &HT;    As a lawyer specializing in genetic and reproductive
technologies, I am frequently called in when scientists and doctors
are proposing some strange new thing and asked to sort out the
rights and responsibilities, the liabilities and the commercial
potential.
 &HT;    This time, it seemed to me, the idea was a radical one _
procreation without permission. Should it be allowed even if a
lawyer like me could come up with a scheme to deal with it?
 &HT;    The incentives for disturbing the comatose _ or the dead _ are
high. Grieving survivors may simply want to hold on to a part of
their loved one, of course, but in addition, doctors are always
looking for new technical challenges, and the financial
opportunities for a wife who creates children after her spouse's
death can be quite compelling.
 &HT;    Edward Hart's widow, Nancy, used his previously frozen sperm to
create a daughter, Judith. She then sued the Social Security
Administration for death benefits for the little girl. The media

central character is the product of a liaison between a nurse and a
comatose patient. The nurse in that case knew exactly what she

 By JOHN POWERS  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    The first person pronoun has been displaced in America: I am no
longer me, I am he.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton has been known to refer to himself as The
President. Mike Tyson (who, me?) claimed that Mike Tyson chewed
Evander Holyfield's ear. Maradona said that soccer didn't
understand Maradona.
 &HT;    Even Dilbert's Dogbert said that Dogbert, henceforth, would
refer to himself as Dogbert.
 &HT;    The vertical pronoun, this reporter declares, is falling into
disuse. I has turned into he, that man over there who I used to be.
If he does well, I admire him. If he misbehaves, I disavow him. The
first person has been eclipsed by the third person in America. The
Me Decade has given way to the He Decade. I is out of step with the
way we live now. I is egotistical. I is self-centered. I is
immodest. I lacks diversity.
 &HT;    He is more dispassionate, more detached, more humble than I am.
He is greater and, when convenient, lesser than I. He gladly
accepts honors that I am reluctant to bestow upon myself. He
willingly shoulders blame for the shameful things that I do.
 &HT;    He stands apart from, and often above, me, which may be why
politicians, athletes, rock stars, cult leaders, authors, even
cartoon characters have come to prefer him to themselves. He is
whom I defer to when celebrity makes me bigger than myself.
``Dogbert does this,'' says Dilbert's canine executive, ``to
emphasize his special brand of greatness.''
 &HT;    Elvis wasn't bad, Little Richard once said, ``but Little Richard
is the king of rock 'n' roll.'' David Koresh grew to such
greatness, before he went wacko in Waco, that he made himself his
own lackey, calling himself ``David, my servant.''
 &HT;    Julius Caesar was the first to go third. At least he's the first
we know about, probably because he wrote his own history. Caesar's
Commentaries feature Caesar the historian coolly appraising Caesar
the commander. ``What Caesar thought would happen, did happen,''
Caesar writes about Caesar.
 &HT;    Caesar went a bit overboard when he progressed from proconsul to
dictator, putting Caesar's image on coins and Caesar's name on
triumphal arches. When he was murdered by senators who had tired of
his third-person egomania, Caesar's final word was Caesar: ``Et tu,
Brute? Then fall, Caesar.''
 &HT;    When I grow too big for me, he is the only recourse left. That's
what Bob Dole realized when he ran for president in 1996. When Dole
was a simple senator from Kansas, he still could be I. Kansas is a
flat state with few echoes and more corncobs than people, a place
where a man rarely needs to stand apart from himself.
 &HT;    But when Dole began jetting around the Republic, seeing his face
a hundred feet high on billboards and hearing his name
reverberating across news cycles _ BobDole BobDole BobDole _ he
concluded that he had evolved into Him. Dole managed to stand apart
from himself so completely that when he went back home, or so his
American Express ad says, folks at the diner wanted to see some ID.
 &HT;    Had Dole been elected, of course, he could have referred to
himself as The President, as Richard Nixon, George Bush, and Gerald
Ford did. That's the formal, ex officio version of third
personhood. It's respectful of the office, and it indicates that
the chief executive considers himself merely another citizen, just
as the Constitution tells us he should. Even the president doesn't
get to refer to The President as I.
 &HT;    Protocol dictates as much. The official White House daily diary
never mentions a man named Bill Clinton. It's: The President had
breakfast. ... The President held a photo opportunity on the lawn.
... The President received a personal delivery from the pizza girl.
 &HT;    That's why Nixon never used I when he was wearing his
presidential wingtips and speaking for posterity. ``The President
made this decision himself,'' Nixon said about the man who bombed
Hanoi. Nor did he call his autobiography My Life. He called it
``The Memoirs of Richard Nixon.'' He wasn't The President anymore,
after all.
 &HT;    Ex officio third personhood is simply a practical acknowledgment
that any president, like his predecessors and successors, is a
transient. It would be confusing (and a grammatical nuisance) to
have I mean Richard Nixon, then The President for a quadrennium or
two, then Richard Nixon again.
 &HT;    On a more local scene, for a time, while he bestrode Boston's
City Hall like a colossus, Mayor Kevin White sent aloof memorandums
to the City Council which that began: ``I desire to provide
compensation to ...'' But that annoyed the councilors, who grumbled
that the mayor was using the words of a king.
 &HT;    So White shelved the vertical pronoun and began referring to
himself as The Mayah and, after he left office, as Kevin White.
``It was an accepted fact that Kevin White was powerful,'' he told
an interviewer, ``and nothing happened without his approval.''
 &HT;    The third person is not only more impersonal but also more
polite. That's why Miss Manners, the nation's mistress of
etiquette, scrupulously refers to herself as Miss Manners. That's
why Wade Boggs (perhaps not coincidentally, a third baseman) rarely
said I-me-my. ``My father always told me not to be a braggart, not
to say I, I, I,'' he said.
 &HT;    The first person attracts attention; the third person deflects
it. ``Look at me!'' demurely becomes ``Look at him!'' Muhammad Ali,
who once composed a two-word ode-to-self (``Me./Whee!''), irked
much of the citizenry during his ``I am the greatest'' phase. But
once he began referring to himself as Ali, he became a planetary
good-will ambassador.
 &HT;    Oscar Robertson, who was such a gifted basketball player that he
was known in the '60s by his first name only, never felt
comfortable evaluating himself directly until he evolved from first
to third. ``I never said how great I was or told anyone I could do
this or that,'' Robertson wrote in a recent advertising feature.
``I will say, however, that no one could play the game of
basketball any better than Oscar Robertson.''
 &HT;    But the third person is at his most useful when he serves as
whipping boy for the first person, when he provides distance and
deniability. I didn't lose 31 states to the Arkansas adulterer. Bob
Dole did. I didn't cover up the Watergate break-in. The President
did. I didn't have sex with groupies on Boston Red Sox road trips.
Wade Boggs, that randy single-slapping ballplayer, did.
 &HT;    I'm not him except when I get me in trouble. That person who
behaved so abominably at last night's cocktail party wasn't me, a
morning-after F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote to his hostess. It was
another man who is often mistaken for me.
 &HT;    Everyone wants to separate his ego from his alter ego, his
better half from his worse. ``I was the first that could thus plod
in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a
moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring
headlong into the sea of liberty,'' the upright Henry Jekyll mused
about drugging himself into the sinister Edward Hyde. ``It was
Hyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.''
 &HT;    There are legal advantages, of course, to separating the first
person from the third, which is why the government allows us to
form corporations in our own names. If G.J. Caesar loses his nest
egg on his bottled salad-dressing business, his possessions are
sold at a yard sale and he is hauled off to debtor's prison. But if
G.J. Caesar Inc. goes Chapter 11, Caesar still gets to keep his
hillside mansion in Latium, his Maserati, and his closetful of
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    Third personhood works, too, for the author who finds himself a
character in his own book and isn't sure how to explicate himself
dispassionately. So he sings a Song of Himself.
 &HT;    ``Still, Mailer had a complex mind of sorts,'' Norman Mailer
wrote in ``The Armies of the Night,'' where he appeared both as the
Participant and the Novelist. ``Like a later generation which was
to burn holes in their brain on Speed, he had given his own head
the texture of a fine Swiss cheese.''
 &HT;    John Updike created a third person named Henry Bech and, after
several sequels, wasn't sure what to do with him. ``For some years
now, Bech had felt his author wanting to set him aside, to get him
off the desk forever,'' Bech wrote about Updike writing about Bech.
 &HT;    The problem with He, of course, is that he won't stay him. He
reverts to Me at the most embarrassing moments. The good Jekyll
could not prevent the evil Hyde from spilling over. The Great Oz
could only boom and bellow for so long (``Pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain'') before he was exposed as the bumbling
Professor Marvel, premier balloonist par excellence of the Miracle
Wonderland Carnival Company.
 &HT;    Eventually, fake IDs get confiscated by the doorman, and split
personalities end up on the psychiatrist's couch. Popeye had it
down: ``I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam.'' Much as we
would like to stand apart from ourselves, we are, like our nation,
indivisible.
 &HT;    I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together,
wrote John Lennon. As the saying goes: The first shall be third and
the third first.

AN ACTOR'S ACTOR TAKES A BOW

  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

Hoffman at the American Film Institute salute to him, as well as a
black-and-white photo of Hoffman in ``Midnight Cowboy'' and a color
slide of Hoffman being embraced by Jack Nicholson at the AFI
ceremony. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It all started for Dustin Hoffman with a single word:
 &HT;    ``Plastics.''
 &HT;    Plastics have done pretty well in the intervening 32 years, but
since that memorable line from ``The Graduate'' (1967), Hoffman has
done even better.
 &HT;    So well, in fact, that the 61-year-old Hoffman this year joined
film legends such as Elizabeth Taylor, Orson Welles, John Wayne and
John Huston as a recipient of the American Film Institute's
prestigious Life Achievement Award. ABC will air an edited version
of the big night on April 22.
 &HT;    The award is well deserved. It is difficult to think of another
actor who so well articulates the complicated, angst-ridden,
ego-driven, urban man of the late 20th century. Hoffman didn't
invent the antihero, but he certainly refocused him for our times.
 &HT;    ``His versatility, range and uncanny ability to embody the
characters he plays have amazed audiences across the globe since
his arrival on the scene more than 30 years ago,'' AFI board
chairman Tom Pollock says. ``Time and again he has displayed
seemingly limitless talents by taking on roles that are more
challenging and distinct than the last.''
 &HT;    The son of a West Los Angeles furniture salesman, the future
actor grew up as the younger brother of a good-looking, athletic A
student.
 &HT;    ``The first time I saw `Death of a Salesman,''' Hoffman jokes,
``I thought they were invading my family's privacy.''
 &HT;    At one time planning to be a concert pianist, at l9 he dropped
out of Santa Monica City College in Santa Monica, Calif., to study
at the renowned Pasadena Playhouse. This in turn led to the
traditional pilgrimage to New York, where he paid the rent with
jobs in a mental hospital, as a waiter, as a dishwasher and even as
a janitor.
 &HT;    As it turned out, it was a minor 1960s comedy, ``Eh,'' that
changed his fortunes forever. Director Mike Nichols happened to see
the play one night at the Circle in the Square theater, and
remembered Hoffman when he was casting ``The Graduate.'' A screen
test won him the title role.
 &HT;    Ironically, the part originally had been written for a blond
WASP. Robert Redford had turned down the part.
 &HT;    ``I had pimples, a big nose, braces just off my teeth,'' Hoffman
says, laughing. ``Everyone else looked like Tab Hunter.''
 &HT;    As Hoffman's fame grew, so did his reputation as a
sometimes-obsessive perfectionist, a reputation that launched a
thousand anecdotes.
 &HT;    Hoffman and Sydney Pollack, who directed him in ``Tootsie''
(l982), didn't speak for many years after completing the film.
 &HT;    On ``Marathon Man'' (l976), Hoffman's passion to get it right
infuriated Laurence Olivier, elderly, ailing and impatient with
long strings of retakes. When Hoffman told Olivier that he had
stayed up for three nights to internalize the weariness of the
marathon runner, the English actor offered a withering response:
``Why don't you just try acting, dear boy?''
 &HT;    Others have been slightly more charitable.
 &HT;    ``He can't distinguish between a pimple and a tumor,'' says
Arthur Penn, who directed Hoffman _ under pounds of plastic makeup
_ as an ages-old survivor of Little Big Horn in ``Little Big Man''
(l970). ``He has the kind of meticulousness that doesn't settle
for, `OK, let's get it in the can.' He's wonderful and he's
exhausting.''
 &HT;    ``I'm no more or less difficult than any actor with power,''
Hoffman insists. ``I've never yelled on a set. But making a picture
gets tense. It's like an arranged marriage.''
 &HT;    At the AFI banquet, surrounded by past co-stars such as Warren
Beatty, Jon Voight and Jessica Lange, Hoffman was more apologetic.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry that I hurt the few people that I have,'' he said.
``I did it only in search for an authenticity of my own work.''
 &HT;    Few can argue with the results. Hoffman got his first Oscar
nomination for ``The Graduate,'' and picked up the statuette for
``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (l979) and again for ``Rain Man'' (l988) _
with nominations as ``Ratso'' Rizzo in ``Midnight Cowboy'' (l969),
as the self-destructive Lenny Bruce in ``Lenny'' (l974) and, of
course, as the actor disguised as an actress in ``Tootsie'' (l982).
More recently he was nominated for his role as a producer _ based
on the real-life Robert Evans _ in ``Wag the Dog'' (1997)
 &HT;    Even when the films are less than successful _ ``Ishtar''
(l987), ``Hook'' (l991) and ``American Buffalo'' (l996) come to
mind _ Hoffman's performances leave an indelible impression.
 &HT;    Now he is branching out into other areas. Along with Jay Cohen,
his partner in Punch Productions, he recently produced two films,
Showtime's teen-age Holocaust drama ``The Devil's Arithmetic'' and
the current independent film ``A Walk on the Moon,'' starring Viggo
Mortensen and directed by actor Tony Goldwyn.
 &HT;    Hoffman looks a decade younger than his 61 years, trim and
tanned from his compulsively competitive tennis games, his gray
hair cut in a youthful semi-buzz. He wears the de-rigeur Hollywood
uniform _ a black T-shirt, worn under a casual suit and tiny,
metal-framed glasses.
 &HT;    His role as father to four children _ Max, Rebecca, Jacob and
Alexandra, ages ll to l8 _ with his second wife, Lisa, and two
grown children from his first marriage makes him worry about the
violence that's all but omnipresent in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I saw in The New York Times the other day, on the 10th page in
a very small paragraph, that some kid killed his mother, his
father, his brother and sisters. And it was given this much
space,'' he says, holding his fingers an inch apart.
 &HT;    ``That's real violence,'' he says. ``And, my God, what we've
done to our children. Now they won't go to see a movie that has
less than 30 slaughters in it. They're inured to violence.''
 &HT;    Hoffman's no sideline-sitting curmudgeon, however. Recently in
the headlines for a $3 million lawsuit win over Los Angeles
Magazine for illegally using his ``Tootsie'' image in an
advertising-based fashion spread, he's also acting as much as ever.
He recently returned from Europe, where he filmed a role in a new,
big-screen version of ``Joan of Arc'' for French director Luc
Besson.
 &HT;    The role? The Grand Inquisitor, of course. Dustin Hoffman
wouldn't settle for less. And neither would his fans.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Goodbye Lover'' is a would-be noir comedy that,
despite trying strenuously, never churns up a convincingly
fatalistic noir atmosphere. Except in its attempts at humor, which
were doomed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Roland Joffe, whose sanctimony-charged
filmography includes the studiedly mirthless ``City of Joy,'' ``Fat
Man and Little Boy,'' ``The Mission'' and ``The Killing Fields.''
The English filmmaker's only certifiable laugh riot was the Demi
Moore travesty of ``The Scarlet Letter''; of course, none of the
humor in that one was intentional. It's a true challenge to think
of any director less temperamentally suitable for a wicked black
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes in ``Goodbye Lover's'' screenplay, written by Ron Peer
and two guys who contributed something to ``Toy Story,'' Joel Cohen
and Alec Sokolow, are abundant, but they're too lazy to be funny.
Typical example: In the few shots when her mouth isn't stuffed with
food (and sometimes when it is), Ellen DeGeneres' detective Pompano
says cynical things like ``I don't trust anybody over 10 who
listens to `The Sound of Music.'''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of many stupid references to the beloved Alpine
musical meant, presumably, to provide ironic counterpoint. It's the
favored soundtrack of otherwise amoral vamp Sandra Dunmore
(Patricia Arquette), a pixie-cut blond real estate agent with a
monster dress-for-success fetish. Early on, we see her in a church
organ alcove seducing Ben (Don Johnson, in the film's only credible
performance _ a fact that pretty much tells you all you need to
know). We later learn that Ben is a hot shot PR spinner, that his
dissolute alcoholic brother Jake (Dermot Mulroney) works at the
same firm, and that sultry Sandra is Jake's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The studio has requested that we not reveal any of the film's
plot twists, which is good news for anybody reading this who does
not wish to be bored. Suffice it to say that every ``surprise'' is
both predictable and hard to swallow. The basic scheme is a
sub-``Double Indemnity'' murder-insurance scam. And it soon becomes
numbingly obvious that just about everybody we meet is plotting
against everyone else, including Pompano and a deceptively mousey
Dunmore co-worker played by Mary-Louise Parker.
</P>
<P>
   A common complaint about movies like ``Goodbye Lover'' is that
all of the characters are too unlikable for audiences to have
anyone to root for. That's rarely really true, since the more
troubled or troublesome a character is, the more interesting he or
she usually is to watch.
</P>
<P>
   It's when they're not interesting, as is the case with all of
``Goodbye Lover's'' denizens, that their nastiness seems worse than
it actually is. The folks in this movie may plot to kiss and kill
with abandon, but their greater crime is making us sit through
their dull-witted affairs. &QL;

`OPEN YOUR EYES': A HEAD TRIP WORTH TAKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything we see in the riveting Spanish
psychological thriller ``Open Your Eyes'' comes through the eyes of
a man locked inside a mental institution. His name is Cesar
(Eduardo Noriega), and he's imprisoned because he killed somebody.
Cesar doesn't remember committing the crime, but then his memory
has been playing tricks on him. He doesn't know what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you. Writer-director Alejandro Amenabar has fashioned a
marvelously complex movie that moves in and out of reality with
such verve and intelligence that it keeps its audience guessing
right up until the provocative conclusion. An inherent sense of
logic makes ``Open Your Eyes'' a rarity among movies that deal with
alternate points of view. This is one head trip you can actually
buy into, unlike, say, the spectacularly filmed mumbo-jumbo of
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Your Eyes'' opens with Cesar waking up (or is he?),
getting dressed and heading out to the streets of Madrid, which are
incongruously devoid of life. (Or are they?) Cesar then wakes up
and realizes he has been dreaming. (Maybe.)
</P>
<P>
   Cesar is one of those spectacular specimens who gets by in life
on his pretty face and facile charm. At a party celebrating his
25th birthday, he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and believes he may
finally have met a woman worthy of his attention. Problem is,
Cesar's current girlfriend, Nuria (Najwa Nimri), is still in the
picture and inclined toward obsessive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nuria begs Cesar for another chance, appealing to his
considerable ego. Cesar relents and hops in her car, which she
proceeds to drive into a brick wall, killing herself and horribly
disfiguring Cesar's face.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the setup. The film initially appears to be heading
into familiar territory, with Cesar coping with his deformities and
wounded pride. But then fantasy and reality begin to blend
seamlessly together. Cesar wonders why he's in a psychiatric
prison, accused of murder. He also doesn't understand why he
remembers having his face cosmetically repaired and, yet, here he
is, wearing a rubber mask while talking to a prison psychiatrist
(Chete Lera).
</P>
<P>
   Another stumper: the various recollections of a cryogenics
infomercial and its elderly actor spokesman. Are all these things
part of a dream, or are they real, or has Cesar, as the
psychiatrist suspects, gone completely mad?
</P>
<P>
   Amenabar, whose previous film ``Tesis'' won seven Goya Awards
(the Spanish equivalent of the Oscar), successfully keeps his
audience thinking, constantly upending expectations and appearances
in surprising and fantastic ways. Amenabar doesn't use special
effects as a crutch; he's a sufficiently skilled filmmaker to be
able to employ camera angles and lighting to convey Cesar's
shifting reality. It's superb work, as is Hans Burmann's haunting
cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are quite good, too. Noriega, playing Cesar in
three different mental states _ ladies' man, fearful paranoid and
deformed victim _ displays an impressive range, and the beautiful
Cruz (``The Hi-Lo Country,'' ``Belle Epoque'') continues to reveal
an emotional expressiveness that labels her as an actress to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Your Eyes'' was a box-office sensation in Spain two years
ago. Tom Cruise's production company, Cruise-Wagner, has bought the
English-language rights to the movie, but don't wait until
Hollywood remakes it. (That's rarely a good idea, anyway.) This is
one movie that demands immediate attention. &QL;

 For release: Thurs., April 15 or thereafter  
 By GERALDINE A. FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When I was first elected to Congress in 1978, a Washington
insider drew me aside and said to me, ``If you want a loyal friend
in D.C., buy a dog.''
 &HT;    I was reminded of that advice recently as I watched former White
House senior adviser George Stephanopoulos sweetly swing a $2
million hatchet at his former boss on national television to hype
his book. I think of it every time I read a column by former
Clinton pollster Dick Morris or see him pontificating on
television.
 &HT;    Not that this is anything new. Do you remember David Stockman?
In 1980 he evolved overnight from a junior member of Congress into
President Reagan's chief budget maven. For four years he skillfully
maneuvered Reagan's budgets through Congress.
 &HT;    Then Stockman left the White House, pocketed his own $2 million
and wrote a book telling us that Reaganomics was a lot of smoke and
mirrors put over on the unsuspecting president. Not only did he
reveal that the Reagan budget was a charade _ no news to some of us
_ but in doing so he belittled his former boss.
 &HT;    Fast forward to the Clinton administration. Morris _ who will
probably go down in history as the only White House power broker
who ever had to pay for sex _ is forced out in disgrace, writes a
tell-all book, lands a newspaper column and starts ripping Bill and
Hillary Clinton.
 &HT;    Why is he so angry with them? Unlike former altar boy
Stephanopoulos, he can't even pretend to be offended by the
seaminess of the past few years. After all, Morris himself raised _
or lowered _ smarminess to a whole new level.
 &HT;    And speaking of curious George, who was it who made him into the
national pundit, professor and possible future political candidate
that he is? And is it irrational to ask if he owes any gratitude
for his remarkably swift ascension to power?
 &HT;    In 1991, Stephanopoulos was a nice, young, energetic
Congressional staffer with a minimum of experience, drawing a
not-very-large salary on Capitol Hill. If the Clintons hadn't
brought him into their White House, he'd probably still be on the
Hill, a nice, not-quite-as-young staffer with, perhaps, an extra
zero or so on his salary.
 &HT;    And their reward for making possible his national-level career
is the widespread airing of their private affairs in the interest
of enriching Stephanopoulos himself.
 &HT;    Now, understand me, I have no problem with people making money
selling books. I've done it myself.
 &HT;    I don't even have a problem with people making money selling
books about their former bosses. I haven't read Monica Lewinsky's
book, for example, and I doubt I ever will _ but I think she's
entitled to write it and, if she can, make a fortune selling it.
Some may think her disloyal for revealing secrets about her affair
with the president, but I don't.
 &HT;    She doesn't owe him any loyalty, unlike Morris and
Stephanopoulos, who were given their positions of power with the
implicit _ for that matter, probably explicit _ understanding that
they would be trustworthy.
 &HT;    An example of someone who appreciates that understanding is
Henry Kissinger, who's recently published the last in a trilogy
about his years in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
 &HT;    I'm not a Kissinger fan, but watching him promote his book I was
struck by the contrast between him and the Clinton refugees. It's
more than age _ it's class. Kissinger will make money from his
book, but that's not his sole goal _ he obviously wants to leave a
record for history. It's a story only he could tell, and it's no
less important because he waited 25 years to tell it.
 &HT;    Why did he wait so long? It seems to me that it was out of
respect for Nixon, Ford and his colleagues of that day. Today
Kissinger's memoir stands as history _ in 1989, let alone 1979 or
earlier, it would have been politics.
 &HT;    It's an important distinction. Today's public officials live in
a peculiarly insular world. We hire strangers who seem absolutely
devoted to us to run our political campaigns. If we lose they
disappear like magic the minute the polls close, which can be
devastating to a candidate.
 &HT;    But if we win they become our buddies, part of our ``inner
circle.'' We take them into our confidence, figuring that if they
were smart enough to get us elected, they must be smart enough to
advise us in doing the political things that will get us reelected.
 &HT;    We trust these strangers-turned-confidential-advisers, telling
them personal details that we would ordinarily reserve for family
or old friends, because the latter might not understand the
political ramifications of our situations the way our advisers do.
 &HT;    In return for our treating them like friends, we expect them to
become friends. In a word, we expect loyalty.
 &HT;    In order to function effectively, office holders need people to
bounce ideas off of. In return, staffers have to know how to keep
confidences. No excuse short of a subpoena makes it OK to betray a
trust.
 &HT;    They say you can't buy loyalty. I agree _ but, going by the
antics of some of these guys, you sure can sell it!
 &HT;    (Geraldine A. Ferraro, a former congresswoman and the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984, is a Manhattan-based
attorney.)

J. BRIAN ATWOOD: A VETERAN OF POLITICAL BATTLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the top floor of the new Ronald Reagan Federal
Office Building, narrow white corridors lead to a warren of
windowless rooms that are part of the nerve center of the US
government's Kosovo refugee relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   From here, questions from the upper levels of policy-making are
asked of assessment teams in Macedonia and Albania. Rumors are
checked, priorities adjusted. The rooms are crowded with
representatives of the military, the Department of State, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, even the US Forest Service, by
virtue of the logistics expertise it has amassed fighting fires.
</P>
<P>
   All fall silent as J. Brian Atwood, director of the US Agency
for International Development, whom President Clinton has put in
charge of the relief effort, starts a teleconference with Kim
Maynard, a former Forest Service smoke jumper who has just become
her country's front-line relief leader in Macedonia. She gives him
worrisome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is ready to go'' away from the refugee camps ``and will
take its equipment with it,'' Maynard tells Atwood. ``UNHCR in
particular, and the WFP are lacking in leadership,'' she adds,
referring to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and
the World Food Program. ``I don't see them stepping up to the
plate'' to keep the camps running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   During the private conference Friday, Atwood swiftly dispatches
an assistant to consult with the National Security Council on the
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logistics nightmare, but it's always difficult to make
sure one hand knows what the other is doing,'' says Atwood, a
Wareham native who previously worked on American relief efforts to
Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti. ``These are really tough times
now, because everyone is second-guessing the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other aspects of the US effort _ flying in millions of
meals, arranging an emergency evacuation, hiring bakers on the
scene _ the stated purpose of keeping NATO in the camps is
humanitarian. But enormous political stakes are riding on all these
steps.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their attack on Serb forces, NATO members
seemed surprised, even staggered, by the swiftness and
effectiveness of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's response
to attack. By starting a tidal wave of Albanian refugees toward
Macedonia and Albania, Milosevic threatened the stability of those
countries and conjured up the specter of a rapid spread of ethnic
violence that could jeopardize NATO's ability to operate in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no calculation,'' Atwood said in an interview,
referring to the rapidly constructed plan to move more than 100,000
Albanian Kosovars to temporary camps in Germany, Turkey, the United
States, and other countries. ``Suddenly, there were 100,000,
120,000'' refugees ``in no-man's land and the Macedonian government
said `we're not taking any more.' You could understand why: A
majority in Macedonia supports the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the government knew it would be rough, but no one
thought it would be complete ethnic cleansing,'' he said. ``We were
not prepared for that, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Atwood is the picture of a Washington functionary,
immaculately suited and coiffed, standing behind the president at
press conferences, escorting the first lady on visits to relief
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the operations center, and in interviews about his 30 years
in foreign affairs _ as a State Department official, as a foreign
affairs adviser to Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, and as dean
of professional services at the Foreign Service Institute _ he is
candid about his own ups and downs, and those of American policy.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, 56, characterizes himself as a lower-middle-class kid
from a lower-middle-class town whose parents ``never went to
college but had the guts to send me overseas, to Luxembourg,
through an American Field Services program, when I was a junior in
high school. It opened my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg in 1959 was still suffering physically and
psychologically from the devastation of World War II. Atwood's peer
in his host family harbored extreme feelings against Germans;
Atwood had pride in how America had behaved, during the war and
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one day, my AFS brother said to me: `You Americans are
just like the Russians. You want to dominate us,' '' Atwood
recalled. ``I was shocked. I didn't cry in front of him, but I went
to my room and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience had a profound effect on the future director of
American aid programs. ``It caused me to really do a lot of
thinking about my country, about what it means to be sensitive,''
Atwood said. ``It has caused me every day for the rest of my life
to think about the image of our country abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   On finishing Wareham High School, he entered Boston University
on a football scholarship _ the only way the 6-foot, 2-inch,
200-pounder says he could afford college _ earned a degree in
political science and government, and signed on with the National
Security Agency, where he worked for a year before joining the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed serving as a junior officer in the Ivory Coast and
Spain, but he was repelled by a chewing-out administered to him and
several hundred other young officers for signing a letter
questioning US policy in Vietnam. So when Atwood got an offer to
become foreign policy adviser to Eagleton, a young Democratic
senator he had met in Madrid, he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood returned to government when Jimmy Carter was elected
president, serving as the State Department's deputy assistant
secretary, then assistant secretary, for congressional relations.
Because of a quirk in the Civil Service Reform Act, he was able to
regain career diplomat status when Carter was defeated, and became
dean of professional studies at the Foreign Service Institute.
</P>
<P>
   During the long Democratic drought of the 1980s and early 1990s,
he worked briefly in the private sector, then for the Democrats'
Senate campaign committee and the Democratic National Institute,
which promotes democracy abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton was elected president, Atwood was asked to
head his State Department transition team. ``It was like a dream,''
he said, and dream he did _ of being deputy secretary, or
undersecretary for political affairs. But both jobs went to others.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Secretary of State Warren M. ``Christopher asked me what
else I wanted and I said `AID,' '' Atwood recalled. ``But he said
the White House wanted a woman or a minority, and that I should
take undersecretary for management. So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As luck had it, competing forces within the administration
deadlocked on the AID appointment, and a few weeks later Atwood had
the job. ``I was undersecretary for management for five weeks,'' he
said, ``which is as long as I'd recommend anybody take it. Nobody's
going to manage the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of insouciance and political seasoning managed to make
him friends among some Republicans _ but not foes of foreign aid
such as Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and not Christopher.
They teamed up in 1995 in an almost-successful attempt to fold the
AID budget into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian was under fire from State and Congress at the same time,
and he succeeded in doing something very important _ keeping AID
out of the State Department,'' said Andrew S. Natsios, a top AID
official under President George Bush who now is Massachusetts'
secretary of administration and finance. Natsios shares Atwood's
view that the separate agency keeps American investing in
longer-term outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios says that, despite Atwood's long Democractic
affiliation, ``he is more centrist than ideological. He supports
the Clinton positions'' on hot-button issues such as population
control policy, ``but he has enough sense to realize that
Republicans are in power in Congress, and he does not pour salt on
the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Such realpolitik may hold Atwood in good stead now, with his
nomination to be US ambassador to Brazil pending before the
Helms-chaired Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``We disagreed on
the reorganization, but I have a letter from him saying he'll
always hold me in `affectionate respect,''' Atwood says. ``I hope
that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the two hours a day he is studying Portuguese will
not got to waste, he says, since he has always wanted to know what
the Cape Verdeans back in Wareham are saying.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Three weeks of war have turned much of the allied plans
and diplomacy into what Secretary of State Madeleine Albright calls
``OBE _ Overtaken By Events.''
 &HT;    The Rambouillet agreement, which the Albanian Kosovars signed
reluctantly and which the powers set out to bomb Serbia's Slobodan
Milosevic into accepting, will no longer do.
 &HT;    It provided for disarming the Kosovar Liberation Army (KLA),
leaving some 5,000 Serb military in the province and Serbian
control of its frontiers. For NATO to accept that now, even if
Milosevic allows some kind of international protection force for
Kosovar civilians, would be to grant him victory.
 &HT;    But it isn't clear what NATO will consider adequate concessions
to stop its attacks. The momentum of the war has imposed some
questions which didn't have to be addressed before.
 &HT;    The KLA has not been defeated, according to NATO briefers and
French Defense Minister Alain Richard, who says they have withdrawn
into the mountains. Their supply lines run across the Albanian
border, the obvious reason for Serbian action in the area.
 &HT;    Because of the vast number of refugees and the virtual absence
of Albanian military or police organization in the area, NATO is
sending 6,000 troops into northern Albania. Their job is
humanitarian, not combat, but now they become responsible for the
border too.
 &HT;    They can try to block the passage of military supplies and
volunteers, which would make them in effect local allies of the
Serbian forces. They can help with the difficult logistics which
would put them on the KLA side.
 &HT;    Or they can pretend not to notice. ``This is a political
decision which NATO hasn't taken yet,'' Richard told a press group
in Paris this week.
 &HT;    It is another example of the way facts on the ground change the
context of seemingly theoretical issues argued out by diplomats,
and reshape the questions they must face. Until now, there was
allied consensus not to recognize the Kosovar demand for
independence, not to support the KLA, not to open any questions of
sovereignty and borders.
 &HT;    But willy-nilly, the allies are being drawn into dealing with
the KLA, who can provide the only on-the-ground intelligence at
this point. They are an assorted group who have been described as
former Marxist fanatics, thugs and adamant nationalists, but the
war is bringing them a flow of patriotic recruits, both from within
the country and from the substantial Kosovar population abroad.
 &HT;    What kind of leadership will emerge if and when the fighting
stops is quite unclear. Unfortunately, it probably can't be the
widely admired, moderate leader, Ibrahim Rugova. He is the pacifist
who prevented open violence for so long, but by now Milosevic has
isolated and tainted him with non-resistance.
 &HT;    The arguments for seeking a way to back out of this increasingly
irrational trap deserve a hearing. A well-informed Yugoslav friend
of mine, a longtime bitter critic of Milosevic, notes that the
bombing was started with two objectives. One was to protect the
Kosovars against an increasing offensive and the other to
destabilize and if possible bring down Milosevic. What it has
achieved so far is the vast refugee catastrophe and a surge of
national ardor for Milosevic.
 &HT;    It is a measure of how instinctively that emotion rises that it
quite dominates the minds of many Serbian expatriates in France.
Unlike their compatriots, they have as full access to all the TV
images, the reports, the horror stories as the rest of us. But they
believe, as Belgrade propounds, that it's all a vicious anti-Serb
plot.
 &HT;    My friend calls for another diplomatic initiative _ relying on
the Russians as intermediaries _ as the only way out. But providing
what? There is no answer because the middle ground, the respectful
compromise which Rambouillet tried to conjure up, has been lost.
The alternatives _ a major land invasion or, short of that, an
intensive arm-and-train program for the KLA _ have been proposed
and so far rejected as politically unacceptable. In any case, it
would take a few months for either one to begin to have effect and
what's to be done in the meantime?
 &HT;    Just keep bombing, President Clinton says, and so far all the
allies agree. The United States, providing the bulk of the force
and the weight of decision-making, is increasingly blamed for the
problems. There is a curious reaction in France where a very large
majority support NATO bombing, according to polls, and at the same
time express anti-American views. This attitude may well spread.
 &HT;    It is painful and frustrating to be in a position of waiting to
be ``OBE'' because acceptable answers to the current dilemma aren't
available and events are changing the questions _ what is to become
of the people? what is the fate of the land?
 &HT;    But it is better to hold out temporarily, for now, than to
plunge into dramatic escalation through impatience or to slink away
in defeat, which would be unconscionable.

`DIVAS LIVE' STARS FORGET TO SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DIVAS LIVE 
Starring: Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, Brandy, Cher 
On: VH1 
Time: Tuesday night 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, VH1 had a clever idea. The inventive cable channel
decided to throw together a few ``divas'' _ women with big voices
and big attitudes _ for a night of singing, saluting, and
strutting. The secret hope was that while the divas paid air-kissy
homage to one another on stage, audiences would detect competitive
and catty dynamics playing beneath the surface. And indeed, the
concept was compelling enough to make the first ``Divas Live'' into
VH1's highest-rated program ever, spawning a video and a CD that
sold 3 million copies. Since then, VH1 has shamelessly used repeats
of the concert, which featured queen diva Aretha Franklin and
ladies in waiting Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan, and
Shania Twain, to wallpaper its weekly schedules.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that VH1 doesn't spend the next year rerunning
the second ``Divas Live,'' which aired live from New York on
Tuesday night. The event, which featured Tina Turner, Cher, Whitney
Houston, and Brandy, was flat, self-conscious, and forced, with
about as much musical excellence as a Budweiser commercial. Despite
the star power of the participants, there were almost no memorable
diva interactions or mind-blowing vocal moments. One of the only
ecstatic points came early in the night, when Turner teamed with
honorary diva Elton John for a fast and loose version of ``The
Bitch Is Back,'' with Turner moving in such a happy frenzy that she
missed a few of her cues. But mostly the 2 1/2-hour show was a
series of disappointing performances, with the nadir arriving
during Cher's brief set, when the self-labeled ``Lazarus of pop
music'' followed up her insipid ``If I Could Turn Back Time'' by
lip-synching her comeback hit, ``Believe.'' Cher was carefully put
together, of course, a vision of black leather and preternaturally
shiny black hair, but apparently she was saving her vocal cords for
a more important appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with ``Divas Live '99'' was in the selection
of participants. Each of the chosen divas has persona to spare, and
the cameras made the most of Turner's famous legs and Cher's
infamous costuming. But none of these women seemed to be at her
vocal peak, which may be why powerhouse singer LeAnn Rimes was on
hand to belt out a few songs. Turner, who keeps her physical energy
high, finesses most of her singing these days and seemed to be
having a hard time catching her breath after her duet with John.
Houston, who also has an electric presence, sounded raw and spotty,
although she did manage some nice vocal flourishes on ``I Will
Always Love You.'' Chaka Khan, who joined Houston for ``I'm Every
Woman,'' was painfully rough, and Brandy sang with a whispery
soulfulness that was decidedly not diva-esque.
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that VH1 gave the night the sort rushed,
overstaged feel of those countless TV awards shows. As if this were
the Grammys, the camera kept returning to the audience, to the
faces of unexpected people like Martha Stewart, Hugh Grant, Donald
Trump, Donnatella Versace, Lorraine Bracco, and _ huh? _ Susan
Lucci. The floor of the Beacon Theater stage was a checkerboard of
distracting blinking lights, and the camera moves, particularly
during Turner's opening set, were dizzying. If the divas were going
to dazzle, they had plenty of glitz to overcome first.
</P>
<P>
   The night began with a filmed parody of last year's show, with
``Saturday Night Live'' players Cheri Oteri, Molly Shannon, and Ana
Gasteyer doing over-the-top imitations of Carey, Twain, and Dion.
It was a sharp goof on diva stereotypes that was more entertaining
than the concert itself. Wisely, VH1 has announced that this year
will be the last diva-thon.

<TEXT>
<P>
   America has always been about big: a big land of big dreams run
by bigshots with big money. Fueled in part by a booming economy,
consumers are taking their cues from fast-food chains and demanding
their lifestyles be super-sized.
</P>
<P>
   From homes and furniture to cars, food, and clothes, big is not
only better, it's big-time.
</P>
<P>
   But now, as bulldozers crush suburban homes to make way for
mansions, and rec-room floors strain under the weight of
movie-screen-sized TVs, many observers are wondering whether the
big-bigger-biggest phenomenon is about the country's economic
confidence or personal insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   After all, is driving really easier behind the wheel of a
behemoth? And does pasta really taste better by the bucketload?
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to status and power anxiety, average Americans are
finding and surrounding themselves with symbols of power in his own
lifestyle,'' said Northeastern University sociologist Jack Levin.
</P>
<P>
   One possible cause of the anxiety, Levin and other specialists
suggest, is the stock market: High rollers sense that the bull
market can't last forever and are buying big now to cushion the big
fall later.
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, the frantic pace of life in the '90s has just made
some people anxious. And living large, some who study American
culture say, is really about feeling small, and just projecting a
big, brave image.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they explain, if we feel the world is getting
aggressive, we fight back with a big car that can kick your little
car's butt. If we're feeling under attack, we buy a five-bedroom
fortress and a 17-horsepower John Deere riding mower to patrol the
grounds. Stressed? Sink into a 9-foot-long (up from 6 feet),
40-inch-thick sofa and watch ``Titanic'' on your 63-inch,
big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in doubt, Americans make it humongous,'' said Syracuse
University popular-culture professor Robert Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, size has become the latest and best boast by
advertisers, retailers, builders, and restauranteurs, who,
incidentally, are raking in big profits as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the Ford Motor Co. will unveil ``The World's
Largest Sport Utility Vehicle,'' a 3 1/2-ton, 19-foot-long, $50,000
battleship that requires two parking spaces and will guzzle so much
gas, the Sierra Club has dubbed it ``the Ford Valdez.''
</P>
<P>
   New homes in the nation's suburbs have increased in size by 150
percent over the past two decades, from an average 2,000 to 5,000
square feet, altering the character of the cul de sac. Homes have
transformed from Cape to Colonial to Colossus.
</P>
<P>
   Food is huge. A simple plate of pasta is now a trough of
tortellini at Vinnie Testa's restaurants in Boston, and bagels are
the size of throw pillows. Soft drinks at the 7-Eleven have gone
from the Big Gulp (32 ounces) to the Super Big Gulp (42 ounces) to
the Double Gulp, a 64-ounce bladder buster.
</P>
<P>
   Even formerly innocuous items and generic pastimes in our lives
are getting the big treatment, like children's toys and ladies'
shoes, blue jeans, cheesy TV, and traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   The wimpy-sounding ``squirt'' gun is now the battle-ready Air
Pressure Supersoaker XP 110, and women's heels are clunky and
chunky to the point of fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers wear pants with 27-inch bell-bottoms that sag to their
knees, a look Levin says is copied from prison inmates (who aren't
allowed to wear belts) to make the hip fashion statement, ``My
pants are big and therefore I am bad.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, professional wrestling _ featuring big guys with
big attitudes and big muscles _ is so popular, several grapplers
have entered the political ring.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, we have the Big Dig, which causes big headaches but
promises to be a big success.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Syracuse University sociologist, believes America,
as still a young upstart country compared to most of the world, is
simply always trying to make up for in size what it cannot claim in
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Paul Bunyan,'' Thompson said. ``He couldn't just be
any lumberjack, he had to be 50 times bigger than any other
lumberjack in the universe. . . . It's an identity crisis. We have
to be better, we have to be bigger, even if it's to the level of
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has profited nicely from the sale of the 5,000- to
15,000-square-foot ``trophy homes'' he builds in Boston's tonier
suburbs, developer David Tocci says even he has to wonder why a
family of four needs seven bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In this upscale housing market, he sees young professionals
making a killing on the stock market buying $1 million to $2
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   And although families are getting smaller, and the divorce rate
is 50 percent, couples are still willing to pay for all the latest
luxuries: home theaters, gourmet kitchens with oversized
appliances, five garages, dressing rooms with automated clothing
racks, and bathrooms with so many fixtures and faucets ``they're
like going through a car wash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not houses, they are mausoleums,'' said Tocci.
``These owners, they want to make a statement to the world that
they made it. And I say, if you can do it, good luck to you. But I
wonder every now and then, when I see these couples with one kid or
no kids, `Why do these people want to live in such big homes?' And
the answer always is, `Because they can.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing backlash against the constant demolition
of smaller homes to make way for the big.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Needham, Mass. establishing a ``Big House Committee'' to
study the effect of ``knock downs,'' and Lexington residents
organizing Citizens Against Mansionization. State Representative
Jay Kaufman, a Democrat from Lexington, Mass., has gone so far as
to file legislation to allow towns to discuss the impact of large
homes and what, if anything, should be done about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly change the appearance and feel of a community,''
he said. ``Everyone is looking for a buffer zone these days; a big
home, a big car, and a big bank account are among the ways we are
reaching out for some sense of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in addition to wanting things big, Americans want
more of everything. And they look like they're getting it: Over 70
percent of all adults in this country are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   But which came first, big appetites or big portions?
</P>
<P>
   Marty Bloom, owner of the Vinnie Testa's restaurant chains,
where a single order of lasagna could serve a family of six,
proudly calls his business ``your little, old Italian restaurant on
steroids.'' One recent diner at Vinnie's swears that one salad
listed as an ``appetizer'' fed 12 people. With leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where families are far flung, Bloom says, big
servings of familiar food conjure a sense of comfort, a pleasant
memory of grandma's house, where being fat meant being happy.
</P>
<P>
   Judy George, owner of Domain furniture stores (where the sofas
are as overstuffed as Vinnie's diners), says big furniture comforts
the psyche the way that big food does. So, her stores will soon be
stocking _ by customer demand _ the last things she ever thought
she'd see in her chic shops: big, bulky ``Get me a beer, honey''
recliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine will be tasteful,'' she promised. ``People want a big
chair they can put their feet up in. I am being forced to bring
them in by clients telling me `I don't care what the image is, find
me one that's beautiful.' Some even have phones and vibrators and
cup holders.''
</P>
<P>
   But how how far can the bent toward big go before going bust?
</P>
<P>
   George predicted: ``When Alan Greenspan stops smiling.''

WE HAVE TIME, BUT MUST USE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm at the post office, waiting to mail a package. I'm trying to
be patient, but I'm getting tenser by the hundredth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason I don't understand, the powers that be have
decreed that directly behind the people working at the counter
there must hang a sign that says, ``Time is running out.'' This is
not a formal statement of the post office's philosophy. It is a
scientific report on the upcoming millennium, complete to the
number of days (260), the number of hours (11), the number of
minutes (42), and the number of seconds (11:14), down to the
nearest hundredth. I'm in a line where I can't avoid the bright red
numbers flashing in my face.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm desperately trying to become interested in a
display of merchandise the post office is trying to sell to what
surely must be the most captive audience in America, those
constantly changing figures have me mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running out,'' the sign proclaims, ensuring that
everyone who enters this building will become hyperaware that the
year 2000 lurks just over the horizon. It works. It makes me want
to scream, ``So why am I wasting so much of my valuable time
standing here?'' I want to shake the responsible parties and make
them tell me what they think they're doing. Don't ordinary citizens
experience sufficient stress without being reminded that there
aren't enough hours in the day to accomplish everything on their
lists? Is the government deliberately trying to kindle post office
rage in their usually docile customers?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this racing clock has gotten under my skin has
something to do with the speed with which those hundredths of
seconds are flashing by. They move faster than my eyes can see
them, blending into one another in an inexorable stream, like a
wave driving you underwater, no matter how hard you fight against
it. By now I definitely feel like pushing my way to the front of
the line. I want to get out of here.
</P>
<P>
   Time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   The thought summons my state of panic in college every time I
had to write too many papers and take too many exams all in the
same week. I remember measuring out blocks of time _ for study, for
meals, for washing my hair, for sleep _ and realizing that no
matter how dutifully I rearranged them, there'd still never be
enough of them. I used to fall into bed at night, tense as a stick,
feeling as if the ticking of the clock was my worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's what's bothering me now as I stand here, fighting
off anxiety. This sign defines time as my adversary, an unyielding
force that is hostile to my happiness. In this building, digits are
rushing like grains in an hourglass, running their swift course all
the way to zero. Nada. No more. All done. The whistle blows. It's
official.
</P>
<P>
   TIME IS RUNNING OUT.
</P>
<P>
   I want to protest to the postmaster general, ``There's more
where that came from.'' With billions of years behind us, I think I
can say with confidence that days and nights will continue to swirl
around us in an endless procession. Time will still be unfolding
long after our species has disappeared from the earth. What we're
really running out of is a gratifying human perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't we think of time as something to fill with delightful
experiences, like an old-fashioned trunk full of treasures we can
open at a later date and enjoy again at our leisure? Why can't we
think of time as a symphony of available moments that carries us
along in its familiar rhythms, its notes an endless supply of
minutes and hours, its theme a continually recurring round of
seasons?
</P>
<P>
   I feel the urge to whisper to the person behind me, ``Spend the
moments of your life as if they were bright new pennies, spilling
endlessly into your palm. Each one gives you another chance to mend
the world. Express your uniqueness. Try something difficult one
more time. Be grateful for all you have been given. Use the
opportunity each moment presents. It is never too late to say words
that will make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   I mail my package and gladly turn my back on the clock. I push
open the door and step into a gorgeous spring day, warm and
fragrant, unfinished and full of potential. What if each of us were
given only one morning, one budding magnolia tree, one splatter of
daffodils, one convocation of clouds in a blue topaz sky? Who of us
would dare to complain that one moment of the fullness of the world
could not sustain us for a lifetime?

GEORGIA'S BAILEY UNDISPUTED CHAMP AT DEFENSIVE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost to a man, NFL scouts and personnel directors are
lamenting that the members of this year's crop of defensive backs
generally lack the height needed to combat the league's growing
arsenal of tall, fleet receivers, which includes Michael Irvin,
Randy Moss, Cris Carter, J.J. Stokes, Terrell Owens, and Herman
Moore. Yet at least four corners will be drafted in the first round
Saturday and 10 defensive backs are likely to be selected among the
first 60 players for the simple reason that someone has to cover
those guys and the league doesn't have enough such people already
under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The best of this year's crop, in the opinion of nearly everyone,
is Georgia's Champ Bailey, a Deion Sanders-like talent who could
play in the NFL on offense or defense. He has blazing speed, the
cockiness needed to live or die on the corner, and the
explosiveness as both a wide receiver and kick returner to be a
major offensive threat as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey often has been described as a clone of Charles Woodson,
who came out of Michigan last year and became an instant star with
the Raiders. If Bailey is even close to that talented and isn't the
first defensive back taken it will go to show the paralysis from
analysis that has overcome the drawn-out draft process these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I could be in the top five projected players
to go in the draft,'' Bailey said at the combine in February.
``That says a lot right there. People must think I'm good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they do, but they are more and more thinking the same way
about Arizona's Chris McAlister. McAlister is nearly as fast as
Bailey and has superior size (nearly 6 feet 2 inches) plus the kind
of long arms that can frustrate a receiver. The only thing he seems
to lack is Bailey's soft hands, which is why as remarkable as his
15 interceptions in three years at Arizona were, scouts believe he
would have had a dozen more if he could catch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Al Davis would tell you if he could catch he'd be
playing offense. Instead he'll be playing defense next year and
probably for one of the top 10 teams in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike two years ago, however, when six cornerbacks were drafted
on the first round and four became instant starters, the drop off
after Bailey and McAlister is noticeable. Although Ohio State
knockout artist Antoine Winfield, Alabama's Fernando Bryant, and
Clemson safety Antwan Edwards are likely first-round picks and West
Virginia's fast rising Charles Fisher also has a chance to crack
the top 31, none seem a lock to play regularly next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The crop of safeties is especially thin, with Edwards the only
one with a shot at being taken on the first round and even in his
case some teams believe he could be converted to corner, which
makes him more attractive on some team's draft boards. If that
shift can be made, Edwards would have the size (at a shade over 6
feet and 208 pounds) the scouts feel corners need in the '90s to go
along with natural speed. The beauty of Edwards is if he can't play
corner, he still projects as a solid safety.
</P>
<P>
   What will most bear watching on Saturday is what Washington does
with the No. 5 draft position. The Redskins have long coveted
Bailey but might find themselves in position to draft one of the
two top running backs (Ricky Williams or more likely Miami's
Edgerrin James) or trade down with someone like New Orleans, who is
breathlessly pursuing Williams. That is especially likely if
quarterbacks go 1-2-3, as many have projected.
</P>
<P>
   If they are tempted and take a running back or make the trade,
the 'Skins will most likely have accomplished one thing _ blown a
golden opportunity to finally grab a potentially top-flight
replacement for aging perennial Pro Bowl corner Darrell Green, who
has to slow down some time now that he's 38.
</P>
<P>
   It is Draft Day decisions like that that turn general managers
into geniuses or ghosts.

FOR THIS `LOVER,' THE THRILL IS GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in a topsy-turvy entertainment world, where the best
episodes of the best TV shows look cinematic, whereas too many
mediocre movies look like they belong on television. Despite
liberal doses of R-rated content, ``Goodbye Lover'' is an example
of the latter. It looks like nothing so much as it does a nastier
version of one of those TV movies that ``Columbo'' creators Richard
Levinson and William Link churned out in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   This is a movie that inspires oxymorons such as ``leisurely
twistfest'' and ``tasteful dark comedy.'' It aspires to be
Hitchockian, but it barely achieves the level of ``Alfred Hitchcock
Presents.'' Its twists, however, are worthy enough that a plot
description should be vague: Ben Dunmore (Don Johnson), a
public-relations honcho and church organist, is having a fling with
a femme fatale named Sandra (Patricia Arquette). In Ben's employ
are Jake (Dermot Mulroney _ he's the guy who's not the guy on ``The
Practice''), the office's hotheaded slouch, and Peggy Blaine
(Mary-Louise Parker), who apparently has a thing for Ben.
</P>
<P>
   There are connections among the four, which the movie reveals in
its own time. Bodies fall. Twists happen.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie evokes Hitchcock, it didn't need a Hitch to
make it more interesting; someone like John McNaughton, who brought
a sense of gleeful outrageousness to last year's ``Wild Things,''
or the Coen brothers, with their showoffy sense of style, could
have brought the three-writer screenplay to life. Director Roland
Joffe, whose career has taken the down escalator from ``The Killing
Fields'' to ``The Scarlet Letter,'' appears to be trying for an
old-fashioned thriller here, but the result is pedestrian direction
that leaves everything flat.
</P>
<P>
   Joffe's movie gives you the sense that you're watching actors,
not characters; everyone is more or less playing a meaner version
of his or her self. You could say that Ellen DeGeneres steals
``Goodbye Lover'' as a tactless, foul-mouthed cop (who, in that
``Columbo'' way, shouldn't be underestimated), but it's more
accurate to say she has the movie handed to her on a silver
platter. Ray McKinnon, as her naively optimistic partner, is also
watchable, although he employs a mannered accent that inspires
unfavorable comparisons to ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Lover'' has been on the shelf for some time, and
Warner Bros. is apparently opening it in an off period as some sort
of spring cleaning (a better Warners film, ``The Matrix,'' is
likely to beat it at the box office this weekend). Between
``Lover's'' original release date and its actual release date, Don
Johnson spouted off in an ego-driven Los Angeles Times interview,
kvetching that he's as good as Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson,
but nobody knows it because he doesn't get the material. Man, Don,
next time you say something like that, make sure that you've got
something at least as good as ``Tin Cup'' coming out, instead of
something that makes your TV series look like De Niro movies.

HANCOCK CHIEF FINDS MARATHON SAFER BET THAN THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- From a chair in his all-windows office on the 59th
floor of the Hancock tower, David D'Alessandro can see past the
Common, past the airport, and nearly to Olympic headquarters in
Switzerland. Is that His Excellency Juan Antonio Samaranch sidling
toward the egress of the Chateau de Vidy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's looking for the door, looking for an exit here,''
muses D'Alessandro, who has been observing the Lords of the Rings
with a more critical eye than most these last few months.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alessandro seems a bit more preoccupied with what's
happening in Lausanne than in Boston on the eve of the 103d Boston
Athletic Association Marathon, it may be that he's got $40 million
tied up in tarnished Olympic rings. And that the Marathon, which
dates back to the year after the first modern Olympics and which
the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. has sponsored since
1986, has been on quiet cruise for years now with few bumps in the
macadam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people miss the controversy about the race,'' says
D'Alessandro, who got Hancock involved with the Marathon when he
was its corporate communications chief and is now president. ``It's
getting a little dull without the controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that D'Alessandro is complaining. Hancock modernized and
revitalized the race when it was in danger of becoming a
19th-century curiosity and arguably has made it the planet's most
attractive and competitive 26-miler outside of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few marathons that have a great mystique about
them,'' says D'Alessandro. ``This one does. It's world-renowned and
people will come from all over to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the insurance company has signed on through 2008 and has a
five-year option after that. Not so for the Olympics, whose recent
travails have had D'Alessandro popping his cork since the Salt Lake
City payoff scandal broke in December. Until the International
Olympic Committee cleaned up its act, D'Alessandro said, Hancock
was wiping the five-ringed logo off its annual report, letterhead,
and billboards and pulling $20 million in NBC advertising off the
table.
</P>
<P>
   And if the IOC's announced cleanup ends up being half-hearted
and half-baked, D'Alessandro asserted this week, Hancock won't
renew its sponsorship for the 2001-2004 quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yet to be seen what they'll do when the media spotlight
is off them,'' he says. ``The IOC has a tradition of minimizing
what they have to do. I think we'll see some reform, but probably
not anywhere near what we need to. And if we don't see enough,
we're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just out of the IOC, but out of the US Olympic Committee and
Salt Lake City, too. ``In the Olympic movement, you're either in or
out,'' D'Alessandro says. ``I don't think the public makes a
distinction between Salt Lake City's rings and the USOC's rings and
the IOC's rings. They see rings.''
</P>
<P>
   You are what you sponsor, he believes. If you sponsor tarnished
goods, then the public perceives you as tarnished, too. Tarnish, of
course, can be removed over time, which is why Hancock is stepping
up to the plate for a whack at the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides signing on as Major League Baseball's financial services
sponsor, the company will underwrite the weeklong Fanfest when the
All-Star Game comes to Fenway Park for the first time in 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a smart move for a company like ours,'' says
D'Alessandro. ``Aside from what Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa did
last year, the sport has a lot of advantages. It has 162 games.
It's a great spring-summer-fall plug for the schedule. And it's
having a resurgence among young people. Baseball is probably one of
the more credible sports properties around at the moment, and it's
undervalued because of the problems they had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro may be up to his ears in demutualization and
diversification, his company's current D-words, but he still has a
sports marketer's soul in a city that barely recognized the concept
until Hancock showed the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sports-oriented town, this has not been a sports
marketing town,'' D'Alessandro says. ``It's been a town of signage
being called sports marketing. If you put up two signs at the
FleetCenter and sponsor the third-quarter break, that doesn't make
you a sports marketer. It makes you an advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock doesn't sponsor the Marathon because it loves potholes
and blisters. The company sponsors it because its headquarters is
right at the finish line and because the race is a civic heirloom
that came at a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like two-fers,'' says D'Alessandro. ``Things that give us
an opportunity to help our community but are also national
events.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Hancock has hooked up with the Mass. Sports
Partnership to bring in marquee events such as the 1996 and 2000
Olympic gymnastics trials and the 2001 US figure skating
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure skating and gymnastics are the top two Olympic
television sports,'' says D'Alessandro. ``We can put them on tour
in 30 or 40 cities where we have offices (Hancock is sponsoring the
Champions on Ice circuit, which stops at the FleetCenter for two
shows Sunday) and we get a chance to have the championships in our
hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, though, that Hancock will underwrite any
sporting event that hits town for a weekend. Though the company
will do corporate hospitality and some signage at the Ryder Cup at
The Country Club in September, it won't be a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Golf doesn't make sense for Hancock. Neither do tennis (sorry,
Longwood), rowing (ditto, Head of the Charles) or soccer (what
women's World Cup?).
</P>
<P>
   Sponsoring golf, D'Alessandro says, is about bragging rights for
CEOs in their country-club locker rooms. ``They can beat their
chests for the weekend,'' he says, ``and hand out a giant check
with Greg Norman looking at them cross-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis is pricey, he says, and Boston doesn't get a top field
any more. ``Players can pick and choose now because they have so
many tournaments,'' D'Alessandro says. ``Longwood attracts a fair
amount of has-beens and never-weres.''
</P>
<P>
   The Head, he says, ``is a little too highbrow, it's not
televised, and we can't get a bang out of touring it.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't mention the f-word (as in futbol). ``If I hear one
more person say soccer is the coming sport in America . . . ''
D'Alessandro says. ``The fact that children play soccer, the fact
that we have a zillion soccer Moms and Dads, the fact that we have
a lot of soccer being played in high school and college is
irrelevant to mass audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that marathoning is any marketing slam-dunk, and
D'Alessandro concedes that. It makes for dreadful television, it's
weak for signage, and there hasn't been a top American contender
since the Reagan era. Hancock is no longer involved with the New
York (``It's become a fun race'') or Los Angeles events. But
Boston, the granddaddy of road races, has been grandfathered. ``We
have to be here.'' he says. At least until someone yanks the tower
off Clarendon Street and moves it to Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro on: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MARATHON: ``I'd like the race to be bigger. We've discovered
you can handle 50,000 people on the course and there's some talk
about expanding it next year. It'd be better to be a bigger race
without being a show business race. One of the great things is that
it's virtually a non-commercial race from a television and fan
standpoint. I'm not sure how to improve it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES RACES: ``New York has become pretty
much a fun race, less competitive. (Race director) Al Steinfeld and
those guys will argue about that, but they generally don't have
more than 10 real world-class runners in the race. LA has none. So
the only world-class marathon is in Boston.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LACK OF A US MEN'S CONTENDER: ``I'm sure we'll have one
again sometime, but I'm afraid we'll have just one and not a
contingent of them like the Kenyans do. We've had some good
American runners in the 10Ks and that's part of the problem. They
can run a 10K every weekend. They can pick up $10,000 or $20,000
and run again. Given a choice of running a smattering of 10Ks or
having to kill themselves running a marathon twice a year . . . '' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAMARANCH: ``I think he'll declare victory, then exit. But the
likelihood of his great dream, of attaining the Nobel Peace Prize,
is gone. So right now, it's about salvaging his reputation and
ostensibly leaving the Olympic movement in reasonable shape.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IOC REFORMS: ``I desperately wanted to support what they did in
Lausanne last time. I was hoping they would do more, but I didn't
see anything. Maybe I missed it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE OLYMPIC IMAGE: ``For the rest of our lifetimes, the Olympics
will have fallen from favor because people will have seen something
they hadn't seen in the past _ the greed and the avarice and the
privilege behind the scenes.''

J. BRIAN ATWOOD: A VETERAN OF POLITICAL BATTLES 
</HEADLINE>

 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the top floor of the new Ronald Reagan Federal
Office Building, narrow white corridors lead to a warren of
windowless rooms that are part of the nerve center of the US
government's Kosovo refugee relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   From here, questions from the upper levels of policy-making are
asked of assessment teams in Macedonia and Albania. Rumors are
checked, priorities adjusted. The rooms are crowded with
representatives of the military, the Department of State, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, even the US Forest Service, by
virtue of the logistics expertise it has amassed fighting fires.
</P>
<P>
   All fall silent as J. Brian Atwood, director of the US Agency
for International Development, whom President Clinton has put in
charge of the relief effort, starts a teleconference with Kim
Maynard, a former Forest Service smoke jumper who has just become
her country's front-line relief leader in Macedonia. She gives him
worrisome news.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is ready to go'' away from the refugee camps ``and will
take its equipment with it,'' Maynard tells Atwood. ``UNHCR in
particular, and the WFP are lacking in leadership,'' she adds,
referring to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and
the World Food Program. ``I don't see them stepping up to the
plate'' to keep the camps running smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   During the private conference Friday, Atwood swiftly dispatches
an assistant to consult with the National Security Council on the
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a logistics nightmare, but it's always difficult to make
sure one hand knows what the other is doing,'' says Atwood, a
Wareham native who previously worked on American relief efforts to
Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti. ``These are really tough times
now, because everyone is second-guessing the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As with other aspects of the US effort _ flying in millions of
meals, arranging an emergency evacuation, hiring bakers on the
scene _ the stated purpose of keeping NATO in the camps is
humanitarian. But enormous political stakes are riding on all these
steps.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of their attack on Serb forces, NATO members
seemed surprised, even staggered, by the swiftness and
effectiveness of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's response
to attack. By starting a tidal wave of Albanian refugees toward
Macedonia and Albania, Milosevic threatened the stability of those
countries and conjured up the specter of a rapid spread of ethnic
violence that could jeopardize NATO's ability to operate in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no calculation,'' Atwood said in an interview,
referring to the rapidly constructed plan to move more than 100,000
Albanian Kosovars to temporary camps in Germany, Turkey, the United
States, and other countries. ``Suddenly, there were 100,000,
120,000'' refugees ``in no-man's land and the Macedonian government
said `we're not taking any more.' You could understand why: A
majority in Macedonia supports the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the government knew it would be rough, but no one
thought it would be complete ethnic cleansing,'' he said. ``We were
not prepared for that, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Atwood is the picture of a Washington functionary,
immaculately suited and coiffed, standing behind the president at
press conferences, escorting the first lady on visits to relief
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the operations center, and in interviews about his 30 years
in foreign affairs _ as a State Department official, as a foreign
affairs adviser to Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, and as dean
of professional services at the Foreign Service Institute _ he is
candid about his own ups and downs, and those of American policy.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, 56, characterizes himself as a lower-middle-class kid
from a lower-middle-class town whose parents ``never went to
college but had the guts to send me overseas, to Luxembourg,
through an American Field Services program, when I was a junior in
high school. It opened my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg in 1959 was still suffering physically and
psychologically from the devastation of World War II. Atwood's peer
in his host family harbored extreme feelings against Germans;
Atwood had pride in how America had behaved, during the war and
after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one day, my AFS brother said to me: `You Americans are
just like the Russians. You want to dominate us,' '' Atwood
recalled. ``I was shocked. I didn't cry in front of him, but I went
to my room and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience had a profound effect on the future director of
American aid programs. ``It caused me to really do a lot of
thinking about my country, about what it means to be sensitive,''
Atwood said. ``It has caused me every day for the rest of my life
to think about the image of our country abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   On finishing Wareham High School, he entered Boston University
on a football scholarship _ the only way the 6-foot, 2-inch,
200-pounder says he could afford college _ earned a degree in
political science and government, and signed on with the National
Security Agency, where he worked for a year before joining the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed serving as a junior officer in the Ivory Coast and
Spain, but he was repelled by a chewing-out administered to him and
several hundred other young officers for signing a letter
questioning US policy in Vietnam. So when Atwood got an offer to
become foreign policy adviser to Eagleton, a young Democratic
senator he had met in Madrid, he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood returned to government when Jimmy Carter was elected
president, serving as the State Department's deputy assistant
secretary, then assistant secretary, for congressional relations.
Because of a quirk in the Civil Service Reform Act, he was able to
regain career diplomat status when Carter was defeated, and became
dean of professional studies at the Foreign Service Institute.
</P>
<P>
   During the long Democratic drought of the 1980s and early 1990s,
he worked briefly in the private sector, then for the Democrats'
Senate campaign committee and the Democratic National Institute,
which promotes democracy abroad.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton was elected president, Atwood was asked to
head his State Department transition team. ``It was like a dream,''
he said, and dream he did _ of being deputy secretary, or
undersecretary for political affairs. But both jobs went to others.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Secretary of State Warren M. ``Christopher asked me what
else I wanted and I said `AID,' '' Atwood recalled. ``But he said
the White House wanted a woman or a minority, and that I should
take undersecretary for management. So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As luck had it, competing forces within the administration
deadlocked on the AID appointment, and a few weeks later Atwood had
the job. ``I was undersecretary for management for five weeks,'' he
said, ``which is as long as I'd recommend anybody take it. Nobody's
going to manage the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of insouciance and political seasoning managed to make
him friends among some Republicans _ but not foes of foreign aid
such as Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and not Christopher.
They teamed up in 1995 in an almost-successful attempt to fold the
AID budget into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian was under fire from State and Congress at the same time,
and he succeeded in doing something very important _ keeping AID
out of the State Department,'' said Andrew S. Natsios, a top AID
official under President George Bush who now is Massachusetts'
secretary of administration and finance. Natsios shares Atwood's
view that the separate agency keeps American investing in
longer-term outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Natsios says that, despite Atwood's long Democractic
affiliation, ``he is more centrist than ideological. He supports
the Clinton positions'' on hot-button issues such as population
control policy, ``but he has enough sense to realize that
Republicans are in power in Congress, and he does not pour salt on
the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Such realpolitik may hold Atwood in good stead now, with his
nomination to be US ambassador to Brazil pending before the
Helms-chaired Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``We disagreed on
the reorganization, but I have a letter from him saying he'll
always hold me in `affectionate respect,''' Atwood says. ``I hope
that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the two hours a day he is studying Portuguese will
not got to waste, he says, since he has always wanted to know what
the Cape Verdeans back in Wareham are saying.

`LIFE' GOES ON, EVEN WHEN ITS SPIRIT HAS EXPIRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the people one ever expected to court respect, Eddie
Murphy is far down the list. But in ``The Nutty Professor'' remake,
in which he gave a performance of surprising believability, he
broke through in a way that must have surprised even him. So, in
``Life,'' a brazen comedy-melodrama in which he and Martin Lawrence
play a pair of small-timers thrown in jail for a crime they didn't
commit, Murphy continues on his newly paved path marked
``Hallelujah, I'm An Actor.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 minutes or so, we halfway buy it. His eyes
gleaming, Murphy, as lightweight hood Ray Gibson, slides into a
Harlem club, taking in all of the richness of the partying around
him.
</P>
<P>
   He literally bumps into middle-class aspirant Claude Banks
(Lawrence) and drafts the hapless Banks into helping with a
bootlegging scheme. When a racist Southern sheriff frames the two
for murder and they're sentenced to life in prison, all the air
goes out of the picture. Even before you start riffing on all the
movies ``Life'' jacks, _ like ``Stir Crazy,'' which starred Murphy
and Lawrence's idol, Richard Pryor _ you fear that moving the
action inside a prison will snuff all the life out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   You're not wrong. ``Life'' is careful to make sure that it steps
right in the footprints of the prison/buddy movies that came before
it. The initial passage of the movie, which gives Murphy a chance
to go back to material he squandered in ``Harlem Nights'' without
wearing the bored princeling mask he sported, is so rich that
``Life'' never recovers from walking blithely away from it.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, even ``Life'' seems bored with its own
second-rater quality. Ray and Claude squabble, and the movie even
has the nerve to have its narrator (Obba Babatunde) note that after
these meant-for-each-other pals stop speaking to one another,
``life (in prison) was never the same.'' The sentimental touches
not only remind you that you've seen everything in this Odd Couple
Goes to the Joint in better pictures, but that ``Life'' itself is
so patently fake that you can almost hear director Ted Demme shout
``cut'' during the meandering takes.
</P>
<P>
   The narcissism of Murphy and Lawrence definitely suggests a
shotgun buddy marriage. Neither of them ever seems to be talking to
the other. Which is odd, since Lawrence's best movie work came when
he was agog over Will Smith's Yeah-I'm-All-That bicep-smooching in
``Bad Boys.'' Murphy's crowning achievement in ``Professor'' came
when he was acting in scenes with himself _ the only time he has
ever bothered to notice someone else in the same frame with him was
when Bronson Pinchot had the audacity to steal scenes from him in
the first ``Beverly Hills Cop.'' He showed a king's disbelief.
Here, he knows he owns the movie, and Lawrence isn't really in the
same league with him. Nor is Demme, who showed some feel for
Brotherman bonhomie in ``Who's the Man?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fun in ``Life'' comes from cameos by music figures
like Heavy D and Rick James. (Or from noticing that every old man
Murphy does sounds like Thurgood Stubbs, the project super he
voices in ``The PJs.'') As the pair grow old in jail, we even get
to watch Murphy strap on some of Rick Baker's patented make-up
appliances. (Baker worked with him on ``Professor'' and ``Coming to
America.'') When a performer's most long-lived professional
relationship is with a make-up artist, maybe it's time for him to
reappraise his career.

BANNED IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I searched for Drazen Pantic on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The first two links that I found were to his resume and home
page. Unfortunately, both of those pages are on computers inside
the ``AC.YU'' domain _ academic computers within the former
Yugoslavia. Needless to say, both of those machines are unreachable
on the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I could still find plenty of articles about Pantic,
a professor of mathematics at Belgrade University, who until
recently was the director of OpenNet, the Internet service provider
of Belgrade's formerly independent radio station, B92
(www.b92.net).
</P>
<P>
   The story of OpenNet and B92 clearly demonstrates the power of
the Internet to overcome political oppression _ especially
censorship by dictatorships. In December 1996, when the Serbian
authorities demanded that B92 cease broadcasting, the radio
station's staff sent out its programs over the Internet to
broadcasters outside Serbia, who then re-broadcast the programs
back into the country. Two days later, the Serbian authorities
relented, and allowed B92 back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   This past March, the Serbs banned B92 again, and once again the
radio station started broadcasting on the Internet. ``For something
like almost 10 days, the Internet and air around Serbia was so full
of the B92 signal,'' said Pantic, who spoke last week in Washington
at the annual conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the story of OpenNet also shows that even the Internet
is vulnerable to brute force. On April 2nd, the Serbian authorities
sent police to OpenNet, took over the Internet service provider,
and changed the programming. ``That fairy tale could not last
forever,'' said Pantic.
</P>
<P>
   When OpenNet started offering service in November 1995, it was
Belgrade's only Internet service provider. It was sponsored by the
Fund for an Open Society, the organization created by billionaire
financier George Soros that is trying to help the world end
dictatorships and become a collection of open societies. The idea
was to let Serbian citizens get their own news and communicate
freely with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But the dictatorship started opening its own Internet providers
in March 1996; Pantic says that these providers are one-way
organizations, designed to carry propaganda to the citizens.
Recently, they have also been used to attack the NATO Web site and
to send unwanted junk e-mail advocating the Serbian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pantic has tried mightily to assure freedom and
privacy. He has used encryption and remote storage to protect
OpenNet's users, even when they didn't want to be protected .
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, encryption is a technique for foiling wiretaps.
In the beginning, OpenNet taught seminars on how to use encryption
programs like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), but even in this
life-threatening situation, few of Pantic's users wanted to deal
with the complexity of encryption. ``PGP has this unpleasant thing
that it is not user-friendly,'' Pantic said .
</P>
<P>
   So instead, OpenNet created an encrypted tunnel between
OpenNet's computer in Belgrade and the Internet service provider
XS4ALL in Amsterdam, where OpenNet stored all of its subscribers'
e-mail and Web pages. When an OpenNet user in Belgrade checked his
mail, the messages would automatically be encrypted when they were
sent from XS4ALL's computers in Amsterdam to OpenNet's computer in
Belgrade, than decrypted when the message was sent from OpenNet to
the end user.
</P>
<P>
   This encryption system wasn't perfect: Serb authorities couldn't
eavesdrop on the communications between OpenNet and XS4ALL, but
they could wiretap OpenNet's own modems and eavesdrop on the actual
messages as they were being sent to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantic, when I spoke with him, didn't think that
</P>
<P>
   this was a much of a problem: modem transmissions are much
harder to eavesdrop on than high-speed, long-distance data lines.
Even so, said Pantic, after the encrypted tunnel was installed, the
Serbs cut the data line every Saturday around noon. They were
hoping, he said, that by watching the tunnel start up, they might
be able to figure out how it was working.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these minor technological triumphs, it's important
to remember that the wonders of the Internet were only available to
people in Belgrade who had access to computers. Indeed, in many
parts of the world, repressive regimes work hand-in-hand with
economics to restrict access to the freedom of information that the
on-line world holds.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this partnership more evident than in China,
explained Bobson Wong, of the Digital Freedom Network, who spoke at
the same conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Search the Web site of the British Broadcasting Corporation for
stories about the Internet and China, said Wong, and you'll come up
with articles talking about human rights abuses , and China's
decision to filter access to the Internet to remove pornography and
information about democratic rights. ``You do that same search on
Chinese Daily and you get a whole bunch of stories about the high
cost of Internet access and the lack of content.''
</P>
<P>
   A current survey of Chinese Internet users found that the
Internet was ``too slow, too expensive, and too English,'' said
Wong. ``Most of the Web is in English, and most people in China do
not read English. So most of the Internet users in China are
well-educated, they are students or work in computers, and they are
pretty well off.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling statistic, he said, is this: ``The average cost
of a computer in China is about $1,000. But the per capita income
for urban city residents, as of 1997, is $620. A lot of people in
China save for computers the way people in America save for cars.''
Or for houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has a great capacity for effecting social change.
The free flow of information changes societies from within, that's
why the regimes in Belgrade and Beijing fear giving their citizenry
unrestricted access. Unfortunately, in any battle between guns and
modems, one simple fact gives guns the upper hand: You can't kill
somebody with a modem, but you can with a gun.

_AN ALARM IS SOUNDED ON ALLERGIES TO NUTS   
 _GENDER-SURVIVAL GAP IN HEART DISEASE FOUND   
 _HOW A STEROID AIDS HIV, KIDNEY PATIENTS  
</HEADLINE>

 An alarm is sounded on allergies to nuts
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About three million Americans are allergic to nuts, researchers
say, and many aren't prepared to treat themselves in case of a bad
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate emerged from a survey carried out by the American
Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, amid proposals to ban
peanuts from certain areas of airliners or from schools.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies to peanuts and ``tree nuts'' like walnuts, almonds,
and cashews, are the leading cause of severe or fatal allergic
reactions to food, the academy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey included 12,032 people in 4,372 households.
Allergies to nuts were reported by 164 people. Judging by this
sample, about 1.1 percent of Americans have these allergies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to see how many people are affected, and it
gives us the sense that there could be a large-impact public health
issue for anyone who serves food to a lot of people,'' said Anne
Munoz-Furlong of The Food Allergy Network, nonprofit education
organization based in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Because nut allergies can cause quick fatal reactions, patients
often are advised to carry a small device for self-administering
epinephrine, which can halt the attack. The survey found that only
7 percent of the respondents had self-injectible epinephrine
available at the time of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Gender-survival gap in heart disease found
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women with congestive heart failure, the fastest-growing type of
heart disease, live twice as long as men with the same disease,
according to a study released this week.
</P>
<P>
   The survival advantage holds true even if a woman is as sick as
a man with heart failure and has had it for as long. Previous
studies suggested that the apparent survival advantage of women was
a result of the groups of men and women not being equally sick.
</P>
<P>
   Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump
enough blood to meet the body's demands. It can be caused by
atherosclerotic heart disease or from high blood pressure. About
4.6 million Americans have congestive heart failure. The study was
reported in the journal Circulation this week, and the lead author
is Dr. Kirkwood F. Adams Jr. of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. The authors said further study would be needed to find
the cause of the survival difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; How a steroid aids HIV, kidney patients
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patients on kidney dialysis and those with HIV are prone to lose
weight in the form of wasted muscle, worsening their plight because
they become weakened and unable to do what they would like to.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a pair of studies has shown that an anabolic steroid, like
those banned in sports because it gives athletes an unfair
advantage, can help HIV and kidney patients gain some weight and
live a more active life.
</P>
<P>
   The studies were published this week in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at San Francisco General Hospital gave the steroid,
called nandrolone decanoate, to dialysis patients who were
malnourished, a common complication of kidney disease. In six
months of treatment, the patients who got the drug gained an
average of 5.7 pounds more than those on a placebo. And, the
researchers said, there was evidence that they increased their
muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   The study, headed by Dr. Kirsten L. Johansen, found mixed
results when they tested the volunteers for functional improvement.
The patients could climb stairs faster and felt less fatigued, but
they performed no better on exercise tests than the untreated
patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the other study, researchers at the university of California
at Berkeley gave the steroid oxandrolone to men who had lost weight
because of infection with the AIDS virus. The drug was given along
with a male hormone and a regimen of exercise. Those who took the
steroid gained more strength and lean muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Adrian Sandra Dobs of Johns
Hopkins University said it remains unclear what role anabolic
steroids will have in medicine, and further research on possible
side effects needs to be done.

<P>
   BOSTON -- At a luncheon held for Chinese Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji Wednesday, business leaders cheered when John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Co. head Steve Brown declared that China deserves
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Brown knows the challenges of doing business in the world's most
populous country: His company received permission to sell insurance
there just last week in a joint venture with a Chinese firm.
Another speaker at the luncheon, publisher Patrick McGovern,
produces computer trade journals that are jointly owned by Chinese
government institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, China's requirement that these companies share
their profits with Chinese partners shows the need for further
economic reforms. Even some of China's advocates note the country
bars foreigners from wholly owning telecommunications and
automaking firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more for them to do,'' said Bryan Batson, president of
Boston consulting company China Business Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over China's fitness to compete in an open world
economy was the central question of Zhu's US visit, which ended
Wednesday with his stop in Boston. President Clinton last week
aborted a deal that would have made China's 1.2 billion people part
of the WTO, which sets rules for international commerce. Washington
and Beijing now say they plan to restart talks later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another local publisher plans an unusual test of the
state of China's economic reforms. She is Chai Ling, a former
student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student demonstrations
who now heads an Internet start-up called Jenzabar.com.
</P>
<P>
   Around June 4, the 10th anniversary of the government's massacre
of the protesters, Chai plans to formally apply for permission to
open shop in China as a 100 percent foreign-owned firm. That would
be a rare arrangement, unlike the partnership agreements like those
struck by Hancock or McGovern's International Data Group of
Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a commercial application might seem a far cry from the
demands of Tiananmen Square. But these days, Chai's company is
represented by a high technology public relations firm, which lined
up press interviews for her during Zhu's visit.
</P>
<P>
   As Chai and other US-based businesspeople see it, the ability to
strike deals without government interference would show that civic
reforms are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic reform can't continue without political rights,''
said Chai, speaking in her company's office in a converted church
hall in Cambridge. ``The government needs to understand the two are
the same. Today you need the same freedoms to be in business
</P>
<P>
   that we were asking for'' in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Chai says she doesn't know whether she'll receive the approvals
she wants for her company, which operates Web sites for schools
like Boston College and St. Michael's College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to ask for it,'' she said. ``To join the WTO they
should have to show progress. Giving us the license would show
they're serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing authorities might grant Chai the license just to avoid
negative publicity, said Thomas Gottschang, a trade specialist at
Holy Cross University in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a strictly legal level, it's already OK for US companies to
own 100 percent interests of their Chinese units. But on a
practical level, you really have to have some kind of informal
relationship to gain access to the market,'' Gottschang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very sensitive about criticism of that, even if that's
not changing as quickly as some might like.''
</P>
<P>
   Chai's proposal strikes at the heart of a dilemma facing China's
economic reformers who want to attract foreign capital, technology,
and expertise without ceding economic or political control.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly trade is increasing. As Governor Paul Cellucci noted
at the luncheon, Massachusetts firms shipped $370 million in goods
to China last year _ twice that of 1997. But as China's top
economic official, Zhu indicated at the luncheon that he doesn't
intend to let trade develop without any restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Zhu said in answer to a question, ``We're
particularly eager to learn from the American experience'' of small
and midsize companies who might invest in his country. But Zhu also
made clear he imagines these deals as ``cooperation'' and
``partnerships'' rather than unfettered free enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Change must have limits, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to be another Gorbachev,'' Zhu said at
another point in his talk, referring to the former Soviet leader
whose reforms led to the end of his government.
</P>
<P>
   The business audience gave Zhu two standing ovations at the
event sponsored by IDG, the law firm of Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot, the
Harvard China Review, and the state.

PLANET BIRTH IS GETTING MORE CROWDED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ By Oct. 12, this unique blue planet of ours is
expected to reach an awesome and dangerous milestone: A population
of 6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as how it took us until 1804 to reach 1 billion, and how
as recently as 40 years ago there were but 3 billion of us, we are
talking about cataclysmic acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Human beings now reproduce themselves at a rate of 78 million
per year _ about 3,500 new people every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is: This bad news is not as bad as population
experts predicted five years ago. The global birthrate is
increasing but not as quickly as was expected. Declining birthrates
in 61 nations have contributed to the slowdown. At the current
pace, 10.7 billion people will crawl the Earth by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is: The cultural and social changes that aided the
slowdown are themselves impeded. In 1994 at the miraculous
International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo,
11,000 delegates from 179 nations agreed that the better off all
women are _ financially, politically, socially _ the less they will
contribute to overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   (Odd how that works: Offer a woman proper medical care,
education, nutrition and the freedom to control her own
reproduction, and she rarely produces passels of children.)
</P>
<P>
   As a means to this desired end, the nations pledged to spend $17
billion per year by 2000 on population and related issues.
</P>
<P>
   The annual allocation was to grow to $22 billion by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the money was to come from developing countries,
the folks who most need to put the brakes on the rate of birth.
</P>
<P>
   The other third was to be contributed by industrialized nations
like the United States. Funding is based on percentages of gross
national product.
</P>
<P>
   The reality? Only five countries _ Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
Finland and the Netherlands _ have managed to meet their funding
goals.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mighty U.S., whose 274 million people out-pollute
China's 1.25 billion, the total funding for population issues
(domestic and international) has actually dropped from $583 million
per year to $385 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of 20 major donor countries, the U.S. ranks eighth.
</P>
<P>
   What difference does it make?
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations Population Fund, if donor
nations match their current ``below-target'' rate of funding, there
will be a shortfall next year of $2.1 billion. That translates into
some tragic projections that are based on historic reproductive
behavior:
</P>
<P>
   _ Abortions will increase by 50 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deaths of women in childbirth will increase by 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 97 million women and men who would have availed
themselves of contraception will be denied access to it; 130
million unintended pregnancies will result.
</P>
<P>
   If last month's mandated self-review by the International
Committee for Population and Development is any indication, those
projected figures will end up looking like a lovely dream.
</P>
<P>
   Mired in religious and political arguments about women's rights,
contraception, abortion and sex education, representatives of the
179 nations didn't even get around to talking about money. As Paul
Lewis of the New York Times put it: ``A loose coalition of
conservative Roman Catholic and Muslim countries and the Vatican
sought to water down commitments made at Cairo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican underscored its priorities earlier this week when
Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, vice president of the Pontifical Academy
for Life, condemned the use of ``morning-after'' pills by ethnic
Albanian women who reportedly have been raped during the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The pills are part of 350,000 emergency reproductive health kits
that the U.N. Population Fund rushed to Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of Muslim women have told relief workers they
were pulled from refugee crowds, imprisoned at a Yugoslav army base
and systematically raped.
</P>
<P>
   Sgreccia said the use of morning-after pills by such women is
the same as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 12 looms.

INVESTOR SEES NO TROUBLE WITH NET BUBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors fear the end of the Internet stock bubble could be
around the corner. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warns of
a lottery mentality driving Web stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Masayoshi Son doesn't lose a wink of sleep over any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Son, the world's largest and perhaps most influential Internet
investor, has earned a staggering paper fortune with early and bold
investments in companies such as Yahoo Inc., E-Trade Group Inc.,
and Geocities Inc. That portfolio of about 100 stocks, worth more
than $20 billion, amounts to roughly 7.5 percent of the entire
Internet's stock value, by his calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Japan's Softbank Corp. believes the
aggregate value of all Internet stocks will be dramatically higher
a decade from now and whatever happens to Web shares in the near
term is mostly inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's simple mathematics and I don't understand why
people don't get it,'' Son told Boston Capital after an appearance
this week at Babson College, where he was inducted into its Academy
of Distinguished Entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all wonder what is going to happen to stock prices three
months from now and get nervous about it. I'm not nervous. I say
go, go, go because it's going to grow 10 times or 30 times,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy to take advantage of the rising tide and not get
pulled down by too many losers: target broad Web categories and pay
up to invest in the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   What about the tempered caution urged by the likes of Greenspan?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he doesn't understand the new revolution that's
happening,'' said Son.
</P>
<P>
   Before you dismiss his words as unbridled boosterism, remember
that people thought Son was off his rocker when he made his first
Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   He began to scour the Web five years ago with plans to spend
millions on new companies, borrowing heavily to make the deals. One
of his earliest Web investments, sinking $100 million into Yahoo,
is now worth more than $10 billion. Softbank can claim plenty of
other successful Web investments, but its early gamble on Yahoo put
the company on the cyber map.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't all been winners. Some companies went under and
others have achieved high profile but not as much business success,
like PointCast. Son would say the disappointments make his case:
You don't need wall-to-wall winners when the Internet itself is
growing at an astronomical pace.
</P>
<P>
   Son, 41, came from a poor family of Korean descent, and was
raised in Japan. He went to California at age 16 to go to school
and eventually landed at Berkeley. During his college years, Son
invented a multilingual pocket translator and sold the idea to
Sharp for $1 million. He returned to Japan and formed Softbank,
which began as a distributor of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Softbank went public in 1994 and made a round of acquisitions,
buying computer trade show giant Comdex for $800 million and
publisher Ziff-Davis for $2.1 billion. It paid $1.4 billion for an
80 percent stake in memory board maker Kingston Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Softbank was spending wildly and paying too much,
comments that were not softened by Son's early Internet stakes. But
the more recent, spectacular gains of the Web investments have
muted the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Son's initial Internet tactic targeted companies that could grab
as much of the Web's ``eyeball traffic'' as possible. Yahoo and
another big investment in GeoCities helped accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Son began to invest in Internet companies focused on
financial transactions. Last year, Softbank sunk $400 million into
on-line brokerage E-Trade Group, an investment that has soared to
about $3.5 billion in value today. He bought into E-Loan and
another Web business that quotes insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Softbank is focused on building investments in electronic
commerce companies that sell products of all kinds over the Web.
One of Son's investments: Buy.com, a self-described Internet
superstore expected to go public in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my dream to have the number one group of E-commerce
companies,'' he said. ``We have to make a lot of transactions to
achieve that position. It's still at an early stage and we are very
hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   Softbank often works as a kind of cyber hub for its portfolio
companies. Cyber surfers can connect easily to E-Trade and E-Loan
via Yahoo. E-Trade joined with Softbank to form a similar Web
brokerage business in Japan. Yahoo did the same thing earlier,
jointly launching Yahoo Japan with Softbank.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Softbank and Yahoo Japan joined with Microsoft Corp.
to create a Japanese version of CarPoint, an automobile information
cite in the United States owned by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the far-flung Web portfolio and its hard to miss
the similarities between Softbank and CMGI Inc. of Andover, best
known for its interest in Internet search site Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI manages a smaller portfolio, but its own stock value is
only modestly lower than that of Softbank, a fact that does not
elude Son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any shareholder who thinks CMGI (stock) is a great investment
had better look at another company that has at least three times
more value,'' he said. ``Do you think Lycos is bigger than Yahoo?
Do you think any other company they have is more exciting than what
we have?''
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain about Softbank's Web portfolio: It's going
to get bigger. An Internet stock correction may well get in the
way, but Son will see it only as a bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can still criticize us, say that the Internet is still
a bubble that could burst anytime,'' he said. ``I think people who
criticize like that don't have an understanding of the big
picture.''

PAYING FOR CLINTON TO WAG HIS MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I did my bit for the war effort. I just paid for
1/100 of a cruise missile or 1/4500 of a so-called stealth fighter,
which I hope isn't turned into souvenir ashtrays in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Or else I just bought 20 flak vests (which any veteran will tell
you don't stop really determined pieces of lead and steel), in case
we get into a war on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I'm not telling you exactly how much I paid in
federal income taxes. It's embarrassing, because if I'm so smart,
why aren't I a millionaire who pays no taxes at all and supports
dubious wars only with hot air?
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to figure out how much I made from the goods and
services I just paid for. The math is hard because it includes
military mishandling, air delivery to the Balkans and cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as a friend pointed out, I had to put stamps with pictures
of little blueberries on an envelope marked ``Internal Revenue
Service.'' Better a picture of Al Capone or Mars, the god of war.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the IRS already are hard at work pounding our
checks into missile gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Tax time is when you really find out who you are, and learn your
deepest resentments.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson probably worries that he just paid the federal
government for 50 or 100 Medicaid-funded abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan may be seething over paying some of the $2 billion
in food-stamp benefits restored to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   You have to hand it to the federal government. It unites us at
tax time. There's something for everybody to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Right now I hate buying 1/100 of a cruise missile, not so much
because it's a weapon, but because it's a coward's weapon. It's
risk-free, except to taxpayers and foreigners who happen to be in
the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   The damn things don't work reliably, either. And I'm not so sure
the cost of each ($1 million) includes development and
cost-overruns, the Pentagon's middle name.
</P>
<P>
   The only saving grace of this tax time is that the cruise
missile plants are out of production. Somehow someone forgot to buy
more of the standard ammunition of modern American war and
presidential dog-wagging.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I'm just in a bad mood. The evening news is enough to
make a civilized person vomit, and I walked all over town in the
sunshine, which only made me feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   I walked not just because of the fine weather, but because my
car developed an expensive-sounding noise just as I was mailing my
tax return. There should be a special line on the 1040 for the
Murphy's Law tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week I spent about seven hours in the health care
system, six of which involved reading old People magazines and
issues of the New York Times that seemed even older, like from 1964
or 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley K. Clark looks a little more collegiate than Gen.
William Westmoreland, though. He still used that ominous phrase
``grinding down,'' in speaking of the high-velocity mixing of metal
and men.
</P>
<P>
   Not to get too personal. You don't care. You have your problems,
too.
</P>
<P>
   I sit here contemplating the cost of new brakes (less than a
cruise missile, but maybe as much as a flak vest), and wonder how
many medical bills I'll get even though all those readings of
People were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Then a message arrives from a friend, concerning the person who
failed in giving us a national health care plan, yet whose picture
fills all those magazines in doctors' waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the hell is Hillary Clinton in all this?'' e-mails my
friend. ``And her b.s. about caring for children? And the
village?''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, all the villages have been leveled, and now it takes a
very big refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   I don't blame Hillary for keeping a relatively low profile. She
has to run for office, and the other day she did criticize Congress
for trying to cut international spending.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope my 1/100 of a cruise missile doesn't count as
international spending.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this is not satire: Hillary Clinton is writing another
book, ``An Invitation to the White House,'' on how the Clintons
entertain guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help yourself to some coffee. May I take your check? I mean,
check your coat? The pizza will be along shortly.''

NEW BARBIE ITEM: TIME WILL TELL

<P>
   Contained in information about Timex's new line of
Barbie-doll-themed wristwatches is an amazing statistic: The
average American girl who collects Barbies has 10 of the dolls. And
now there's more Barbie stuff to collect.
</P>
<P>
   Each timepiece in the six-style line features a Barbie doll in a
different pose and outfit and incorporates design features such as
flower- and heart-shaped cases. Straps are either ``jelly'' resins
or washable, Scotchgarded elastic fabric. All the watches are
water-resistant and come with Timex's Kids Loss Protection Plan,
which allows a lost watch to be replaced within a year of purchase
for $10.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie watches went on sale at the beginning of the month. They
cost about $25 and are available at most of the 80,000 retail
outlets that carry Timex products, as well as stores that sell
Barbies.

   TIME AND TEMPERATURE: For the meteorology geek of your
acquaintance, the Wind &AMP; Weather catalog offers a way to keep in
touch with how warm or cool it is at the same time as he checks his
watch: stainless-steel-and-glass thermometer cuff links.
</P>
<P>
   One registers in Fahrenheit, the other Celsius. The quirky
catalog observes, ``They'll provide you with the perfect reply to
those who make off-the-cuff weather remarks like, `Is it hot enough
for you?'''
</P>
<P>

   A Web site called the Diploma Factory will, for $20, dummy up a
personalized and customized degree, with an embossed gold seal and
tri-color ribbons on a heavy cream-colored ``sheepskin'' stock,

looks authentic, but closer inspection reveals that much of the

``Life's A Bitch and Then You Die.''

IT AIN'T HEAVY, IT'S MICROSOFT

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Where do you want to go today?'' the Microsoft
Corp. ads lamely inquire. No wonder this outfit has an image
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a livelier slogan, one that accurately describes many
Microsoft products: ``Two pounds in a one-pound bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's habit of cramming extra features into each new
product has its benefits. Microsoft's Web browsers, for instance,
are full of clever and delightful gadgets that I didn't know I
needed until I tried them. But often, the same design philosophy
gives you products that are too large and complex to get out of
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   The problem extends even to Microsoft's efforts in the palmtop
computing field. The company's Windows CE operating system
shoehorns a hefty subset of full-fledged Windows into a package
large enough to threaten irreparable harm to your shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on the road this week, visiting several West Coast
technology firms and trying out one of the latest Windows CE
devices _ the Compaq Aero, a $450 personal digital assistant that
offers more assistance than I know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose many a gadget freak will freak over the Aero, with its
color touch screen and its built-in sound capabilities. So why does
this product leave me cold?After all, from the standpoint of sheer
technical capability, the Aero impressive. I've been comparing it
to the Palm Pilot IIIx, one of the latest in 3Com's red-hot line of
pocket assistants. And the Palm Pilot's feature list seems rather
paltry compared to the Aero.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero screen is in color, compared to the Palm Pilot's
monochrome. The Aero can download, store and play back music and
spoken-word recordings from the Internet. It's got a built-in
microphone so you can use it as a digital tape recorder during
business meetings. Like the Palm Pilot, the Aero will let you enter
data by writing on the screen, using a modified writing method that
takes hours to master. But the Aero will also let you scrawl notes
in your own handwriting on an electronic notepad that stores an
image of your scribblings.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rather slick. But I soon realized that these fancy
Windows CE extras have almost nothing to do with the way I work.
</P>
<P>
   A color screen? Who needs it? It merely assures that the Aero
will devour more battery power. In fact, the device uses a
rechargeable battery, rather than the cheap standard AAA's that
drive a Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pack a recharger for the trip, instead of buying spare
batteries at the local Walgreen's. Those rechargeable batteries
also mean extra weight.
</P>
<P>
   I can slip a Palm Pilot into my jacket pocket and almost forget
it's there; the Aero thumps against my chest with every step.
</P>
<P>
   Sound recording? Nice, but it eats up available memory for other
uses. You'll need costly flash memory cards if you want to record
more than a few minutes. It's easier to buy a cheap tape recorder
at Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   The notepad? I have terrible handwriting, and the Aero makes it
look worse. Besides, why bother? Has the world run out of paper?
</P>
<P>
   The only Aero features I've found useful are its appointment
calendar, to-do list and address book _ the same features you'll
find in any Palm Pilot. Or, for that matter, in the most underrated
pocket assistant of them all _ Franklin Electronics' Rex, a $100
device only slightly larger than a business card that runs on
disposable watch batteries. I first tried one a couple of years
ago, and I still put the Rex at the top of the list for convenience
and value.
</P>
<P>
   So does Intel chairman Andrew Grove, by the way. Figuring him
for a fellow gadget freak, I showed him my Aero the other day. He
turned up his nose at it and began singing the praises of the Rex.
But you can't jot notes to yourself with a Rex, I noted. ``I just
use paper,'' Grove replied. Me too, Andy.
</P>
<P>
   With its abundance of features, Windows CE may have a bright
future in larger devices like minilaptop computers and interactive
television set-top boxes. But to conquer the palmtop computing
market, Microsoft should either slim down its software or launch a
new line of clothing with oversized, triple-reinforced pockets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Julie Garwood doesn't stray far from the formula that's made her
a best-selling author with her latest historical romance, ``The
Ransom'' (Pocket Books, $24).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some best-selling romance novelists who seem to be
churning out new books with weaker and weaker plot lines, Garwood
doesn't sell her readers short with this hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   Set in England in medieval times, the book focuses on Gillian,
who was separated from her sister, Christen, when the girls were
forced to leave their ancestral home after it was attacked by Baron
Alford, a loyal follower of King John.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, when the girls left, they took with them a box
of jewels the king desperately wants, and Alford won't be happy
until he gets the box back.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Scottish chieftains Brodick Buchanan and Ramsey Sinclair,
characters from Garwood's ``The Secret,'' who resolve to reunite
the now-grown sisters and help them fight for their home. Things
don't go smoothly, of course, but that's the fun of the book.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who have missed the characters of ``The Secret'' will be
glad to be reunited in Garwood's latest.

HANCOCK CHIEF FINDS MARATHON SAFER BET THAN THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- From a chair in his all-windows office on the 59th
floor of the Hancock tower, David D'Alessandro can see past the
Common, past the airport, and nearly to Olympic headquarters in
Switzerland. Is that His Excellency Juan Antonio Samaranch sidling
toward the egress of the Chateau de Vidy?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's looking for the door, looking for an exit here,''
muses D'Alessandro, who has been observing the Lords of the Rings
with a more critical eye than most these last few months.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alessandro seems a bit more preoccupied with what's
happening in Lausanne than in Boston on the eve of the 103d Boston
Athletic Association Marathon, it may be that he's got $40 million
tied up in tarnished Olympic rings. And that the Marathon, which
dates back to the year after the first modern Olympics and which
the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. has sponsored since
1986, has been on quiet cruise for years now with few bumps in the
macadam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people miss the controversy about the race,'' says
D'Alessandro, who got Hancock involved with the Marathon when he
was its corporate communications chief and is now president. ``It's
getting a little dull without the controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that D'Alessandro is complaining. Hancock modernized and
revitalized the race when it was in danger of becoming a
19th-century curiosity and arguably has made it the planet's most
attractive and competitive 26-miler outside of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few marathons that have a great mystique about
them,'' says D'Alessandro. ``This one does. It's world-renowned and
people will come from all over to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the insurance company has signed on through 2008 and has a
five-year option after that. Not so for the Olympics, whose recent
travails have had D'Alessandro popping his cork since the Salt Lake
City payoff scandal broke in December. Until the International
Olympic Committee cleaned up its act, D'Alessandro said, Hancock
was wiping the five-ringed logo off its annual report, letterhead,
and billboards and pulling $20 million in NBC advertising off the
table.
</P>
<P>
   And if the IOC's announced cleanup ends up being half-hearted
and half-baked, D'Alessandro asserted this week, Hancock won't
renew its sponsorship for the 2001-2004 quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yet to be seen what they'll do when the media spotlight
is off them,'' he says. ``The IOC has a tradition of minimizing
what they have to do. I think we'll see some reform, but probably
not anywhere near what we need to. And if we don't see enough,
we're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just out of the IOC, but out of the US Olympic Committee and
Salt Lake City, too. ``In the Olympic movement, you're either in or
out,'' D'Alessandro says. ``I don't think the public makes a
distinction between Salt Lake City's rings and the USOC's rings and
the IOC's rings. They see rings.''
</P>
<P>
   You are what you sponsor, he believes. If you sponsor tarnished
goods, then the public perceives you as tarnished, too. Tarnish, of
course, can be removed over time, which is why Hancock is stepping
up to the plate for a whack at the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides signing on as Major League Baseball's financial services
sponsor, the company will underwrite the weeklong Fanfest when the
All-Star Game comes to Fenway Park for the first time in 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a smart move for a company like ours,'' says
D'Alessandro. ``Aside from what Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa did
last year, the sport has a lot of advantages. It has 162 games.
It's a great spring-summer-fall plug for the schedule. And it's
having a resurgence among young people. Baseball is probably one of
the more credible sports properties around at the moment, and it's
undervalued because of the problems they had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro may be up to his ears in demutualization and
diversification, his company's current D-words, but he still has a
sports marketer's soul in a city that barely recognized the concept
until Hancock showed the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sports-oriented town, this has not been a sports
marketing town,'' D'Alessandro says. ``It's been a town of signage
being called sports marketing. If you put up two signs at the
FleetCenter and sponsor the third-quarter break, that doesn't make
you a sports marketer. It makes you an advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock doesn't sponsor the Marathon because it loves potholes
and blisters. The company sponsors it because its headquarters is
right at the finish line and because the race is a civic heirloom
that came at a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like two-fers,'' says D'Alessandro. ``Things that give us
an opportunity to help our community but are also national
events.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Hancock has hooked up with the Mass. Sports
Partnership to bring in marquee events such as the 1996 and 2000
Olympic gymnastics trials and the 2001 US figure skating
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure skating and gymnastics are the top two Olympic
television sports,'' says D'Alessandro. ``We can put them on tour
in 30 or 40 cities where we have offices (Hancock is sponsoring the
Champions on Ice circuit, which stops at the FleetCenter for two
shows Sunday) and we get a chance to have the championships in our
hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, though, that Hancock will underwrite any
sporting event that hits town for a weekend. Though the company
will do corporate hospitality and some signage at the Ryder Cup at
The Country Club in September, it won't be a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Golf doesn't make sense for Hancock. Neither do tennis (sorry,
Longwood), rowing (ditto, Head of the Charles) or soccer (what
women's World Cup?).
</P>
<P>
   Sponsoring golf, D'Alessandro says, is about bragging rights for
CEOs in their country-club locker rooms. ``They can beat their
chests for the weekend,'' he says, ``and hand out a giant check
with Greg Norman looking at them cross-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis is pricey, he says, and Boston doesn't get a top field
any more. ``Players can pick and choose now because they have so
many tournaments,'' D'Alessandro says. ``Longwood attracts a fair
amount of has-beens and never-weres.''
</P>
<P>
   The Head, he says, ``is a little too highbrow, it's not
televised, and we can't get a bang out of touring it.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't mention the f-word (as in futbol). ``If I hear one
more person say soccer is the coming sport in America . . . ''
D'Alessandro says. ``The fact that children play soccer, the fact
that we have a zillion soccer Moms and Dads, the fact that we have
a lot of soccer being played in high school and college is
irrelevant to mass audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that marathoning is any marketing slam-dunk, and
D'Alessandro concedes that. It makes for dreadful television, it's
weak for signage, and there hasn't been a top American contender
since the Reagan era. Hancock is no longer involved with the New
York (``It's become a fun race'') or Los Angeles events. But
Boston, the granddaddy of road races, has been grandfathered. ``We
have to be here.'' he says. At least until someone yanks the tower
off Clarendon Street and moves it to Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro on: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MARATHON: ``I'd like the race to be bigger. We've discovered
you can handle 50,000 people on the course and there's some talk
about expanding it next year. It'd be better to be a bigger race
without being a show business race. One of the great things is that
it's virtually a non-commercial race from a television and fan
standpoint. I'm not sure how to improve it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES RACES: ``New York has become pretty
much a fun race, less competitive. (Race director) Al Steinfeld and
those guys will argue about that, but they generally don't have
more than 10 real world-class runners in the race. LA has none. So
the only world-class marathon is in Boston.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LACK OF A US MEN'S CONTENDER: ``I'm sure we'll have one
again sometime, but I'm afraid we'll have just one and not a
contingent of them like the Kenyans do. We've had some good
American runners in the 10Ks and that's part of the problem. They
can run a 10K every weekend. They can pick up $10,000 or $20,000
and run again. Given a choice of running a smattering of 10Ks or
having to kill themselves running a marathon twice a year . . . '' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAMARANCH: ``I think he'll declare victory, then exit. But the
likelihood of his great dream, of attaining the Nobel Peace Prize,
is gone. So right now, it's about salvaging his reputation and
ostensibly leaving the Olympic movement in reasonable shape.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IOC REFORMS: ``I desperately wanted to support what they did in
Lausanne last time. I was hoping they would do more, but I didn't
see anything. Maybe I missed it.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE OLYMPIC IMAGE: ``For the rest of our lifetimes, the Olympics
will have fallen from favor because people will have seen something
they hadn't seen in the past _ the greed and the avarice and the
privilege behind the scenes.''

FOR BISCUIT SNOBS, A SCONE FOR ALL TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scones are nothing more than biscuits with snob appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Both breakfast breads are made in single-size servings and taste
dandy topped with butter and jam. And they are both made with
flour, fat and fluid. The difference is the kind of fat and how
much fluid. And, unlike biscuits, scones are perfectly acceptable
dressed in cream.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for exceptional scone recipes, we discovered a
few things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweet (unsalted) butter makes scones with a better texture
than margarine or shortening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scones placed on a preheated baking sheet cook faster and
result in a less doughy scone.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's faster to make scones with a baking mix, such as
Bisquick, but the result is too salty and too cake-like to be
called a scone.
</P>
<P>
   Scones (pronounced SKON) are an invention of the Scots and are
said to have been named after the Stone of Destiny (scone), where
the coronation of Scottish kings was once held, according to the
``Food Lovers' Companion,'' by Sharon Tyler Herbst. This royal
connection may explain why crowning a biscuit with clotted cream _
a rich, high-fat, semi-solid cream _ is a tradition in the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scones were made from oats and baked on the stove in
a round griddle (think corn pone) and then cut into wedges. Today,
scones are more often prepared with wheat flour, rolled out and cut
like biscuits and baked in an oven. But don't go searching for the
rolling pin yet. You can make scones without using the heavy
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Simply mix your scone dough and then knead briefly on a floured
surface. Then, pat the dough into a 1/2-inch-thick circle and cut
with a sharp knife into wedges. You can cut the scones with a
biscuit cutter, but then you have to pat the scraps into a new
round and cut some more until all the dough is used.
</P>
<P>
   For a finishing touch, brush the scones with lightly beaten egg
before baking. The tops will emerge golden brown, shiny and just
barely crisp. If you want, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, seeds or
grated cheese after applying the egg wash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASIC SCONES
</P>
<P>
   (Makes about 12 scones)
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup cold butter, cut into cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk or more if needed
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   Place baking sheet in oven, on a rack placed one notch above
center, and heat to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut in
butter with a pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Stir in
sugar and fruit, nuts, cheese or other additions, if using.
</P>
<P>
   Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add egg and
milk. Mix with a large fork (one from a carving set works well),
until mixture forms a soft dough. Add more milk, a tablespoon at a
time, if needed to keep mixture from being too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead lightly for 30
seconds to form a smooth dough. Divide dough in half and pat each
half into a circle, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut into circles into
wedges. Brush wedges with beaten egg and sprinkle with topping, if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Place on hot baking sheet in oven and cook for 10 minutes or
until risen and golden brown. Remove from oven and move with a
spatula to a wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want your scones to be a bit more jazzy, add one of these
ingredient combinations to our basic scone recipe just before
adding the liquid:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1 tablespoon orange zest
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup currants and 1 tablespoon grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup chopped dates and 1 tablespoon grated orange rind
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 3 tablespoons chopped
fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 tablespoons parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese,
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   _ Use 1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all-purpose
flour. Add 1 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2
teaspoon dried oregano. Serve with garlic butter
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/4 cup poppy seeds, substitute orange juice for milk and add
1 teaspoon orange peeled apple
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute dark brown sugar for granulated, add 1/4 teaspoon
ground cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/2 cup currants

GERMAN DESIGNER INTRODUCES COLOR TO WEST COAST FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Escada, Munich's finest design house, produces
the kind of clothes that talk in bold-face capital letters. These
are not the whisperingly polite unconstructed draperies of Giorgio
Armani nor are they the luxuriously quiet classics of Oscar de la
Renta or Bill Blass. These are big, bold, bawdy, obvious clothes
for women who are exceedingly happy with their bodies and sure of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can carry colors like ``Escada red'' _ a bright
cardinal _ worked into everything from velvet and wool to carved
leathers with matching fox collars and cuffs. And not everyone can
carry enough beading and gilt trim to decorate one of Mad King
Ludwig of Bavaria's Rhine castles. The point being: These are
clothes for women who have real figures and large personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking violets need not aspire.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco Wednesday night, at an event celebrating the
20th anniversary of Escada, the German company pulled out all the
stops, bringing in some of their favorite models and 134 separate
ensembles, from the sophistication and edginess of tough chic black
leather set off with black fox to the studied innocence of the
ultimate princess wedding gown in voluminous snowflake printed
tulle and beading.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there was color (lots of it in an homage to Yves
Saint Laurent's winter-palette brights), there were ``smokings''
(again, homage to Saint Laurent, who patented the men's formal
clothes for women look in the early '70s) and there were the huge,
stately and quite formidable ball gowns which San Francisco women
love to buy for the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the troops from the People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals have made no inroads in Munich, given the amount of fur
featured in this collection. There were collars, there were cuffs,
there were whole coats in natural red fox, butterscotch squirrel
and silver mink; there were balls of it decorating animal-print
patchwork capes; there were ``collars'' of it trimming boot tops
and halos of it around hoods.
</P>
<P>
   And if truth be known, it was pretty and wintry and probably
nothing that would sell to be worn in San Francisco. But for the
city's skiing population or the internationals who freeze their
posteriors in Paris in the winter, it would be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, at shows like this, the faithful pull out their vintage
clothes in honor of the designer. However, some of the prettiest
(and hippest) clothing on a very good-looking crowd came from other
designers. Kathryn Keller was a knockout in a sequined, black and
white slip dress from Giorgio Armani; the sole Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, a
riotous print with black lingerie straps looked amusing and quite
sexy on Anna Bech.
</P>
<P>
   Daru Kawalkowski was fetching in a 6-year-old shocking
delphinium-blue Michael Casey that was far too short and far too
low-cut for the millennium, but what the hell, it looked great on
her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nearly balmy temperatures, San Francisco's society
types still cling to their black, which is a shame. Those who opted
for color stood out like Playskool toys.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hoganson, president of the Modern Art Council, was in Kim
Basinger's Academy Awards dress, but hers was a deep, dark
aubergine with a bustle big enough to serve dinner on.
</P>
<P>
   The whole 1998 Basinger story, by the way, has entered into the
annals of Escada lore. Marie-Louise (LuLu) Berg, the director of
international public relations for Escada, explained it: ``Kim had
seen the Escada Couture dress on the cover of Vogue and decided she
had to have it. It came in the wrong color (it was light blue, she
wanted green). We brought in a seamstress from Germany, bought the
fabric at a store in Los Angeles on a Friday and stayed up 72 hours
and had it to her for Monday night.''

BETTER IF YOUR HEART GOT STOLEN, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Joyriders'' presents a dilemma: It's a movie that's easy
to root for, but hard to recommend. On the plus side, it's small
and offbeat, it has a likable cast and its heart is in the right
place. Those qualities can't quite overcome the movie's slack
direction and sledgehammer script.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those movies that actors say they're drawn to
because they ``believe'' in the message. ``The Joyriders'' even
snagged a recent Oscar-winner, Martin Landau, who plays Gordon
Trout, a mopey and borderline suicidal old man. Things haven't gone
well for Trout since his business failed 15 years ago, and now his
marriage is in trouble, and he's once again close to ending it all.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a mall parking lot, three teen-age runaways weasel
their way into Trout's car and almost inadvertently shanghai him on
a road trip from Seattle to Arizona. Asking you if you think that
the quartet will eventually bond is like asking you if you think
that the movie will end with a credit roll. But one of the teens,
Jodi (Elisabeth Moss), is nicer than the others, and Trout and Jodi
begin to take on an awkward surrogate grandfather-granddaughter
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's agenda becomes clear when Kris Kristofferson shows
up as a folksy preacher who, of course, was once a rowdy kid just
like immature homeless kid Cam (''The Faculty's'' Shawn Hatosy, in
an energetic performance) and Cam's slightly more mature girlfriend
Crystal (''Party of Five's'' Heather McComb). It's all about
forgiveness and redemption, underscored by Kristofferson's
inspirational messages and a soundtrack that not-so-subtly switches
from screaming guitars to contemporary Christian rock.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to want to like a movie with such a positive
attitude, especially when it's knowing enough to give its
characters some key flaws. But director Bradley Battersby often
leaves his actors adrift; only the professionalism of the lead cast
keeps it from getting lost, and the supporting cast founders in
contrived and underwritten roles. Battersby, who co-wrote with Jeff
Spiegel, also must share blame for the movie's increasingly
heavy-handed final half-hour and for the way its characters act not
out of logic, but out of convenience to the script. For example, if
you had to make an important phone call that might help you escape
kidnappers, would you be waving a gun at a hotel clerk?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie does fill a niche that too often goes unfilled
_ family-oriented, uplifting entertainment. If you're among the
handful of folks who checked out such little-seen fare as last
year's ``Second Chances'' and ``The Ride,'' this might be worth
your time and money. But it's not much more than a TV-movie that
somehow got some big-screen play.

<P>
   Q: What's the origin of the term ``quisling''?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.P., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Winston Churchill popularized the use of ``quisling'' to
describe traitors, according to ``The Wit &AMP; Wisdom of Winston
Churchill'' by James C. Humes.
</P>
<P>
   When Churchill talked about ``these vile quislings within our
midst'' in 1943, he was referring to Vidkun Quisling, a leader of
Norway when it was occupied by Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Quisling urged Hitler to take over Norway and declared himself
its leader after Germany invaded in 1940. His government lasted
only a week, but he was named minister president in 1942 and sent
nearly 1,000 Jews to the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   After Norway was liberated, Quisling was found guilty of treason
and executed in October 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just heard that the boy who played Fred Savage's best
friend on ``The Wonder Years'' is now Marilyn Manson. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.S., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: There's enough of a resemblance to fuel a dozen World Wide
Web sites, but Josh Saviano has been attending Yale University
rather than touring the world as a shock rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a dozen e-mails a week asking if it's true,'' Saviano
told the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1997. He played Paul Pfeiffer on
``Wonder Years'' and graduated from Yale last year.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, joined his
band in 1989 when Saviano was 13 and still working on the TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Michael T. Weiss and Andrea Parker of
``The Pretender,'' and what are their upcoming movies?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.P., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to any member of the cast in care of The Pretender,
6250 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills, CA 91367.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who previously starred in ``Jeffrey'' and ``Freeway,''
will be appearing this year in the film ``Net Worth.'' Parker has
not announced any upcoming movie projects.

RUSHDIE ROCKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coming to record stores soon: a new U2 album that
contains a song, called ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' with music
by Bono and lyrics by Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   The most acclaimed novelist to come out of India in decades; the
author of ``Midnight's Children,'' ``The Moor's Last Sigh,'' and,
most famously, ``The Satanic Verses,'' whose jibes at Islam stirred
the Ayatollah Khomeini to pronounce a death sentence against him,
forcing the otherwise gregarious writer into a decade of hiding _
that Salman Rushdie is, all of a sudden, composing rock 'n' roll
songs?
</P>
<P>
   How this came to be is a tale of such improbable linkages that
it sounds like something out of a Rushdie novel itself.
</P>
<P>
   His new novel, also called ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet'' _
which simultaneously hit bookstores in 13 countries Tuesday _ is
the sprawling saga of a pair of legendary rock stars. To give it an
extra dose of realism (even if mainly of the ``magic'' variety),
Rushdie felt compelled to write some lyrics that the characters
presumably sang.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie has been friends with Bono, ever since U2's leader
brought the author on stage during a 1993 concert at Wembley
Stadium in London as a sign of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested in supporting me in my time of trouble,''
Rushdie recalls (``to use a phrase from the Beatles,'' he adds
parenthetically). So when Rushdie wrote this rock novel, he sent a
copy of the manuscript to Bono, who liked it so much that he set
one of its songs to music. ``He turned it into a wonderful song, a
lovely song,'' Rushdie says.
</P>
<P>
   We will, for the moment, have to take his word here. Rushdie is
in New York to publicize the novel, sitting in his literary agent's
midtown office, but there are no tapes of the song available.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just doing the album now, and it won't be out until
September,'' Rushdie says, a bit apologetically. ``I sort of like
the fact that they're not coming out at the same time. I don't want
people to see the book as the springboard for a U2 song.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly seems likely. A more pertinent concern might be
whether it is any longer possible to see a new Salman Rushdie novel
as simply a novel _ and not a thinly disguised meditation on the
nightmare that has overtaken his own life these past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie himself makes it difficult to do so. The new novel
starts out on Feb. 14, Valentine's Day, 1989, with an earthquake
that swallows up the tales rock-superstar heroine _ and it's
impossible to sweep aside the fact, as Rushdie himself has recently
reminded us in a widely published essay, that this was the date
when the Ayatollah's fatwa engulfed Rushdie in an earthquake all
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of acknowledging that fact,'' Rushdie says of the
coincidence. But, he adds, he also meant it as a cleansing device,
a way of bringing the whole business to a close. ``I wanted to give
the date another meaning, for myself,'' he says. ``It has become a
very polluted date. It's hard for me to think of it as a day of
love. Now, I can think of it also as the date when the book begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say this,'' he goes on. ``I was very appreciative of
the way people in this country rallied around and gave me support,
in many different ways. What I want most, now, is for people to let
me get back to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He knows this is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the Iranian government formally lifted the
fatwa, which makes the peril, as he puts it, ``different but not
over.'' It's not that he fears freelance fanatics. ``That's not the
danger,'' he says. ``The only attack has been from the Iranian
government, specifically the Ministry of Intelligence. Insofar as
something remains a problem, it's that the Iranian regime is still
a divided regime. We can't be sure all the factions of the regime
have signed on.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes, though, that he does not lead as cloistered a
life as many people think _ and hasn't for many years. ``These
things that were written _ that I was sleeping in a different place
each night _ that was never true,'' he says, though ``the first six
months, I was probably in seven or eight different apartments,
which is disruptive enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, though, he moved about a bit more freely, to
restaurants, parties, movies, concerts. Although he acknowledges
that he lives in London, he adds, ``Any more than that, I'm not
saying.'' Asked if he leads a normal life, he replies, ``Normal,
but with security'' _ a reference to the British security police
who escort him everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, he will probably never again feel completely safe,
or entirely normal.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, forms a theme of his new novel: the urge to escape
one's roots, to wander from one culture and world to the next _
yet, at the same time, the desperate need for home, foundations,
and routine. Rushdie's narrator (or is it the author himself, in
one of many philosophic asides?) writes at one point of ``how
people behave when their dailiness is destroyed. . . . Calamity
fixes them with her mesmeric eye, and they begin to scoop and paw
at the rubble of their days, trying to pluck the memory of the
quotidian _ a toy, a book, a garment, even a photograph _ from the
garbage heaps of the irretrievable, of their overwhelming loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader can't help but wonder: Is this how Rushdie felt in
the initial panic of the fatwa?
</P>
<P>
   Like Rushdie, the book's three main characters _ the narrator (a
dyspeptic photographer named Umeed ``Rai'' Merchant), the
legendary-mystic songwriter Ormus Cama, and his lover, the
torchsinger Vina Apsara _ roam Bombay, London, and New York, at
once straddling and standing apart from all three.
``Outsidedness,'' the narrator calls this state, and his characters
spend much of the tale trying, in their own ways, to find the
``route through the looking glass,'' to burst through ``the secret
turnstile'' that will transform confusion into transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie means to propose _ half-humorously, which makes the
other half all the more serious _ that rock 'n' roll might be this
unifying force. Ormus Cama claims to be ``nothing less than the
secret originator, the prime innovator, of the music that courses
in our blood, that possesses and moves us, wherever we may be, the
music that speaks the secret language of all humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Rushdie is enough of a humorist to have the narrator
laugh at such loftiness and to have his cosmic heroine, Vina
Apsara, speak in upward inflections, like a Valley Girl (``I did
that as a way of not making her too grand,'' Rushdie says). But,
beneath the ironies and deprecations, he seems to believe it, sort
of.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it has been for much of his generation (Rushdie was born in
1947), rock was a source of liberation. ``Rock is the music that's
under my skin the most,'' he says. ``I listen to music all the
time, except when I write.'' The Beatles, the Stones, and Paul
Simon are his favorites, but, he adds, ``I like some of the new
people, too. I like REM, Lauryn Hill, Jewel. I'm a pretty big
Madonna fan, I must say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all need some way of being told, `It's all right,'
'' he goes on. ``Some people find it in music, in love, in God, in
art. I feel it in all those things _ except religion.'' He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' he continues, ``I wanted to write a love story, so
I thought about how one would write a contemporary love story that
wasn't fashionably hip and cynical or all romantic and gushy. I
thought about the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. I thought about the
main character _ so he's a singer. What sort of singer? I didn't
want to be stuck in an opera house. So, he's got to be a rock 'n'
roll singer. That's when the book clicked into place.''
</P>
<P>
   What about writing those pop songs? In the novel, Ormus and Vina
lead the greatest rock band in history. They convulse whole
cultures, spawn heroic myths, trigger literal earthquakes. Had John
Lennon, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, and Madonna all been
rolled into one phenomeon, they still would not quite have matched
the impact of these two characters. So didn't Rushdie _ who can't
sing or play an instrument or write poetry _ feel a bit
presumptuous, nervous, writing lyrics ascribed to such titans?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no,'' he says, then giggles. ``The reason is, I didn't
feel they were my lyrics. If I'd said, `I'm sitting down and
writing a pop song,' nothing would have happened. I didn't allow
myself to be scared. If you're inside the character and you can
write his dialogue, you can write his interior monologue; you
should be able to write his songs, too. They're in the same place
in his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   (For browsers, the title song's lyrics are on page 475 _ though
don't overlook a nifty take-off of Paul Simon's ``You Can Call Me
Al'' on page 290.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed making this outrageous proposition that the biggest
act in the history of rock 'n' roll was these two Indian singers,''
Rushdie says. ``This was part of the skewed universe I was
creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make a mistake of what a `realistic' novel is,'' he
goes on. ``It has nothing to do with technique. Realism is not
about kitchen-sink naturalism. It's an attempt to give as true a
vision of the world you live in. To do this, you may have to employ
techniques that are not realistic. As a reader, I like to see the
writer offering me a vision of the world _ the greater the writer,
the more unique that vision is.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what's Salman Rushdie's vision of the world? ``Grim,'' he
replies, ``with lots of jokes.'' And he laughs.

TITANIC: SMALL TRAGEDY IN A BRUTAL CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ The date: April 15, 1912. The time: 2:20 a.m.
The disaster: A steamship collides with an iceberg; 1,542 people
die.
</P>
<P>
   For a significant number of Americans, the tragedy of the
Titanic is more compelling than our involvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are: What is it about the Titanic that so
fascinates late 20th century America? And what does this
fascination say about us? It can't be only the movie, successful as
it was, because ``Titanic'' _ with its 11 Oscars, its swelling
music, and its doomed, blue-lipped hero _ was only the latest in a
very long list of Titanic-related creations.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to the movie's release (back when James
Cameron's name was a running joke on Entertainment Tonight) the
mid-1990s had already produced three Titanic novels, plus a
half-dozen non-fiction titles (including a cookbook with authentic
``last night'' recipes), numerous PBS documentaries and a handful
of television movies.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a musical, which won a Tony in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one reason for our interest in the Titanic is the
story itself: steerage passengers trapped below deck, the captain
going down with his ship, the evil managing director of the line
surviving while many of his crew and his passengers perish. A
maiden voyage. Ignored ice warnings. Not enough lifeboats. ``Women
and children first.'' The disasters and ironies abound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, history is replete with disasters and ironies _ and
ironic disasters. There is something about the Titanic which goes
beyond irony, and this ``something'' says much about our concerns
in these waning years of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   One major concern _ captured by the Titanic's unforgivably
upbeat tag line, ``the unsinkable ship'' _ involves technology, and
our dependence upon it in modern life. At a time when some people
are braced for world-stopping millennium bug computer chaos while
others promise there's nothing whatever to fear, the Titanic
intrigues us because it so dismally demonstrates the dangers of
expecting (and counting on) technological perfection.
</P>
<P>
   While it's unclear whether our current worries about technology
are well-founded suspicions or Luddite hysteria, what's certain is
that the Titanic provides a powerful metaphor in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of honor. While history shows there
was somewhat less honor on board than we'd like to believe (plenty
of women and children died; plenty of men survived), there still
was great honor and courage displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Would such honor exist today? Would a modern man, in this
post-feminist age, offer his place on a lifeboat _ offer his life _
for a modern woman or child? If the answer _ as many suspect _ is
``no,'' what does this say about us? And, finally, there is the
scale of the disaster _ the size of the casualty list, and the
individuality of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   We have achieved much in this century, but we also have seen
more human slaughter than in any other period in human history.
</P>
<P>
   World wars, civil wars, genocide, revolution: Unnatural deaths
in the 20th century have occurred in such vast numbers that
sometimes numbers are all we see; we cannot feel for the
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanic produced death on a small enough scale to evoke a
sense of individual tragedy. We can properly mourn and respect
every death because, while so many died, not enough died to blur
into mere bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Titanic haunts us, not only because the story made a
good movie, or the movie told a good story, but because the tragedy
of her sinking brings up certain pressing concerns _ concerns which
remain, like the iceberg, not easy to see, but dangerous to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   She will sink for the last time only when _ and only if _ we, in
some happier century, accept the limits of our technologies, feel
confident in our collective honor, and finally put an end to the
myriad major tragedies that make the Titanic tragedy ultimately so
minor and so compelling.

 &HT;    With space race over, Huntsville diversifies
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ Rocket City is taking off _ again. But this
time the final frontier isn't outer space, it's the outer fringes
of town.
</P>
<P>
   This city made famous by the race to the moon is spreading and
sprawling. In just the last four years, Huntsville and its county,
Madison, have seen a 62 percent increase in housing permits. They
have had a 13 percent growth in population since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear, even among the clutter of fast-food restaurants
on U.S. 72 and the mushrooming trail of subdivisions cropping up
alongside farmland in Jones Valley, this is the place the late
Wernher von Braun built. He and his collection of dreamers,
scientists and German families have touched nearly every foundation
in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The town had fewer than 20,000 people in the early 1950s when it
became the site of the nation's rocket development program. As NASA
rushed to put astronauts on the moon and the Cold War continued,
Huntsville thrived. It has grown nearly ninefold, to 174,000
people. But in the last few decades, federal government jobs began
to shrivel up.
</P>
<P>
   NASA announced four years ago it was cutting space jobs in town
by 30 percent. That forced Huntsville, the city nestled between the
Tennessee River and northeast Alabama's Appalachian Mountains, to
start learning to stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to start from scratch. Leaders heeded what
von Braun told them during the 1950s: To be a truly great town,
they needed a research university and a research park. The
University of Alabama at Huntsville was born. So was the 3,800-acre
Cummings Research Park, which chamber officials say is the second-
largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The brainpower already drawn to the area is branching out from
the focus on space and defense to the software, telecommunications
and biomedical fields. In at least six of the past eight years,
Madison County has led Alabama in job growth. Between 1994 and
1997, the county added 11,592 jobs. Successes include homegrown
companies like Research Genetics, one of the largest manufacturers
of synthetic DNA, and electronics manufacturer SCI Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there are a lot of smart people here,'' says
Brian Hilson, who is in charge of drumming up business and
development for the area chamber of commerce. ``They aren't all
doing their thing in space and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   One out of every 11 employees is an engineer, 12,000 of them in
all. When Delta began hiring for the 220 positions at its first
satellite reservations center, all but four of the first 100 people
had some college education.
</P>
<P>
   But Huntsville still has trouble getting the word out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not that well-known in the Southeast,'' Hilson
says. ``But when people do know us, they like what they see, and
they are pleasantly surprised with the sophistication and
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has its own symphony. And it just opened the EarlyWorks
museum, an interactive history center to complement its Von Braun
Civic Center and collection of historic buildings called
Constitution Village.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Watts has lived in Huntsville nearly all of her 66 years.
She has seen it grow from a small Southern town to a spreading
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had more planning and more control out in the
county, (but) I would never live in a small town again,'' says
Watts, who helped start a local land conservation group called the
Huntsville and North Alabama Land Trust. She also sells houses in
Huntsville and nearby in Madison, a booming, wealthy city. Both
cities have zoning, but the county does not. Only a few counties in
Alabama do.
</P>
<P>
   So far, smart growth and the issues of sprawl haven't exactly
become top priorities in Huntsville and Madison counties. But they
are beginning to see light.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Mayor Loretta Spencer launched a series of
meetings to measure community feelings about the city and its
vision for the next century. Participants said their four issues,
in order of importance, were public schools, race relations,
traffic flow/transportation and job growth. And they said one of
the town's major weaknesses was lack of uniform planning for
community and commercial development. City-formed committees will
be presenting their suggestions on solving the problems by the time
the city begins budget planning this month.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some people who don't typically show up at city hall
are starting to take notice. Patricia Purushotham, a librarian at
University Place Elementary School, said the issues prompted her to
write a column when the Huntsville Times newspaper asked for
opinions about the city's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of Huntsville, but we seem to keep building and then
we leave empty buildings behind,'' said Purushotham, who lives in
the city's fast-growing southeast section.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is creeping up the mountainsides. For years, homeowner
groups asked for tighter slope development, but the city is only
now working on it. And late last year, a landslide washed away part
of Monte Sano mountain, Huntsville's crown jewel. It was just a
stone's throw from the mayor's house.
</P>
<P>
   Public-private efforts have already worked to preserve the
mountain. The Land Trust has bought and preserved more than 1,500
acres in and around the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But development has been speeding up. Golf course communities
and gated neighborhoods are starting to become the rage. Just over
Huntsville Mountain, Hampton Cove is a collection of fancy
subdivisions netted together by a golf course, a fire station and
restaurants. It's advertised on billboards as the best in
small-town living, and it sports a pricey entrance with waterfalls
and fancy landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   A $750 million limited-access bypass planned for the south side
of the city could begin construction in 18 months, potentially
opening more land to development.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Jones Valley, just south of downtown Huntsville and
overlooked by Monte Sano and Huntsville mountains. The Jones family
owns hundreds of acres there.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, real estate signs have been popping up all over the
land. And some folks have been asking the Land Trust if they're
going to try to snatch up some of it before it all gets developed.
</P>
<P>
   Land Trust Director Jill Gardner is open to that. But nothing's
happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this kind of development you have to do it at the right
time,'' she says, ``because once you develop it, you can't go back.
Things have to be done now or you lose the opportunity.''

 &HT;    Environmental, business groups try to get along
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ This college city that never wants to graduate seems to
do everything with the passion of a 20-year-old. Club music zings
and tech geeks are kings. And people jealously protect their city.
</P>
<P>
   Consider environmentalists: In Atlanta, they negotiate for
parkland and struggle to persuade people to recycle and carpool. In
Austin, they dominate the City Council, mobilize voters, force
tough building restrictions directly on the ballot, scrounge up
money to protect tens of thousands of acres and squash resistance
from developers.
</P>
<P>
   Their handiwork has embroiled the state Supreme Court and
angered Texas legislators, who, frankly, never particularly liked
Austin's liberal lean, which they have to endure every time they
are in session.
</P>
<P>
   So, relationship building hasn't been a strong point. At least
not between the business community and environmental organizations.
Which is why a lunch meeting last year at a hip downtown Mexican
restaurant was so strange.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a corner table at Guerro's were opposing forces. F.
Gary Valdez, a bank president and the then-chairman of the local
chamber of commerce, was dining with Robin Rather, the president of
a high-tech market research subsidiary and the chairwoman of the
Save Our Springs Alliance, a locally powerful environmental
organization. The two agreed it wouldn't hurt to talk. They weren't
completely correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly. It was awkward. No one knew what to say,''
recalls Rather, whose father is CBS newscaster Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed to meet again. And after a series of parleys,
SOS and the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce agreed they could
work together. Some people in both organizations still have
difficulty accepting that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was,'' Valdez says, `` 'Why should you trust
them? We've never been able to trust them before.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the chamber and SOS supported referendums that
would expand a downtown convention center, begin construction of an
urban flood control project and set aside $65 million to buy and
preserve up to 15,000 acres to protect water quality.
</P>
<P>
   They both backed Mayor Kirk Watson's efforts to convince the
Computer Sciences Corp. to build a major work complex downtown
rather than in an environmentally sensitive area the corporation
had originally favored.
</P>
<P>
   SOS and a local developers group also have worked out a truce.
The two sides had been bitter adversaries, especially since 1989
when SOS succeeded in putting strict watershed protection measures
on the voting ballot. SOS said it was crucial to protect the area's
drinking water supplies, which come from the city's limestone
canyonland where soils are thin and water pollution can be
particularly damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and the chamber spent $200,000 fighting the watershed
measure and warning that it would crush Austin's growth. Voters
approved it overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Developers fought the issue all the way to the state Supreme
Court and lost. State legislators have tried to help out
developers, but so far ther efforts haven't succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The rules put sharp limits on the size of parking lots, homes
and buildings in a southwest corner of the metro area that had been
fast growing. Developers have to tag cedar, oak and other trees
over a certain size and face fines if they cut down those they are
supposed to save. They have to build a series of special catch
basins to filter rainwater running off oily parking lots.
Developers find they may need up to six times as much land as they
would for projects in portions of Austin where city officials are
more willing to see growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the headaches, chamber president Glenn E. West
acknowledges the measure hasn't been the obstacle to development
that he predicted. But he said it has driven up development costs
and some believe it has added to sprawl by pushing more affordable
projects out to suburbs like Round Rock, where rules are less
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that Austin is becoming a more expensive city
to live in, but it hasn't slowed the wave of newcomers. The metro
area's population, now just over 1 million people, is expected to
double around the year 2015. Jobs in just the last four years grew
24 percent, fueled by companies like Dell Computer Corp. and
Motorola and numerous small high-tech startups. Austin is almost
always ranked among the nation's top high-tech cities.
</P>
<P>
   It is a young and optimistic town. One in 10 Austin residents is
a student at the University of Texas or other area colleges.
Hiking, hunting and fishing are big pastimes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Zandan moved here from Massachusetts 22 years ago to
attend the University of Texas. Now 46, he still can't bring
himself to leave the city he loves, even after building
IntelliQuest, a firm that specializes in market research for
high-tech companies. The publicly traded company has 500 employees
and $50 million in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But Zandan and others worry about what continued growth will do
to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made Austin special in the first place could be lost,''
he said. ``If we don't get ahead of growth Austin will lose its
competitive edge in terms of attracting people with the quality of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of cities, Austin drivers face growing traffic jams.
Some of the worst are on Interstate 35, the main north-south
connection through the city. The interstate cuts straight down the
nation's midsection, through San Antonio, Dallas, Oklahoma City,
Kansas City and Minneapolis. But its slowest drive times are in
Austin, according to the local chamber. The problems are
compounding. The metro area is close to falling out of compliance
with federal air quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials are pushing for construction of a light rail
system and a new north-south highway. More road projects are
possible, but so are battles over them. Environmental and business
leaders agree their truce will be tested by debates over roads and
how much additional development intown areas can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to avoid slipping into the community-splitting
warfare of the past. Says West at the chamber, ``We want to conduct
ourselves in ways that when we are 2 million people _ which we will
be _ we will have the quality of life that people are still happy
they live here. That's a theme that I believe everybody can
embrace.''

WAR FILLS NEWS WHERE ONCE WAS SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between O.J., Princess Di, and Monica, the second half of 1990s
has been an era marked by tabloid story lines, insatiable 24-hour
media outlets, and news events with an apparently endless shelf
life.
</P>
<P>
   So when February's impeachment votes brought the curtain down on
the yearlong White House soap opera, some observers wondered where
a media culture seemingly addicted to this type of ratings-pumping
saga (Newsweek's Howard Fineman called it ``a kind of crack
cocaine'') would find the next megastory. Now, two months after
Bill Clinton's acquittal, a war in the Balkans is dominating
headlines and airwaves, and vying to fill that Monica void.
</P>
<P>
   As a news phenomenon, there are some ways in which the war with
Serbia conjures up the Lewinsky episode. Most notably, it is again
the ``new media'' constellation of cable news networks and Internet
sites _ with their instant news delivery and explosive growth
potential _ that are attracting eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike the Lewinsky matter _ which could be synthesized in a
few off-color jokes _ Yugoslavia is a complex geopolitical morass
that won't sink to the bottom rung of the tabloid media ladder. And
even if Slobodan Milosevic isn't the water-cooler conversation
starter that Lewinsky was, the Kosovo crisis could prove to become
an immensely more compelling news event than White House
hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a traditional news story rather than an all-media news
story,'' says media analyst Andrew Tyndall. ``It doesn't cross over
into entertainment. . . . Leno can't crack jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pew Research Center director Andrew Kohut says
his ``news interest index'' for the war far exceeds Lewinsky
scandal levels, suggesting that a broader cross section of
Americans are deeply interested in this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large tabloid audiences and political junkies who
drove the ratings for the Lewinsky story,'' Kohut says. With
Kosovo, more people ``feel their own interests are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Cold War world, conventional wisdom holds that
Americans have become increasingly apathetic about global matters.
In her book ``Compassion Fatigue,'' Susan Moeller explains why some
overseas events attract major media attention while others sail
below the radar screen. There are several reasons, she says, why
Kosovo falls into the former category.
</P>
<P>
   We saw pictures of ``Kosovo refugees who are white and European,
and that resonated,'' Moeller says. And comparisons between Kosovo
and Hitler and the Holocaust are ``hitting a cultural touchstone,''
she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Moeller's theory is validated by the intensity of coverage on
the ABC, CBS, and NBC nightly newscasts. Last week, according to
Tyndall, the war consumed nearly 65 percent of those programs. More
notably, the network news shows have devoted more minutes to the
Balkans conflict in each of the three weeks since hostilities
erupted than for any single week of Lewinsky coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, that hasn't translated into any ratings spike for the
newscasts. ``I don't think any of the three networks really showed
an uptick,'' says CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius. ``What seems to
have emerged is the cable networks tend to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   At MSNBC, the ratings since NATO commenced its bombing campaign
against Serbia have doubled over the three weeks prior to the war.
Fox News Channel's wartime ratings are up dramatically over the
same period last year. And CNN's average rating for the past three
weeks equals the cable network's ratings for the first three
frenzied weeks of Monica-gate in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While both have proved to be ratings boosters, cable news
executives are quick to point up the substantive differences
between the Lewinsky episode and the carnage in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was a juicy scandalous, sex-oriented . . . tale of
intrigue,'' says Fox News Channel vice president John Moody. The
other ``is a terrible thing that's happening and hundreds of
thousands of people are being displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of ``big stories have been kind of sensational
stories that were not necessarily traditional news stories. . . .
We needed the viewing public to know we could do this kind of
story,'' says MSNBC vice president and general manager Erik
Sorenson.
</P>
<P>
   While there seems to be little evidence that the war has
generated newspaper circulation increases, the Internet is seeing
dramatically increased traffic.
</P>
<P>
   CNN Interactive spokesman Kerrin Roberts says the first day of
the Balkans conflict was the second busiest day ever, trailing only
September's release of the Starr report. Although other factors
also played a role in its surge, The New York Times reports that
visits to its Web site in March were up 16 percent over February.
Since the war started, traffic on the world section of the
Washington Post's site has doubled. And The Boston Globe's ``Kosovo
package'' ranks as one of the most popular areas of its site.
</P>
<P>
   While the crisis in the Balkans is currently producing some
Lewinsky-like audience spikes for the new media, it is far more
unpredictable. And there's no telling whether the story will have
the staying power of a scandal that wended its way through the
White House, special prosecutor's office, and finally Congress for
13 long months.
</P>
<P>
   Tyndall says one potential yardstick could be America's 1992
intervention in Somalia, where media interest began to wane after
about a month or so. ``Wars,'' he notes, ``are harder things to
sustain than scandals.''

 &HT;    Casinos bring good times to not-so-sleepy Biloxi
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILOXI, Miss. _ Maxine Williams remembers Biloxi when it was a
well-kept secret among golfers, fishermen and those with family
ties to the area.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much of a secret anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Within a stone's throw of the town's beaches, where people relax
on the gray-white sand and children play close to the water's edge
along Mississippi's once slow-paced Gulf Coast, is another draw:
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, casinos have changed the face of Biloxi _ indeed,
all of Harrison County _ mixing historic richness with a dash of
Las Vegas-style glitz.
</P>
<P>
   At all hours of the day and night, people enter the casinos to
plunk down their quarters and dollars on Lady Luck at such places
as the newly opened Beau Rivage Resort, the Grand Casino and the
New Palace Casino. Hotels and multilevel parking decks dot the
area, which is slightly more than an hour's drive from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really come up,'' said Williams, a single mother of three
and employee at the New Palace Casino. ``It has really grown since
the casinos opened.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to several projects under development, including a
new mall, office buildings, new schools, scores of apartments,
single-family houses and more casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in Kansas anymore,'' said Harry B. Joachim, director
of the Biloxi Chamber of Commerce. ``The catalyst is the casinos.
Business, especially tourism, has surged. People have taken a new
look at us and found the area to be particularly strong for
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, hotel development has gone ``way crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The area's economy was once strongly dependent on shrimping and
seafood processing. Over time, those industries started to erode.
Casinos pumped new life into Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Benson, 35, knows that first-hand. ``There's a lot of
work,'' said Benson, of nearby Gulfport, who has found work as a
painter at one of the casinos. ``You can get a job almost
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ole Biloxi Schooner, a local favorite that offers such
daily specials as shrimp spaghetti, cornbread dressing and beef
stew, owner Joe Lancon said business used to be slow during the
winter months, but now it's good year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos ``have been good for the area and good for the
economy,'' said Lancon. He said the downside has been traffic jams
and concerns about air pollution. ``I guess that's progress. You
give up one for the other. Now we have a little bit of both
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Joachim said hits on the chamber's Web site have risen sharply,
largely due to inquiries about tourism or from business owners
interested in relocating to Biloxi. Recently, Joachim said, he was
contacted by businessmen interested in opening a magnetic resonance
imaging clinic and a telemarketing center.
</P>
<P>
   How does he view the growth?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen people who were on welfare now buying homes and
automobiles,'' he said. ``People have better health care. Eight or
nine years ago, the police cars couldn't operate because we
couldn't afford new tires and minor repairs. Now the police force
has doubled in size and everyone's driving new cruisers. Without a
question, it has been a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Crosby, general manager of the New Palace Casino, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Before the casinos opened, ``there was a brain drain. The sons
and daughters of the coast would leave here to go to school and
never come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of job opportunities, they are returning.
</P>
<P>
   Among developments either recently completed, under construction
or planned for Harrison County:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Beau Rivage opened last month amid much fanfare. The
casino resort includes 1,780 hotel rooms, 12 restaurants and a
small convention center.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Crossroads Mall is under construction in nearby Gulfport. The
$70 million mall, scheduled to open in mid-1999, will have 850,000
square feet of space.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hard Rock Cafe International plans to build a multi-use
project in Biloxi near the Beau Rivage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The New Palace Casino plans later this year to add a $40
million, 250-room hotel and garage. The addition is scheduled to
open later this year and will employ 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Columbia Garden Park Hospital and medical office building is
under construction in north Gulfport. The $52 million project is
slated to open in 2000 and will include a 130-bed hospital.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Grand Casino in Biloxi is building a 600-room hotel tower.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfport's neighbors, Pascagoula and Ocean Springs, also stand
to benefit from development in Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   Pascagoula-based Ingalls Shipbuilding and Chicago-based American
Classic Voyages Co. have reached an $880 million deal that calls
for the construction of two 1,900-passenger cruise ships, with the
possibility of a third. The ships will serve the Hawaiian Islands.
The deal is expected to create 5,000 jobs in Mississippi and
Hawaii. Along with the applause for new development, there are
worries that the area's roads and sewage systems are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Terese Collins, a businesswoman, environmental activist and
Biloxi native, casts a wary eye on the activity in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proper management of that growth and development is
important,'' she said. ``You either pay now or pay later. The
window opens both ways _ opportunities can become problems. We
don't want to lose the culture, history and nature of Biloxi.''
</P>
<P>
   Joachim says the area is 30 years behind on transportation
issues. He said there is a need for another east-to-west route to
run parallel to U.S. 90, where most of the casinos are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act that we've got to maintain,'' he said.
``We have to maintain the culture of the city, but I would be lying
if I said this has not been a wonderful thing for us.''

 &HT;    Charlotte challenges Atlanta as queen of malls
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE _ Once again, this fast-growing city where
marble-and-glass banking towers soar into the Carolina-blue sky is
talking trash about its big neighbor down in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte long ago grew weary of its runner-up status to
Atlanta, as that Southern capital wannabe running hard but still
trying to catch its Olympic-sized rival 235 miles to the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the outset of a ferocious battle over the expansion of
Charlotte's flagship shopping mall, SouthPark, Atlanta is getting
bashed, sometimes subtly, by people on both sides of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have an attitude about Atlanta,'' said
40-year-old Ann Wooten, a Charlotte native who opposes SouthPark's
expansion. ``I just want Charlotte to have a sustained, balanced
environment and a quality of life where people still want to live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In coming months, the Charlotte City Council will take up
SouthPark's proposed expansion, which Mayor Pro Tem Lynn Wheeler
predicted will be ``by far the bloodiest zoning decision in the
city's history.''
</P>
<P>
   SouthPark's manager, Trammel Crow Co., hopes to slap a fashion
plate on this powerful, pin-striped hometown of Bank of America and
First Union.
</P>
<P>
   Trammel Crow has secured big-name retailers Nordstrom and Saks
Fifth Avenue as anchors in SouthPark's planned expansion. The mall
can accommodate Nordstrom under current zoning, freeing the
Seattle-based upscale chain to open a 160,000-square-foot store in
2001. Saks Fifth Avenue also hopes to open in 2001, but expanding
the mall for Saks requires a City Council rezoning.
</P>
<P>
   Trammel Crow hasn't yet filed its rezoning petition in what it
says would turn Charlotte into the biggest fashion center between
Washington and Atlanta. But the developer's opponents are already
mobilizing for a City Council vote, still five months away.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fight between an influential developer and a coalition of
well-heeled residents who fear Nordstrom and Saks would spur more
development, more traffic and more headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest fears is that, like in Atlanta, developers
would buy out neighborhoods to build office parks and tear down
office buildings to construct even taller ones. Suddenly, the
SouthPark area would become a high-priced can of sardines, packed
by more people and more cars swimming through neighborhoods where
housing prices spiral northward of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   After years of explosive growth, from its resurgent downtown to
its suburban country-club enclaves, Charlotte has latched on to the
SouthPark debate as a pivotal moment in the boomtown's development.
</P>
<P>
   Will the city of a half a million people plan wisely _ or sprawl
like kudzu from a sun-drenched manure patch? Increasingly, people
who fear growth could run wild cite Atlanta as a role model to be
avoided at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A to provide for infrastructure and other needs.
</P>
<P>
   This county vs. city conflict is not new, nor solely the result
of the growth plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had some of that, and I regret that,'' Coker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, the regional planning head, downplays any territorial
squabbles among the elected officials on the coordinating
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are dedicated to their own jurisdictions, but I've seen a
tremendous amount of realization on their part that we're all in
this together,'' she said. ``They're doing a good job of keeping
their eyes on the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton County Executive Claude Ramsey says he supports both
growth and the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue to see housing developed in unincorporated
parts of the county as well as incorporated parts of the county,''
he said. ``We're looking at orderly transition. I'm all for putting
in sewers and roads.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ramsey said, he wants to be able to protect
the rights of private property owners, particularfarmer should have
the right to operate his farm that's been there. Government
shouldn't take that away from him,'' Ramsey said. ``And a farmer
should have the right to sell his property. For a lot of farmers,
that's their retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Coulter also wants to reassure property owners' concerns that
they will lose control over their land, particularly if they want
to sell or develop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already make decisions locally on a daily basis that affect
private property values,'' she said. ``This legislation does
nothing that is not already affected.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the growth plan as a tool to catalyze growth rather
than inhibit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to believe this will create opportunity,'' Coulter
said. ``We can use good information to pinpoint places where growth
makes the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, she and most others working on the plan realize
they have much difficult work ahead, particularly getting all the
competing economic and political interests to agree on it.
</P>
<P>
   Not until then will anyone be able to judge the new law, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell how good it is,'' Coulter said. ``How we
approach it and implement it will determine how good a law it is.''
</P>
<P>
   quote: ``Twenty-five percent of the growth in the Southeast in
the next 10 years will be in Atlanta. Give us that 25 percent
growth. We'll handle the roads and traffic.''

 &HT;    Columbus leads second-tier of cities in renewed growth
 &HT;    By Ernie Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the decade of the 90s metro Atlanta has been the dynamo
leading Georgia's extraordinary burst of growth, a performance that
has made the state one of the fastest growing in the region.
Lately, however, a second tier of Georgia cities has been clamoring
for notice, featuring renewed growth, a brighter outlook and higher
aspirations for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it, Atlanta is still the star
performer,'' said Jeff Humphreys, economist at the University of
Georgia. ``But there is new activity out there beyond Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underline his point, Atlanta added more jobs in 1998 _
estimated at 68,000 by Georgia State economist Donald Ratajczak _
than the combined five-year effort of Savannah, Macon, Columbus,
Augusta, Albany and Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, working from relative small existing employment bases,
the second-tier cities grew handsomely percentage wise.
</P>
<P>
   Among the faster-stepping cities, none has been more
eye-catching than Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   The old mill town on the Chattahoochee has been remaking itself
as a financial services center of sorts, driven by two major firms
_ AFLAC, the supplemental insurer, and the less well-known Total
System Services Inc., a branch of the Synovus family of companies
in Columbus. Total System's specialty is processing credit card
transactions, but the company features a package of services for
clients that even includes marketing of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Total System gave inspiration to the Columbus economy three
years ago when it decided to build a new and enlarged $100 million
company campus on the banks of the Chattahoochee, complete with a
colorful river walk for employees and the public to enjoy. A
half-mile of riverfront will be enhanced by Total System as part of
the project rising on 46 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,100 employees are already at work in new offices, and
this summer the headquarters building, complete with a soaring
five-story atrium, will be unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   The complex has been designed by Kevin Roche, the architect of
the NationsBank tower that now commands the Atlanta skyline from
Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Georgia, with some $25 million in assistance, was
instrumental in keeping Total System in Columbus at a time when
adjoining states Alabama and South Carolina were courting the
company to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   State assistance also included a boost from the Intellectual
Capital Partnership Program, which trains people at nearby Columbus
State for jobs at Total System. It functions as a partnership among
the company, the school and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason to regret our decision to stay,'' said Jim
Buntin, senior vice president at Synovus, and the overseer of the
campus development plans for Total System.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one element of the program that has made a major
difference is the ICAPP program, which could become a model for the
whole state,'' Buntin continued.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Zell Miller had an inkling the Total System decision
could be the start of something big.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you examine this, the incentive package was low compared
to what the state and the community will be getting,'' the governor
said on the day he announced the state's role in keeping Total
System.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has given me greater satisfaction than any other
announcement since I've been governor. We are producing the jobs of
the future, the jobs that I want to see in Georgia are highly
skilled, well-paid jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way it has worked out. Like a pebble in a pool,
the Total System expansion on the riverbank helped to spur develop
elsewhere in the central city.
</P>
<P>
   A new Performing Arts Center is now rising in the neighborhood,
a huge project that will cover a city block.
</P>
<P>
   Work is being completed on two historic theater projects,
including the restoration of The Springer Opera House, a huge
theater for live performances, where Columbus citizens have enjoyed
Will Rogers, W.C. Fields, and the famed actor Edwin Booth.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually completed also is the restoration of the Liberty
Theatre Cultural Center, with its centerpiece being the playhouse
where African-Americans, during the days of segregation, saw movies
and heard luminaries like Duke Ellington, Count Basie and legendary
blues singer Ma Rainey, a Columbus native, whose house is also
being restored. Even though the new Total System campus is rising
on a former textile mill site, the company bowed to
preservationists' wishes and is retaining and renovating
Calhoun-Griffith-Mott House, an old mansion said to be the last of
its kind on the riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in growth in Columbus is significant in job growth and
in rates of pay, said F. Michael Gaymon, president of the Greater
Columbus Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988, we were seventh out of seven metro areas in Georgia
in terms of pay,'' said Gaymon. ``We were so far behind, we could
scarcely see the end of the parade. Now we rank third.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the military commitment around the country is
holding or declining in many places, Columbus is still buoyed by
the presence of nearby Fort Benning, the Army's primary infantry
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base provides some $80 million a month,'' Gaymon said,
``and that could grow because a new brigade is about to be assigned
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, the base is not only a big share of the
economic foundation but it also supplies talent as military people
with technical skills return to civilian life and decide to remain
in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, if you search history, the new growth in Columbus
may have started back in 1983, when Pratt &AMP; Whitney decided to
locate a plant here to make jet engine blades,'' Gaymon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was when we got the idea we could be something other than
a mill town, and it began to establish a sense of confidence in our
city.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the passage of a controversial 1-cent sales tax in 1993
was proof that the city had aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's confidence was boosted further when it won the
showy softball site for the 1996 Olympics, giving the city a chance
to be seen around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The latest burst of pride in Columbus, he said, was the Fortune
Magazine recent designation of Synovus Financial, owner of Total
System, as the nation's best place to work, and AFLAC as 13th on
that list of 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been fortunate,'' said Gaymon of the chamber, ``but we
had a lot to do with making our own luck.''

 &HT;    Plant closing guts Fla. company town
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. JOE, Fla. _ For decades, tourists zoomed right through
this sleepy Florida Panhandle town, holding their noses as they
passed the smelly paper mill on their way to enjoy the beaches of
Panama City or the quaint charm of Apalachicola.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most residents didn't mind being overlooked. The
town's namesake, St. Joe Paper Co., was a huge, prosperous employer
that provided good wages and security for hundreds of rural Gulf
County's 13,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in the early 1990s when St. Joe was taken over
by new management. Suddenly, the company that for 60 years had been
a generous benefactor to an entire town _ and which owned the bank,
the telephone company, the mill and most of the land in Gulf County
_ decided to get out of the paper-making business to concentrate on
real estate development. Suddenly, families that had relied on
lucrative blue-collar wages for decades were frozen with financial
worry. And after decades of smug prosperity, residents who hadn't
batted an eye as Florida's tourism-related boom largely passed over
their isolated corner of the state suddenly wondered about the
wisdom of depending on a single large, smokestack industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Joe owned this town,'' said Mayor Johnny Linton, whose
father worked at the mill for 47 years. ``You can't find anybody
here who didn't have somebody in their family or some close friend
who worked there. So what's happened has really torn this town
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened has been Port St. Joe's worst nightmare. Last
August, the mill's new owners _ Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. and
Box USA _ shut down the factory, laying off 550 employees.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope the mill will reopen, but also lots of worry that
it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf County's unemployment rate soared to nearly 20 percent, and
the side effects buffeted the local economy like storm waves, not
ripples. ``It's been devastating,'' said longtime Port St. Joe City
Clerk Pauline Pendarvis. ``People were used to having a good
standard of living, and suddenly they have no income. It's a whole
new world.'' Ironically, just as many Florida communities are
looking to put more controls on growth because traffic and
infrastructure problems have degraded their quality of life, Port
St. Joe needs growth in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have stepped in to help, pumping job-training
dollars into the area and allowing workers to continue receiving
unemployment benefits while training for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush has also promised to staff a new prison built a
few years ago but never opened because there weren't enough
prisoners to fill it. But corrections officers won't make the $20
to $25 an hour many mill workers earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend worked there for 17 years, and he's never going
to make what he did at the mill,'' said Deborah Owens, who has had
her own hours at a convenience store near the mill cut back. ``We
just bought a new house. I'm not leaving here, but if we had known
this was going to happen, we sure wouldn't have bought the house.''
</P>
<P>
   City leaders have scrambled to attract new industries, getting
help from state recruiters and from the revamped St. Joe Co., which
still owns much of the land in town. The company has also donated
money for improving the city's sewer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this time we don't want to put all our eggs in one
basket,'' said City Commissioner Damon McNair, whose father worked
at the St. Joe Railroad for 42 years. ``We want small, clean,
environmentally friendly plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders also realize they can no longer ignore the lucrative
tourism market, which has brought prosperity to many Florida
communities. Visitors have already discovered nearby Cape San Blas,
a gorgeous peninsula dotted with vacation cottages.
</P>
<P>
   City fathers hope to bring more tourists with a new city marina,
which was under construction before the mill closed and will open
soon. The facility will bring in revenue from owners of high-end
yachts and pleasure craft, and equally importantly, will offer the
city much-needed exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be businessmen on those boats who will see what
we've got to offer,'' Linton said. ``We've got wonderful,
hard-working people. I truly believe in three or four years, you
won't know this town. We've just got too much to offer.''

 &HT;    Good times abound in the region but sprawl threatens quality of
life
 &HT;    By David Goldberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If this is the American century, in many ways the last five
decades have been the Southern half-century.
</P>
<P>
   From a Depression-era basket case that hung like a lead weight
on the rest of the country, the South has grown to become the
fourth largest economy in the world. It has been the nation's most
rapidly growing regional economy throughout the 1990s, with an
unemployment rate lower and job growth stronger than those of any
other region.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for Southerners, stereotypically famous for
languor, to fall into complacency about the future. That would be a
mistake, most observers warn.
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of air conditioning, the South has lured
industries from other, troubled regions with a simple formula:
cheap labor, cheap land and an ``anything goes'' mentality toward
business. The strategy worked _ in some places, a little too well.
Like an overzealous rain dance, it brought growth in such a torrent
that many Southern cities now are flooded with demand for roads,
schools, water and sewer systems, as well as complaints over
traffic, air pollution and loss of identity.
</P>
<P>
   Cities across the South _ from Austin to Chattanooga to Raleigh
_ are trying to cope with the effects of growth and the resulting
sprawl. Those efforts include forging new alliances and enacting
new laws, or encouraging new development in already established
areas. The goal has been to manage growth without killing the
golden goose that has fed the region's current prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new report from the Commission on the Future of the
South, a collaborative effort of 14 states and Puerto Rico, points
up potential pitfalls ahead for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of industrial relocations is ebbing, according to the
report, called ``Southern Connections.'' Rust Belt cities in the
Northeast and Midwest that had cast off businesses and workers to
the South are being resuscitated. And Southern schools continue to
lag behind the rest of the country in turning out well-educated
workers for the information economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of the South as cheap labor is gone,'' said
Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State
University. ``The South now has to sell itself as the land of
livability and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of plentiful opportunity, he and others noted,
springs from the rapid growth in jobs. Traditionally, the South has
imported a large share of both jobs and workers from other areas.
The ``Southern Connections'' report urges Southern governors and
other leaders to put an emphasis on incubating home-grown
enterprises and educating a high-tech work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start growing our own talent,'' agreed Ratajczak.
``We can no longer rely on the Northeast and Midwest to train their
kids and send them to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic success for the South _ indeed for all regions _ will
hinge on the availability of those well-trained young workers,
economists say. If the South can't produce them in sufficient
quantities, the states will have to continue to import them. At the
moment, that's not a terribly tall order, said Mark Vitner, a
Charlotte-based economist with First Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're ETrade, America Online or Northern Telecom,'' Vitner
said, ``and you have to site a facility where there are lots of
bright young people, you're going to cite it in the Southeast,
where young people are tending to move.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged as other parts of the country ratchet up
their own livability quotient, the South may have a tougher time
attracting workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Midwest there has been an enormous revival, and we've
seen employment go into Detroit, Minneapolis, Cleveland and
Chicago,'' Vitner said. ``People aren't really moving in yet, but
they're not losing population as fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These cities and their suburbs have become very interesting,
livable areas,'' Ratajczak agreed. ``They're like a more livable
New York. And they're starting to get people moving in, despite the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast, too, has moved to make itself more competitive.
Several areas have cut taxes and adopted pro-business policies. The
region also has unparalleled cultural amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Southern cities will need to develop those and other amenities
in the coming years in order to provide the quality of life that
young professionals seek, experts said. For these workers in
``industries of the mind,'' quality of life goes beyond possessing
a big house on a big lot miles from cultural activities. But the
South underspends every other region in funding for arts and arts
education.
</P>
<P>
   The South needs to become more worldly in other ways, as well,
economists said. In an increasingly global economy, the region lags
behind other regions in exports to other countries. Currently,
every Southern state except North Carolina lags behind the national
average in the percentage of firms with more than 500 employees
that export to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But as a gateway to Central and South America, the South has
great potential as those markets become more integrated with the
United States, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states also are behind in spending for research and
development, and they are exporting many of the innovations their
institutions generate, said Paul Essex, executive director of the
Southern Growth Policies Board, which commissioned the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``What little research that left the lab for the marketplace is
being sold to Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in Boston,''
Essex said. ``We're trying to encourage professors and experts to
start up their own companies, to keep these advances close to
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern states must educate their children better, according to
the report, and keep those educated children close to home. But the
South still has more high school dropouts, more children living in
poverty and lower rates of educational attainment than any other
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional ways of doing things,'' says the report, ``our
familiar arrangements _ between school and work, employer and
employee, family and community, parent and child _ are not adequate
to meet the challenges we already see. Why? Because too few of
these arrangements place our priorities where they must be: to
develop continuously the human mind and imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The South also can expect to become one of the more diverse
regions of the country. ``The face of the South is changing,''
Essex said. ``We have a lot of in-migration, from other areas of
the country and Hispanic and Asian immigrants. Opryland was
importing hotel workers from the Caribbean.'' In Atlanta, a rich
mix of Hispanic, Asian and other immigrant groups has helped to
revitalize some parts of the metro area with a slew of new
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A widening income gap could undermine the growing overall
prosperity in the region. The South produces low-skilled workers at
a faster rate than the rest of the country, leading to high
competition for low-paid jobs that keeps wages low. And those jobs
are not growing in the way information-related jobs are. Since the
North American Free Trade Act was enacted four years ago, 220,000
jobs in textile and apparel have been lost in the rural South.
Throughout the South, rural areas and central cities are continuing
to decline, even as suburbs prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to make sure the economic prosperity is
attainable by everybody,'' Essex said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, experts agreed, the South's future is bright, as
long as the overall U.S. economy does well. In many ways, the
business of the South is growth. Development, construction and
sales of real estate are a large part of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, what has thrown the Southeast off track is when
commercial real estate gets overbuilt,'' Vitner said. ``When we
build too many office buildings, too many shopping centers, that's
when the economy tumbles. Real estate touches so many parts of the
economy it tends to shut down banking and credit in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   How well the region fares during the next recession will depend
on the cause of the slowdown, Ratajczak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go down because of construction and overbuilding, the
places that will be hit will be where that happened,'' he said.
``If we go down because of loss of competitiveness to the rest of
the world, we're more vulnerable, because we still have segments
dependent on cheap labor. If we go down because of loss of consumer
confidence we might be better off, because the consumer sector is
not quite as developed here.''

WHAT'S A PARENT TO DO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 20 minutes before dinner and you catch your 5-year-old with
her hand in the cookie jar. What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sympathize that she must be hungry, remind her there's a
no-cookie-before-dinner rule, but tell her this time it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   B. Slap her hand, remind her sternly about the no-cookie rule,
and tell her to wait for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   C. Make eye contact, say nothing, and look away or leave.
</P>
<P>
   D. Sympathize that she must be hungry, remind her that dinner is
soon, cookies can spoil an appetite so a person won't be hungry to
eat the healthy things a body needs, and then brainstorm about a
snack that would be OK.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find fault with each of these _ A seems too
indulgent, B too punitive, C too neglectful, and D too wordy _ you
may be a more savvy parent than you realize.
</P>
<P>
   These responses represent the range of traditional approaches to
parenting, from disengaged (C) to inconsistent (A). Most of us are
able to avoid these extremes because we recognize the dangers in
them: The child of a disengaged parent eventually feels neglected _
``Does Mom even care?'' _ and acts out more and more in an effort
to find out; the child of an indulgent parent is confused by the
inconsistency _ ``Well, when is a rule a rule?'' _ and feels
equally compelled to push the limits to find out.
</P>
<P>
   But our reactions to the other two styles, when we're thinking
about what kind of parent we want to be, are less clear-cut. What
parent doesn't have moments when a slap on the hand and a stern
response have great appeal? Or when explanations and logic seem
more fair, more comfortable, more respectful . . .
</P>
<P>
   In parenting lingo, the rigid, punitive style is called
``authoritarian,'' while the parent who reasons and negotiates is
considered ``authoritative.'' For more than a decade, parenting
professionals have recommended the more empathetic authoritative
style. Now, that thinking is changing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still, rules are rules &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The consensus today is that children fare best when parents take
a balanced approach that tilts toward the authoritative but
includes bits of authoritarianism: Finding your child with her hand
in the cookie jar, you might still comment that she must be hungry,
but you would cut to the rule quickly, eliminate verbiage, and
offer a carrot instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that professionals are backing off from empathetic
parenting. But there's a time and place for everything. You could
still have a conversation about nutrition, for instance, but do it
several hours after the fact or even tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents have empathized and listened and tried to be
understanding to kids, they've lost the knack or sense of when it
is they need to take control,'' says Linda Braun, director of
Families First, a nonprofit parenting-education group in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, sympathize, provide children with
age-appropriate opportunities to express themselves and to make
decisions, but don't go so far that you abdicate control or are
wildly inconsistent in your limit-setting.
</P>
<P>
   Just as previous parenting movements have reflected societal
ebbs and flows _ ``Puritan parents were harsh with their children;
today they'd be arrested for child abuse,'' quips Harvard
psychologist Jerome Kagan _ this change is a reflection of, and a
reaction to, a society that is more and more collaborative but also
more and more permissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children need to grow up to be adaptive, learning about
cooperation, teamwork, compromise, and sharing,'' says Kagan.
``They also need to be firmly rooted in their family's values.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
With respect, you're in charge &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist and author Carolyn Webster-Stratton dubs this
parenting style ``guided democracy: You respect a child's point of
view, but you also know when to take control.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving it is a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 4-year-old who hits the baby or the 11-year-old who
cheats on a test. An authoritarian response would be punitive,
perhaps a spanking accompanied by removal of privileges but
certainly no touchy-feely discussion. An authoritative response
would revolve around discussion: What were you feeling? Why?
</P>
<P>
   A mix of the two makes clear the behavior was unacceptable _
``You can't hit your sister no matter what''; ``Cheating is wrong
no matter what'' _ but it doesn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't debate the premise that pushing or cheating is
wrong, but you still engage in a discussion about why it's wrong.
That's what develops character and the ability to think for
yourself,'' says psychologist Ed Damon, director of the Center on
Adolescence at Stanford University and author of ``Greater
Expectations: Overcoming the Culture of Indulgence in Our Homes and
Schools'' (Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   With very young children, identify their feelings for them, says
Braun: ``You were mad when you hit the baby. I wonder if you're
feeling sad that I spend so much time with her and less time with
you.'' With an older child, you might say, ``I know you know
cheating is wrong. I'm wondering what would make you do something
you know is wrong.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
It calls for judgment &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It can be tricky to recognize when you need to offer guidance
and when you need to lay down the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child needs guidance when it comes to peer relationships
or how to dress to fit in,'' Damon says. ``This is his arena, and
his judgment needs to count; your ideas may be mistaken or unfair.
But if he says he only wants French fries for dinner, that calls
for exercising parental control.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if your child begins, ``Mom, you're off the wall,'' it's
not necessarily disrespectful, as long as it's the prelude to a
dialogue. Open communication is critical, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Family therapist John Rosemond probably would not agree. A
national lecturer and author of eight books including ``A Family of
Value'' (Andrews McMeel), Rosemond is the de facto head of a
popular authoritarian movement. He advocates a return to
old-fashioned parenting where ``do it because I said so'' replaces
discussions about feelings, and discipline, including spanking, is
swift and unquestionable. Rosemond's publicist said he was not
available for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Braun speculates that Rosemond's popularity is a reaction to
working mothers and two-worker parent families who overdo
negotiation as a way to salve their guilt for time away. But
swinging the pendulum to the right is no better, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get immediate compliance (with an authoritarian
parenting style), but it's compliance born of fear, which breeds
resentment toward authority. Kids who don't get heard feel a lot of
rage,'' says Braun, who is also on the faculty of Wheelock College.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel like nobody's listening,'' says Webster-Stratton,
director of the Parenting Clinic at the University of Washington in
Seattle and author of ``The Incredible Years: A Trouble-Shooting
Guide for Parents'' (Umbrella Press).
</P>
<P>
   When they are little, these kids act out. When they are teens,
they rebel. At all ages, their relationship with the parent tends
to be troubled and superficial because they feel unfairly punished
and restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Webster-Stratton helps parents achieve guided democracy by
comparing parenting to a bank account: Beginning at birth, you give
love, respect, and limits according to a child's stage of
development. That becomes a deposit in the account that accrues
interest, in the form of the trust that develops between you.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that foundation,'' she says, ``discipline will never feel
arbitrary, because you have the trust to draw upon. Even when a
child is angry with you, he knows at some level that you understand
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This style also fosters character development, which Damon says
depends on good habits and the ability to be reflective.
Authoritarian parenting, in contrast, tends to be inconsistent
about the former _ ``A parent may expect a child to be truthful but
not see the need to model truthfulness himself'' _ and not value
the latter at all.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just as no one moment can define a parent's style, no
one style fits all children or even all the children in the same
family. ``How you parent requires knowing each child, as opposed to
following one philosophy,'' says psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   A very sensitive child, for instance, will become overly
compliant and not learn to take initiative if her parents are
authoritarian, he says. A very active child with lots of sensory
craving, on the other hand, may need a high degree of structure,
but that alone isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also needs creative outlets and constructive stimulation''
that come from a flexible, authoritative style, says Greenspan. A
professor at George Washington University, he is author of ``The
Challenging Child'' (Addison Wesley).
</P>
<P>
   What happens if you go overboard in one direction or the other?
``It's never too late to change,'' says Webster-Stratton. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No compensating &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What she sees most frequently is that one parent perceives the
other as having gone too far in one direction. But attempts to
compensate typically backfire. ``The parent usually ends up too far
in the other direction, either too laissez-faire or too strict,''
she says. That makes life confusing for children and makes it
easier for them to play parents off each other.
</P>
<P>
   Her advice is to talk about your tendencies, perhaps with
professional help, so that both of you are aware of them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, however, she says, ``Find the balance
within yourself rather than try to compensate for the other parent.
If it's hard for you to set limits, work on that. If it's hard for
you to talk about feelings, get some help.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what style you decide is appropriate for you and your
child, the bottom line is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important,'' says Kagan, ``is that a child
perceives he is loved.''

 &HT;    Ga.'s `hottest little boomtown' ponders future
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. MARYS, Ga. _ Women's voices and guitar chords waft through
the salty air onto Osborne Street. The door of the old church is
open.
</P>
<P>
   On most Wednesday nights, anyone can come inside the tiny
150-year-old church, sit in one of the eight slim pews and hear
Lucy Bryant and Linda Sheffield Rice practice their folk music and
tap their feet on the wide, dark planks of wood.
</P>
<P>
   The Our Lady Star of the Sea choir members come to the chapel,
now used only for weddings and special events, because the big
church down the road is packed with Knights of Columbus and Boy
Scout meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is quintessential St. Marys. The ``hottest little
boomtown'' in the country is still a small town.
</P>
<P>
   But with 50 percent population growth this decade and more and
more subdivisions popping up like weeds, St. Marys might not stay
that way for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate all the growth coming in,'' said Rice, propping her
feet on a pew and talking about how her family's roots in town go
all the way back to a land grant from the king. ``Personally, what
I hate the most is it used to be just land.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a dental hygienist, moved from Brunswick two years ago
and isn't too upset about the new restaurants and commercial
growth: ``I kind of like the modernization, the choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers like her have arrived in droves, most of them drawn by
the 10 Trident II nuclear submarines that have come to the Navy
base at King's Bay in St. Marys. The base employs 9,400 people with
a payroll of $342 million. It's been the turbine for much of what's
happened in this coastal Camden County community about five hours
from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   All the activity caused Money magazine a few years ago to name
St. Marys the top boomtown in the United States. This past year,
the Census ranked Camden County the sixth-fastest-growing county in
Georgia and the 23rd-fastest-growing in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the population of the county and its three cities,
St. Marys, Woodbine and Kingsland, has more than tripled from
13,000 to more than 47,000.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 tourists a year pass through St. Marys to visit
the natural wonders of Cumberland Island National Seashore, a
45-minute ferry ride away from the downtown historic district. And
the 40-bed Camden Medical Center, just 5 years old, is already
bursting at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   All of that is a chamber of commerce's dream, right?
</P>
<P>
   But now the growth is beginning to level off. The last new
submarine docked in 1997. The base isn't going away, but it
probably isn't going to grow any more either. If anything, it will
decrease a bit.
</P>
<P>
   And even more pressing, the Navy plans to decommission four of
its Trident nuclear missile subs shortly after 2000. Two or three
of those could be taken from King's Bay, removing about 340 sailors
and their families per vessel. That's roughly 1,000 people per sub.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the trouble at Gilman Paper Co., the second-largest
employer in town after the base. It laid off 20 workers last month
and has acknowledged it's not making money. The company was put up
for sale in November, along with Gilman's building products
division and 183,000 acres of timber.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question for St. Marys and Camden County is whether all
the growth they've had up to now will be sustainable without such
firm dependence on subs and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is everywhere. Boosters point to the two relatively new
golf course communities, Osprey Cove and Laurel Links, as potential
magnets for avid golfers and retirees. Others talk about the
increase in tourism to the area and influx of houses despite the
halt in sub traffic. The 560-foot-long submarines started arriving
in 1988, at about one every summer. But the momentum didn't start
right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the base announcement, people were coming in like crazy.
But it took a while for things to get going,'' says real estate
agent Teddie Lockhart, who lives in the historic district just a
few blocks from her office and gift shop. ``Some people got
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   After the initial clutter off of I-95's Exit 2, the main entry
into St. Marys, you get an immediate sense of lots of open land in
the county. That just means much of the growth is tucked away.
Drive down the side streets and along secondary roads, and places
like Bristol Hammock and Sugar Mill Plantation dot the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The area had no real zoning before the base's announcement.
Piney woods dominated the landscape. But city leaders traveled to
the West Coast, to the Bangor base in Washington, to soak up how a
town grows around a major Navy base, and how to avoid the mistakes.
What emerged was a master plan for a base built in a parklike,
college-campus-looking setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to stay. We are part of the community,'' said
Commanding Officer Capt. Frank P. Stagl, who moved to St. Marys 10
months ago and bought a house in the historic district. ``The base
has made them what they are today, and they have to move ahead, and
manage it from now on. And I think they are doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The base's tentacles are still reaching out and changing the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the hospital was delivering 200 babies a year.
Last year, largely because of the influx of young Navy couples, it
delivered 706 babies. So, the hospital is putting the finishing
touches on four new labor and delivery rooms and a Caesarean
section surgery room.
</P>
<P>
   The schools are growing, too. The Camden County system has been
adding about 500 students a year since the buildup began. Since
construction started at King's Bay in 1981, eight schools have been
built, many of them with some of the $55 million in federal impact
fees used to help build roads, sewers and other infrastructure in
the county.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, the historic area and waterfront have benefited from
the boost in special local-option sales taxes. The town has spent
about $20 million on redevelopment in that area, says St. Marys
Mayor Jerry Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandon, a chemist who moved back to his hometown in the
late 1970s to run his family's bed and breakfast inn, is skeptical
about the county's direction. He was peeved recently when the
county's industrial authority spent money to build a speculative
office building off Exit 3 near I-95. Brandon, who is in his third
term, didn't think it was a wise way to spend taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of being anti-economic development, but my
feeling is we are growing whether we like it or not, and we ought
to be in charge of that. It needs to be planned, controlled
growth,'' says Brandon, with his Hemingway-looking white beard and
dancing blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the big push is to encourage growth. I think
we ought to be like Oregon and New Mexico. Come see us, spend your
money and leave.''

 &HT;    Exodus of GIs affects La. towns differently
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEESVILLE, La. _ Despite its best efforts, this GI town isn't
utopia yet.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years after a group of Californians founded a large
commune here and promised members equal pay and equal social
opportunities, Leesville is a town in search of economic equality
with growing Southern communities.
</P>
<P>
   The New Llano commune lasted just 20 years. A U.S. Army base
here has survived longer, but it has never been particularly
reliable. It opened and closed often enough to flood the town with
soldiers preparing for World War II and wars in Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leesville is struggling again. True, the regular Wal-Mart
was upgraded to a Super Wal-Mart and a mobile home manufacturer
started operations in town. But houses, bars, shops and a mobile
home park are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Polk _ still far and away the biggest employer in Leesville
and Vernon Parish _ remains open. But by early 1993, the Army base
had shipped out half of its 16,000 soldiers. Vernon Parish lost one
in six of its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Proprietors of mom-and-pop stores found they didn't have enough
work to keep their counter help. With fewer military kids in
school, the government laid off teachers. Requests for emergency
assistance to buy groceries and pay rent rose by more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is afraid to borrow and invest capital because it is
so uncertain right now,'' said Ron Steed, who is president of both
the Merchants &AMP; Farmers Bank and the local chamber of commerce. At
home, he is comforted by the sounds of shots fired during training
maneuvers at the nearby base. ``That's good to hear. You know they
are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the South booms with growth, the trend has been
lopsided. Some communities lost population in the 1990s. Heavily
represented among them are military communities that have had to
recreate their economies after base closings and cutbacks of the
1980s and 1990s. But not all such communities are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Central Louisiana suffered two whacks in the military
dice-and-slice. Leesville lost half the troop strength at Fort
Polk. And 50 miles away, across bayous and pine forests, the larger
city of Alexandria lost everyone at England Air Force Base. The
installation closed in late 1992, taking with it 3,000 military
personnel and 1,000 civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to the surprise of the people who still live there,
Alexandria appears to be better off without them.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, the community's total number of jobs is up, not
down. Economists and locals agree the city is economically
healthier than it was. The U.S. Department of Defense highlights
Alexandria as proof that communities don't have to be doomed when
tanks, ships and fighter wings leave.
</P>
<P>
   With 50,000 residents, Alexandria is the biggest economic center
in a central Louisiana landscape dominated by pine trees and cotton
and soybean farms.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand the plight that faced Alexandria, you have to
understand what the city isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't particularly close to New Orleans. Or Baton Rouge. Or
Shreveport. It isn't on the Mississippi River. It isn't sitting on
oceans of easily accessible oil. And, up until recently, it wasn't
on an interstate.
</P>
<P>
   That changed just as the base was closing. Road crews began work
on sections of I-49 through Alexandria, pumping new jobs into the
community. When the highway was completed, it spurred new
restaurants and gas stations and helped local officials trying to
attract new industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's successes weren't all happenstance. When locals
learned England Air Force Base might be among those closed, leaders
broke into two groups. One worked on plan A, which was to lobby to
keep the base open. The second worked secretly on plan B, which was
to figure out a way to reuse the base if it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials persuaded the federal government to give the
base to a new state-created regional authority. Next, the authority
persuaded the federal government to pay it to temporarily maintain
the base after it closed _ giving local officials a chance to learn
on the job how to run a 2,500-acre complex with nearly 500
buildings, 600 houses and apartment units, and a runway long enough
to handle 747s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out just trying to keep the grass cut and the
lights on,'' said Jon Grafton, Alexandria's former city clerk who
now serves as executive director of the authority overseeing the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The glass doors to his offices still carry the logo of the 23rd
Tactical Fighter Wing. It's from there that he makes this
pronouncement: ``Communities that have bases close have this
incredible asset and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now called the England Industrial Airpark &AMP; Community, the
former base is a weird mix of military base and industrial park.
Military homes have been turned into a new retirement community.
Hangars have been taken over by an aircraft repair company.
</P>
<P>
   There's an Internet service provider on base, a computer
manufacturer, a new call center, satellite classrooms for a local
university and other businesses. Officials also moved a regional
airport to use the base runways and increase the passenger load of
commuter airlines serving the community.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the military hasn't disappeared. The
Department of Defense pays $1.3 million annually to use its old
base to fly in thousands of troops 10 times a year for exercises at
Fort Polk in Leesville.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 people work at the park, and about a third of
the homes are occupied. But there are also vacant spaces. The base
movie theater opened up as a commercial operation, then closed.
Dormitory buildings and the base bowling alley sit mostly unused.
While leads for new industrial prospects have slowed, authority
officials have laid plans to embark on their first major
construction projects: A new 220-acre golf course and a new
terminal five times bigger than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roy Jr., a personal injury lawyer in town, saw enough
positive signs last year to invest some of his personal fortune
into starting a professional ice hockey team at the Rapides Parish
Coliseum. The Alexandria Warthogs _ named after the aircraft once
based at England _ are both a salute to the base and proof that the
city has moved on, Roy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become more self-reliant as a community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the coliseum, at Connie's bar, proprietor Connie
Stilley braced for devastation after the Air Force base closed.
Instead, she said, ``I make more money now than I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that base personnel spent most of their money at
the base. ``Bases are just about self-sufficient. They don't need
the community really and truly.'' And Alexandria, she said, has
learned it didn't really need the base.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty miles away, the city of Leesville can't draw the same
conclusion about Fort Polk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest industry here is Wal-Mart. Does that tell you
anything?'' said Renee Brannon, who oversees programs development
at the Vernon Community Action Council in Leesville.
</P>
<P>
   Limited opportunities is the price of being in not just a small
town, but one that has lost population, she said. Students with
good grades leave for college and never come back.
</P>
<P>
   Some local leaders are looking for economic diversification
beyond the military. They are marketing land to industries and have
pushed for a four-lane connection to I-49 in Alexandria. But the
efforts were slow to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of old heads that made a fortune here on the
military, and they didn't want to change,'' said Ron Steed, who for
12 years has been president at the Merchants &AMP; Farmers Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have forgotten the smokestacks and taken care of the green
suits,'' he said. ``That's where we have fallen down.''

 &HT;    'Smart' growth a larger issue at ballot box
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept of growing ``smart'' has hit the state capitols and
city halls in boomtowns across the nation. Last November, there
were about 250 anti-sprawl initiatives on ballots across the
country. Most of them were successful. In addition, 12 states have
passed laws to manage growth. Here's a rundown of a few new rules
and other initiatives to rein in development in the South:
</P>
<P>
   Florida
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, voters approved a constitutional amendment to issue
bonds to finance the state's acquisition of open land and to
protect wildlife habitats, parks, beaches and archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarasota County last month, voters overwhelmingly approved a
tax increase to protect thousands of acres of environmentally
sensitive land over the next 20 years. The tax would raise about $5
million annually. Voters also gave the Sarasota County Commission
the authority to issue up to $53 million in bonds for those lands.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Voters rejected a proposal that would have raised real estate
transfer taxes to collect $30 million annually to protect open
space. But an influential group of business leaders, calling itself
the Metropolitan Atlanta Transportation Initiative, created a list
of proposals needed to get the metro Atlanta region out of its air
quality problems. The suggestions were incorporated into Gov. Roy
Barnes' plans to create an overarching transportation agency that
would guide transit and, in many cases, development in areas around
the state with air quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   And 10 years after passage of Georgia's comprehensive planning
act, a task force assessed the act and its aftermath. One of its
conclusions: Most counties and cities in Georgia have comprehensive
plans, but not many make land-use decisions in accordance to those
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi encourages redevelopment of ``brownfields,'' areas
that have been environmentally contaminated, by creating trade-off
agreements between the state and landowners.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina
</P>
<P>
   The state has a farmland preservation law on the books, but
until last year made no money available in the budget to buy
at-risk farmland. Last session, the Legislature appropriated
$250,000. Lawmakers last year also approved $13.4 million in
transportation funding, divided equally between transit and rail
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   A new state law calls for cities and counties to develop and
adopt growth plans by July 2001. If they don't, they face being cut
off from state subsidies for highways, community development and
tourism. The plans basically say local governments must create
urban growth boundaries that encourage dense development in certain
areas and protect open space and agricultural land in others. The
plans are supposed to guide development for the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Texas
</P>
<P>
   The city of Austin is in the process of a series of ``smart
growth'' initiatives designed, among other things, to guide
development and deter sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has a ``Smart Growth Criteria matrix,'' a list
of good growth elements planners want developers to include in
their projects, such as sidewalks and proximity to light rail.
There's also a major revitalization proposal encouraging people and
businesses to move downtown and to avoid environmentally sensitive
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout March, the city held a series of meetings. They were
a ``visual preference survey'' showing residents snapshots of the
ways different communities look _ from landscaping to architecture
_ and gathering feedback on what they liked best. On April 17, the
city plans its first citywide neighborhood workshop.

 &HT;    Farms, tech collide in suburb of D.C.
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDOUN COUNTY, Va. _ Dulles International Airport may not look
like a cathedral, but it is the seat of an awesome economic power
that has made this Northern Virginia county the
third-fastest-growing in the nation. After Forsyth County, north of
Atlanta, and Douglas County, near Denver, Loudoun posted the
largest population jump last year _ 8.2 percent to 143,940
youngish, educated, well-paid souls who are largely Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun is Northern Virginia's largest county, with 517 square
miles that range from the dense Washington, D.C., suburbs to
Middleburg and its estate-size horse farms. Two-thirds of the
county's land is dedicated to agricultural endeavors such as
Christmas tree farms and wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The growth, now concentrated in a quadrant just north of Dulles
and west of Leesburg, is already expected to generate the need for
$500 million to build 22 new schools within six years. The growth
comes from two primary sources. One is people moving out from
more-populated areas such as Fairfax County and Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The other cause is the Dulles airport, catalyst for an
astounding influx of high-technology employers into Loudoun County
within the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 of them now. Based in one or more of
the county's 75 office parks that occupy 8,000 developable acres,
they are known as the ``Silicon Dominion.'' They are anchored by
America Online, which built its headquarters near Dulles in 1996
and is already planning an expansion. More recently, MCI WorldCom
announced a $200 million investment in a 153-acre campus that will
house 1.3 million square feet of offices and 4,000 jobs. Orbital
Sciences also leased 610,000 square feet. There are also CyberCash
and PSINet.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they more than doubled the county's non-residential
construction square footage between 1997 and 1998. There are some
20,000 unfilled technology jobs, estimates Mark Vitner, vice
president and economist at First Union Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Loudoun's vacancy rates are below 7 percent. By
contrast, in 1992, when the metropolitan Washington area was in a
deep recession, vacancy rates were nearing 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Asian crisis spurred Motorola Corp. to postpone
a massive semiconductor project near Richmond, in central Virginia,
Loudoun calls itself the Internet capital of the world, and people
like Robyn Bailey and Randy Minchew are determined it will continue
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to curtail the airport's growth by allowing
residential (development) to creep in around it,'' said Bailey, a
marketing expert with Loudoun's Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the airport that created the conditions that led
to growth, it was also the airport that created demand for new
housing and the accompanying water-sewer-sprawl concerns. In 1998,
a special task force submitted a rural economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for keeping our rural economy thriving in western Loudoun
County as a compatible ally to our high-tech economic development
in eastern Loudoun County,'' said Minchew, task force co-chairman.
The plan was to promote profits from agricultural products _
already valued at $53.4 million annually _ and, among other things,
to curtail residential sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge debates about the extreme growth and how you
control it,'' remarked Arlington resident Gail Raiman.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-growth fanatics represent one extreme. Some would like to
see all development proceed not one foot west of U.S. 15, a
north-south road that symbolically cuts the county in half. They
want nothing like South Riding, which is already snugly settled a
few miles east of 15.
</P>
<P>
   This 5,600-house planned urban community already has its own ZIP
code, 2,000 acres and 500 families. Four years into a 16-year
buildout, the former sod farm promises everything from complete
retail services to maintaining open fields and numerous old-cedar
hedgerows.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the product is a luxury condominium with double garages,
a starter house or a half-million-dollar mansion on the golf
course, South Riding is already the No. 1-selling community in the
area. But sprawl it does not. No lot is larger than a third of an
acre.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Northern Virginia counties led the entire metro
Washington region in total net housing sales. Loudoun County
outperformed them all, with a 22.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Minchew says it will not stop, even if efforts to bring rapid
rail to Dulles, to add another limited-access highway and to put
another bridge across the Potomac involve prolonged political
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a pro-growth, low-tax-burden, fiscally conservative
jurisdiction. Business is a good word here.''
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the western part of the county will be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to see that developed. It is very special.''

 &HT;    Mississippi landmark daunted by popularity
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. _ Recently, a California man was visiting Rowan
Oak, the home of William Faulkner, and told the house's curator he
was looking for a place to retire. He'd been living in Sonoma, in
the heart of wine country, but found it had ``peaked,'' and he
wanted to move somewhere less trendy. Oxford was looking good.
</P>
<P>
   Curator Cynthia Shearer was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `If people are moving here from Sonoma because it
has peaked, this is the apocalypse for Oxford,''' said Shearer, the
Georgia-born author of ``The Wonder Book of the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford, a picture-perfect Southern town with a long, tantalizing
list of amenities, has been discovered. Long a favorite haunt for
writers _ the list of literary residents past and present includes
Faulkner, John Grisham and Barry Hannah _ Oxford is now popular
with retirees, doctors, lawyers and even people who work in
Memphis, 90 minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   Magazines and newspapers routinely list Oxford as one of the
best places in America to live and retire. They cite the vibrant
arts community, a 200-bed hospital with a new cancer center, good
public schools and the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   All this popularity caught Oxford unprepared. The city in the
last five years has begun to grow like a rebellious teenager with
absentee parents. Subdivisions are spreading, some would say like a
disease, across the city and into the county.
</P>
<P>
   So many old oak trees were being cut down to widen roads and
create turn lanes that the city had to establish the Tree Board to
regulate the chainsaws. Traffic, while almost cute compared to
Atlanta's, for the first time is something to grouse about over
morning coffee.
</P>
<P>
   And as doctors and lawyers and affluent retirees move in,
housing prices have skyrocketed. The average house costs more than
$100,000, and it is not unusual for homes near the square to sell
for more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing, almost too late, that growth could become sprawl if
it continues unchecked, the city last year asked Georgia Tech for
help in planning the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current plan for growth was designed in 1972, and it's
very out of date,'' said Chris Nelson, professor of city planning
at Georgia Tech and leader of a team of 20 graduate students
studying Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Specific concerns cited by Georgia Tech include the need to
handle the increase in traffic, the lack of restrictions on the
subdivisions that have been built, and the risk that Oxford will
lose the charm and character that make it attractive to people in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dees, a reporter for the Oxford Eagle who makes no secret of
his disdain for uncontrolled growth, has a special well of hate in
his heart for a subdivision called Shiloh Place. Located just
outside the city in Lafayette County _ where there is no zoning and
until recently no restrictions on development _ the completely
treeless tract has 70 small, simple homes selling for around
$70,000. The developers, from Jackson, Miss., recently won approval
to build 70 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horror,'' Dees said as he drove his old pickup through
the narrow streets of Shiloh. ``Find anything that's like Oxford in
this. They even tore out the real grass to put in sod. There's no
trees, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Gunn, owner of one of the largest real estate agencies in
Oxford, gets offended when people call developments ``ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone can afford the more-expensive homes,'' she said.
``We have to remember that supply and demand is in effect. I know
we all want to keep Oxford as a small town and a quaint little
city, but I don't think that is feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Oxford can grow and have subdivisions without
offending those residents who want the city to retain its original
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oxford's new developments have no sense of design,'' he said.
Subdivisions and commercial development should be designed to fit
in with the spirit of the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Pat Lamar agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to grow, and we don't want to be perceived
as `no-growth,''' she said. ``But we'd like to see the ambience and
history of Oxford duplicated as we grow, rather than have miles and
miles of asphalt and subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are 2,500 homes in the county that hug the city
limits. Inside the city, Vick Smith, the building inspector who
used to issue between 25 and 50 permits a year for new houses, said
he issued 157 last year. Not everyone in town is upset by the
development. Many older natives, who remember when Oxford had slums
and flophouses off the square, welcome the infusion of money and
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   H.C. Franklin, who worked for the city for 36 years as a
policeman, a planning commissioner and an alderman, said he likes
the growth. ``I don't see how you'd stop it anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Wiley, 57, operator of Wiley's Shoe Shop, said he, too,
approves of the growth. ``We used to have slums after slums, and
shacks,'' he said. ``Now there are nice homes.''
</P>
<P>
   At Smitty's, a restaurant off the square, the men who gather
every morning said although they don't know everyone on the street
like they used to, they see growth as a good thing for the city.
But they said there should be more restrictions on developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are very vocally opposed to growth, but they
weren't born here,'' said Ryland Sneed, 55, an engineer who helps
design subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cynthia Shearer moved here 15 years ago, for many of the
same reasons people are moving here now. ``There's a kind of
hypocrisy in my hostility toward development,'' she said, referring
to the fact that she, too, is a newcomer. ``But so much of what is
going on now is spurred by profit, and the consideration of quality
of life has gotten lost in the shuffle. There's a mentality that
all growth is good.''
</P>
<P>
   And some natives share Shearer's concerns. Dean Falkner Wells,
William Faulkner's niece (the novelist added the ``u'' to the
family name), has lived in Oxford most of her life and despises the
changes she sees. She's not sure which was worse: when they cut
down five 150-year-old oak trees for a turn lane across the street,
or when the 24-hour Chevron station began flooding her dining room
with fluorescent light. She lives in Faulkner's mother's house, and
the dining room was where the novelist wrote ``Absalom, Absalom!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very much a village, it's still home, but the
jingle of cash registers could destroy us,'' she said. ``Some bad
press would help. Could you lie and say this is an overrated
town?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most towns of its size, Oxford's downtown remains the
center of public life. The 150-year-old square is Mayberry meets
Aspen, and that mix appeals to both natives and newcomers. While
writers and students have cafe au lait and croissants at the
Bottletree Bakery, old men gather for black coffee and gossip at
Smitty's. Nelson said Oxford stands a good chance of surviving its
newfound popularity. ``Oxford has a tremendous amount of citizen
firepower,'' he said. ``This is probably the most sophisticated
town I've ever worked with. Once they understand what they can do,
watch out.''

HEROIC MCDOUGAL ISN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan McDougal has not exited the forest yet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's victory in court in Little Rock, Ark., McDougal
is not out of the judicial thickets. Special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr and his pack of legal Rottweilers may very well decide to
continue hounding her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors already have indicated that they want to
question the jurors who found McDougal not guilty of obstruction of
justice and who deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt. That
could signal their intent to try to retry McDougal on the contempt
charges.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe that a jury could be impaneled now
that would convict McDougal on the contempt charges no matter how
much _ after grilling the Little Rock jurors _ the Starr team is
able to improve the presentation of its case against McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that a majority of Americans has come to see
McDougal as a heroic figure, the underdog against the top dog, Jill
against the giant.
</P>
<P>
   Starr transformed McDougal from someone widely viewed as
something of a shady character into a heroine of our day by sending
her to prison for 18 months for refusing to provide his prosecutors
with testimony to use against President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Had McDougal testified the way the Starr team wanted her to, the
special prosecutor might have been able to link the Clintons more
convincingly to the Whitewater scandal, which was what Starr was
appointed to investigate four years and nearly $50 million ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starr would not have had to make the colossal reach of
presenting Congress with a case for impeachment based on a
distasteful sex scandal that he was not appointed to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal was in a no-win position. If she testified and her
testimony did not support the case that Starr was trying to make
against Clinton, the special prosecutor would then have tried her
for perjury. But she insisted that she could not truthfully give
Starr what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking the easy way out by cooperating with the
special prosecutor, she refused to testify at all, and Starr
responded by having her sent to prison for contempt.
</P>
<P>
   That earned her the admiration of Americans across the political
spectrum. Even some dedicated Clinton-haters had to give her credit
for taking a stand on principle.
</P>
<P>
   She came to epitomize all victims of prosecutorial excess. And
Starr came to represent every federal or local prosecutor who has
ever intimidated any accused person into incriminating somebody
else with true or false testimony or punished such a person
excessively for not cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   That perception of Starr had already evolved from the human
wreckage he had strewn in his single-minded, relentless pursuit of
the president _ careers and reputations damaged (in some cases
irreparably) and people driven deeply into debt by legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal stood up to the special prosecutor, and he made
her pay. But her defiance prevented Starr from making a really
substantial case against Clinton and thereby justifying his heavy
drain on the public purse.
</P>
<P>
   He was reduced to the desperate gamble of trying to get the
president evicted from office on the basis of something that the
independent counsel surely knew did not reach the threshold of
``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Starr knew that there were enough Republican votes in
the House to impeach Clinton on a purely partisan basis. But that
was not the case in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority was
needed. The hope then was that Clinton would be so embarrassed and
frightened that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton didn't resign and was exonerated by the Senate,
Starr was the biggest loser. He will now go down in history as
having wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on a witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he put the Republicans in the posture of
appearing to be so preoccupied with the business of trying to oust
Clinton that they neglected the business they were really sent to
Washington to do.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP loses control of Congress in the 2000 elections, many
Republicans are going to blame Starr for tying them to the Monica
Lewinsky albatross.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, therefore, had a serious score to settle with McDougal in
Little Rock. Had she been convicted, that would have provided some
solace for his defeats. The acquittal and the mistrials simply
poured salt on his lacerations.
</P>
<P>
   The special prosecutor's best choice now would be to forgive
McDougal for standing up to him and undermining his effort to get
Clinton. But Starr has displayed no evidence of being endowed with
a forgiving nature.
</P>
<P>
   Having nothing more to lose, the special prosecutor is likely to
choose to continue to persecute McDougal out of pure
vindictiveness.

 &HT;    N.C. airport courts FedEx over neighbors' objection
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Uncertainty is thundering across Cardinal
Commons, a subdivision where residents fear the arrival of a big
neighbor that cranks up jet engines at night.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-mile from this postcard-pretty neighborhood
where children ride bikes and play basketball in tree-lined
cul-de-sacs, Federal Express plans to build its fifth national
package sorting and distribution hub.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $300 million hub at the Piedmont Triad
International Airport isn't yet a done deal. It faces regulatory
hurdles, and a neighborhood coalition is threatening to sue to
block the project, slated for completion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, one of the most-heralded economic development
projects in North Carolina's history is spawning a fight as big as
the MD-11 wide-bodies FedEx proposes flying in and out of
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   The angry dispute pits mostly well-to-do homeowners who fear for
their sleep and property values against airport officials and
others who view FedEx as an economic catalyst worth billions of
dollars. The fight illustrates how progress is increasingly the
cause of community discord.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened for debate the South's century-old scramble for
industrial development as a primary source of jobs and prosperity,
even if it disrupts the lives of a few.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, FedEx selected Greensboro over five other North
Carolina and South Carolinia cities. What's unsettling to people in
fast-growing northwest Greensboro is the uncertainty about how the
hub would affect them. No one can say for sure how loud the jets
would be. Or how the noise might affect one neighborhood as opposed
to another. Or how many homes the airport authority might buy in
areas where engine noise makes living unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is addressing such concerns
in an environmental impact study, but it's still a year or more
from completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought of the airport as that gentle rumbling
giant behind the trees,'' said 42-year-old Kinney Ford, an
economist who writes long-range forecasting software from his
Cardinal Commons home. ``Now I see them as an economic terrorist
holding us hostage. We are in limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents fear the FedEx hub would be a first step in
turning the airport into a 24-hour-a-day cargo hub. The airport
does foresee a prosperous future hauling cargo, as its efforts to
bolster passenger traffic have failed.
</P>
<P>
   But the airport authority's executive director, Ted Johnson,
said, ``We are not recruiting other cargo carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is the latest flashpoint in this piedmont North
Carolina city's struggle over whether it should aspire to grow as
vigorously as neighboring powerhouses Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, voters in Guilford and neighboring Forsyth counties
overwhelmingly defeated a referendum to tax restaurant meals to
finance construction of a stadium for Major League Baseball. It
sent a clear signal voters are wary of projects that appear driven
by the city's power brokers without strong grass-roots support.
</P>
<P>
   That anti-establishment attitude has surfaced in the FedEx
debate. And it's worrisome to some who believe Greensboro can't
afford to turn back another major project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel for the people who live near the airport, but from
the Triad's perspective, we need a trophy like this,'' said Gary
Shoesmith, an economist at Wake Forest University. ``We need more
FedExes, not fewer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Triad region encompassing Greensboro, High Point and
Winston-Salem is at the center of the state's textile, furniture
and tobacco industries. All are mature sectors with shrinking
employment. Even though it boasts low unemployment, the Triad has
been less successful than Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill and Charlotte
in diversifying its historically blue-collar work force.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the FedEx hub would do little to diversify the work
force. The project would eventually create 1,500 mostly blue-collar
jobs, paying an average of $8 to $10 an hour. But economic boosters
envision the hub attracting medical testing labs, computer repair
shops and technology companies that want late-night access to
FedEx's global delivery network.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the economic impact of new companies, FedEx would
boost the Triad's economy by $2.4 billion over 15 years, according
to UNC-Greensboro economist Don Jud's analysis for the Greensboro
Area Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   That includes more than 3,100 construction-related jobs at the
FedEx project and nearly 2,000 new jobs providing supplies and
services to the hub once it is built. The project would entail
relocating roads and building a highway tunnel, a bridge and a
9,000-foot runway for FedEx jets. At present, two FedEx jets fly in
and out of Greensboro's airport every night. The company insists it
needs a pair of parallel runways for its hub to expedite departures
of its jets traveling between the Southeast and the Northeast. The
hub also would serve as a regional sorting and distribution center
for deliveries in the Carolinas, Virginia and eastern Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of residents, the additional runway would end a
half-mile from Cardinal Commons. It would end three-fourths of a
mile from an even larger subdivision, Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The FedEx hub would operate primarily at night. The number of
cargo-hauling jets would start at 20 and climb to 63. Flights would
arrive around midnight for unloading. Then workers would load cargo
for outgoing flights, departing around 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joked that we may as well be dairy farmers because we are
going to be getting up,'' said Gil Happel, a US Airways pilot and
nearby resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now they are freaking out for no reason at all,'' said
Charlie McCoy, a manager at FedEx's airport operation. He insists
the proposed hub would be quieter than residents fear.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents accuse the airport authority of negotiating in virtual
secrecy to recruit FedEx. It was widely known Greensboro was in the
running for the project. But few details, including plans for the
additional runway, had been discussed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a civilized world, when you move into a neighborhood, you
assume that your neighbor is not going to mow their grass at 2
o'clock in the morning,'' said Joe Liebreri, a Cardinal resident
and founding member of the Piedmont Quality of Life Coalition,
which opposes the FedEx project.
</P>
<P>
   Now residents are threatening to sue over the millions of
dollars in state and local incentives pledged to FedEx. Officials
sealed the deal with a package of financial incentives initially
valued at $142.3 million over 20 years. A more recent state
analysis lowered the total to $79.8 million. ``The cargo facility
is incompatible with this residential area,'' said Mark Miller, who
lives in the Edinburgh subdivision. ``For health reasons and
financial reasons, it does not belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   An associate professor at the Wake Forest University School of
Medicine, Miller serves as an informal scientific consultant to the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is typical of the relative newcomers to the cluster of
subdivisions around the Cardinal, a private golf course community
carved from a cattle farm in the early 1970s. Back then, airport
officials objected to the development, apparently foreseeing a
collision between residential sprawl and the expanding regional
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, his wife, Helen, and their two children moved to
northwest Greensboro in 1996 and bought their present home in
December 1997, four months before FedEx announced plans for its
Greensboro hub.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of their proximity to the airport, they nonetheless moved
to Edinburgh because of the quality of the schools and the
friendliness of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we could put up with the day noise from the
airport,'' Miller said. But like many others, he never imagined a
project as big as FedEx, even though the airport's long-range plan
showed a third runway.
</P>
<P>
   A bunker mentality has set in among residents of affluent
neighborhoods surrounding the Cardinal country club. Realtors
report houses that typically sell in 30 to 90 days now take six
months or longer. In some cases, homeowners took sizable losses
when their property finally sold.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who tried to sell their homes have given up. They
are holding out hope FedEx might decide not to build the hub after
all.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition said it has collected more than 4,600 signatures
from people across Guilford County who oppose the FedEx hub. Yet
even as the group tries to broaden its appeal by citing the
potentially negative environmental fallout, not all residents near
the airport oppose the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some who live closest to the proposed hub hope it is built
because they feel certain they'll be bought out by the airport
authority. Some who oppose construction of a third runway aren't
necessarily against the hub itself.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials concede that the hub will generate noise, but
that steps will be taken to minimize it.
</P>
<P>
   The airport authority's Johnson rejected the coalition's
assertion that more than 4,000 homes, valued at $634 million, could
be affected by jet noise and thus eligible for some form of
mitigation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson estimated the authority expects ``around 100'' homes
will be eligible for buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few would be in the Cardinal,'' Johnson said. He
explained that 90 to 95 percent of FedEx's jets would arrive and
depart at the ends of the two runways opposite the Cardinal
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Such predictions just make opponents madder. Some weary of the
protracted fight can't wait for it to be over, one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm an optimist,'' said Realtor Penny Olson, who sells
houses in the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think things will get better the day the first plane
takes off.''

PLANTING GARDEN MEMORIES FOR YOUR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the first memory you have of a garden? If you are reading
this, you are probably a gardener, but did you ever think where or
why you got interested in this fascinating pastime?
</P>
<P>
   If I ever have time, I am going to write a book for my children
called ``Mother's Garden.'' I have been wanting to do this because
they call me, usually long distance, to ask something like, ``What
are the dots on my magnolia and what should I do?'' (Answer:
Magnolia scale. Spray with dormant oil.)
</P>
<P>
   When children are just discovering the world and how it works,
each and every mother's garden (and father's garden, too) is a
source of wonder and sharing. The trick is to share something that
grows easily and well to become a memory cherished forever.
</P>
<P>
   For the smallest child, start with sure things that sprout fast.
Consider a flowerpot or clear plastic cake container planted with
rye grass seeds, not blue grass or fescue, which will sprout in
five or six days if the soil is warm. They can be ``mowed'' with
scissors. After one or two shearings, juvenile boredom will set in
and, mercifully, you'll be able to throw it out, onto the mulch
pile.
</P>
<P>
   For a real garden experience that can be shared all summer long,
consider vegetables and the joy of the harvest. The two old
reliable standbys are bush beans and tomatoes. If you'd rather
plant flowers, nothing can beat dwarf marigolds for fast sprouting,
fast flowering, and no deadheading. Sunflowers, though not as easy,
grow so fast they are memorable, and even more so if and when they
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Though we buy flower and vegetable seedlings these days, I think
watching the seeds sprout is an important part of gardening in
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Start with beans. These can be sowed outdoors when all chance of
frost is gone, but for children it's more fun as well as more
reliable to start some seeds indoors on a sunny windowsill.
</P>
<P>
   For inexpensive planters, use paper milk cartons with the top
and bottom cut off. If run through the dishwasher, the chlorine
will semi-sterilize them.
</P>
<P>
   Plant two beans per container. To hasten germination, soak the
seeds overnight. If they don't sprout in a week, plant some more.
If too many grow, cut off the weakest ones with scissors. This
works for marigolds and sunflowers, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperature is warm enough, plant the beans outdoors,
in a prepared vegetable bed. Beans do not like their roots jostled,
so carefully cut away the paper container. At the same time, plant
a whole row of beans in the ground and two weeks later plant
another row for a season-long supply.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes should be bought as seedlings and planted outdoors a
week after the beans. Pick varieties that fruit early and are
disease resistant, and always include at least one cherry tomato
such as Sweet l00.
</P>
<P>
   When growing vegetables, it's wise to test the soil for lead,
particularly if you have a house built before the mid-1960s or your
land had old fruit trees or you are next to a heavily traveled
roadway. (Send a cupful in a bag that can be closed tightly along
with a check for $8 to Soil Testing Lab, West Experiment Station,
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have lead, grow flowers and be happy. To grow vegetables,
you should make a new raised bed at least eight inches high. Line
it with black plastic perforated for drainage, and bring in either
new clean loam or bagged soil. Fertilize regularly and add manure
if you want things to grow really well.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is heavily absorbed by leaf crops like lettuce, moderately
so by root crops such as radishes and carrots, and least by
fruiting crops such as tomatoes. The Romans had lots of lead
poisoning from their lead-lined wine amphora and lead water pipes.
We know better.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no suitable outdoor spot, a window box or a big
planter, regularly fertilized, can produce a nice harvest.
Incidentally, just two cooked beans make a memorable feast for the
child who has watched them grow.
</P>
<P>
   Why garden with children? It teaches many things, like
responsibility and patience, and that everything isn't as simple as
on TV or the Web. Some things live and some don't, so gardening is
a way for children to learn to face calamities with quiet
acceptance and move on. Plant some more seeds if chipmunks eat the
seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, gardening is a lifelong hobby with happy memories
of Mom or Dad or grandparents. What is the garden you want your
children to remember?

   Convention center boosts New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   By Shelia M. Poole
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ New Orleans has long been a hot destination for
tourists and conventioneers. After all, there's Bourbon Street,
exceptional cuisine and finger-snapping music.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the city has been working hard to
increase the number of convention visitors by providing bigger
meeting facilities and better hotels By some accounts, New Orleans,
with all its charm, is undergoing a ``renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of new hotels being planned or under
construction, and several new condominium projects are being
developed.
</P>
<P>
   On the transportation front, there's talk of establishing a rail
system that will link the area around the convention center to the
airport, and also reviving the old streetcar system to ferry people
around the central business district.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans doesn't quite have the growing pains of nearby
Biloxi, Miss., which is feeling the effects of a burgeoning casino
presence. Nor does it have the woes of metro Atlanta, which, fueled
by a strong economy, is rapidly growing _ a growth that has
resulted in massive traffic jams and even stirred some
municipalities to invoke building moratoriums.
</P>
<P>
   Many credit a large part of New Orleans' growth to the recent
expansion of the Ernest Morial Convention Center, a huge complex
sandwiched between the Mississippi River and the warehouse
district, which is undergoing a revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The total economic impact of the convention center in 1997 was
$3.1 billion. It has helped solidify New Orleans as a major
convention draw, vying neck and neck with Atlanta, Orlando and Las
Vegas, all of which recently have expanded convention facilities or
have plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernest Morial Convention Center opened its second expansion
earlier this year, with 1.1 million square feet of contiguous
exhibition space that can be divided into 12 separate halls. A
state-of-the-art conference center auditorium, which can seat more
than 4,000, can also be divided. There's already talk of a third
expansion, though nothing has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it. We already know we need it,'' said Edward McNeill,
executive vice president of New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The largest convention booked to date is the Super Com Show,
which draws 36,000 participants. But in 2013 and 2014, New Orleans
will get the Home Builders Show, which will bring 60,000 people to
the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, there were only X-number of hotel rooms,''
McNeill said. ``Now there are many more hotel rooms, more
restaurants and more sights to see. People wouldn't be investing in
those things if we were not doing something to drive the economy.
People don't build hotel rooms not to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might think the market will soon reach the saturation
point, but so far it looks good, McNeill said. ``We're holding our
breath that the bubble won't burst.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, a Ritz-Carlton luxury hotel will open on Canal
Street, just on the edge of the French Quarter. The $200 million
project, on the site of the historic Maison Blache building, will
have a 452-room hotel with rooms from $305 to $335 a night, a spa,
fitness center, shops, meeting rooms and a high-end restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly to an extent a lot of (guests) will be tourists, but
no doubt the overall attraction is meetings and conventions,'' said
Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman for Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. ``Groups
like doctors, lawyers and other high-end groups are going to be
very receptive to having a convention in the city if they know
there is a luxury hotel there.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1999 and 2001, nearly 12 new hotels are scheduled to
open, adding more than 8,000 rooms to the market, according to the
New Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't include hotel renovations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, later this year, Le Meridien plans to renovate 400
rooms. In other developments, Harrah's is building a casino near
the convention center. The casino on Poydras Street is scheduled to
open in October.
</P>
<P>
   Local entrepreneurs are also getting in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   The Halpren family, which owns a furniture-making business
across the street from the convention center, plans to move its
operations from that site to another area. Then, the family plans
to develop a hotel, restaurant and small bar.
</P>
<P>
   The family plans to start construction on the five-story,
100-room hotel this summer. That could grow to a total of 300
rooms, if the family decides to develop additional land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about this for 10 years,'' said Edward Halpern. ``We
knew the convention center was here and would be a factor.'' But, a
decade ago, the center was much smaller _ and five blocks away _
putting the Halpern property on the fringe of the convention area.
With the expansion, the convention center is now much closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda come to us,'' Halpern said. ``Now, the best use for
the buildin'' and people did. And did. And did. And did.
</P>
<P>
   City and suburban dimensions have exploded. Development
regulations and miles of new roads and sewers have made it easier
and cheaper _ for both home buyers and developers _ to go farther
out than to stay within urban areas. And people like what they get
farther out. What wonderful appeal: a fresh start, good schools,
less crime, big houses, big yards, new stores. Less hustle and
bustle, at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   But growth has gotten less comfortable. And a lot more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't simply there are more people than ever before
in the South. It's that the region and much of the rest of the
nation stumbled in planning ahead. It didn't build enough schools,
roads, sewers or public transportation to accommodate the
newcomers. And the job of providing all that stuff got harder and
more costly the farther out and more spread out people went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was just grand to keep growing and
growing,'' said ``
</P>
<P>
   DeGrove cites suburban sprawl: monolithic development, almost
entirely dependent on the car, hopscotching toward the horizon. ``I
call it `sluburbia,'' he said. And he concludes that even though
people continue to rush to distant suburbs, Americans are
recognizing that kind of development carries high environmental,
social and economic costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh-Durham, big high-tech firms worry that increasing
traffic will limit their ability to expand because it will be
harder to find talented workers willing to move to the area. In
metro Atlanta, nearly every chamber of commerce backed creation of
a powerful state authority to force growth changes to ease the
area's air pollution problems and bring back federal road dollars.
In Austin, Texas _ a metro area a third the size of metro Atlanta _
officials face the certainty that soon the city will have dirtied
its air so much that it will fall out of compliance with federal
clean air laws.
</P>
<P>
   From Oxford, Miss., to Charlotte to Virginia's northern suburbs,
communities are struggling with the challenges of sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   In some metro areas, home buyers and developers have begun to
return to inner cities, though generally in far smaller numbers
than those continuing the suburban march. And in many communities,
tidbits of former development trends have returned as alternatives
to sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``smart growth'' by supporters, the idea calls for
compact, well-designed development, with mixtures of homes, stores
and workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The projects are supposed to reduce dependence on driving a
motor vehicle alone and maximize people's ability to walk, bike,
and ride buses or light rail.
</P>
<P>
   For all the South's population bonanza, some cities and rural
areas have had little growth, or even population losses.
Communities like Leesville, La., worry about how to draw the
economic boom that others in the South have enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, the South's economy and population have grown
faster than the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drawing people in from the rest of the country is a really big
deal for the continued economic growth of the South,'' says Tom
Cunningham, a senior economist at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Newcomers fill new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But both he and DeGrove say it's clear the region has to tackle
sprawl's side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much more than ever before,'' DeGrove says, ``you find people
say we've gone too far.''

 &HT;    Cleaning up our polluted air is likely to take years
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Getting metro Atlanta's traffic problems under control
goes hand-in-hand with getting the area's pollution problems under
control.
</P>
<P>
   A federal moratorium on highway construction, triggered by
Atlanta's failure to meet air quality standards, means the region
can't expand the capacity of its highways.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Regional Commission, the planning agency for 10
metro counties, is working on a plan to address air pollution
problems and hopes to have it in place next year.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the plan; even if the feds approve the plan,
actually cleaning up our polluted air is likely to take many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Congress repealed the Clean Air Act and said we can
have all the money, we'd still have a sprawl and pollution problem
we're going to have to address,'' Gov. Roy Barnes said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is caused, at least in large measure, by all those
cars, trucks and sports-utility vans crowding metro Atlanta
highways _ with the numbers increasing every day. The congested
traffic helped put Atlanta in violation of federal air quality
standards. The guidelines cover a number of auto-related
pollutants, including ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Things could get worse soon. This year during the ozone season
(May 1-Sept. 30), the state Environmental Protection Division will
begin using a new, tougher standard for measuring ozone pollution.
Officials expect that could mean more days of noncompliance for
metro Atlanta, and possibly also affect Augusta, Columbus and
Macon. Also, this summer the EPD will begin phasing in
cleaner-burning gas in metro Atlanta. It's the first step in an
ongoing program to lower the sulfur content of fuel, which in turn
will limit the emission of nitrogen oxides, a contributor to ozone
smog.
</P>
<P>
   As air quality regulations change, transportation plans must
change with them to remain in compliance, said Marlin Gottschalk,
program manager in the air protection branch of the state EPD.
Trying to get the plans to match here _ and loosen up federal money
_ has created conflicts between transportation and environmental
planners on both the state and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Not all road projects are banned. Projects that will enhance air
quality, such as ongoing extensions of the HOV lanes on I-75 and
I-85, are permitted. Safety and hazard-elimination projects may
also continue.
</P>
<P>
   A number of road projects were ``grandfathered,'' or approved
before the moratorium took effect more than a year ago. But several
environmental groups have filed a lawsuit challenging Atlanta's
grandfathered projects, and a federal appeals court recently ruled
the federal Environmental Protection Agency's practice of allowing
grandfathered projects to proceed is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Regional Commission has said it is on track to get a
plan _ including nearly $30 billion in road, mass transit and other
expansions _ approved by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's newly created Georgia Regional Transportation
Agency will have to review the plan and decide what goals it ought
to meet, how resources should be allocated, what should be
emphasized and which areas should get priority.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to be months away from addressing the issue.

 &HT;    Raleigh-Durham region working together to control growth
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH _ This high-tech mecca is packaged like one metro area,
routinely referred to as Raleigh-Durham, but it doesn't act like
it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the phone company knows it. Raleigh-Durham isn't in the
same local calling zone. It can be a long-distance charge to dial
from the Durham area to Raleigh 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Want a road built? That could require approval of one of two
separate regional transportation authorities that split the metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh-Durham is in fact a hodgepodge of communities strung
together by I-40 and a famous research campus, Research Triangle
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a dominant city,'' says Jim Roberson, the
president of Research Triangle Foundation, the developer of the
park. ``This is a community of communities and each works hard at
maintaining its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here think it is a strength,'' Roberson said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also complicates the task of managing growth.
Administrators build new schools at a furious pace, but they still
don't have enough to avoid packing classrooms into school
gymnasiums and libraries. Gridlock has metastasized into a daily
menace, burrowing its way into the daily fabric of home life and
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down from D.C. in '92. There was no traffic problem
compared to D.C., but we are catching up fast,'' says Gaile
Renegar, an attorney who works in Research Triangle Park. ``There
is a sense it's not being managed, that it's uncontrolled growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Job recruiters have noticed the effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago traffic didn't play a role in job decisions.
Now it has a major influence,'' says Kabir Mahadeva, who directs
recruiting for technical positions for Fortune Personnel
Consultants of Raleigh. Some highly marketable workers refuse to
apply for jobs that would involve traffic-clogged commutes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One such person is Donna Bennett, a veteran of computer project
management who won't pursue jobs that could pay $80,000 a year if
they entail a commute on I-40 that will cut into time with her
family. Traffic ``is a critical factor even in things like where I
let my daughter do extracurricular activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth,'' she said, ``is starting to run up smack against
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, some of the major employers in Research Triangle
Park met with North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt to plead for emergency
funds for betterroads. They warned that major expansions could be
threatened by traffic.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies asking for improvements was the
pharmaceuticals company Glaxo Wellcome, which has nearly 6,000
employees locally. The company takes the traffic risks so seriously
that Bob Ingram, Glaxo's chief executive of worldwide operations,
agreed to chair a regional committee looking into traffic fixes.
</P>
<P>
   New regional efforts _ mostly voluntary strategy sessions
involving government and business leaders _ have raised hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole region is starting to work together a lot better,''
says Bill Shore, Glaxo's director of community affairs. ``We are
probably five years late in doing it, but we are doing it now.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all its downside, growth has plenty of fans here.
Raleigh-Durham has cracked the million population mark and growth
has made sure the metro area stays fresh, with new store concepts,
new restaurants and a barrage of new civic projects that include a
new stadium, a new entertainment and sports arena, plans for a
sports park, a new art museum and a major expansion of a science
and natural history museum.
</P>
<P>
   While Donna Bennett refuses to seek a job that would require
driving on I-40, she quickly points out that her family has
benefited from the area's dramatic economic growth and spreading
pool of entrepreneurial start-ups. Her husband works for one,
commuting sometimes an hour each way to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs have been plentiful and diverse. Research Triangle Park's
heavily wooded setting has drawn big branches of big companies.
IBM's largest single cluster of workers _ 14,000 _ is here, rather
than at the company's headquarters in New York. Raleigh is North
Carolina's state capitol with a plethora of government workers.
Then there's the metro area's concentration of major hospitals and
universities, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
to Duke University in Durham and North Carolina State in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   But problems remain. Planners predict the metro area will dirty
its air so much within the next five years that it will fall out of
compliance with federal clean air standards. The pressure to keep
up with growth has frustrated local elected officials. The city of
Cary resorted to water quotas to divvy up future supplies for
predicted development.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have tried to make progress. A regional transit
authority plans to open a light rail system connecting Durham,
Research Triangle Park, Raleigh-Durham International Airport and
Raleigh by the year 2004. It's run into snags working out details
with the airport and Duke University. And it is still short of
money to complete its first phase, though it has both state and
federal funding and money from a local rental car tax.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last montha group of business and government leaders
announced its suggestions for how to keep up with transportation
needs. The recommendations include a five-cent increase in the gas
tax statewide, creation of HOV lanes and state legislation to allow
construction of toll roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge,'' says Raleigh planning director George
Chapman, ``is one of more trying to develop some kind of collective
decision-making in the region as a whole.'' Change in
Raleigh-Durham's approach to growth has been slow in coming, says
Mack Paul, a local attorney who has been active in area growth
coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what point along that continuum will we have
the political will that we need to make these changes,'' Paul says.
He favors the idea of a strong regional authority to make growth
work, but he adds, ``Local officials are not going to relinquish
authority without some political pressure or pots of money as
incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what it took in Atlanta for you to do something,'' he
said. ``We are a long way from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders, like developer and former Raleigh mayor
Smedes York, say the area doesn't need another layer of government.
Instead they say it needs leaders who are less reactive to
neighborhood fights and willing to allow developments that put
homes, stores and workplaces within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the rub of how best to get Raleigh-Durham's
independent communities to work together.
</P>
<P>
   Says Roberson of the Research Triangle Foundation, ``Any notion
to try to force anybody in Durham to do something with folks in
Raleigh would not work. If you're talking about sticks it wouldn't
work. Carrots, maybe it would.''

 &HT;    Tax, planning authority needed to prevent accidental communities
 &HT;    By Donald Ratajczak
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Urban sprawl now appears to be discussed by politicians at all
levels of jurisdiction and by most communities. Congestion has
crowded out education and crime as the primary local concerns of
Atlanta citizens. Deteriorating air quality is on the verge of
ending federal financing for road construction in much of the
Atlanta area. How did we get this way and what can be done about
it?
</P>
<P>
   Unless sprawl is hidden when people make their location choices,
an economist must assume sprawl is preferred to the alternatives.
To be sure, no new community wants more people between them and
their work. Sometimes, development occurs after people have
settled. As a result, social costs are inflicted in the form of
more drive time and lower air quality when the new communities are
constructed. Needless to say, there currently exists no method for
extracting these costs from the new developments.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we can readily see two factors that create the problems of
sprawl. One, it is preferred to alternatives, whether they are at
higher-priced or perceptively lower government-served communities
elsewhere. Also, owning your own homestead may mean more than
sharing a condominium high-rise. Indeed, sprawl in Atlanta may be
preferred to non-sprawl in other locations. Otherwise, why are
100,000 new people per year coming here despite all the sprawl
publicity?
</P>
<P>
   Second, new community development either is unnoticed or
unexpected but it inflicts costs upon the lifestyles of existing
communities. In other words, the costs of new development exceed
the prices paid by those occupying those developments.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to combating sprawl must address the factors that
create it. Can we change the perceived cost/benefits of government
between the inner cities and the sprawling suburban communities?
Are we providing subsidies to sprawl at the expense of other
location decisions? Can we extract the social costs of new
community developments requiring new transportation, schools,
sewers, and inflicting more congestion and lower air quality from
the purchasers of those communities?
</P>
<P>
   If the economic costs of sprawl are inflicted by the automobile
(an issue that still requires considerable debate), then higher
costs must be heaped on that vehicle. Europe suffers much less
sprawl than the U.S., although Europe also has much less growth of
population. (Fewer people is one way to avoid sprawl, as many of
our northern urban neighbors have discovered.)
</P>
<P>
   At least one reason for less sprawl in Europe is the substantial
operating costs inflicted upon automobilies. Gasoline taxes are
high there. Parking is not always subsidized at work. Companies
sponsor lunches on premises so the midday traffic can be avoided.
Also, alternatives to the auto are timely and low cost, especially
the trains.
</P>
<P>
   I am not one to advocate sky-high prices on gasoline to finance
alternative transportation that will create more noxious fumes in
its construction than will be removed by the autos it displaces.
Clearly, autos came after urban developments in Europe. This
permitted concentrations that economically could be linked by rail.
Atlanta is a city created by the auto. Only a crash effort to push
alternative transportation beyond the population concentrations
could have any meaningful impact upon altering that auto
dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the subsidies provided to auto transportation need
to end. We have no business using $20 million from the general fund
in the latest Georgia budget to help build roads. If gasoline taxes
are not available, roads should not be built. Of course, this is a
backhand way of saying Georgia's gasoline taxes are too low.
</P>
<P>
   Subsidized parking also encourages auto use. Many employees
prefer working in the surburbs because they drive to their spots
without cost. What would happen to the auto if all highway
construction required by a community was billed to that community
and all parking space cost the user the appropriate land rent for
the space?
</P>
<P>
   Better planning of the location of new communities may also
help. Our zoning is based more upon the private property rights of
existing landowners than upon the costs of using that land to
existing residents. Why shouldn't property taxes be staggered?
</P>
<P>
   Older communities not putting new burdens on the construction of
social capital should receive a lower millage rate than new
communities requiring new schools and sewers. Property used
according to approved and acknowledged land-use plans would require
less approval costs than property that inflicts substantial costs
upon surrounding neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   We now have the spatial tools to determine the costs of altering
zoning. Those costs should be borne by those requesting such
changes.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much more to be said. Clearly, the perception
(possibly reality) of poor cost/benefits from some governments must
be removed. We now have a transportation oversight committee for
the Atlanta region. In theory, we also have one for regional
governments, called the state government that charters most of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The state, however, has avoided the disputes and incompetence of
local governance. Perhaps it is time to create some taxing and
planning authority that serves the urban areas rather than allow
these decisions to remain with each historically accidental
community that currently demands independent jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these proposals are radical. But if you ask why there
is sprawl, these are some of the solutions that surface.
</P>
<P>
   (Quote): Older communities not putting new burdens on the
construction of social capital should receive a lower millage rate
than new communities requiring new schools and sewers.

 &HT;    Tourists? Development?
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach wants more
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach eager to turn
 &HT;    tourism into development
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Stephen Greene is waving his arms, his eyes
wide, his voice like a carnival barker's hawking the changes up and
down the Grand Strand.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Hard Rock theme cafe with its replica of Egyptian
pyramids. The only one of its kind! There's the first NASCAR Cafe,
where diners can practice taking off and putting on tires. Just
like a real pit crew! There's Broadway at the Beach, strip centers
connected in a frenzy of shopping, nightlife and restaurants. Each
section is themed, so it looks like Boston or Charleston!
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. How about 46 miniature golf courses, 102
not-so-miniature golf courses and 11 live theaters?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say we are overdeveloped. Others say we're not
even close,'' Greene says, gesturing out the window of his
sport-utility vehicle and, for a moment, taking his hands off the
steering wheel. He's the chief spokesman for the area's chamber of
commerce. ``If you fly overhead, you'll see how much we have
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle Beach embraces its neon roots _ its seashell bracelet,
Putt-Putt Golf and ``Believe It or Not'' image.
</P>
<P>
   But this small beach community inundated with 13 million
visitors a year also wants to get beyond the neon. Like scads of
other Southern coastal boom towns, Myrtle Beach is trying to
diversify, to spread its wings beyond the traditional yearly influx
of vacationing families and spring breakers and grab the market of
retirees and business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   So, it wants the world to know about its collections of
impressive outdoor sculptures at Brookgreen Gardens. Its new art
museum. The new convention center and upcoming 400-room hotel that
are eyeing overflow business trips from nearby big cities like
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the plans for an ``urban village,'' a la Fredrick
Law Olmstead, on an Air Force base that closed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this image of being the redneck Riviera and people
saying, `Agh, it's T-shirts and tacky,' '' Greene smiles. ``If you
haven't been here in five years, it's a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Myrtle Beach on a late spring or summer night,
cruise past the 1950s-style pavilion, with its cotton candy and
roller coasters, and you can still find teenagers in their
convertibles jamming Ocean Boulevard and longing for a few moments
with someone who catches their eye in another car. Walk up and down
the strip, and it's tough not to load up on T-shirts and every
imaginable beach-flavored trinket.
</P>
<P>
   But this 60-mile-long strip on South Carolina's northeast
corner, called the Grand Strand, has had one of the fastest-growing
housing markets in the country. Housing permits have nearly doubled
in the last four years. It means more and more visitors are
staying, or opting to buy a second home or condominium there.
</P>
<P>
   For Tami Meek, moving to the beach from Atlanta nearly three
years ago took some adjusting. She and her husband had to
reconfigure their thinking from the more corporate mind-set of
metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first moved, I said, `So, where does everyone work?' I
didn't see the office buildings,'' laughs Meek. ``Everyone was in
the service industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old is working as a bartender at the beachside Four
Points Sheraton while she finishes getting her bachelor's degree in
nursing. She and her husband were born and grew up in Atlanta. He
works in landscaping for Environmental Design and was asked to take
care of a project at Briarcliff Mall in North Myrtle Beach. When
the couple moved, they committed themselves to staying a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But business has really taken off,'' Meek says. ``The
businesses he has are all brand-new apartment complexes and the
NASCAR Cafe. It's definitely a boom town, but so is Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, and the service industry that accompanies it, has been
a giant force driving the economies of coastal towns. In Myrtle
Beach, roughly 70 percent of the jobs are tourism-related,
according to chamber of commerce statistics. Still, economic
leaders are trying to expand on that.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Myrtle Beach had been like an island hemmed in
by the Intracoastal Waterway and Big Blue, as some locals call the
Atlantic Ocean. But new and improved roads have changed that, as
will plans to spend $638 million for a big bypass creating more
crossings over the Intracoastal Waterway. Boosters hope other
infrastructure construction will open up even more land. There's
even been talk of a monorail system.
</P>
<P>
   And the big projects are rolling in. Burroughs and Chapin, the
old turpentine and timber company that once dominated the economy
and today is probably the biggest landholder in the area, is
developing Grande Dunes. It's a collection of homes, multifamily
units, shops, hotels and golf courses to fill up a sprawling chunk
of land from the U.S. 17 Bypass to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther north, Barefoot Landing was begun in 1998. It's
an $812 million project with plans for a conference center, golf
courses and residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   All the development isn't lost on Buddy Styres. He's trying to
lure some of it to the 4,000 acres that used to be the Myrtle Beach
Air Force Base. But as executive director of the quasi-governmental
redevelopment authority, the retired Air Force colonel doesn't want
a resort or collection of theme strip centers. He's looking to
build a small town called South Park Village.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of old sand-colored barracks and chipped-paint
buildings, Styres envisions a village where 1,200 families can live
within walking and bicycle distance of offices, shops, parks, a
tree-lined parkway and a series of small lakes cleverly doubling as
stormwater retention ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings he shows visitors are held alongside renderings of
Market Street in Charleston and the riverfront in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say, close your eyes and forget what you saw driving
in, and visualize what it can be in five years or 10 years, when
that is a main street,'' he says, pointing out his office window,
``and you have parks and retail with places to live above them. And
we are just 500 yards from the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Styres isn't unrealistic. Several parcels have sold. But he
doesn't exactly ask the banker to close his eyes and visualize. The
first phase of the project will cost about $25 million. There also
are hurdles to jump with the local school board and the city over
how to handle services to the area and how to split property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the plans for South Park Village, the smart-growth
buzzwords traveling around the country aren't exactly taking the
beach by storm. Still, all of the construction brings the
inevitable questions about where the community is growing _ and how
it's growing.
</P>
<P>
   Amid dealing with that, environmental issues are always bubbling
to the surface. Huge beach renourishment projects are trying to
stave off all the erosion that beachfront building has caused. The
area also has a mandatory testing program for water, to make sure
development runoff doesn't affect the water quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big worries is having more moderate and affordable
housing for all the workers fueling the massive service economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ever-present hassle with getting workers.
Unemployment has been hovering at a super-low 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those are troubles local business leaders don't necessarily
complain too much about.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Virginia Beach or in North Carolina or Charleston
are saying that they don't want to look like Myrtle Beach. You
might say you don't want to look like us all day long, but we do 13
million visitors a year,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people laugh about our neon. But that's not all we
have ... We want to be diversified to the point where we have
everything.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Only months ago, doom-meisters were having a field day
with Latin America after reverberations from Asia's financial
crisis appeared to be swamping the region.
</P>
<P>
   There were bloated deficits, collapsed currencies, and weaker
earnings by U.S. multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola Co.'s sales in Latin America, which shot up 19
percent in the first quarter of 1998, fell 4 percent to 5 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But now analysts are re-thinking their gloomy predictions for
the region's still-fragile -- but recovering -- economies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Latin America's future remains a shaky one as the
region's largest economy, Brazil, continues to wrestle with the
after-effects of a crisis spurred by last year's financial chaos in
both Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst could be over, and many countries are expected to
show signs of a rebound during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is much more upbeat now, and Brazil's recovery has
played a major role in this new optimism,'' said William Cline,
deputy managing director of the Institute of International Finance,
a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents international
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans still expect to see negative growth this year.
Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela all are bracing for recession.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the region's economy is expected to shrink by 1 to 1.5
percent this year, following growth of 2.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Cline said the economic panic that took Brazil by storm in
mid-January when the currency fell 46 percent has abated.
</P>
<P>
   Even moreso, Brazil's stock markets have surged. Interest rates
have been lowered to 34 percent. And the country's currency, the
real, has strengthened, regaining about 15 percent of its value in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute much of the economic turnaround to the new
president of Brazil's Central Bank, Arminio Fraga, a former fund
manager for Wall Street financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga brings enormous credibility to the table and a coherent
approach to addressing the fiscal deficit, and he's moved very
swiftly to deal with the country's problems,'' said Lawrence
Goodman, managing director of Global Economic Associates, a New
York-based economic advisory firm.
</P>
<P>
   He said inflation could fall to as lows as 10 percent by year's
end, and that interest rates could drop to lower than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is so upbeat about
Brazil's economy that in late March it approved the second
installment of a $41.5 billion rescue package, providing Brazil
with more much-needed reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government's next big priority is passing a fiscal
responsibility law that will be the linchpin of plans to get a
whopping public deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would permit the government to impose rigid limits
on all areas of spending, including on state governors and city
mayors, and establish stiff penalties and fines for those who
exceed their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the brighter picture in Brazil, economic turmoil has
yet to be averted in other parts of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, for example, is an economic basket case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government decided to float the currency earlier this
year, the sucre, it has fallen drastically.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year it's expected to lose 60 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the Andean nation's national debt of $16
billion is totally disproportionate to its annual budget of $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its troubles can be traced to El Nino, which caused $2.6
billion in flood damage last year, as well as to falling world
prices for oil, the country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador hopes to negotiate a deal with the IMF and other world
lenders that could provide the country with as much as $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking with authorities in Ecuador for quite some
time now,'' said the IMF's Francisco Baker, who refused to indicate
whether a deal was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ecuador, other countries such as Argentina, Brazil's
major trading partner, have been dragged into recession by Brazil's
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of Argentina's exports go to Brazil. But these
exports are expected to fall by at least a third this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a recovery in the flow of capital to Argentina,
but we still believe Argentina will experience a recession this
year,'' said Felipe Frydman, economic minister at Argentina's
embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off a deepening crisis, Argentina's President Carlos
Menem stunned U.S. officials by recently proposing that Argentina
abolish its national currency, the peso, and replace it with the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   That means salaries, car payments, store purchases, and other
financial transactions would be denominated in the American
greenback.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the currencies trade on a 1-to-1 parity, and many
financial transactions already are made with dollars instead of
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has urged Argentina's government to
move cautiously, and only in consultation with U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the hobbling of economic growth in Argentina
and other countries, the dreaded economic meltdown has failed to
materialize in much of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, has demonstrated a better-than-expected
ability to weather the crisis. About 75 percent of that country's
trade is with the United States so as long as the U.S. economy
shows growth, so will Mexico's.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn against overall complacency.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that the worst part of the region's crisis may be
over, but that doesn't mean developing countries will be wildly
healthy any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank reported earlier this month that it expects
average growth rates in developing countries to fall to just 1.5
percent in 1999, the lowest growth rate since 1982, before
ratcheting back up in 2000 to 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's still below the average rate of 4.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Latin countries could suffer if the U.S. economy
stops being so robust, or if the high-flying U.S. stock market
finally stops defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a quick return to the heyday of the mid-1990s
is relatively slim,'' Goodman said. ``But things are sure better
than they were, and we are starting to see a recovery.''

A VISION IN VEGETABLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture tomatoes lashed to stakes with old nylon stockings and
pepper seedlings covered with chopped-off plastic milk bottles used
as cloches, and you have a vision of the traditional vegetable
garden. Like the orphan in a fairy tale, it was usually stashed out
of sight, often behind the garage.
</P>
<P>
   But many vegetable gardens are no longer the ugly relation of
the flower garden. They're taking their rollers out, putting on
lipstick and glass slippers, and claiming more visible positions.
Some are even in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Rosalind Creasy, the California doyen of edible
landscaping, has planted designs of different colored lettuces and
other vegetables for a number of years. She took her inspiration
from Europeans, who often frame their front walks with beautiful
vegetable patches and fragrant herbs, as well as flowers.
</P>
<P>
   These days, more American gardeners with limited space are
combining vegetables and flowers in a single garden that marries
flavor and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The French-inspired potager garden is one easy-going style with
increasing popularity. Named from the French word for soup, potager
gardens mix small amounts of continually sown crops with herbs to
provide everything you need for a pot of vegetable soup. Decorative
flowers for the table are often included. A concept more than a
planting plan, the potager garden itself is a kind of all-inclusive
horticultural soup, prettily mingling vegetables, herbs,
ornamentals, and even fruit trees into a single plot, and breaking
down old ideas about compartmentalization.
</P>
<P>
   A more challenging French approach that's also making inroads is
the parterre style, usually symmetrical pairs of formal-looking
multiple square beds planted with vegetables. One example,
considered one of the world's most beautiful vegetable gardens, is
at the Chateau de Villandry in the Loire Valley of France. It's
composed of nine large parterres, each divided into a different
pattern of vegetables and flowers. Symmetrical paths between
parterres are an important part of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ornamental and complicated is the parterre de broderie
style. Like the embroidery from which it takes its name, these
gardens contain elaborate rounded designs, composed of curving rows
of plants within the parterre squares. It's much more difficult to
achieve this with annual vegetables than with ornamental
perennials, but Jan and Michael Gertley, two Washington state
designers, have devised and described how to create nine such
gardens, ranging from window-box size to 32 feet square, in their
new book, ``The Art of the Kitchen Garden'' (Taunton Press).
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable gardens are looking better because of changes in who
grows them and why. ``This has become something we do for pleasure
now. And once that becomes your motive, the pleasure gained from
something looking good becomes part of it,'' says Creasy, whose
newest publishing venture is a colorful paperback series on edible
gardening, distributed in the United States by the Charles E.
Tuttle Co.
</P>
<P>
   Americans used to grow long rows of vegetables, which they then
harvested all at once and canned for future use. But today's
homeowners, safe in the knowledge that supermarkets stock winter
vegetables, are growing food just to eat fresh at harvest time.
This naturally leads to continual sowing and harvesting of little
bunches of beans or lettuce, and a smaller but lusher garden
located close to the house for daily snipping and gathering. It is,
in short, a more Mediterranean style of vegetable gardening, which
has contributed to the new interest in European design.
</P>
<P>
   The recent explosion of colorful vegetables in seed catalogs
reflects the trend toward growing vegetables that look as good as
they taste. When landscape designer Creasy lectured on edible
landscaping 15 years ago, gardeners would ask her if she used food
coloring on her blue potatoes, and her clients were deeply
suspicious of ruby chard.
</P>
<P>
   Now seed companies sell purple green beans, white eggplants, and
striped tomatoes. Peppers? You have your choice of growing crimson,
gold, orange, red, yellow, or purple ones, as well as green. Beets
can be red, gold, or candy-striped, while bush beans can be gold,
purple, or yellow.
</P>
<P>
   One year Allard, whose cookbook ``Absolutely Delicious'' was
inspired by her vegetable garden, created a purple and red theme by
planting purple-pink `Neon' eggplant from Johnny's, dark purple
`Violetta Lunga' from The Cook's Garden, `Scarlet Emperor' pole
beans from Nichols, and `Purple Pod' pole beans from Henry Field's
Seed &AMP; Nursery in Shenandoah, Iowa. Another winning combination was
sunflowers grown through red tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Renee's Garden sells seeds of assorted color variants in one
package. The company dyes the seeds with Easter egg dye, so you can
see what colors you're planting and design accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Gertleys' vegetable and flower designs,
which look like a living Celtic knot or Japanese family crest come
to life, especially if viewed from a balcony or second-story
window. To photograph each of the nine gardens the couple created,
Michael put his camera on a 40-foot boom, then tripped the shutter
by remote control to capture the carpet-like designs.
</P>
<P>
   The Gertleys give detailed instructions for those who are game
to try their designs, including advice on how to grow the necessary
plants from seed. A typical composition requires more than 700
plants, which would be prohibitively expensive to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it takes an hour or two to lay out each design, using
string and stakes and working from our pattern on graph paper,''
says Jan Gertley. Mulch is also important, serving as a decorative
background the way colored gravel does in European parterres.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you harvest the produce of a decorative vegetable
garden without destroying the design?
</P>
<P>
   The Gertleys use parsley to simulate boxwood edging and
interplant sweet alyssum with the vegetables to fill in the design
as harvesting progresses. To preserve the design as long as
possible, Jan recommends harvesting the outer leaves of plants like
lettuce and pulling every other beet or radish at first.
</P>
<P>
   The Gertleys' favorite vegetables for beauty, pest resistance,
and ease of growth are beets, lettuce, bush beans, herbs, the new
colored chards, spinach, and onions. Creasy also recommends working
with tomatoes and zucchinis, which are now available in rounded
shapes and deep yellow stripes.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners who want to explore these decorative vegetables
and European gardening styles, Creasy recommends trying a potager
garden. ``You get a quick return. You don't have to wait two months
to harvest mesclun and spinach.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it pretty? ``That depends on the flowers you mix in with your
vegetables,'' Creasy says, adding that there are other
considerations to her choices. ``Thyme, dill, marigolds, and sweet
alyssum all pay their way by attracting beneficial insects that
will dine on pests threatening your vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gertleys also advise starting small.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, their more intricate designs will produce less to eat
than vegetables grown intensively in rows.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you could do our designs with just flowers,'' says Jan
Gertley. ``But there's an aesthetic beauty to vegetables. And we
actually did get quite a good yield.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest fans of their project were local children, she
reports. ``All the neighbors were fascinated, but especially the
kids, who loved to follow our mulch paths as though they were in a
maze.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that can get kids excited about vegetables is worth
considering.

 &HT;    Need growing for traffic troubleshooters
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like thousands of Atlanta area commuters, Cheryle Crumley dreads
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Four days a week she endures a 2 1/2 hour, round-trip crawl on
Georgia 400 to get to her job at Emory University. The round-trip
commute used to take a little more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrendous,'' the Alpharetta resident said of her Georgia
400 trek, an ordeal she's dealt with for six years. ``I fume. By
the time I get to work, I'm ready to murder a few people. It's
pretty stressful. And it's not going to get better until we have
some major lifestyle adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumley brings more to that assessment than a commuter's
frustration. As Emory's director of alternative transportation,
it's her job to help the university's employees steer clear of
Atlanta's vise-like traffic and persuade them to try other ways to
get to work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tough sell in Atlanta. But as sprawl grows, so does the
need for traffic troubleshooters like Crumley. While sprawl creates
lots of headaches, it's also creating jobs, many of which didn't
exist a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of jobs that will be critical for the
future of Atlanta,'' said Michael Dziak, a teleworking expert in
Snellville.
</P>
<P>
   Communities, business groups and companies like Home Depot,
Georgia Pacific, Georgia Power and Hewlett Packard are hiring
full-time transportation planners to make business operations in a
rapidly growing region more manageable, and to ease on-the-road
hassles for workers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Crumley and others like her can attest, changing
commuting habits is difficult in a region so wedded to its cars _
commuters here spend more time behind the wheel than any place in
the nation, and the number of cars is growing faster than the
number of people. As traffic and congestion grow, so does the need
for people like Crumley entrusted to find new ways to deal with an
old problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's requiring now is a new mix,'' says Philip Winters,
director of the Transportation Demand Management program at the
University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation
Research in Tampa. ``Perhaps the idea in the past was to build more
roads. Now we can't really afford it. Building our way out just
isn't an option anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumley became the region's first full-time employer
transportation coordinator when Emory enlisted her help five years
ago after running into a parking space crunch at the 640-acre main
campus on Clifton Road. Her work has since evolved into a job
that's part urban planner, marketer, saleswoman and customer
service representative. She also sits on a number of regional
committees that give her a front-row seat of the region's growing
pains, as well as some influence in curbing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no predecessor,'' she said. ``We're creating this
position as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   At Emory, Crumley oversees an expanded set of services for
employees _ from free MARTA passes to carpooling to promoting
telecommuting _ aimed at helping the university's 14,000 employees
find solutions to their traffic problems. Demand for Crumley's
knowledge has since spread to the community around Emory, and she
is acting director of the Clifton Corridor Transportation
Management Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``With parking and transportation issues, we discovered we had
to work with other disciplines such as planners on future buildings
and how that will affect traffic congestion and flow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Emory's transportation needs are a small part of the
region's growth, the university is a microcosm of what happens to
Atlanta. ``We may be slightly ahead of the curve,'' Crumley said.
``When people start discussing these issues on a regional level, I
find that we've already been dealing with these issues at Emory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, five transportation management
associations have been established in the Atlanta region.
</P>
<P>
   Malaika Warner heads one. She brought her background in
transportation demand management to Atlanta from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of urban areas have been forerunners to this,'' said
Warner, a former Atlanta Regional Commission official who helped
create and now runs the Cumberland Transportation Network, metro
Atlanta's first TMA. Like Crumley, Warner works with companies to
find options besides solo driving by employees to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new to everybody. TMAs are really marketing arms. They're
not engineering arms. We promote alternatives. Most TMAs look at
what's wrong with current transportation systems and how we can
improve it. Then we work with the business community and government
agencies to get it done. We're kind of the go-between.'' Getting
people to think in pairs or groups when it comes to driving is a
hard concept to put into practice, even for the planners
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Crumley and Warner drive alone to work because they say their
schedules keep them from being able to carpool. Warner says she's
in meetings some nights until 8. But she eventually plans to tap
into a regional database of potential carpoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Crumley says moving closer into town isn't an
option for her. ``My home and family are established in
Alpharetta,'' where she has lived 13 years. Plus, she said, ``The
cost of housing close in has been a deterrent for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crumley adds: ``I have changed my commute pattern. I use a
flexible work schedule.'' She works from home once a week and
sometimes two or three times a week during the summer. At work, she
says she takes MARTA to most business meetings in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Crumley says she empathizes with people who aren't able to make
commuting adjustments, and for that reason she tries to take a
``big picture'' approach to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people can ride MARTA, but can't carpool. Others who may
not be able to carpool may be good telecommute candidates. You look
at the whole gamut of options.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow process,'' said James Caldwell, secretary of
environmental programs at Home Depot. He added the duties of
transportation coordinator last August when the company started its
program as a way to address the region's clean air problem. The
company works with the Cumberland Transportation Network and offers
car and van-pooling and discounted passes on MARTA and Cobb
Community Transit. The home improvement chain is also looking at
flextime and telecommuting as options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get people to change their lifestyles,'' he said.
``It's more than a situation of `I'm not going to drive.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Only months ago, doom-meisters were having a field day
with Latin America after reverberations from Asia's financial
crisis appeared to be swamping the region.
</P>
<P>
   There were bloated deficits, collapsed currencies, and weaker
earnings by U.S. multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola Co.'s sales in Latin America, which shot up 19
percent in the first quarter of 1998, fell 4 percent to 5 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But now analysts are re-thinking their gloomy predictions for
the region's still-fragile -- but recovering -- economies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Latin America's future remains a shaky one as the
region's largest economy, Brazil, continues to wrestle with the
after-effects of a crisis spurred by last year's financial chaos in
both Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst could be over, and many countries are expected to
show signs of a rebound during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is much more upbeat now, and Brazil's recovery has
played a major role in this new optimism,'' said William Cline,
deputy managing director of the Institute of International Finance,
a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents international
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans still expect to see negative growth this year.
Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela all are bracing for recession.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the region's economy is expected to shrink by 1 to 1.5
percent this year, following growth of 2.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Cline said the economic panic that took Brazil by storm in
mid-January when the currency fell 46 percent has abated.
</P>
<P>
   Even moreso, Brazil's stock markets have surged. Interest rates
have been lowered to 34 percent. And the country's currency, the
real, has strengthened, regaining about 15 percent of its value in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute much of the economic turnaround to the new
president of Brazil's Central Bank, Arminio Fraga, a former fund
manager for Wall Street financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga brings enormous credibility to the table and a coherent
approach to addressing the fiscal deficit, and he's moved very
swiftly to deal with the country's problems,'' said Lawrence
Goodman, managing director of Global Economic Associates, a New
York-based economic advisory firm.
</P>
<P>
   He said inflation could fall to as lows as 10 percent by year's
end, and that interest rates could drop to lower than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is so upbeat about
Brazil's economy that in late March it approved the second
installment of a $41.5 billion rescue package, providing Brazil
with more much-needed reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government's next big priority is passing a fiscal
responsibility law that will be the linchpin of plans to get a
whopping public deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would permit the government to impose rigid limits
on all areas of spending, including on state governors and city
mayors, and establish stiff penalties and fines for those who
exceed their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the brighter picture in Brazil, economic turmoil has
yet to be averted in other parts of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador, for example, is an economic basket case.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government decided to float the currency earlier this
year, the sucre, it has fallen drastically.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year it's expected to lose 60 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the Andean nation's national debt of $16
billion is totally disproportionate to its annual budget of $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its troubles can be traced to El Nino, which caused $2.6
billion in flood damage last year, as well as to falling world
prices for oil, the country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador hopes to negotiate a deal with the IMF and other world
lenders that could provide the country with as much as $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking with authorities in Ecuador for quite some
time now,'' said the IMF's Francisco Baker, who refused to indicate
whether a deal was forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ecuador, other countries such as Argentina, Brazil's
major trading partner, have been dragged into recession by Brazil's
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of Argentina's exports go to Brazil. But these
exports are expected to fall by at least a third this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a recovery in the flow of capital to Argentina,
but we still believe Argentina will experience a recession this
year,'' said Felipe Frydman, economic minister at Argentina's
embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To stave off a deepening crisis, Argentina's President Carlos
Menem stunned U.S. officials by recently proposing that Argentina
abolish its national currency, the peso, and replace it with the
American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   That means salaries, car payments, store purchases, and other
financial transactions would be denominated in the American
greenback.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the currencies trade on a 1-to-1 parity, and many
financial transactions already are made with dollars instead of
pesos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has urged Argentina's government to
move cautiously, and only in consultation with U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the hobbling of economic growth in Argentina
and other countries, the dreaded economic meltdown has failed to
materialize in much of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, for example, has demonstrated a better-than-expected
ability to weather the crisis. About 75 percent of that country's
trade is with the United States so as long as the U.S. economy
shows growth, so will Mexico's.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But analysts warn against overall complacency.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that the worst part of the region's crisis may be
over, but that doesn't mean developing countries will be wildly
healthy any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank reported earlier this month that it expects
average growth rates in developing countries to fall to just 1.5
percent in 1999, the lowest growth rate since 1982, before
ratcheting back up in 2000 to 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's still below the average rate of 4.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Latin countries could suffer if the U.S. economy
stops being so robust, or if the high-flying U.S. stock market
finally stops defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a quick return to the heyday of the mid-1990s
is relatively slim,'' Goodman said. ``But things are sure better
than they were, and we are starting to see a recovery.''

ENQUIRING FEMALE MINDS ALREADY KNEW 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Shocking New Study Reveals Swimsuits Make Women Stupid'' read a
headline in a recent issue of the National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's something I've long suspected. Now it seems there's
scientific evidence to support the idea. Well, there's a study
anyway, published in the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   According to this account, student volunteers at the University
of Michigan and Duke University were falsely told they would be
testing consumer products. The students, 42 women and 40 men, were
sent one by one into a private dressing room and asked over
headphones to put on various articles of clothing. They were then
given a math test.
</P>
<P>
   Let's pause here for a moment to consider just how smart these
student volunteers were in the first place. They're enrolled at two
top universities, so they must be intelligent. But if someone asked
you to participate in a study of consumer products, then stuck you
in a room by yourself, told you to put on a swimsuit and then gave
you a math test, wouldn't you think something was a bit fishy?
</P>
<P>
   But I'm straying from the point, which is that when the test
results were in, the men's scores were consistent, no matter what
they were wearing. However, the women scored lower when they were
wearing swimsuits than when they were wearing other unspecified
items of clothing. At last, science offers proof that women should
not wear swimsuits when taking math tests.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers were also asked to complete the sentence, ``I am.
. .'' When the women were wearing other clothing they gave the same
sort of responses as the men, answers such as, ``I am smart,'' or
``I am a pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   When the men were wearing swimsuits, they completed the phrase
with words like ``foolish or embarrassed.'' The women filled in the
blank with words like ``disgusting,'' ``repulsive,'' and
``ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that ``idealized female body images in
our society can interrupt a woman's thinking.'' Said Dr. Barbara
Frederickson, ``The more a woman worries about how she looks, the
less mental energy she has for focusing on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies such as this give all of us hope that someday women may
feel merely ``foolish'' rather than ``ashamed'' when wearing
swimsuits while taking math tests, and that eventually they may
even score the same on math tests in swimsuits or out. I hope I
live to see it. Because the swimsuit-stupidity connection is
something I've struggled with all my life.
</P>
<P>
   Just last night I found myself studying the swimsuit section of
the latest Lands' End catalog, where a system of ``shape icons'' _
hourglass, inverted triangle, circle, triangle, rectangle _ is
employed to help shoppers choose suits appropiate to their body
type. I was staring at the chart, trying to decide if I'm a circle
or a triangle, or maybe both, when my mind went blank. At that
point, if somebody had asked me to add two and two, I couldn't have
done it. And I wasn't even wearing a swimsuit, just thinking about
wearing one.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if the researchers have considered looking into the
notion that women in swimsuits make men stupid. They'd need look no
further than this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit number.
Moralists annually complain about the photos in this issue. The
pictures are tame. It's the text that's offensive. Austin Murphy's
slobbering account of watching artists painting swimsuits on nude
models is stupid and prurient, but mostly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   You might think he'd never seen a naked woman before. Maybe he
hasn't. As a sportswriter he's probably more accustomed to being in
the company of naked men.

AMERICA'S WORST SERIAL KILLER CONVICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)

Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The words of Judge Jessica Cooper in sentencing Jack Kevorkian
to 10 to 25 years for killing Thomas Youk were chilling. As she
read them, America's worst serial killer visibly shuddered.
 &HT;    This man who had helped 130 people end their lives and
videotaped himself injecting poison into Youk, and got the snuff
film aired on ''60 Minutes,'' clearly did not expect to be found
guilty of murder, or to be sent to prison.
 &HT;    ''This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of
euthanasia. It was all about you, sir.'' said the judge. ''It was
about lawlessness. It was about disrespect for a society that
exists and flourishes because of the strength of the legal system.
 &HT;    ''No one, sir, is above the law. No one.
 &HT;    ''You were on bond to another judge when you committed this
offense. You were not licensed to practice medicine when you
committed this offense and you hadn't been licensed for eight
years. And you had the audacity to go on national television, show
the world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well,
sir, consider yourself stopped.''
 &HT;    In the corridor outside the courtroom, a cheer went up from a
group of folks in wheelchairs who call themselves, ''Not Dead
Yet.'' Some 40 members of the wheelchair movement bent on halting
euthanasia, traveled long distances to peacefully demonstrate
outside the courtroom each day.
 &HT;    ''If this had happened sooner, there are 130 people who would
still be alive,'' said Diane Coleman, Not Dead Yet's organizer, as
tears rolled down her face.
 &HT;    ''We are the potential victims. It is our lives at stake.''
 &HT;    The American Medical Association had such people in mind when it
commented, ''Patients in America can be relieved that the guilty
verdict against Jack Kervorkian helps protect them from those who
would take their lives prematurely.''
 &HT;    That, indeed, is the danger.
 &HT;    Half of the people Kervorkian helped kill were not terminally
ill and some had no physical illness or lack of autonomy. They were
lonely, depressed or felt under pressure to die from loved ones.
 &HT;    Consider the case of Judith Curren, a woman with chronic fatigue
syndrome who was addicted to painkillers and depressed. Only three
weeks before her death, she was allegedly beaten up by her husband.
That same man arranged for her to come to Kervorkian to die.
 &HT;    Rita Marker, executive director of the International
Anti-Euthanasia Task Force, who has led the national fight against
the movement Kervorkian has helped spark, sees his conviction and
imprisonment as a ''very appropriate end to his run of serial
killings and a disgusting sort of self-promotion.''
 &HT;    Her concern now is that two more states may follow Oregon's lead
in legalizing assisted suicide. Legislation that is a clone of
Oregon is on a fast track in California and Gov. Gray Davis
probably would not veto it.
 &HT;    In Alaska, there is a court case challenging the state's law
prohibiting assisted suicide on grounds that it violates the
state's constitutional ''right of privacy'' protection.
 &HT;    In its first year, the Oregon Health Division (OHD) reports that
23 patients received legal lethal prescriptions in 1998, of whom 15
actually took deadly drugs and died while six others died from
their illnesses and two others were still alive.
 &HT;    Rita Marker does not believe the numbers. ''We don't know what
is going on in Oregon. There are no penalties for not reporting. We
don't know how many did not report. All the circumstances were
provided by the very doctors who provided the lethal prescriptions.
How many people on a freeway would call in and tell us what speed
they were driving?''
 &HT;    Indeed, the OHD itself says, ''The entire account could be a
cock-and-bull story.''
 &HT;    A recent report in the Journal of Medical Ethics indicates that
Dutch physicians routinely ignore established euthanasia guidelines
created to protect patients against abuse. In 1995, 59 percent of
euthanasia cases were unreported, a clear violation of the law. And
20 percent of the thousands of patients killed by doctors were NOT
requested by patients!
 &HT;    Imagine that you are a patient lying in an Oregon hospital with
congestive heart failure. You are semi-conscious when you hear your
son talking to the doctor, ''Mom is suffering so much. Don't you
think we should put her out of her misery?'' You know your son is a
gambling addict, who has run up thousands of dollars of debt. If
you die, he inherits your estate. You try to speak and say, ''But I
don't want to die. I can recover.'' But your mouth is not moving.
 &HT;    You think, ''I wished I lived in California where doctors can't
kill patients.''
 &HT;    But for how long?

LEVEL THRESHOLD WILL BE TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I had a new threshold installed with a new storm door. Now,
the threshold looks level. Shouldn't it slant? As it is now, the
threshold stays wet when it rains and water leaks under the door.
</P>
<P>
   NELL RUSSO, Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It's funny _ no, not funny, but strange _ how manufacturers
come up with wonderful new windows, storm doors, and other things
to make the house livable and weathertight, but forget the
old-fashioned ways of keeping the weather outside, sometimes
thinking that the product is so good it doesn't need anything
extra. So they install a storm door on a level threshold. It has
happened with windows, too; the handyman got a call some time ago
from a homeowner who had a whole wall of fixed windows; they looked
great and let in a lot of light, but the outdoor sills were level.
Result: decay of those sills, and a dilemma for the homeowner with
his expensive wall of rotting windows.
</P>
<P>
   After this tirade, you can call up the installer and ask him to
do it right, with a sloping threshold, which will solve the
problem. Actualy, thresholds for exterior doors do not slope;
rather they are tapered on the outside, allowing water runoff.
Fixing it is a simple but labor-intensive project, but should be
done. A door needs a tapered threshold, period, just as a window
needs a sloping sill.
</P>
<P>
   A temporary fix is to install a door sweep at the bottom of the
storm door to try to keep water from leaking through. They don't
always work very well, so the tapered threshold is the only real
fix.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The glass doors on my fireplace insert have a gold-trimmed
border. Little black marks are developing on it. How can I remove
those black marks?
</P>
<P>
   RITA SMITH, Norfolk, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The black marks sound as if they are soot, or maybe smoke
stains. If so, use a little Soft Scrub to remove them. Apply the
Soft Scrub, let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe the marks with
a damp sponge. That border is brass or brass-plated steel that has
been lacquered, so you have to be careful about using an abrasive
on it. In fact, the black marks may be the result of some of the
lacquer peeling off and the brass underneath tarnishing. If that is
the case, to fix it, you would have to remove the lacquer and
repolish the brass.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it might be unlacquered brass, or brass
plate, that is tarnishing. Simply repolishing will help remove the
spots. A final thought: It might be an inexpensive door and the
brass or gold finishing is simply deteriorating. In that case,
nothing can be done except replacement with a higher-quality door.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A snowblower broke a part of my green vinyl siding. I
discovered that a replacement piece of the right color costs $35,
plus $10 shipping. That seems a little much. Or a lot much. I can
find a small replacement piece for much less, but it is the wrong
color. Can I paint the replacement part? If so, how?
</P>
<P>
   EMMA TROIANO, Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can paint it after installing it, and you should be
able to get a fair match. Sand it to roughen the finish and reduce
gloss, then apply two thin coats of a latex house paint. The more
you sand, the better the paint will stick. And, as with all
painting, staining, and varnishing, use thin coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I remove lichen from my asphalt-shingled roof? It
doesn't look so good and I am afraid the lichen will decay the
shingles.
</P>
<P>
   DESPERATE, in lichen country
</P>
<P>
   A. Lichen is a combination of a fungus and an alga, living
symbiotically (depending on each other for existence) and growing
on many surfaces. For some reason it is extremely difficult to
remove, either by chemical or physical means. It is resistant to
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   A reader suggested one way to remove it is by rubbing with
cotton gloves. I guess the abrasion somehow gets it off, but the
handyman tried it once on a piece of granite, and couldn't budge it
even with a putty knife and chisel.
</P>
<P>
   I don't suggest rubbing it off asphalt shingles because it would
damage the shingles.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sam Bordelon of Bloomington, Ind., wrote to suggest
this way to remove it. Make a solution of two tablespoons of copper
sulphate per gallon of water in a spray can. That is worth a try;
you can buy copper sulphate in a hardware or drug store or chemical
supply house. But be extremely careful; copper sulphate is highly
poisonous, toxic, and corrosive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Milton Landove of Weston, Mass. called to say, ``Why
get rid of it?'' Lichens are not necessarily bad, he said, and
there certainly is no need to get rid of trees around the house.
The trees may have nothing to do with the lichen anyway, and there
may be no harm done to the asphalt shingles over the shingles' 20-
to 40-year lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a gas stove in the kitchen of my apartment, which is
in a building that has hot-water heat. I also have a baby. Should I
install a carbon monoxide detector?
</P>
<P>
   RALPH EMMERITH, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Because the chimney of your hot-water heating system is far
away from your apartment, one would think that a CO detector is not
needed. But gas stoves do give off CO, and if the apartment is
tight and well insulated, it would be a good idea to install a
detector. They are not expensive and can give you peace of mind.
And since you asked the question, then by all means, install one.
</P>

AMERICA'S WORST SERIAL KILLER CONVICTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Religion Commentary)

Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The words of Judge Jessica Cooper in sentencing Jack Kevorkian
to 10 to 25 years for killing Thomas Youk were chilling. As she
read them, America's worst serial killer visibly shuddered.
 &HT;    This man who had helped 130 people end their lives and
videotaped himself injecting poison into Youk, and got the snuff
film aired on ''60 Minutes,'' clearly did not expect to be found
guilty of murder, or to be sent to prison.
 &HT;    ''This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of
euthanasia. It was all about you, sir.'' said the judge. ''It was
about lawlessness. It was about disrespect for a society that
exists and flourishes because of the strength of the legal system.
 &HT;    ''No one, sir, is above the law. No one.
 &HT;    ''You were on bond to another judge when you committed this
offense. You were not licensed to practice medicine when you
committed this offense and you hadn't been licensed for eight
years. And you had the audacity to go on national television, show
the world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you. Well,
sir, consider yourself stopped.''
 &HT;    In the corridor outside the courtroom, a cheer went up from a
group of folks in wheelchairs who call themselves, ''Not Dead
Yet.'' Some 40 members of the wheelchair movement bent on halting
euthanasia, traveled long distances to peacefully demonstrate
outside the courtroom each day.
 &HT;    ''If this had happened sooner, there are 130 people who would
still be alive,'' said Diane Coleman, Not Dead Yet's organizer, as
tears rolled down her face.
 &HT;    ''We are the potential victims. It is our lives at stake.''
 &HT;    The American Medical Association had such people in mind when it
commented, ''Patients in America can be relieved that the guilty
verdict against Jack Kervorkian helps protect them from those who
would take their lives prematurely.''
 &HT;    That, indeed, is the danger.
 &HT;    Half of the people Kervorkian helped kill were not terminally
ill and some had no physical illness or lack of autonomy. They were

GET THE RIGHT TOOLS _ OR THE RIGHT EXCUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN LUPO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I stood precariously on the stepladder and yelled at the
fluorescent lightbulbs that refused my vulgarity-laced entreaties
to be removed from the ceiling fixture, I recalled my father, Max.
</P>
<P>
   Dad could do a lot of things. He could dress like a movie actor.
He could pitch and hit a ball. He could box. He taught himself how
to play piano. He could tell good wisecracks. He could sell
clothing. He could write a beautiful letter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the talents, however, that Dad never mastered was that of
fixing things. He seemed to have absolutely no concept of how to
fix anything, be the broken part something in the house or in the
car. He generally handled broken stuff by swearing at it.
</P>
<P>
   I have inherited this talent, albeit with some caveats.
</P>
<P>
   First, I use some obscene remarks that even he, growing up as
the son of immigrants in the Roaring Twenties and the Depression,
never imagined using.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I never use the excuse he always employed when my
mother, Esther, used to complain, ``Other men are handy. Why aren't
you handy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the proper tools!'' he would yell.
</P>
<P>
   Her question was not particularly sensitive, and his answer was
a bit disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other'' men were handy? Which other men? What were their
names, and what had they fixed lately? There was one neighborhood
guy who seemed particularly handy, but he reportedly had a habit of
stealing stuff from the local hardware store to feed his handiness
habit. Dad never stole.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dad, indeed, he did not have the proper tools. This was
because he rarely, if ever, bought any tools. And that was because
he wouldn't have known what to do with them had he purchased same.
He managed to spend more than four-score years on the planet
without ever having a shot at the proper tools. It was not by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, own tools. I own hammers, screwdrivers, a
monkey wrench or two, some pliers, nails, a couple of saws, and
some other stuff with which you do stuff to stuff that gets broken.
</P>
<P>
   My wife would never suggest that other men can fix things, so
what's wrong with me? There are reasons for this.
</P>
<P>
   First, she is sensitive to the fragile male ego, which collapses
upon hearing such a remark.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she knows how to fix some things herself. She can grout,
for example. She has grouted our bathroom tile more than once. She
is one of the world's great grouters. I have told her occasionally,
``It's the reason we are still married. Where else would I find
such a grouter?''
</P>
<P>
   Third, I do know how to fix some stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes can stop a toilet from running on and on and on. I
can snake a drain with a wire clothes hanger and pour drain cleaner
into the hole without spreading the stuff all over the joint. I
have on two occasions helped people start their cars by creating a
vacuum where their air filter normally is. I think that's what it's
called. Anyway, I did it twice, whatever it's called.
</P>
<P>
   When the cable television makes funny sounds, I often can fix
it. Once, I tiled a floor. Twice, I have painted walls. I have
fixed a few loose doorknobs in my time, I might say. I do say, and
with pride do I say it. Finally, in an act not to be belittled, for
its absence would cause a darkness to be cast upon my world, I have
replaced many a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   But not those fluorescent bulbs. With these, I reverted to my
usual incompetence. My only consolation was that my wife couldn't
figure it out either. When someone who is smarter than you cannot
figure out what has befuddled you, it is amazing how good you feel.
</P>
<P>
   We consoled ourselves by blaming the manufacturer of the
fixture. I called our pal, Kenny the electrician. When he returns
from Disney World, he will come by and remove the bulbs and replace
them with the ones I bought. Yes, I do know how to buy stuff; I
just can't do much with it once I get it home. What worries me is
that Kenny will do it quickly. He will look down at me from the
stepladder and will explain how easy it is if only whatever.
</P>
<P>
   I'll shake my head and try to remember the whatever part when
next the bulbs go out. They seem to last a long time. So by then, I
can cite senility as the reason for my inability to remove them
from the fixture.
</P>
<P>
   Or, I might say, ``You know, I have the proper tools, but my
wife is using them to grout.''

ZENGA'S FOCUS ON DEFENSE IS PAYING OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Revolution are proving they can prevent the
opposition from scoring at will. In nine games in two seasons under
Walter Zenga's direction, they have surrendered nine goals,
including three in three matches this season.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has placed his stamp on the team, converting the stopping
of goals into nearly as inspiring a feat as scoring them.
</P>
<P>
   Strong defense will be necessary when the Revolution play host
to the Columbus Crew Friday, then visit D.C. United April 24. But
sometime soon, the Revolution's offense will have to exhibit
similar personality and resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Against D.C. United, individual improvisation produced the
Revolution goals as they played to a 2-2 tie in regulation time
before losing in the postmatch shootout. Jair sliced through the
midfield and was fouled from behind, leading to Joe-Max Moore's
free kick goal. Edwin Gorter then set up Johnny Torres for the
tying score late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Such moments have been rare for the Revolution, partly because
Gorter has played only 21 minutes after missing the first two games
because of a suspension. Gorter expected to start against D.C.
United but did not enter the match until the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the choice of the coach, and if he doesn't think I am 100
percent ready, I have to work to get myself to 100 percent ready,''
Gorter said. ``The only thing I can do is train hard and do my
best. I hope I can bring something to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorter scored twice in the Revolution's 3-1 victory over the
Boston Bulldogs in a 60-minute scrimmage at Babson College in
Wellesley Wednesday. He placed a 20-yard drive into the far corner
seconds into the second half, and after Torres headed in a Ted
Chronopoulos corner, converted a free kick off the inside of the
post.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution, using a Dan Calichman-Manny Motajo central
defensive combination, fell behind on a third-minute goal by Carlos
Rocha, the striker who was waived by the Revolution two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team needs time,'' Gorter said. ``We don't give away a lot
of chances, and that is a good sign. If we score one or two goals,
we will probably be in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to sit on the bench. But this team is going to
have competition, and sometimes the starters will sit on the bench.
That is a good sign, also, because it means there is competition.
In Europe, the good teams have a big bench.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trial run continues
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Galderisi's trial run as Revolution assistant coach
will continue through Saturday's game, according to general manager
Brian O'Donovan. Galderisi was on the bench for the D.C. United
game and did most of the coaching Wednesday. ``It's a lifestyle
decision for Beppe,'' O'Donovan said. ``His choice can be compared
to either going to grad school or forgoing it to pursue practical
experience.'' Galderisi is scheduled to participate in a coaching
licensing course in Florence in June, which would make him eligible
to coach in Italy. Sid Mazzola will remain an assistant, with
mostly scouting duties . . . A second crowd of more than 18,000 is
expected for the Columbus game, according to O'Donovan . . . John
Harkes (right knee sprain) hopes to return for the April 24 visit
to D.C. United.

QUIGLEY THE SURPRISE OF THE SENIOR CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ The man with the camera had one more
photo left and didn't want to waste it on just anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that the club pros aren't any good,'' said the man as he
inspected the candidates on the putting green. Evan ``Big Cat''
Williams was there, a guy who won all those long drive contests. So
was John Bland, a five-time winner on the Senior PGA Tour. The man
with the camera wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that guy? Is he somebody?'' asked the man. He was told
it was Dana Quigley and he immediately put the camera to his eye,
studied his target, and pushed the button. Mission accomplished, so
the man with the camera walked away with a smile. ``I lucked out,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Joe Carr stood to the side, making a few practice
strokes, occasionally looking up to see if any old friends had
entered onto the putting green. ``I knew he would do well out
here,'' said Carr of Quigley, who went from New England PGA
dominance to Senior PGA Tour surprise. ``But I never imagined he
would do this well.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could have? Least of all Quigley, who is seriously talked
about as a contender to win the 60th PGA Seniors' Championship at
PGA National's Champion Course. ``I still can't believe it,'' said
Quigley. ``And every day keeps getting better. Life is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that great. He is wearing Tommy Hilfinger clothes these
days, smoking good cigars (giving plenty of them out, too),
acknowledging the best wishes of spectators, and accepting
accolades from colleagues for his fine play. That's what three wins
and a million-dollar season can do for you. Indeed, Quigley has
arrived, though he doesn't miss a chance to pinch himself to make
sure it's all real.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Carr may have thought about such a life.
He is 60 now, but 36 years ago he took his golf game to the highest
level. You have to ignore everything you know about the PGA Tour to
understand that the 1960s did not offer a road paved with riches
for touring professionals. Travel was mostly by car, equipment
contracts a futuristic idea, televised events rare, purses small,
and to survive you had to win, or finish high every week. Not a
great life, but ``they were wild times, lots of fun,'' said Carr.
</P>
<P>
   His traveling mate in those days was Tom Shaw. ``A friend from
Oregon introduced us and I don't know why, but we hit it off. We
hung around for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Shaw won three times -- including the AVCO Golf Classic
at Pleasant Valley in Sutton, Mass. -- to pour the foundation for a
touring career that is still going strong as he approaches his 61st
birthday. Carr, however, called it quits and headed home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember exactly why he left,'' said Shaw. ``He got a
good job, I guess, more security, and he could play in the winter.
But he was good, a very good player. He almost won and put himself
in position to win a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr settled into the club pro life, became one of New England's
better players, qualified for some PGA Championships and US Opens,
but never really pushed the idea of joining the Senior Tour when he
turned 50 in 1989. He is part owner and head pro at Bedrock GC in
Rutland, Mass., a nine-hole facility that he helped build, content
in his life and happy with the winter months in Florida he spends
playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   There are cherished trips overseas every summer to take part in
some European Senior Tour events and Carr is making his sixth
appearance in the PGA Seniors' Championship. Bellbottoms were the
rage when Carr won something called the Bob Hope of Tomorrow (1969)
but pleated pants and cotton shirts had taken over by the time he
was posting a 28th-place finish in the US Senior Open at Canterbury
(1996). Which is to say he has been playing fashionable golf for a
long time. There have been great opportunities and plenty that he
has seen, perhaps the most amazing of which is the success of
Quigley, against whom he competed for years at the NEPGA level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing, isn't it?'' said Carr when someone mentioned that
Quigley had bought a house right on the course at Bear Lakes CC in
West Palm Beach. ``But great for him. It's great to see him do
well.''

AZUMAH CAN'T BE OVERLOOKED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Walter Payton award winner text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Bertha Azumah was six months pregnant in 1977
when a most unfortunate thing happened. She contracted chicken pox.
Doctors feared the worst, that the disease might render her unborn
child blind, physically or mentally defected, or that she might
even miscarry. They suggested an induced labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared at the time, but I told them I couldn't do
that,'' said Azumah, who now lives in Worcester and at the time had
recently moved with her husband, Theophilus, from Ghana to Oklahoma
City. ``I decided to simply pray for a healthy baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone beyond the clouds heeded her intercessions. The child, a
boy they named Jerry, was born not only healthy, but blessed with
extraordinary physical skills, skills that have made him a likely
choice in Saturday's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   His Pop Warner football coaches in Oklahoma City saw it early.
They began running offensive plays consisting primarily of reverses
_ singles, doubles, triples, and delays _ with 5-year-old Jerry
Azumah the final recipient of the ball. It seemed he scored every
time he touched it.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Worcester, he played for St. Peter-Marian High
but bided his time behind other talented players. He didn't play
varsity until his junior year and didn't start until his senior
season. You know what they say about a lighted candle under a
bushel: As a senior, Azumah shined, rushing for 1,800 yards and
scoring 31 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire football coach Bill Bowes, who lured Azumah to his
program, wasted no time in utilizing his skills. Yet the kid who
had been overlooked by local and national recruiters figured he
again would bide his time, particularly since UNH already had a few
veteran backs and a couple of freshmen who were more highly
regarded than Azumah.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while the true freshman was standing on the sideline
during the Wildcats' 1995 season opener against Connecticut, Bowes
called his number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does someone need some water?'' Azumah asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the coaches responded. ``We need you.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first collegiate play, he was leveled almost as soon as
he took the handoff. On the second, he scampered for 19 yards. On
the third, he scored on a 14-yard run. Three weeks later, he rushed
for a UNH-record 278 yards against Lehigh.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way to a career that ended with him winning the
Walter Payton Award as the top offensive player in Division 1-AA
and setting 1-AA career marks in rushing yards (6,193), all-purpose
yards (8,376), and points (424). As a senior, Azumah also surpassed
his single-game rushing mark with 329 yards against Hofstra. He is
the only player in 1-AA history to rush for 1,000 yards in four
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, 21 years after she prayed for merely a healthy
child, Bertha Azumah is constantly fielding questions as to where
her son will be chosen Saturday. He has been projected to go
anywhere from the second to the seventh round.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Azumah says she again is merely hoping for good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for some NFL scouts to be impressed with Azumah,
a 5-foot-10-inch, 195-pound back whose detractors dismissed him
because he played for a 1-AA school. Then he held a coming-out
party at the national scouting combine in Indianapolis Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Working out alongside draft hopefuls such as Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams of Texas, West Virginia star Amos Zereoue,
and Boston College's Mike Cloud, Azumah set a record for running
backs in the vertical leap (43 1/2 inches) and was the top running
back this year in the 10-yard dash (1.5 seconds), broad jump (11
feet), and a 20-yard dart-and-cutting drill called the shuttle
drill (3.86 seconds).
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the combine, Azumah had never jumped higher than 41
inches, which is impressive in itself. ``I think I looked up there
and saw an NFL contract,'' he said, ``and I just leaped up and
grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with my vertical and 10-yard dash being on top,
that opened up the eyes of a lot of scouts that say, `DB,' ''
Azumah said, referring to the many NFL types who figure he would be
better suited as a defensive back. ``I've been getting that lately.
I guess those things say `DB' all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Patriots vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier
said Wednesday if the team were to draft Azumah it would initially
try him in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought him here and worked him as a halfback,'' said
Grier. ``The kid has unusual quickness. The coach up there (Bowes)
tells you that you ought to try the guy as a DB. Some clubs have
worked him out as a DB.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had him here, I think the first thing Pete (Carroll,
Patriots coach) said was with the quickness on this guy it favors
him being at defensive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier did mention that Azumah had an exceptional career at
running back. And he's hard to pass up for any team in need of a
back who is durable. Azumah finished his collegiate career by
starting in 36 consecutive games, including each game in the last
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He also fared well at the Hula Bowl, accounting for 71
all-purpose yards, including 22 rushing yards on three carries. On
his first carry, he gained 12 yards off left tackle on third and 2
from the opposition's 38-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the same ability he had as a freshman, but now he's
bigger,'' said Bowes. ``He came in with extraordinary athletic
ability, great cutting ability, great intensity when he ran. And he
worked as hard in practice as he did in games.''
</P>
<P>
   Azumah said he doesn't know what to expect Saturday. He said
many of the scouts wished him well after sessions ``then I pick up
the paper the next day to see if I had a good workout or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times when I go in the Internet, it says RB
(running back) could possibly be a cornerback,'' said Azumah. ``All
I've been doing in college is running the ball. I feel that the
more things I can do, the better the opportunities I'll have and it
won't hurt me. It will probably just increase my stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be offended or hurt if they said they wanted to
draft me as an athlete, because if the team that drafts me wants me
to be an athlete, they see something I possess, something that will
possibly make a team better and that's what it's all about.''

MARTINEZ BROTHERS FINDING COMFORT ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The bond between brothers Pedro and Ramon Martinez has
always been strong. Now that both are wearing Red Sox uniforms, it
may get even stonger.
</P>
<P>
   It should seem that way when Pedro Martinez makes his 1999
Fenway Park debut Thursday against the Chicago White Sox. Older
brother Ramon is working to rehabilitate his right shoulder after
having surgery last June. But he'll watch Pedro pitch as a teammate
for the first time since 1993, when both were with the Los Angeles
Dodgers. It is a dream come true for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have everything I need,'' said Pedro, off to a 2-0 start.
``I have my best friend around me, and another close one in Jose
Offerman. I hope they feel comfortable like I do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to play with Ramon again. I almost asked for a
trade to LA one year when I was with Montreal. I knew he wasn't
going to leave LA. Now that I have the chance I feel very lucky. I
hope he can stay here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Red Sox signed Ramon Martinez last March 31 there
has been anticipation of the day when the brothers both would pitch
in a series at Fenway Park. It might happen in a few months. It
might take longer. Neither seems worried.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 with the Dodgers, Ramon was a starter _ and a great one.
Pedro worked as a short reliever, appearing in 65 games. In the
offseason, Pedro was traded to Montreal where he flourished as a
starter. In 1997, he won the National League Cy Young Award. That
offseason, he was traded to Boston, where he almost won another one
last year. The brothers talked almost daily by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of their conversations concerned Ramon and his torn
labrum, which cut short his 1998 season. After the Dodgers released
Ramon last November, the Red Sox showed interest and eventually
signed him to a $2 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to be around him,'' said Ramon. ``Now I can be
there for both the good times and the tough times. He should be
better. He will have a better idea about the hitters and the
league. It's different in your first year. You have to make so many
adjustments for different hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pedro: ``I think it will be a lot more fun this year, just
having somebody to go to eat with and talk with on a daily basis. I
feel positive about this team. We have everything to go where we
went last year, and even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Pedro himself do better, improving on a 19-7 record and 2.89
earned run average?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hard to say,'' offered Sox manager Jimy Williams. ``I
know he feels more relaxed with his brother around. But you don't
ever want to get too comfortable. This game will humble you real
quick. The one thing I like about him is that he really competes
out there, with every hitter and every pitch to the best of his
ability. Yes, he's got good stuff. But the important thing is that
he knows how to use it, changing speeds and throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was sharp in spring training, going 3-1 in six starts
with a 2.16 ERA. He struck out 32 batters, tops for American League
pitchers. On Opening Day in Kansas City, Martinez went six innings
and beat the Royals, 5-3. Five days later, he went seven innings in
a 5-3 victory at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``In regard to his pitching, Pedro is just about where he was
last year,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``When you have
three outstanding pitches like he does, you don't mess with
success. He has a chance to be better this year because he knows
the league and he'll be able to study the hitters more. He has a
whole year under his belt of 15 to 20 at-bats against the hitters
that he faced last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as important, he's been through the Boston ropes. That's
a big thing. He's more relaxed around the people here, around the
players here. I think it helps to have Ramon here. I can't speak
for Pedro. But everybody would like to have their older brother tag
along. ''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro hopes Ramon and the rest of his teammates will tag along
all the way to return trip to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of experience,'' Pedro said. ``If we can stay
healthy, we can do anything. We have one of the best bullpens in
the league right now. I wouldn't be surprised. I think we're really
solid right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Big Brother, Ramon threw 38 pitches on the side Tuesday
and will throw 40-45 more Saturday. If all goes well over the next
two weeks, he will begin to throw batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope that when Ramon is ready to come back or feels
that he is 100 percent that our team will be even stronger,'' said
Pedro. ``Then we'll be able to intimidate teams. If not with the
bat, we'll do it with the pitching.''

also more than expected. It, too, was aided by strong North

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Serb government is happy to publicize these
atrocities _ just as NATO is ready and willing to report every
atrocity committed by Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's new ground rules are playing into Serbian hands. For
it is becoming ever clearer that somewhere _ in Washington,
perhaps, or Brussels or the Aviano air base in Italy _ someone has
decided that Serb civilians must suffer for their country's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Or that their lives can now be regarded as forfeit if they live
near a barracks or an airfield or happen to be travelling on a
passenger train.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb authorities _ who denied the stories told by thousands
of Albanian refugees of ``ethnic cleansing'' at the hands of Serb
forces _ were quite specific in their description of the slaughter
of as many as 75 Albanian refugees by NATO aircraft Wednesday,
first near the village of Medjan, at 1:30 in the afternoon, then at
Bistrazin at 3:0 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Albanians were travelling in cars and tractors,
``escorted'' by at least three Serb policemen. The three cops were
also killed.
</P>
<P>
   Did NATO believe these were Serbs driving down the roads of
southern Kosovo? Or did they see military traffic and decide _ as
they did when they bombed a barracks 50 meters (165 feet) from a
Belgrade hospital on Tuesday _ that the risk of harming civilians
was worth taking anyway? For that now seems to be NATO's policy in
its bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark _ the general who thought he could fight a war
without ground troops _ gave a deeply unsettling performance when
he tried to explain the train massacre this week.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot only saw the train enter his bomb frame at the last
second, he said. But then _ incredibly, knowing the train was there
_ he returned to fire two more missiles at the railway bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even to attack a railway bridge _ in daylight _ when NATO knew
that it carried scheduled passenger services, begs a thousand moral
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded passengers from the train have all described how the
NATO jet hovered in the air for several seconds before making its
second bombing run on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Was it an RAF Harrier? The Yugoslav military believe a British
aircraft bombed Aleksinac. A ``technical malfunction,'' NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ after the Serbs have repeatedly claimed (in an attempt
to cover up their own war crimes) that Albanians are in fear of
NATO bombs, NATO kills dozens of them in an air raid.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's no doubt that the greatest victims of this
catastrophe are the dispossessed Kosovo Albanians. And there are
war criminals among the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger
of looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

`STAR WARS' CROWNS A CENTURY OF SPACE OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trims)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB STEPHENS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ George Lucas' ``The Phantom Menace,'' the first
of a three-part prequel to his ``Star Wars Trilogy,'' opens next
month, provoking considerations of his 22-year-old classic's place
in the history of science fiction movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' works clearly belong to a crucial subgenre of sci-fi
filmmaking, the outer space movie _ a drama that occurs on other
worlds. Because of the use of extraterrestrial locations, exotic
landscapes that must be built from scratch, outer space films are
more expensive to make than invasion-of-Earth movies and are,
consequently, less common. But there are several movies that, like
``Star Wars,'' exemplify changing visions of mankind's place in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first, Georges Melies' ``A Trip to the Moon'' (1902),
was created at the dawn of cinema, and it explores the magical
possibilities of film _ celluloid tricks _ right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Trip to the Moon'' presents a visit to the lunar frontier as
though it were part of a celestial circus.
</P>
<P>
   In the Melies film, a small group of astronomers rides a large,
capacious bullet to our neighboring world. The cannon that propels
the ``rocket'' is reminiscent of those that catapult circus
performers across the ring, under the Big Top. The astronomers
encounter ``Selenites'' who are like contortionists and acrobats.
(Whenever one of the aliens is picked up and thrown to the ground
by an Earthman, he disappears in an illusionist's puff of smoke.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, passing comets are dazzling pinwheels, like part of a
fireworks exhibition, and a goddess sits on a crescent moon with
the jaunty air of a girl relaxing on the bar of a flying trapeze.
</P>
<P>
   Several actresses also stick their faces through holes in stars
as if they were poking their heads through openings in a canvas
sideshow prop.
</P>
<P>
   By 1929, when Fritz Lang made ``Woman in the Moon,'' the world
was deeper into the industrial era, and practical matters assumed a
greater role in fictional concepts of space flight. Therefore,
``Woman in the Moon'' deals with the possibilities of mining the
moon for minerals, particularly gold. This utilitarian idea,
however, could not sustain audience interest alone, so
entertaining, pulp-like adventure elements were added.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``Woman in the Moon'' has tremendous documentary
power, especially in shots of the spaceship's great arching
lift-off and views of the moon's astonishing surface. The movie is
also known for the invention of the countdown, a device for
building suspense in anticipation of the take-off as much as a
synchronization of activities for efficiency's sake.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, two significant films with entirely different aims were
released: Frederick Stephani's serial ``Flash Gordon'' and William
Cameron Menzies' ``Things to Come,'' with a screenplay by H.G.
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flash Gordon'' is set in the future of comic book imaginings
and deals with the conflicts of societies that are essentially
medieval.
</P>
<P>
   The simplified ethical heroism of ``Flash Gordon'' appealed to
Lucas as a boy, and he later discovered an adult rationale for such
concerns in Joseph Campbell's books on mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Menzies' ``Things to Come,'' an epic about a seemingly
interminable war, offers technology and technocracy as the
salvation of civilization. At its conclusion, the film is poised on
the verge of a flight to the moon, and its uniqueness resides in a
progressive insistence that such a voyage is merely the first step
in defining mankind's ultimate purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The towering metropolis of ``Things to Come'' is a likely
precursor to the monumental architecture of Lucas' Cloud City in
``The Empire Strikes Back,'' and its unashamed celebration of man's
yearning toward the empyrean is surely a part of the ``Star Wars''
spirit.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At midcentury, the golden age of science fiction filmmaking was
launched by ``Destination Moon,'' a movie that combines the
imaginative hopes of its producer George Pal, writer Robert
Heinlein and America's incomparable space artist Chesley Bonestell.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Destination Moon,'' the journey of the spaceship Luna is
made necessary by the exigencies of the Cold War. America must
travel into space for reasons of military strategy: Whoever
controls the moon, as one of the astronauts says, controls the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destination Moon'' is unique in forecasting the expansion of
the American empire into space through free enterprise, rather than
the efforts of government. The movie's spaceship, a sleek variation
on the V-2 rocket of World War II, provided the basic design of
science fiction cinema's interplanetary craft for 18 years, until
``2001: A Space Odyssey'' came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Worlds Collide'' (1951), another George Pal-Chesley
Bonestell collaboration, is an apocalyptic, biblical vision of
man's future. A huge star named Bellus and its companion planet
Zyra destroy the Earth as they traverse the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   But a nuclear-powered Noah's ark allows a small group of people
to escape the end of the world and land in the coincidentally
compatible biosphere of Zyra. It's a place that looks suspiciously
like Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, lavish spectacles on the scale of the latter-day
``Star Wars'' appeared, Joseph Newman's ``This Island Earth''
(1955) and Fred McLeod Wilcox's ``Forbidden Planet'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   ``This Island Earth'' begins as a scientific detective story
about two researchers who try to decipher the nature of a device
they inherited from representatives of the planet Metaluna. But
halfway through, the movie changes direction and becomes a space
opera that focuses on interplanetary conflict, surveying a
territory that ``Star Wars'' would occupy more than two decades
later.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lucas' film, ``This Island Earth'' is loaded with wonders.
We see a world devastated by remote-controlled meteors, an
underground city that looks as if it were painted by the surrealist
Yves Tanguy, an anthropoid insect, the Metaluna mutant _ one of the
last memorable monsters from Universal Studios _ and the fiery
crash of a flying saucer in a cobalt blue sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Island Earth'' is one of the few science fiction movies
that approaches tragedy. In the end, the Metalunan in charge of the
Earth expedition sacrifices himself to save a man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Planet'' is one of the rare 1950s science fiction
movies that has a literary basis. Roughly based on Shakespeare's
``The Tempest,'' the film is about a man who unwittingly murders
people around him by means of inadvertent wishes formed in his
subconscious mind.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist is a stand-in for Prospero, his robot, Robby, is
the magical Ariel and a monster from the id is Caliban. The
Prospero figure has inherited the knowledge and powers of a lost
race, the Krell, and he's destroyed by the same tragic flaw that
ended their reign, intellectual pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Planet'' makes the astute observation that the real
enemy will not be a bug-eyed monster when we travel among the
stars, that we should fear, instead, the projection of our own
secret desires.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' is a departure from
``Destination Moon's'' optimistic, can-do attitude in its pessimism
about the potential success or worth of any human endeavor. In
fact, Kubrick's film places man in a cosmos dominated by immense,
irrational forces that are incomprehensible to us. Fittingly, his
scary vision surfaced at a time when America's social institutions
were crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the ``Star Wars Trilogy'' _ soon to be a quartet and
growing _ fit in this grand tradition? For one thing, it was not
exclusively influenced by science fiction movies. In the staging of
its battles, ``Star Wars'' is a genre-loving series that borrows
from Westerns, World War II films and chivalric dramas.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an automaton-adoring work, making use of robots with
personalities as distinctive as those of the cheerful Robby in
``Forbidden Planet'' and the more menacing Gort of ``The Day the
Earth Stood Still'' (1951).
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all, the trilogy is as much of a family
film as Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Godfather,'' even though its
members stray farther from home than from New York to Vegas. This
mythological study of the father-son relationship, with its faith
in filial redemption, has seized our attention and held it.

they did when they bombed a barracks 50 meters (165 feet) from a
Belgrade hospital on Tuesday _ that the risk of harming civilians
was worth taking anyway? For that now seems to be NATO's policy in
its bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Clark _ the general who thought he could fight a war
without ground troops _ gave a deeply unsettling performance when
he tried to explain the train massacre this week.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot only saw the train enter his bomb frame at the last
second, he said. But then _ incredibly, knowing the train was there
_ he returned to fire two more missiles at the railway bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even to attack a railway bridge _ in daylight _ when NATO knew
that it carried scheduled passenger services, begs a thousand moral
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded passengers from the train have all described how the
NATO jet hovered in the air for several seconds before making its
second bombing run on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Was it an RAF Harrier? The Yugoslav military believe a British
aircraft bombed Aleksinac. A ``technical malfunction,'' NATO said.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ after the Serbs have repeatedly claimed (in an attempt
to cover up their own war crimes) that Albanians are in fear of
NATO bombs, NATO kills dozens of them in an air raid.
</P>
<P>
   No, there's no doubt that the greatest victims of this
catastrophe are the dispossessed Kosovo Albanians. And there are
war criminals among the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger
of looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

LEGENDARY GUITARIST DIDN'T WANT TO BE FORGOTTEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics in graf starting with ``Beck's instrumental
sound has changed dramatically ...'')  
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the '60s, Jeff Beck, the guitar hero's guitar
hero, gave Jimi Hendrix a run for his money. In the '70s, he
jazz-rocked with the best of 'em and in the '80s did cameos on some
of the decade's top albums. Then he simply vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man Eric Clapton called ``the best guitarist around''
is back with ``Who Else!'' (Epic), his first album of originals
since the Grammy-winning ``Guitar Shop'' in 1989. So, where have
you been, Mr. Beck?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to do something now,'' Beck says. ``It's been
frustrating to have done so much and then sort of get passed by.
But it's always been difficult for me _ I'm basically an
instrumentalist who doesn't sing _ to put albums together and keep
a band on the road. That's why there's been so many career moves.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least. Beck is almost as well-known for his mercurial
moods and ever-changing band members as he is for spectacular
fretwork. A contemporary of Clapton and Jimmy Page and generally
considered better than both, Beck's restless creative spirit won't
allow him to trade on past glories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cutting a blues album or a pale imitation of ``Blow
by Blow,'' the George Martin-produced jazz-fusion classic that went
to No. 4 in the albums chart in 1975 and sold a million copies,
Beck appropriates the rhythmic energy of electronic music forms
such as techno and jungle while also exploring the intriguing
modalities of Arabic and Irish music on ``Who Else!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those rare musicians that keeps growing, that gets
more creative and imaginative all the time, that keeps changing,''
said Annette Carson, author of ``Crazy Fingers,'' a self-published
biography of Beck. ``And I think that's hurt him in the marketplace
today because you really have to keep up with what he's doing to
appreciate him. It seems today's music fans like to get their
entertainment in easily digested packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's fast-paced rhythms are a perfect setting for the
six-string intensity of a guitarist who first went public replacing
Clapton and preceding boyhood pal Page in the Yardbirds. Afterward,
he formed the first Jeff Beck Group with singer Rod Stewart and
future Rolling Stone Ron Wood. The group's ``Truth'' album is
generally considered the blueprint for hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That record was done with genuine love,'' Beck, 54, says from
London. ``We'd gotten polished on the road to the point where we
just set up some microphones and played. We just chose the best
guitar solos and vocals, and it was in the box _ finished. Most of
the records we love from the '50s were done the same way. There was
an event, an exciting event that took place and that was captured.
It wasn't a feet-up-on-the-couch thing. Today, it's listening to a
click track for three hours. Recording has become a horrible
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck appears Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a new
band that includes virtuoso guitarist Jennifer Batten, who spent 10
years on the road with Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years of playing `Billy Jean,' it's just awesome to
stretch and grow,'' Batten said from her Fillmore home. ``I'm
playing guitar synth with Jeff, and there's a lot of room for
improvisation. It's a whole new world of sound. And I'm trying to
get him to bring back some older stuff, even as far back as the
Yardbirds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's missteps are almost as well-known as the things he's done
right.
</P>
<P>
   He admits breaking up the first Beck group just days before
playing Woodstock (``It was one of the worst things I've ever
done.''); going to Detroit to record at Motown (``My drummer moves
the drums out of the studio and puts his in. This engineer comes up
and says, `You guys came for the Motown sound, right? Well, it just
went out the door.' &UR;  &LR; ''); the ill-fated '70s power trio Beck,
Bogert and Appice (``Completely out of control''); and making one
of the worst albums of the '80s, ``Flash,'' produced with an
apparent complete lack of interest by Chic's Nile Rodgers (``I had
nothing to do with it!'').
</P>
<P>
   But there's also been some fine session work from Beck on '80s
albums by the likes of Tina Turner, Mick Jagger, Roger Waters and
Buddy Guy.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the '90s, though, Beck has been relatively quiet,
except for ``Crazy Legs,'' a lovingly detailed tribute to
rockabilly guitarist Cliff Gallup of Gene Vincent's original
Bluecaps, and a soundtrack for the TV movie ``Frankie's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck _ who has spent much of the past 15 years building '50s hot
rods at his 420-year-old manor house in Sussex, England, but tools
around the city in a '96 Corvette _ concedes the millennium's
approach put a scare into him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who think I'm from the '60s, but I
don't go out there and play Yardbirds songs, and I've certainly
never done a reunion tour of some sort,'' he said. ``I've kept
moving on this whole time. And it's cost me dearly. I don't think
I've ever been less popular than I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   El Becko's longtime fans, at least, are rabid. Reports from the
road say his ``Who Else!'' gigs are bringing down the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that fond of touring _ and that's another thing that
hasn't helped me,'' Beck said. ``I know it's weird, but I get
scared at the openness of America. It frightens the hell out of me.
Something hit me in the '60s when we'd been going across the Texas
plains for 20 hours and not seeing a tree. I mean, I love the
thought that all that space is there, but I don't want to actually
be in the middle of it. For me, the road is three months' luxury
imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's instrumental sound has changed dramatically over the past
decade. Inspired by the ethereal sound of the Bulgarian Choir _ the
Mystery Voices ITALICS START(Mystere des Voix Bulgares)END ITALICS,
Beck has fashioned a distinctive sound, based on harmonics, which
he shapes into long whistling passages by manipulating the whammy
bar on his signature Stratocaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the Bulgarian Choir, it took me by
surprise,'' the guitarist recalls. ``I was in tears inside for
weeks because of their quality and precision. The scales they sing
are almost unplayable. It hit me almost as hard as when I first
heard Elvis Presley and Little Richard in the emotional sense. In
some places, I'm playing sounds that some people don't even
recognize as coming from a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another thing I need at the moment _ playing music that
doesn't sound like it comes from a guitar!''

<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with.
</P>
<P>
   Convince the public the cause is just, liken the enemy to
Hitler, sanitize every nastiness perpetrated by your side, and
claim you are firmly on the way to victory _ these are the rules of
the game. Both sides have been faithfully playing them. Until the
train on the bridge at Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   The affair could have been a PR disaster, proof of how the
allies _ in their frustration at their failure to land a knockout
blow to the Milosevic military machine _ were sinking to terror
bombing of helpless civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Prevarication, or pretending the train was a legitimate military
target, would have made matters even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we witnessed a rare and deliberate show of honesty. It
was an ``unfortunate accident...we are all very sorry for it,''
Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander said as the press was shown
a full cockpit video of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, it transpired, had fired not one bomb, but two; the
second after he knew he had hit a train.
</P>
<P>
   Quite why that second attack happened is unclear. But we
basically know what happened, and few more questions need to be
asked. Had Richard Nixon followed a similar course in Watergate,
history might have been rather different.
</P>
<P>
   Now that allied planes have claimed culpability for the deadly
hit on the refugee convoy near Djakovica, we must brace for a far
more harrowing mea culpa from NATO _ and conceivably a sea change
in public attitudes to the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, Belgrade's forays into the propaganda war have been
more comic than threatening: ``88 NATO men dead and 32 planes
lost,'' ran a front-page headline last week in the Greek daily,
Athinaiki, gleefully reported by the official Yugoslav news agency,
Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
   News indeed to warm Serb hearts, but somewhat at variance with
the one verified loss of an F-117. &QL;

<P>
   Indeed two mysteries of this strangest of wars are the tiny
scale of NATO losses (one aircraft and, as far as can be
ascertained, not a single human life, astonishing given the advance
publicity about Serb air defense capabilities) and the small
civilian death toll in Serbia directly caused by the bombing _
until Wednesday at least, under 100. Had there been more, we would
most certainly have known.
</P>
<P>
   Then there have been the tales put out by the Serbian
Information Ministry of ``columns'' of deserters from the NATO
force stationed in Yugoslavia, donning civilian clothes and
streaming into Greece and Bulgaria, and of conscience-stricken
Norwegian pilots who refused to take part in the air attack, and
returned home to the cheers of their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   For those who dare criticize, there is the fate of Slavko
Curuvija, the anti-Milosevic independent newspaper owner shot dead
outside his Belgrade apartment on Sunday. &QL;

   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

<P>
   NATO of course propagates its own brand of wishful thinking.
Early on, we were told of Kosovo Albanian leaders who had been
murdered. It transpired they had not, and NATO, admittedly
retracted the claim.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, its spokesmen were claiming to detect fissures in the
Yugoslav army's high command over President Slobodan Milosevic's
policy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, despite every sign that the war is solidifying
support for Milosevic, British Defense Secretary George Robertson
was virtually predicting a coup. If only...
</P>
<P>
   But these are small errors, set against the giant shadow cast
over everything the allies say by the miscalculation with which the
war started. A few days, they assured, no ground troops and just a
handful of judiciously aimed Cruise missiles, before the evil
dictator came to his senses.
</P>
<P>
   The music has now changed. ``We always knew this would be a long
haul,'' NATO now insists. If so, then everything it implied, if not
said out loud, before March 24 was nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ever so. Did not World War I begin with the blithe
conviction the boys would be home for Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Western public opinion doubts about the air war
strategy have been submerged by the flood of horror stories of
pillage, rape and murder committed by the Serbs against ethnic
Albanians. But these stories too could in their turn be submerged
by the horror of what apparently happened near the southern Kosovo
town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the refugees were being used as human shields is almost
irrelevant. For the Serbs the carnage was a propaganda coup: a
``crime against humanity'' according to the Foreign Ministry in
Belgrade _ exactly the language used by NATO leaders to describe
Milosevic's tactics in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack strikes at the heart of the weakness of NATO's
presentation of the war _ not lies over daily events, but the fog
of confusion and contradictions surrounding the war's ends.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Kosovo is acquiring the reek of Vietnam, and the line
then that encapsulated the failure of the Pentagon's policy: for
villages to be saved, they sometimes had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win the war,'' say Tony Blair, Bill Clinton et al, day
after successive day of bombing of targets which never seem to get
destroyed the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the bombing is working, they insist, only to order up
another 300 aircraft to finish the job _ and risk more disasters
like Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
   Defying if not the truth, at least elementary common sense, they
cling to the Rambouillet formula that Kosovo remains part of
Yugoslavia even after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Do they really think it can? Do they really believe that having
uprooted more than one million Kosovo Albanians, and having sent
500,000 of them fleeing the country in terror, Milosevic will
meekly admit the folly of his ways and let them back in? Do they
think they will ever come back while Yugoslavia retains a shred of
authority over the province?
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is already asking these questions. Sooner or
later, the gap between the demonization of Milosevic as a
latter-day Hitler, and the refusal to send in a single ground
soldier after him, will become too wide for the most artful
propagandist to bridge. &QL;

Belgrade _ exactly the language used by NATO leaders to describe
Milosevic's tactics in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack strikes at the heart of the weakness of NATO's
presentation of the war _ not lies over daily events, but the fog
of confusion and contradictions surrounding the war's ends.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Kosovo is acquiring the reek of Vietnam, and the line
then that encapsulated the failure of the Pentagon's policy: for
villages to be saved, they sometimes had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win the war,'' say Tony Blair, Bill Clinton et al, day
after successive day of bombing of targets which never seem to get
destroyed the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the bombing is working, they insist, only to order up
another 300 aircraft to finish the job _ and risk more disasters
like Wednesday's.
</P>
<P>
   Defying if not the truth, at least elementary common sense, they
cling to the Rambouillet formula that Kosovo remains part of
Yugoslavia even after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Do they really think it can? Do they really believe that having
uprooted more than one million Kosovo Albanians, and having sent
500,000 of them fleeing the country in terror, Milosevic will
meekly admit the folly of his ways and let them back in? Do they
think they will ever come back while Yugoslavia retains a shred of
authority over the province?
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is already asking these questions. Sooner or
later, the gap between the demonization of Milosevic as a
latter-day Hitler, and the refusal to send in a single ground
soldier after him, will become too wide for the most artful
propagandist to bridge. &QL;

   The most ominous development of the war in Kosovo has come with
the news that the Serb forces in the province are shelling Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The great danger now is that the war will spill over into
Macedonia and the Yugoslav province of Montenegro, leading to more
burned villages, dispersed families and an acceleration of the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO talks about ``tightening the screws'' on Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, his army is continuing to
ignore NATO bombs and wage the war on its own terms by shelling the
towns of Tropoja and Padesh in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly surprising given that Albania has recently handed
over control of its airspace and ports to NATO. Albania is now the
base from which NATO has decided to land its punches on Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic is thus justified to regard his regime at
war with Albania. While this now forces NATO to protect Albania,
NATO must ensure that the fighting does not to spread to Macedonia
and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that this does not happen, NATO needs to hold fast to
its political objectives. At Wednesday's meeting in Brussels, the
19 NATO members pledged to attack President Milosevic until he
``accedes to the demands of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important of these demands is that the Yugoslav regime
allows Kosovars to return to their homeland and live there in
tranquillity. This will be impossible without an army to keep the
ethnic Albanians and Serbs from each others' throats.
</P>
<P>
   There will have to be a NATO element in that force if the ethnic
Albanians are to accept it. The establishment of a protectorate
will be difficult enough without having to cope with an all-out
Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   The Western governments are tortuously maneuvering towards
accepting the inevitability of using ground troops through double
negatives and what they leave unsaid.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is carefully leaving open the opportunity to
authorize a land invasion. The Pentagon has admitted that there are
plans for an invasion. And despite the politicians' platitudes that
invading Kosovo will be dangerous, NATO will win the war.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest threat to the successful prosecution of an invasion
is doubt in the minds of Kosovo's neighbors about NATO's aims.
</P>
<P>
   The support or at least the acquiescence of Greece, Macedonia
and Montenegro are all important to the success of a limited war.
The swiftest way to provoke their hostility is to instill the
suspicion that the NATO protectorate in Kosovo will lead to the
creation of a greater Albanian state.
</P>
<P>
   The Western governments must announce that the external borders
of Yugoslavia are not in question. The West must ensure that the
war is being fought to defend the Kosovar people and will be ended
only with the use of infantry. &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   With her neck and shoulder swaddled in bandages, she looked up
at us Tuesday from her bed, a pretty dark-haired woman of 23 who
was as angry as she was in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which hurts more _ my stomach, my shoulder or my
heart,'' she told us. ``It was the third bomb that broke the window
and did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. On a lower floor, 74-year-old
Radisav Milosavljevic _ already suffering a serious heart problem _
lay curled up like a giant fetus, bandages covering half his head
and face, his heart monitor racing on a small screen to the left of
his bed.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs had vibrated through the entire Military Medical
Academy, shaking the bed of 14-year old Ivan Labovic, fatally
wounded during a NATO bomb attack on Pristina on March 30 and now
dying _ heavily drugged but still conscious _ in the intensive care
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wounded near his home in the back, the abdomen,
stomach, liver and spleen,'' Doctor Nenad Markovic said. ``He has
had major surgery four times already but the wall of his stomach is
missing. I don't think we can save him.''
</P>
<P>
   Six other patients lay beside Ivan, one of them a soldier, the
rest civilians, all dying like the 14-year old, all in a coma, all
on respirators.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them were brain-dead _ most were hit by falling masonry
during air raids _ and a young doctor was using a tube to suck
saliva from the throat of a young man gravely wounded in the NATO
bombing of Aleksinac 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will die _ I'm afraid they are all going to die,'' Dr.
Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   Half its 1,000 patients are civilians and the other half both
soldiers and members of army families _ non-military personnel can
buy their way into the hospital's care with medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical center is located in a suburb teeming with
barrack buildings, parade grounds and army compounds. Most of them
are deserted and NATO was evidently not aiming at the hospital. But
it knew the risk it was taking when it bombed the army garages
behind the hospital's teaching center. And it wounded Dragana
Krstic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution with General Aco Jovicic as its head. True, there are
soldiers as well as civilians among the patients.
</P>
<P>
   But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed to be safe
from attack under the rules of war, as well as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   What if the NATO bombs had deviated just a few meters, as they
had at Aleksinac where 24 people are known to have been killed? Did
Dragana Krstic and old Radisav Milosavljevic have to be lacerated
by glass for a row of empty barrack buildings? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a communist's preference for rhetoric rather than argument
_ and an ability to destroy any arguments with exaggeration on an
epic scale _ Gen. Jovicic loudly denounced the damage to his
hospital as a ``war crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, he told us, was fighting in ``a dance against
Satan'' and ``only the crimes of Ghengis Khan'' could compare to
the NATO attacks on Serbia. The Americans were ``psychopaths
realizing their frustrations in death and destruction all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   We wanted him to stop, to let facts speak for themselves, to end
this genuinely angry but nonsensical tirade.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, walking the wards of the Belgrade Military
Medical Academy, I remembered another hospital I walked through
seven years ago, in Sarajevo, deliberately shelled for months by
Bosnian Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   And I thought of those thousands of Kosovo Albanians,
dispossesed, in despair, the victims of Serb special police, who
desperately need the care and compassion that these Serb doctors
demonstrate each day in this Belgrade hospital. But victims cannot
be balanced against each other. &QL;

<P>

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman, James Shea, says the alliance goes to
``extraordinary lengths'' to avoid civilian casualties. But this is
totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NATO planes destroyed a passenger train in
southeastern Serbia while bombing a bridge that it called ``a
military supply line.'' In other words, it was prepared to target a
railway track in mid-morning _ in full knowledge that the railway
carried scheduled passenger trains _ in order to blow up a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Shea's ``extraordinary lengths.'' &QL;

<P>
   The same applied in Banjica Tuesday. NATO bombed a barracks and
wounded hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   By a terrible irony, we found Mira Drijaca waiting outside the
medical center to visit her wounded brother, Mica. Mira is a
pediatric doctor. Mica is a surgeon. He was wounded while tending
to patients at a clinic more than a week ago _ in another NATO
bombing attack, this time on a nearby military airport outside
Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to Belgrade with his legs covered in burns. Mira
carried a plastic bag of homemade cakes and easter eggs for her
doctor-brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing wrong to the pilot of the plane that wounded
him,'' she said. ``I don't think the pilot knows why he bombed. He
was ordered to do it.'' As for her brother, ``I tell him to
endure.''
</P>
<P>
   In her bed, Dragana Kristic is less forgiving in her pain. ``If
I met the pilot that did this,'' she said, touching the bandages at
her neck, ``I could only wish for his child to have a day like I
had.''  &LR;  &QL;

   What if the NATO bombs had deviated just a few meters, as they
had at Aleksinac where 24 people are known to have been killed? Did
Dragana Krstic and old Radisav Milosavljevic have to be lacerated

   With a communist's preference for rhetoric rather than argument
_ and an ability to destroy any arguments with exaggeration on an
epic scale _ Gen. Jovicic loudly denounced the damage to his
hospital as a ``war crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, he told us, was fighting in ``a dance against
Satan'' and ``only the crimes of Ghengis Khan'' could compare to
the NATO attacks on Serbia. The Americans were ``psychopaths
realizing their frustrations in death and destruction all over the
world.''

dispossesed, in despair, the victims of Serb special police, who

   NATO's spokesman, James Shea, says the alliance goes to
``extraordinary lengths'' to avoid civilian casualties. But this is
totally untrue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NATO planes destroyed a passenger train in
southeastern Serbia while bombing a bridge that it called ``a
military supply line.'' In other words, it was prepared to target a
railway track in mid-morning _ in full knowledge that the railway
carried scheduled passenger trains _ in order to blow up a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Shea's ``extraordinary lengths.'' &QL;

   The same applied in Banjica Tuesday. NATO bombed a barracks and
wounded hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   By a terrible irony, we found Mira Drijaca waiting outside the
medical center to visit her wounded brother, Mica. Mira is a
pediatric doctor. Mica is a surgeon. He was wounded while tending
to patients at a clinic more than a week ago _ in another NATO
bombing attack, this time on a nearby military airport outside
Kraljevo.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought to Belgrade with his legs covered in burns. Mira
carried a plastic bag of homemade cakes and easter eggs for her
doctor-brother.

   ``He did nothing wrong to the pilot of the plane that wounded
him,'' she said. ``I don't think the pilot knows why he bombed. He
was ordered to do it.'' As for her brother, ``I tell him to
endure.''

   In her bed, Dragana Kristic is less forgiving in her pain. ``If
I met the pilot that did this,'' she said, touching the bandages at

DAMNATIONS TX TRY TO BREAK OUT OF AUSTIN 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) It's probably not fair to say that a band like the
Damnations TX could only come from Austin, Texas. The idea of
combining roots-country and alt-rock influences is hardly unique to
the self-proclaimed ``Live Music Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's something about the Damnations' casual _ you
might say slacker _ approach that defines Austin's laid-back
attitude toward stardom. This band has a way of turning concerts
and club appearances into big living room parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less competition between bands here,'' says Damnations
guitarist Rob Bernard, who also plays with Austin's Prescott
Curleywolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's all these different types of music to be inspired
by,'' says guitarist/vocalist Deborah Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come, and they listen to the lyrics,'' says
bassist/vocalist Amy Boone. ``In Austin, people appreciate
songwriters more.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is celebrating the recent release of its national
debut album, ``Half Mad Moon,'' on Sire Records.
</P>
<P>
   Boone and Kelly, who are sisters, grew up in Schoharie, N.Y.
Inspired by ``everything from Bob Dylan to AC/DC,'' they began
playing and singing together when they were kids.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Kelly moved to Austin in 1988 to attend the
University of Texas that they thought about turning pro. Boone
followed her older sister to Austin, and the two rented an
apartment near the university _ behind the building that previously
housed Antone's blues club.
</P>
<P>
   Their old neighborhood, a place where ``burned-out mesquite
winds blow/and senseless conversations grow,'' inspired the song
``Commercial Zone Blues'' on ``Half Mad Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone and Kelly (who has taken her mother's maiden name) began
working as an acoustic duo at open-mike nights in clubs and
coffeehouses. In 1994, the Damnations expanded to four members,
with an all-female lineup that played clubs such as the Hole in the
Wall, an Austin mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Langford, who has since departed to play with the Gourds,
took over on drums, and Bernard joined on guitar and banjo in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the group played mainly for friends and fellow
musicians. They gradually built a wider following with their loose,
spirited live performances. For the past couple of years, the
Damnations have been one of Austin's top-drawing club acts.
</P>
<P>
   A self-released live album recorded at college radio station KUT
quickly sold out last year. With backing from manager Charles
Attal, co-owner of Stubb's Barbecue in Austin, the Damnations set
to work on a studio album, which Sire Records agreed to release
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a six-month delay to work out legal issues
involving the group's name. They eventually settled on adding the
``TX'' to distinguish them from other similarly named bands.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question becomes, ``Can the Damnations TX beat the
Austin curse?'' Many previous local favorites have been swallowed
up by those commercial zone blues when trying to break out
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Attal hopes to build a grass-roots following through tours, good
reviews and adult/alternative radio play. Earlier this year, the
band did a stint as the opening act for Cake, and a spot on this
summer's Lilith Fair roster is a possibility. The band is waiting
for new drummer, Conrad Choucroun, to graduate from college in May
before heading back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The sisterly harmonies and the use of acoustic instruments have
drawn comparisons to such classic country artists as the Carter
Family and the Louvin Brothers. But Damnations TX is really just a
grown-up garage rock band at heart.
</P>
<P>
   As Bernard puts it, ``We didn't know we were alternative country
until they told us we were. That kind of music has always been out
there. Look at Neil Young.''
</P>
<P>
   While rock 'n' roll is filled with examples of successful acts
torn apart by sibling rivalry _ Phil and Don Everly, Ray and Dave
Davies with the Kinks, John and Tom Fogerty with Creedence
Clearwater Revival _ Boone and Kelly continue to live together in
Austin and share writing credits on all songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the males,'' says Boone, referring to the previous
examples. ``Dogs are like that, too. You can't keep 'em together
after they get older.''

HIS AND HERS FASHIONS CROSS THE LINE BETWEEN MEN'S AND WOMEN'S
WEAR 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Not since men and women both wore robes _ or even
animal hides _ have fashion trends been shared so closely between
the sexes as they will this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by the minimalist movement and the casualization of
America, and more recently by a trend to luxury sportswear,
menswear designs are paralleling many of those in women's wear for
fall 1999/winter 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Look for gray flannel, creamy winter white woolens, cashmere
sweaters, blanket plaids, black leather and occasional jolts of
color. Comfy clothes are musts, while those tiny-to-giant-size
utility purses designers slung over women's shoulders and round
their waists have been translated for men _ not only into messenger
bags but also into vests, belts and backpacks attached to clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Many jackets zip or have hidden closures, in the case of car
coats, and toggles on stadium coats. Other coats are down-filled
puffy parkas and anoraks. One of the most popular jackets for men
is not a jacket at all but the popular sailing-type windbreaker
that pulls on over the head, often with a hood, and usually with a
pouch on the front and a drawstring at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Vests sometimes take the place of jackets, and sweaters have
roll necks, turtlenecks and bateau necklines. Athletic shoes are
worn with casual suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nods to the future appear in silvered leathers and synthetic
fabrics, just as in women's wear.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. fashion, these cross trends might have been influenced
by the fact that men's and women's collections were combined in the
New York shows: The plan was for two days of menswear shows,
followed by a day of combination shows leading into five days of
solely women's wear. But as it happened, combination shows were
sprinkled throughout the week, with collections essentially ending
on a Friday night with Tommy Hilfiger's men's and women's wear
blowout.
</P>
<P>
   With women's wear beginning to move rapidly away from black as
the daytime uniform, the Kenneth Cole menswear show that kicked off
the General Motors 7th on Sixth fashion week came as a bit of a
shock. Almost entirely black, the collection nevertheless had the
advantage of a grand location _ Grand Central Station's recently
refurbished Vanderbilt Hall _ and the pizazz of a fun show that
included celebrities Jeremy Piven, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   When color happened on Cole's runway, it went only as far as
gray and an occasional khaki, navy and a couple of high-tech silver
jackets. Even his snowboarding jumpers were black. Then there were
the jeans _ stiff, dark denim, widely cuffed and pre-stained with
what looked like mud.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cole has a sure sense of what goes into young men's
closets today. His black suits ranged from the almost traditional
to high-buttoned jackets worn with narrow, cropped trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers were not as heavily into black. David Chu's
designs for Nautica, a more sports-oriented line, went as far as
winter white and safety orange, but the emphasis was still on urban
survival gear. Black leather or water-resistant jackets, cinched at
the waists, sported large cargo pockets, and there were quilted
vests and plenty of fleece and those sail-type waterproof
pullovers.
</P>
<P>
   The winter-white trend, coming directly from women's wear, was
no where as prevalent as on Donna Karan's DKNY runway. Men's suits,
toggled stadium jackets, down-filled parkas and cargo pants in
parachute fabrics were almost stark in their whiteness. Not nearly
as stark as Helmut Lang's vision of future fashion, however.
</P>
<P>
   Where he was bleak, Lang advocated urban life in black cashmere
T-shirts, slashed at the elbow for easy movement and worn with
padded black leather motocross jackets and pants and fingerless
black leather gloves. In his lighter moments, the look translated
to silver pseudo-astronaut looks.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of avant-garde designers used color more than cut as
the basis for their shock tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Dalal added the snap of red, pumpkin, golden yellow and
lavender to his collection, along with plaids, florals and soccer
shirts. There was even a burgundy velvet suit for evening.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Meyer sent out ruffle-front tuxedo shirts, without the
jackets _ another trend coming out of women's wear _ sweaters and
shirts with golden graphic designs and bright beaded floral motifs
in blues and greens. His ties, centered with large splotches,
looked pre-stained.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was one of several designers showing shearling coats, his
rough-edged with a feel of the Russian Cossack's dress.
</P>
<P>
   When John Scher touched on color, it was with a cornflower blue
leather jacket, blue or olive drab drawstring pants or a red
leather satchel that was swung across the wearer's back.
</P>
<P>
   Along with pouch-front pullovers, Scher sent out a novel fleece
top with hand-warming pockets built into a band along its lower
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Hall liked his color in bright shirts and ties,
pumpkin-spiced suits or gold trousers and a printed gold tie worn
with a conservative gray jacket and shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hall cuts comfortable clothes, roomy enough for casual wear but
not so way-out that they could not go to the office. &QL;

WOULD-BE ROCKETTE IS STILL OUT THERE KICKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (with art) 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For as long as she can remember, Michelle Hames has
wanted to be a Rockette.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the epitome of all precision dance groups,'' the
29-year-old Houston counselor marveled.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster living in New Jersey, Hames first saw the Radio
City Rockettes at a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York and
was dazzled by the glittering, high-stepping dance troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Hames considered auditioning for the
Rockettes, but she didn't muster the courage until she toured Radio
City Music Hall last year and talked with a cast member.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by the discussion, she decided it was time to pursue
her dream. She flew to auditions in New York, Dallas, San Francisco
and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Although she wasn't selected, ``It's been a good experience,''
she said. ``I've learned something new every time I've auditioned.
I'll continue to try.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company that produces the Radio City Christmas
Spectacular featuring the Rockettes in New York and six other
cities added Houston to the places where it conducts yearly
auditions.
</P>
<P>
   And Hames was here to try again.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined at the Allegro Academy of Dance in west Houston
Saturday by dozens of dancers who hope they have what it takes to
become a Rockette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're awesome,'' said Melissa Poteet, 19, who drove
from a small town in Louisiana for the tryouts. ``I like the way
they are all together. They dance as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Mirabella, who has been dancing for 40 years and was
considerably older than the other Rockette aspirants, drove from
her home in Beaumont, Texas, just for the chance to audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do it again tomorrow,'' she said, even though she didn't
make it past the first cut. ``It's exciting to be part of a dance
team, even if it's just for a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving for the tryouts, each participant was measured for
height. Rockettes must be between 5 feet, 5{ inches and 5 feet, 10
inches tall in their stocking feet and be at least 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Officials recently raised the height limit from 5 feet, 9 inches
in recognition that there are a lot of good dancers who are tall.
</P>
<P>
   After the auditioners were measured, Linda Haberman,
choreographer and director of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular,
taught them a simple jazz dance routine, which they were expected
to learn within 15 minutes, and then repeat in groups of three at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman narrowed the group to 10 dancers and taught them a tap
dance routine, which they performed in groups of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We throw a lot out at them,'' Haberman said. ``That's part of
the test because when they rehearse, they have to learn a number a
day. You have to be able to learn to assimilate quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being proficient in jazz and tap, each Rockette must
possess a certain intangible quality, Haberman added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to have a lot of of energy, facial expressions and
attitude,'' she said. ``You have to feel like they really want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a Rockette can't stand out. Each new member must learn to
blend in with the others as a seamless unit, particularly during
the high-kick numbers that the troupe is famous for.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a dancer, you strive to stick out. As a Rockette, you have
to leave that aside,'' said assistant choreographer Julie Branam,
who is a Rockette in the New York company.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the philosophy since the troupe first performed at
Radio City Music Hall during the Great Depression in 1932.
Originally dubbed the ``Missouri Rockets,'' the group first kicked
to life in St. Louis in 1925 before showman S.I. ``Roxy'' Rothafel
brought them to New York, where they were an instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about looking like everyone else,'' Branam said.
</P>
<P>
   As the final part of the audition, the participants were placed
in a line and taught to kick in the Rockette tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to see your toe in front of your eye; not higher, not
lower,'' Haberman explained. ``You have to discipline yourself not
to kick too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Branam later explained that the ``toe-to-eye'' instruction
provides the illusion that the group is kicking in unison.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one (kick) is higher, your eye goes to that. It takes great
discipline, and you're guaranteed to have good, strong abdominal
muscles. It takes lots of sit-ups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Haberman also told the women not to link arms while kicking
because they could inadvertently topple one another if they did.
Instead, she instructed members of the kick line to place their
arms in the middle of the next person's back, but ``don't make
contact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the audition, no slots were filled for the seven
companies that will perform the 1999 Christmas show in New York;
Los Angeles; Chicago; Detroit; Branson, Mo.; Myrtle Beach, S.C.;
and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Haberman kept a score for each contestant and will
notify the winners in June after traveling to all cities where
auditions are held. Houston was the first stop of an audition tour
that includes Dallas, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas, Los
Angeles, Orlando, Fla., and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of variables,'' Haberman said, noting that she
has to take into account such things as height in putting together
the members of each Rockette troupe.
</P>
<P>
   To create the illusion of uniform height, the tallest dancers
are placed in the center, and the line of dancers gradually
decreases in height with the shortest women at either end.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the line consists of 36 Rockettes; companies
outside of New York have 20 Rockettes.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the audition, Hames wasn't sure she had performed
to the best of her ability and planned to fly to Dallas to audition
again.
</P>
<P>
   She will continue pursuing her dream to become a Rockette
``until I make it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to different people along the way. You have to
keep auditioning, and eventually you will succeed. That's what I
want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Branam, who has been a Rockette for six years, understands such
an all-consuming desire to become part of the world's most unique
precision dance team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sorority kind of feeling about being a Rockette.
There's a real camaraderie,'' she said. ``It shows on stage when
you all work together.''

   BC-MENSWEAR-2ND TAKE &QL; 
UNDATED: the office. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott French is another designer who likes to shock with bright
shirts and ties, mixing fuchsia ties with blue, red or chartreuse
dress shirts. But the casual suit, in neutrals such as taupe with a
boxy jacket and slightly baggy pants, is his forte, a suit a man
can wear with athletic shoes or suede loafers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hugo Boss collection, shown with the women's wear, color
for men was confined to striped polos and T-shirts in gold, red and
olive, and colorful woven bands at the necks of mock turtle
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   At Perry Ellis, winter whites and cropped pants worn with white
tennis shoes had the look of a spring collection rather than fall
and winter. Color came in the form of deep red leather or fabric
jackets and camel and gray jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Ponchos, hooded and fringed or not, were worn with widely cuffed
Perry Ellis jeans.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartlett also included ponchos for men, one in a rich red
blanket fabric, but mostly Bartlett's menswear is cut to show off
the body.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts by Bartlett were sleeveless or curve over beefy biceps.
Knitted arm warmers emphasized the biceps also, and long, zippered
jackets make the man appear taller. With colors of dark gray and
olive drab and military pants and coats, these are manly clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Red and black buffalo plaids were worked into Bartlett's
collection as shirts and pants for men _ all casual, of course _
and while trousers may bag in the lower legs or even take a
half-skirt as coverup, they fit trimly across the stomach and hips.
The skirt reference is more to the kilt than a feminine coverup
</P>
<P>
   Stephen DiGeronimo managed to make olive, camel, black and white
look colorful. He mixed camel and white in a wide rugby-striped
sweater, paired a thick wool black jacket with white flannel
trousers and paired a camel pullover jacket with olive velvety
pants. Here again the look was of pants cut wide in the leg, but in
a casual manner, not like Sonny Bono flares.
</P>
<P>
   One must assume with menswear that if a show requires a runway,
something out of the ordinary will come down it. Just as Liz
Claiborne does not bother with a runway show for women, a menswear
label that goes only on traditional business suits or casual Friday
khakis and polo shirts will not command an expensive show.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cynthia Rowley's sheer knit shirts for men worn with
off-white padded and quilted silk pants. Or Tomasz Starzewski's
silly cloche hats and pink Pashmina shawls _ on men.
</P>
<P>
   But some runway designers are not so far afield that their
clothes shock. Some designers do understand the approach of not
alienating men with the ridiculous while still managing to show new
concepts in clothing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marc Jacobs, who sprinkled a few menswear
selections in with his women's wear, went for an entirely different
look for the sexes. Beside women's tall and narrow silhouettes, his
manly sportcoat of thick gray wool and his casual, zipped jackets
appeared boxy and squared-off over fuller pants that bagged about
the cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Michael Kors and Joseph Abboud translated their luxury
fabrics for both men and women. At Kors, there were double-breasted
camel coats worn to the knee over creamy white trousers, thick
white fisherman-knit turtlenecks and a maize crewneck sweater, as
well as a medium gray casual suit, with roomy jacket over a gray
crewneck shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren's Polo presentation covered the waterfront of
menswear, from a surfeit of cargo pants (in corduroy for winter)
worn with athletic shoes or hiking boots, to stadium coats and
puffy, down-filled jackets. Suits ranged from a lighter gray wool
casual cut to Lauren's traditional business suits.
</P>
<P>
   The richest menswear looks were on Abboud's runway. Paisleys, on
velvet jackets and vests, pearl gray tuxedo shirts with matching
bow ties, velvet Nehru-collared jackets and silk-fringed scarves
were for those times when men want a luxurious touch _ not an
every-evening occasion.
</P>
<P>
   But Abboud's warm camel-toned plaid and checked hacking jackets,
his gray stripes and his solid-color coats and suits in rich
fabrics had even the non-fashion-conscious men in the audience
nodding in approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was Hilfiger who wrapped up the cross-sexual
fashion trends, sending both men and women out in black leather
jackets, white shirts and giant-size red or blue plaids. He liked
the look of red leather jackets and pants on both, as well as furry
red vests. But Hilfiger knows enough to temper his bright reds with
urban black or charcoal gray and to add the occasional active-sport
touch.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew enough to end the fashion week, a week that
stretched to 10 days, with a rousing post-show miniconcert by Sugar
Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Most men will find something to like in the fall and winter
menswear. They can choose color or sink into the comfort of
neutrals they recognize. They can look toward the future in silver,
white or black leather or embrace the past in camel and charcoal
gray, cut not so much in retro styles as like traditional
sportswear.

PANEL APPROVES HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR UNMARRIED COUPLES

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Assembly's Health Committee
has approved a measure to require that health maintenance
organizations and health insurance companies offer coverage for
unmarried couples.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, written by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San
Francisco, would set up a registry of domestic partnerships to
document eligibility, and it would require hospitals to extend
visitation rights to unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 major companies already offer domestic partnership
benefits to unmarried couples, including Disney, IBM and Chevron.
But many smaller businesses can't provide the coverage because they
don't have the leverage to negotiate such a policy with health
insurers, Migden said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several large health plans, such as Kaiser, Blue
Cross, Blue Shield, HealthNet and Pacificare, began offering
domestic partnership health benefits.

LEGENDARY GUITARIST IS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics in graf starting with ``Beck's instrumental
sound has changed dramatically ...'')  
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the '60s, Jeff Beck, the guitar hero's guitar
hero, gave Jimi Hendrix a run for his money. In the '70s, he
jazz-rocked with the best of 'em and in the '80s did cameos on some
of the decade's top albums. Then he simply vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man Eric Clapton called ``the best guitarist around''
is back with ``Who Else!'' (Epic), his first album of originals
since the Grammy-winning ``Guitar Shop'' in 1989. So, where have
you been, Mr. Beck?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to do something now,'' Beck says. ``It's been
frustrating to have done so much and then sort of get passed by.
But it's always been difficult for me _ I'm basically an
instrumentalist who doesn't sing _ to put albums together and keep
a band on the road. That's why there's been so many career moves.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least. Beck is almost as well-known for his mercurial
moods and ever-changing band members as he is for spectacular
fretwork. A contemporary of Clapton and Jimmy Page and generally
considered better than both, Beck's restless creative spirit won't
allow him to trade on past glories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cutting a blues album or a pale imitation of ``Blow
by Blow,'' the George Martin-produced jazz-fusion classic that went
to No. 4 in the albums chart in 1975 and sold a million copies,
Beck appropriates the rhythmic energy of electronic music forms
such as techno and jungle while also exploring the intriguing
modalities of Arabic and Irish music on ``Who Else!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those rare musicians that keeps growing, that gets
more creative and imaginative all the time, that keeps changing,''
said Annette Carson, author of ``Crazy Fingers,'' a self-published
biography of Beck. ``And I think that's hurt him in the marketplace
today because you really have to keep up with what he's doing to
appreciate him. It seems today's music fans like to get their
entertainment in easily digested packages.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's fast-paced rhythms are a perfect setting for the
six-string intensity of a guitarist who first went public replacing
Clapton and preceding boyhood pal Page in the Yardbirds. Afterward,
he formed the first Jeff Beck Group with singer Rod Stewart and
future Rolling Stone Ron Wood. The group's ``Truth'' album is
generally considered the blueprint for hard rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That record was done with genuine love,'' Beck, 54, says from
London. ``We'd gotten polished on the road to the point where we
just set up some microphones and played. We just chose the best
guitar solos and vocals, and it was in the box _ finished. Most of
the records we love from the '50s were done the same way. There was
an event, an exciting event that took place and that was captured.
It wasn't a feet-up-on-the-couch thing. Today, it's listening to a
click track for three hours. Recording has become a horrible
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck appears Saturday at the Universal Amphitheatre with a new
band that includes virtuoso guitarist Jennifer Batten, who spent 10
years on the road with Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years of playing `Billy Jean,' it's just awesome to
stretch and grow,'' Batten said from her Fillmore home. ``I'm
playing guitar synth with Jeff, and there's a lot of room for
improvisation. It's a whole new world of sound. And I'm trying to
get him to bring back some older stuff, even as far back as the
Yardbirds.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's missteps are almost as well-known as the things he's done
right.
</P>
<P>
   He admits breaking up the first Beck group just days before
playing Woodstock (``It was one of the worst things I've ever
done.''); going to Detroit to record at Motown (``My drummer moves
the drums out of the studio and puts his in. This engineer comes up
and says, `You guys came for the Motown sound, right? Well, it just
went out the door.' &UR;  &LR; ''); the ill-fated '70s power trio Beck,
Bogert and Appice (``Completely out of control''); and making one
of the worst albums of the '80s, ``Flash,'' produced with an
apparent complete lack of interest by Chic's Nile Rodgers (``I had
nothing to do with it!'').
</P>
<P>
   But there's also been some fine session work from Beck on '80s
albums by the likes of Tina Turner, Mick Jagger, Roger Waters and
Buddy Guy.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the '90s, though, Beck has been relatively quiet,
except for ``Crazy Legs,'' a lovingly detailed tribute to
rockabilly guitarist Cliff Gallup of Gene Vincent's original
Bluecaps, and a soundtrack for the TV movie ``Frankie's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck _ who has spent much of the past 15 years building '50s hot
rods at his 420-year-old manor house in Sussex, England, but tools
around the city in a '96 Corvette _ concedes the millennium's
approach put a scare into him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people who think I'm from the '60s, but I
don't go out there and play Yardbirds songs, and I've certainly
never done a reunion tour of some sort,'' he said. ``I've kept
moving on this whole time. And it's cost me dearly. I don't think
I've ever been less popular than I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   El Becko's longtime fans, at least, are rabid. Reports from the
road say his ``Who Else!'' gigs are bringing down the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that fond of touring _ and that's another thing that
hasn't helped me,'' Beck said. ``I know it's weird, but I get
scared at the openness of America. It frightens the hell out of me.
Something hit me in the '60s when we'd been going across the Texas
plains for 20 hours and not seeing a tree. I mean, I love the
thought that all that space is there, but I don't want to actually
be in the middle of it. For me, the road is three months' luxury
imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's instrumental sound has changed dramatically over the past
decade. Inspired by the ethereal sound of the Bulgarian Choir _ the
Mystery Voices ITALICS START(Mystere des Voix Bulgares)END ITALICS,
Beck has fashioned a distinctive sound, based on harmonics, which
he shapes into long whistling passages by manipulating the whammy
bar on his signature Stratocaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the Bulgarian Choir, it took me by
surprise,'' the guitarist recalls. ``I was in tears inside for
weeks because of their quality and precision. The scales they sing
are almost unplayable. It hit me almost as hard as when I first
heard Elvis Presley and Little Richard in the emotional sense. In
some places, I'm playing sounds that some people don't even
recognize as coming from a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another thing I need at the moment _ playing music that
doesn't sound like it comes from a guitar!''

   DOLEWOMEN _ How likely is it that independent and Democratic

chances to become the GOP nominee for president. Dole so far has
said little about her positions on a wide range of issues, but in
Georgia, she has attracted the support of some prominent
conservative women, including DeKalb Commissioner Elaine Boyer and
state Rep. Renee Untermayer. As her positions become known, can she
attract both moderates and conservatives? (Sherman, Atlanta

Silicon Valley to the Delta and Appalachia.'' He wants
disenfranchised Americans - those who haven't cashed in on the
country's wild prosperity- to assert themselves by registering to
vote and organizing and demanding things like fair wages, health
care, family leave, etc. And he wants the govt. to encourage
investments in the South. He plans other trips through other

standards on tests and grades when Mom or Dad is also Teacher and
Counselor. The movement, more commonly associated with elementary
students, is maturing and is expected to graduate as many as 1
million students over the next 10 years. That's a critical mass
that colleges and universities say they must learn how to deal
with. Education groups _ one of which has set up a special
committee on the subject _ are now urging members to begin
developing policies on how to evaluate the home school application.

 &HT;    KOSOVO WAR A RISK FOR GORE'S PRESIDENTIAL HOPES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The politician with the biggest stake in the war
over Kosovo _ after President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, of
course _ may be Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO action is a two-edged sword for Gore. It highlights his
foreign policy and military experience, particularly the past six
years of close partnership with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But if the campaign goes badly for the United States, with high
casualties and financial costs or a failure to achieve military
objectives, voters might punish Gore at the polls next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No vice president has been ingrained in the process across the
board _ and especially on foreign policy _ the way this vice
president is,'' said Bruce Jentleson, a senior fellow at the U.S.
Institute of Peace who has been advising Gore on foreign policy
issues since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at any photos of key moments of decision-making, on
Haiti, on Bosnia or whatever, he is always there,'' said Jentleson.
</P>
<P>
   Not last Tuesday, however. After a White House meeting with Gore
and members of Congress to discuss the war against Yugoslavia,
Clinton went alone to the Rose Garden to urge the nation to ``stay
the course and persist until we prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gore has been practically invisible as a member of the
administration's war councils. Since March 24, when the NATO-led
air strikes against Yugoslavia began, his campaign trips have
escalated along with the bombing mission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore's public statements against the use of ground
troops are the strongest of any administration official, including
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the introduction of ground troops in combat
settings in the Balkans,'' he told reporters in late March as he
returned from a campaign trip. Clinton and his other foreign policy
advisers say only they have ``no plans'' for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no political calculation involved'' in Gore's
statements on Kosovo, insisted spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, one of only two White House hopefuls with military
experience in Vietnam, clearly understands the politics of war.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``does not want body bags coming home during his
presidential campaign,'' said Emmett Buell, a presidential
elections expert at Denison University in Granville, Ohio. ``So,
obviously, he is a hostage to the success or failure of the Kosovo
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Kosovo is not an issue by which our society is
going to define itself, as we did over Vietnam,'' said Jentleson.
``If a year and a half from now, as the election approaches, there
is a sense of morass in Kosovo, then you get a little bit more of a
comparison to Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear that Gore is no turn-of-the-century Hubert
Humphrey, a vice president who tried to free himself from the
Vietnam War policies of President Lyndon Johnson as he sought the
White House himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all these years of being half of the Clinton-Gore
administration, he cannot suddenly become a shocked bystander,''
said Jack Pitney, a former GOP strategist who now teaches political
science at Claremont McKenna College in California.
</P>
<P>
   There's no indication that Gore wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that we're doing the right
thing,'' Gore said during a recent campaign trip to New Hampshire,
one of several occasions in which the vice president has adamantly
defended the administration's military actions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has described himself as an ``active participant'' in the
conduct of the war, and White House spokesman Joe Lockhart has said
the president relies on him because he's the one with ``no
institutional representation'' in strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't represent the Pentagon, he doesn't represent the
State Department,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore has been Clinton's point of contact with Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia since the conflict began and
has been part of the administration's efforts to limit damage to
U.S.-Russian relations over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has always been hawkish on the Balkans, and his rhetoric in
recent weeks has been as belligerent as any from the
administration. He has called Milosevic a ``butcher'' and a
``junior-league Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings at the White House, Gore has argued
forcefully in favor of the NATO bombing campaign and against the
introduction of ground troops as anything other than peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's longtime foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth, was the
unsung architect and manager of the original economic sanctions
against Yugoslavia and an advocate of increasing the pressure on
the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   But there's limited political advantage in Gore remaining at the
president's side for every pronouncement on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A foreign policy crisis isn't a particularly good (political)
opportunity for an incumbent vice president,'' said Andrew Kohut,
director and chief pollster for the Pew Center for the People and
the Press. ``It's the president's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the war against Yugoslavia provides little
opportunity for Gore to counter polling data suggesting that
significant numbers of voters view him as lacking strong leadership
abilities. ``He's not the commander in chief,'' Kohut emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never easy for vice presidents _ that is why so few
win,'' said Charlie Jones, a presidential expert at the University
of Wisconsin and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Only
one incumbent vice president has been elected president in this
century _ George Bush.

TEXAS-ARLINGTON FRESHMAN TENNIS PLAYER HAD AUSTRIAN ARMY STINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Three guys are sitting at a army gas station
in Austria with nothing to do but read magazines and talk to each
other for about 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A truck comes by for gas. Usually, one truck per day. They fill
it and go back to what little they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. There's no punch line because the story is true.
Texas-Arlington tennis player Andy Leber was one of those guys
serving his mandatory Austrian army duty out of high school. After
six months at the gas station, Leber said his dreams of playing
tennis for a university in the United States were never more clear.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year at Texas-Arlington, college life is exactly as
he imagined.
</P>
<P>
   No joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so great, everything I thought it would be when I
left,'' Leber said. ``I've been a lot of places around the world to
play in tennis tournaments, and nothing compares. And to come into
a winning team, that makes it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Leber joined the Mavericks at the beginning of the spring
semester, and he quickly became an integral part of their
undefeated run through four Southland Conference regular-season
matches.
</P>
<P>
   In the No. 2 singles spot, Leber is 13-5 overall. He is 2-0 in
the No. 3 position.
</P>
<P>
   Leber will hold down the second position at the SLC tournament,
scheduled for Thursday through Saturday at the Texas-Arlington
Tennis Center. The top-seeded Mavericks, who are trying for their
second consecutive SLC tournament title, are scheduled to play at 9
a.m. Friday against the winner of the Lamar-Southeastern Louisiana
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy has played very well for us this season, especially good
for a freshman in the No. 2 spot,'' Texas-Arlington coach Patrick
Dubois said. ``I thought he could handle playing there because he
is a powerful player who can also do a number of other things well.
He's very experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-4, Leber is the tallest player on the team, and he
makes the most of his lanky frame with a serve clocked at 120 mph.
At 21, he's also one of the oldest freshman athletes at the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Before his training stint in the Austrian army, Leber studied at
a place called Monsbergergasse, which is a special five-year high
school for athletes. Only the top two players in each region of the
country are sent to Monsbergergasse.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, students are sent to army basic training
before being assigned to a job. Leber, who speaks German, English
and French, was sent to the gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big a deal in Austria because everybody has to
serve their time,'' Leber said. ``But during that time, it was a
complete waste as far as my tennis game was concerned. I wasn't
really able to do anything but read and sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leber found a university in Texas, he said it helped that
German native Christian Jaeger was on the team. The doubles
combination of Leber and Jaeger has a record of 13-5 in the No. 1
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger will be going for his third consecutive SLC male tennis
athlete of the year honor.
</P>
<P>
   Dubois, Texas-Arlington's fifth-year coach, is going for his
fifth consecutive SLC men's coach of the year selection.
</P>
<P>
   Leber is going on one full year away from his job at the army's
gas station.

TAKE A LOOK AT THE CITIES, JERRY BROWN TELLS NEWSPAPER EDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If newspapers are searching for good stories,
they should go beyond sex scandals and presidential politics and
take another look at American cities, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown
told a gathering of newspaper editors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the former California governor who in January took over
as mayor of a city often derided as an ugly stepsister to San
Francisco, said the media must recognize the news value of cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``While your news is very national and very international in
origin, maybe the most important aspect of America is its cities,''
Brown said. ``In terms of where is the threat, where is the
potential, it's right here. It's right where the rubber meets the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown made his remarks in a luncheon speech Wednesday to the
annual gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors here.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old mayor, who served as governor from 1974 to 1982,
said he saw a bias coming from the national media based on the East
Coast in New York and Washington toward national issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said notions of ``what is in, what is out, what is correct,
what is incorrect,'' were often decided back in those media
capitals, not in local communities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the public may miss seeing important changes
sweeping cities like Oakland, where he said people are bypassing
politicians to create change.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited the fact that in recent weeks Oakland
has more than doubled the number of its charter schools. All the
new schools have been organized by parents disappointed at the poor
quality of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who lost his bid to become the Democratic nominee for
president in 1992 because he beat Bill Clinton in only six states,
took a shot at the nation's current presidential hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the media would put too much emphasis on the
characters of the candidates in the coming campaign, Brown replied,
``Well, when there's not much substance, you don't have much
choice, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown gave a more
biting critique of the press in his speech to the editors. He said
he sees an institutional failure by the media to make sure news is
reported accurately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doubts you as much as it doubts me,'' he said.
``And that's not a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the coverage of President Clinton's affair with Monica
Lewinsky and the impeachment hearings showed that newspapers put
the trivial ahead of the substantive and care more about beating
the competition than making sure stories are fair and correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't be surprising that the public is ceasing to look
at you for information to form an opinion,'' said Mayor Brown, a
self-professed newspaper junkie.

CALIFORNIA INTENSIFIES PROBE OF GAS PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The state attorney general is expanding an
investigation into gasoline pricing in California following a
series of price increases that have made fuel here the most
expensive in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   State lawyers began an examination of pricing practices prior to
the time Attorney General Bill Lockyer took office in January. He
said Wednesday that the state was intensifying its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies attribute the higher prices to rising prices
on the world oil market and supply problems after two recent fires
at refineries in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Gas costs climbed 43.1 cents per gallon in the past month,
bringing the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the
San Francisco area to $1.71, the highest in the nation. The
nationwide average is about $1.10 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer met for 90 minutes Tuesday with Dennis DeCota, executive
director of the California Service Station and Automotive Repair
Association, who has long argued that a monopolistic economic
climate leads to pump price gouging.
</P>
<P>
   DeCota said he showed ``sensitive oil company pricing
information'' to the attorney general which, DeCota said, suggested
a pattern of price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different flag in Sacramento,'' he said, adding that
his complaints about the oil companies seem to get more attention
under the new Democratic governor, Gray Davis, than when Republican
Gov. Pete Wilson was in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do seem to be less influenced by big business like the
major oil companies,'' DeCota said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said he expected it would take ``a number of months to
adequately understand the causes of the price spike and to
determine whether there has been price gouging of consumers by oil
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears less than half the recent price increases are
related to either increases in the world price of oil or to the Bay
area refinery fires, which would only leave excess profit taking,''
Lockyer told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Libbey, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
said Chevron welcomed investigations into pricing practices
''because we are confident it will show there is a competitive
marketplace at work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that investigations into pricing by the Justice
Department and several attorneys general in 1989 and 1991 came to
the same conclusion _ that there was no collusion.

   RENTALS/``SEVEN MORE MINUTES'' (Maverick)
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore effort from ex-Weezer bassist and Rentals frontman
Matt Sharp would've been better received five years ago at the
height of the alterna-rock craze. Today, the new-wave synths,
modern-rock sheen and cutesy lyrics just seem dated. ``Seven More
Minutes'' looks like a big-budget project with high hopes attached,
though. The songs were composed in Spain and recorded in London,
and guests include singers such as Blur's Damon Albarn, Elastica's
Donna Matthews, Lush's Miki Berenyi and That Dog's Petra Haden.

NAS/``I AM ...'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   It's Nassir Jones, the guy who puts the Nas in ``nasty.'' For
his third album, the New York rapper offers yet another set of
tough-talking urban anthems designed for the white suburban teens
who buy this sort of nonsense in droves and will make this record
No. 1 this week. It all seems so calculated and ultimately empty.
Just to make sure radio climbs aboard, the dreaded Puff Daddy makes
a cameo on the overbearing single ``Hate Me Now.'' Students of
hip-hop production, however, will want to note the presence of the
imaginative Timbaland on just one track: ``You Won't See Me
Tonight'' featuring the cooing singer Aaliyah. 2 stars

MANDY BARNETT/``I'VE GOT A RIGHT TO CRY'' (Sire)
</P>
<P>
   With wide-ranging vocal power and the inherent good taste to
know when to hush it down, 23-year-old Mandy Barnett wears all
those comparisons to Patsy Cline well. On ``Right to Cry,'' her
second album, she runs a pleasing gamut from full-throated torch
(the title track, ``Whispering Wind'') to ache-infused ballads
(``With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming'') to jaunty hillbilly swing
(``Falling, Falling, Falling'') and sounds right at home in each
genre. With four songs produced by the late, great Owen Bradley,
the album boasts the richest countrypolitan sound since k.d. lang's
Bradley collaboration, ``Shadowland,'' dripping with luscious
string section arrangements and country gentlemen backup choruses.
But the real instruments here are Barnett's sophisticated voice,
precise enunciation and astute phrasing; even the album's most lush
orchestrations merely provide a showcase for her exquisite singing.

   Over a dozen studio albums, Petty has remained loyal to his
signature Byrds-inspired classic-rock sound. No complaints here _
``Echo'' is packed with superior material and the sort of rootsy,
emotive playing that makes the Heartbreakers one of rock's great
back lines. The melodies are especially strong on standouts like
album opener ``Room at the Top,'' first single ``Free Girl Now,''
the title song and the marvelous won't-back-down number
``Swingin'.'' 3 stars

   Long before ``fusion'' and ``world music'' went mainstream,
conga player Santamaria was breaking ground. Consisting of 24
tracks on two discs, this anthology spans nearly 40 years of
Mongo's career. Among the highlights of this entertaining
collection are the first-ever release of ``Panamanian Aire,''
signature songs such as ``Afro Blue,'' ``Para Ti'' and ``Watermelon
Man,'' plus the CD debut of some of Santamaria's early '70s cuts
for Atlantic. 3 stars

   You could view this album as a blatant attempt to rake more
money off people who bought the ``Tracks'' box set _ thanks to
three tracks, including a stunning seven-minute studio version of
``The Fever,'' that didn't appear on the original four-disc set. On
the other hand, maybe ``18 Tracks'' was designed for fans who
didn't want that hefty collection of Springsteen odds and sods. If
that's the case, the new collection is worthwhile. Still, every
Boss fanatic who doesn't have this ``Fever'' on bootleg will want
this disc. 3 stars

   A regular at Blue Note recording dates in the '60s, Chambers was
valued for his writing as well as his drumming. Now comes his first
Blue Note session as leader, and the resulting ``Mirrors'' offers
polished, diverse and ear-catching performances of Chambers' varied
tunes. With help from such energetic soloists as saxophonist
Vincent Herring and trumpeter Eddie Henderson on highlights like
the ballad ``Ruth'' and the New Orleans-flavored
``Tu-Way-Pock-E-Way,'' the album recalls the sturdy work of Tony
Williams' last quintet. 3 1/2 stars

TOM PETTY &AMP; CO. SING FOR VH1'S `STORYTELLERS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was probably one of the most low-key events in
Tom Petty's career _ at least since he stopped playing spring-break
shows in his native Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A recent taping of VH1's ``Storytellers'' series at a Burbank
soundstage found Petty and his superb five-piece Heartbreakers
performing in an intimate, relaxed setting.
</P>
<P>
   The small audience consisted of fan-club members and invited
guests squeezed into a small makeshift theater. The stage was
decorated with faux columns and patterned fabric swatches draped
around the set.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two hours, Petty played songs from his long career
and dozen studio albums including memorable new material off the
just-released ``Echo.'' Before launching into the group's 1976 hit,
``Breakdown,'' Petty recalled: ``It's 25 years tomorrow since we
came to town.''
</P>
<P>
   There was humor, too. At one point, Petty announced he had
composed a new number specially for ``Storytellers,'' a tune
referring to the blockbuster movie ``Titanic'' since ``everyone
loves `Titanic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The song featured such lyrics as: ``Titanic/It's gigantic/Celine
Dion/Should've been on/That Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining how he came to pen ``You Wreck Me,'' from his 1994
``Wallflowers'' album, Petty said the original title and chorus was
actually ``You Rock Me,'' but band members told him it was too much
of a rock 'n' roll cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Especially well-received were newly recorded songs, including
``Room at the Top'' and ``Swingin','' both from ``Echo.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty's ``Storytellers'' airs May 16 on VH1.

L.A. PUNK REDUX: The locals reckon Los Angeles punk never got a
fair shake, especially compared to London, New York and San
Francisco. That's the theory behind ``Forming: The Early Days of
L.A. Punk,'' an exhibition at Track 16 Gallery (Bergamot Station,
2525 Michigan Ave., Building C1, Santa Monica). The show offers an
ephemera-filled backward glance at the early days of Big Orange
thrash. Included are such artifacts as graffiti-covered doors from
the long-gone Masque club, set lists, fliers, photos and old copies
of Slash magazine. Such junk probably holds up better than the
music. Drop by 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays; the
show closes June 4. Information: (310) 264-4678.

N.Y. GOVERNOR RESOLVES FUNDING FOR GOODWILL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki declared himself the savior of
the first Winter Goodwill Games at Lake Placid, announcing
arrangements for $10 million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   Companies building new ski lifts and bobsled facilities needed
for the event in February 2000 signed contracts for the work last
week.
</P>
<P>
   That was the day before folks in Lake Placid conducted a rally
to blast Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for blocking funds for the
Goodwill Games-related projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're going to have to pay interest and it will cost
us because we couldn't get the appropriation through the
Assembly,'' Pataki said, continuing to express his frustration with
Silver. ``The first-ever Winter Goodwill Games will go forward as
planned, in spite of the highly partisan and political attempt by
Assembly Democrats to hold the games hostage to the state budget
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver had refused to agree to Pataki's request for emergency
funding of $10 million to upgrade the luge/bobsled run near Lake
Placid and to install high-speed lifts with gondola cabins at
Whiteface and Gore mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Democrat declared the projects, which he supports,
should be part of budget negotiations, which have yet to occur, not
of emergency spending bills needed to pay essential state bills,
such as payroll. Further, Silver said, the governor has many pots
from which he could fund such projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Regional Development Authority negotiated
short-term, $5 million loans, Pataki said. He did not make the
announcement until Wednesday because terms had not been completed
until then, according to a spokesman for the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ORDA had notified the financial community, by advertising in the
New York State Contract Reporter in February, that it may need to
take out loans. Two banks responded to that request, said Ginny
Valenze, public affairs director for ORDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans and alternative plans have been worked on for quite
some time ... We have always remained very optimistic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A contract for about $4.9 million was signed last Friday by
Doppelmayr, of Golden, Colo., to put up a new gondola at Whiteface.
A similar contract was signed by POMA of America, of Grand
Junction, Colo., for gondola lifts at Gore. Clough Harbor and
Associates and other companies are rebuilding the luge and bobsled
run.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a $20 million project, most of which is to
upgrade facilities for the international sporting event next
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a concern of ours and we were disappointed it became a
political issue,'' said Amy Phillips, a spokeswoman for the
Goodwill Games. ``Luckily this is all resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the rates negotiated by the banks, the $10 million in
loans will cost ORDA tens of thousands each month _ a cumulative
total of $243,293 by September if the loan isn't paid off by then
through a state budget appropriation.

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene...

   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. The bombs had vibrated through the
entire Military Medical Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Nenad Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution. True, there are soldiers as well as civilians among
the patients. But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed
to be safe from attack under the rules of war, as well as
civilians... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene...
</P>
<P>
   Unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger of
looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. The bombs had vibrated through the
entire Military Medical Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Nenad Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution. True, there are soldiers as well as civilians among
the patients. But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed
to be safe from attack under the rules of war, as well as
civilians... &QL;

   FREUD-EXHIBIT (New York) _ How should we interpret the writings
of Sigmund Freud? One way to regard him has always been as a
literary figure rather than as a scientist. Thomas Mann once even
endorsed Freud's nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Because it caused a widely-publicized fracas even before the plans
for it were finalized, the Freud exhibition, organized by the
Library of Congress and opening Sunday at the Jewish Museum, will
almost surely attract big crowds of curiosity-seekers. Crowds now
being a dominant feature of the museum experience, they are also,
to a degree, self-perpetuating, since people tend to want to go
where other people already are. The resulting frustration involves
trying to see what is on view in a throng. Freud might have noted
how we tend to seek out what we abhor. By Michael Kimmelman.

   APPLES-ST-LOUIS (St. Louis) _ In 1904, St. Louis was the fourth
largest American city. It was rich, river-rich, thanks to the
Mississippi, then the nation's main north-south artery. Although
Chicago had developed into the dominant railroad hub, St. Louis
deemed itself the rightful capital of the Middle West. So the city
staged the grandest, giddiest, most glorious fair the world had
ever seen, on this continent or any other, the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. That was the apogee; life in St. Louis has never been
quite as sweet since, and people here still murmur wistfully about
the summer of 1904. But the lights did not go out right away. St.
Louis prospered through the next few decades, ``a solid expanse of
bricks and mortar stretching away into dim, measure-defying
distances,'' as Mark Twain wrote, making money on beer and shoes
even as it fell behind boom towns like Detroit and Los Angeles. It
built an array of big-time cultural and civic institutions that
serve it well to this day. And fate found ways to keep its name on
the nation's mind. By R.W. Apple Jr.

the circumstances, this ``Sound of Music'' is appreciably better

ONLY ON THE STAGE DOES `ICEMAN' TRULY COME ALIVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the theorists for the moment. The first thing you should
know about ``The Iceman Cometh,'' Howard Davies' brilliant
Anglo-American production of the Eugene O'Neill classic, is that it
sends you out of the Brooks Atkinson Theater in Manhattan on a high
of excitement you probably haven't experienced in years.
</P>
<P>
   Like some spellbinding pitchman, it psychs you up. You will want
to talk about it immediately, but not only about O'Neill's
subversive genius and the mastery of this particular production.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation here is the ability of great theater to transform
the most unlikely material into the kind of enriching, revivifying
experience that defines art, no matter what the subject, or when it
was created, or for whom it might have been intended.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill wrote ``The Iceman Cometh'' in something of a white heat
in a matter of months in 1939. It comes out of the playwright's
experiences when he was in his 20s, knocking around New York before
World War I, living in flophouses, often depressed and sometimes
suicidal. The achievement of the Davies production is to rediscover
the timelessness of a present-day that few of us could ever have
known. For reasons that remain mysterious, it seems especially
moving today.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Iceman Cometh'' was first produced on Broadway in
1946, the critics welcomed it, though with reservations, and it ran
for only 136 performances. No surprise. Everything about it was an
insult to America's can-do sense of itself in the years immediately
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It also displeased those who believed that theater has an
obligation, if only in terms of drama, to demonstrate something
more than what one critic described as O'Neill's ``automatic
pessimism.'' Even Harold Clurman, the theater director who was also
one of our most enlightened critics, responded to that initial
production by saying flatly that ``the world cannot be represented
by a bunch of drunks who fail to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as good a description as any for the habitues of Harry
Hope's dank, dispirited skid row bar in 1912, which is the setting
for ``The Iceman Cometh.'' Yet it doesn't encompass the entire
theatrical equation as you watch the play. O'Neill's characters _
worn-out anarchists, failed con artists, drifters, former Tammany
Hall gofers, whores, pimps, informers, society's dregs _ perform on
the stage, but their theatrical validity depends on the collective
response of the audience. That is, on our recognition and
acceptance of them.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the theater audience, for which O'Neill
originally wrote, were not keen on filling in the blanks. They
wanted to be told exactly what to think. Yet for all of the
biographical details the playwright gives us, the characters remain
at heart ambiguous. Most are long gone in alcoholism. They are
other people. They inhabit a world of frozen twilight, where life
is either a terrifying hangover or a dream so anesthetizing that,
from time to time, they can safely believe in a better tomorrow:
the day they will get straight. Such are their pipe dreams.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, himself an alcoholic, wrote about these characters not
as theoretical types but as people he knew: with compassion,
raucous humor, impatience and fury. About none of them did he write
with more vitriol and self-loathing than Theodore Hickman, the
play's spooky catalyst, the fast-talking traveling salesman
(hardware) fondly called Hickey by the other barflies at Harry
Hope's.
</P>
<P>
   This is the role that made a star of Jason Robards in Jose
Quintero's celebrated 1956 Circle in the Square production of
``Iceman,'' and in which Kevin Spacey is now giving the finest,
most fiendishly mesmerizing performance of the Broadway season to
date.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Hickey has been showing up at the bar for one of his
``periodicals,'' or epic binges, to celebrate Harry Hope's birthday
and to stand everyone in the joint for an extended siege of serious
boozing. Until this visit, nobody has given much thought to Hickey
except as a fellow who spends money freely and tells great
``iceman'' jokes. To be sure, he is not really like them.
</P>
<P>
   He is always neat and clean, at least at the beginning of a
``periodical.'' He makes a decent living, he is as generous with
his ear as he is with his cash, and he has an adoring, faithful
wife in Astoria, who forgives him his trespasses. It is as if the
barflies accepted Hickey as a kind of fiction, someone who
certifies the pipe dreams each has about himself without making any
demands. Hickey is glorious timeout.
</P>
<P>
   This visit, however, is different. Even before Hickey appears
toward the end of the first act, Cora, the bar's senior whore,
reports that she has just run into him down the block and that he
sends word he has come to ``save'' his old pals. Harry Hope, who
hasn't stepped foot outside his bar since his beloved wife, Bessie,
died 20 years earlier, says it is simply Hickey's way of setting up
an elaborate gag. The others aren't too sure, and they are right.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey is a new man. Even as he is buying his first round of
drinks, he announces that he himself has gone off the sauce and
found peace. His mission: to help his friends find the salvation
that has given him his new, clearly messianic serenity. How has he
done it? He has recognized the emptiness of the pipe dreams that
allowed him to live through endless cycles of drinking and whoring,
that tore apart his beloved wife and that swamped him in guilt
insupportable.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey is not a salesman for nothing. Within a few hours, he has
convinced Harry Hope to take that long-planned walk around the
neighborhood and to admit that he actually loathed the beloved
Bessie. Cora and her lover, whom she largely supports, attempt to
get to New Jersey to marry. Cecil Lewis, the florid old English
army captain, and Piet Wetjoen, the Afrikaner general, drinking
partners since they appeared together in the Boer War spectacle at
the 1903 St. Louis World's Fair, make feeble plans to return home.
</P>
<P>
   As Hickey's crusade advances, the alcohol seems to lose its
kick. A sense of desolation takes hold as each attempt to emulate
Hickey fails. Watching all this with uneasy skepticism is Larry
Slade, the dropout anarchist whose pipe dream is that he longs for
death, though he clings to life by his finger tips. Hickey, he
suggests, has brought his friends death, not life. Larry has
Hickey's number, but then Larry is as unrelenting in his way as
Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh'' is not an easy text to read. Only Hickey
and, to a lesser extent, Larry, appear to have lives of their own.
O'Neill's attempts to write dialect phonetically are almost
impossible to decipher. The play is schematic and repetitive. Every
speech seems to go on too long. Every plot revelation is inevitably
telegraphed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on its feet, in a production of this grace and magnitude,
``The Iceman Cometh'' becomes soaring theater. The difference
between the text and the production is the difference between a
score read by an amateur and the same score played by a full
orchestra. There are 19 characters in the play, all but two of them
onstage for most of the four-hours-plus running time.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a theatrical panorama of a sort not seen in the
New York theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's production
of ``Nicholas Nickleby.'' It is not the spectacle that impresses,
but the creation of a virtual community, which, in turn, gives you
a visual equivalent to the expansiveness of the mind that created
this world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill thought big and thoroughly. Characters are important not
only for themselves, but also for their relations to each other and
to their environment.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks he knows the play from either Sidney Lumet's
1960 television adaptation, also starring Robards, or from John
Frankenheimer's 1973 movie version, in which Lee Marvin played
Hickey, should be suitably surprised by what he finds on the Brooks
Atkinson stage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the essential joys of the production is the way the eye
is allowed to wander at will, from a couple of characters having a
furious argument at stage left to the old fellow who has passed out
cold, downstage right, or to the impassive face of Rocky, the
bartender, viewing all from his station upstage right. ``The Iceman
Cometh'' cannot be reduced to a succession of close-ups, medium
shots and long shots without sabotaging the playwright's vision.
</P>
<P>
   As seen on the stage, the play is an organic entity, the
physical form of which becomes an act of compassion in that, as we
examine this community, we are constantly reminded that each
character is equally important. People who make movie and
television adaptations can't afford to give you this freedom,
possibly afraid you might not know where to look, as well as all
too aware that it would slow down the action.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Davies production, which began life last
year at the Almeida Theater in London, is ensemble work of
remarkable balance. By that I mean to salute the contributions of
everyone on-stage and off, from Bob Crowley (set and costume
design) and Mark Henderson (lighting) to the breathtaking cast led
by Spacey, who also starred in London.
</P>
<P>
   The New York cast includes actors from the London company,
supplemented by American actors so seamlessly cast that you
wouldn't know they hadn't all been marooned in Harry Hope's saloon
for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spacey's Hickey gives the production its focal point, the
performance, as fine as it is, is not the entire show. I think also
of Tim Piggot-Smith as the supposedly self-contained Larry Slade, a
moralist possibly even more vicious than Hickey; of Michael Emerson
(you should remember him as Oscar Wilde in ``Gross Indecency''), as
the lost son and heir of a discredited bucket shop tycoon; of James
Hazeldine's Harry Hope; of Patrick L. Godfrey and Ed Dixon, as the
mutually dependent English army captain and Boer general, and of
Clarke Peters, as a once successful uptown gambling figure, now
rummy but still articulate _ a black character that could have been
written yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Note, too, Robert Sean Leonard as the desperate, no longer
radical son of a fiery West Coast organizer who sounds a lot like
Emma Goldman, and Katie Finneran as the boozy but still beautiful
Cora, the tart who dreams of a farm in New Jersey, but who settles
for a cubicle in a flophouse.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be able to avoid Ms. Finneran's expression as, near
the end of the performance, Cora sits stoically, stage center, en
route to oblivion once again. That image, unsentimental and
brutally fixed, provides the evening with its haunting coda. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Whatever you do, don't do as I did and go to the Walter Kerr
Theater to see another London import, ``The Weir,'' which is also
set in a barroom, the night after reveling in ``The Iceman
Cometh.'' It plain isn't fair to ``The Weir,'' an eccentric,
essentially sweet-natured piece by Conor McPherson. He is the Irish
playwright who wrote ``St. Nicholas,'' the uproarious monologue
that Brian Cox played here at Primary Stages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``St. Nicholas,'' which has to do with a hard-drinking
Dublin drama critic's mad adventures with some London vampires,
``The Weir'' also has to do with the occult, but in what might be
called a more humane, less rambunctious way.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for the production, originally done by the Royal
Court Theater in London, is a bar on the remote west coast of
Ireland, where, on a dark and stormy night, four male friends and a
youngish woman, newly arrived from Dublin, meet and exchange tales
that initially evoke fairies, leprechauns and other such
unexplained phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, McPherson's interests go beyond weird
stories to embrace something quite other: the kind of love that
bridges time and place, as well as Ireland's apparent humiliation
at turning into a haven for tourists from Scandinavia, all of whom
are lumped together as ``the Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' (which means dam) is all talk, some of it
entertaining, but most of it fixed in delivery in the way of
stories told too often, too glibly. Of the five members of the
cast, you may remember most pleasurably Brendan Coyle, as the
young, self-composed bartender who hears all and reveals little
about himself, and Kieran Ahern, as a country fellow who is none
too bright.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Norton plays the lonely old owner of a garage as if
auditioning as a replacement for Barry Fitzgerald. Michelle Fairley
is attractive and solemn as the guest from the city. And Dermot
Crowley is the hustling local who is making his fortune in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   That ``The Weir'' should have been so enthusiastically hailed in
London astonishes me. There is nothing gravely wrong with it, but
it seems very lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   The play, directed by Ian Rickson, is not helped by a physical
production that suggests something put on by a high school. Though
you can assume this bar is a small, intimate, homey place, it takes
up the full width of the Walter Kerr's broad stage. You feel as if
you are in a hangar recently abandoned by extraterrestrials. When,
on cue, the great Atlantic winds start to roar outside, you wonder
who's manning the turntable and the tacky sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' never got through to me, but then I had seen ``The
Iceman Cometh'' the night before.
</P>
<P>
   THE ICEMAN COMETH Superlatives all around. A brilliant
production, breathtaking results from the cast and creative team
and a mesmerizing performance by Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEIR An eccentric piece that is all talk in a windy
environment.

MORGAN TERRITORY HAS WILDFLOWERS, ARTIFACTS, SPECTACULAR VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SLUG stands for GREAT-PARKS)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The view seemed like a landscape mural.
</P>
<P>
   Below and to the south was the new Los Vaqueros Reservoir, big,
emerald-green and beautiful. To the east plunging 1,600 feet below
was Round Valley and a verdant wall- to-wall carpet of
fresh-sprouted wild grass. Just behind our perch was Bob Walker
Ridge, with long-distance views in all directions, while the
foothills were sprinkled with color from blooming buttercups, red
maids and wild mustard.
</P>
<P>
   This is Morgan Territory, and of the 55 parks in the East Bay
Regional Park District, it now offers the No. 1 spring adventure in
the San Francisco region.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the wildflowers and long-distance views in all
directions, Morgan Territory has Indian artifacts, perfect hike-in
picnic sites, great bike trails, a dozen hidden ponds and lots of
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The park is located on the south flank of Mount Diablo, about a
15-minute twisty drive north of Livermore. Here, we met my longtime
comrade Ned MacKay, now a park specialist, and headed off on the
Volvon Trail to best experience the arrival of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Right off you realize this is a great destination for not only
hiking but for easy strolls, mountain biking, jogging and horseback
riding. Dogs are permitted off leash providing they are kept under
control. The parking area is large enough to accommodate pick-up
trucks with horse trailers, and on our visit at the trail head we
saw two horses, two mountain bikes, and three hikers with dogs.
With 38 miles of trails and former ranch roads here, there seemed
plenty of space for all users.
</P>
<P>
   We picked the Volvon Trail in a mission to try to find Indian
artifacts, the best views available of the new Los Vaqueros
Reservoir, Mount Diablo to the north and the Sierra crest to the
east, and to find a perfect picnic site. By linking the Volvon
Trail with the Blue Oak Trail and Valley View Trail, you can create
an easy 5.7-mile loop.
</P>
<P>
   The first steps came easy and light, with the air fresh and
clean, and the foothills glowing in greenness. Many of the trails
in bay area parks have been muddy, but the winds and warming
temperatures are drying them out, so the trails are mostly dry with
only a few mushy spots.
</P>
<P>
   We had walked scarcely a mile when MacKay, my friend of 25
years, suddenly grinned and pointed about 50 yards off the trail to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't believe this,'' he said, and led the way, tromping
off trail toward large boulders set near a grove of blue oaks.
</P>
<P>
   He probed around the rocks for a bit, like Lt. Columbo looking
for clues, suddenly announced, ``Here they are! . . . Look at
this!'' We looked closer, and there in the boulders were bowl-like
indentations that had been carved into several rocks. We realized
that these were used by members of the Volvon tribe to grind acorns
into powder before leeching out the bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Volvons were one of five Indian nations in the Diablo area
who were roughly considered Mi-Wok,'' MacKay explained. ``If you
look closely enough around here, you can find these acorn-grinding
bowls.''
</P>
<P>
   This region of California, Mount Diablo and its nearby sphere of
influence, was considered the sacred birthplace of the world in the
ancient days. Its Native American name was ``Tuyshtak.''
</P>
<P>
   We hiked on, topped a short ridge, and there to the north Diablo
came into view, green and fresh. At 3,849 feet above the valley low
lands, Diablo can be seen for hundreds of miles in all directions,
but the best view of it is here, looking up from the 2,000-foot
ridge at Morgan Territory.
</P>
<P>
   You head onward, though, and the views become even more
spectacular. In order to create a loop route out of the Volvon
Trail, we took the 1.8-mile Valley View Trail, providing a short
link.
</P>
<P>
   There are a series of lookouts here, but the best is looking
down at the new Los Vaqueros Reservoir. This is a big lake, and
from the trail, you can see about 65 percent of it. As California's
newest lake, Los Vaqueros has become the bay area's No. 1 mystery
spot, and there is no better view of it than from lookouts on this
loop hike. The sight of it creates tremendous excitement because of
its potential for recreation. It will open to the public about
mid-year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the views are also exceptional all along the Valley View
Trail, which is cut just below the Bob Walker Ridge. In fact, this
part of the trail was named for the plunging view below into
neighboring Round Valley Preserve. From here, it was easy to see
across the Central Valley and to the snow-covered Sierra crest.
Without binoculars, I could clearly identify the Carson-Iceberg
Wilderness and Mokelumne Wilderness near Carson Pass. With
binoculars, I could just discern the highrises of Sacramento,
staring through the valley haze.
</P>
<P>
   On each side of Bob Walker Ridge, there are several ideal spots
for a trail lunch with long-distance views. Here we were joined by
several friendly bovines, one of which seemed particularly enamored
with Ned. He acquiesced by taking its photograph, after which she
let us be.
</P>
<P>
   The cows rile many visitors who want an absolutely natural
experience. Yet MacKay pointed out that this range is the
historical habitat for tule elk, which would render an impact
similar to the bovines. But because of the cows in the park, hikers
must be wary of the chance of occasionally planting their Vibrams
in the center of a meadow muffin, and bikers often have to put up
with a hoof-marred trail surface.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to get away from the cows, that is easy enough
to accomplish. The network of trails in the park and the dozens of
signed junctions make it possible to custom-tailor your visit to
create your own adventure and get exactly what you want out of it.
And what you can get here is simply spectacular.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a writer and are having trouble getting your book
published, it could be because you're lacking a catchy title.
</P>
<P>
   Book titles used to be a lot more attention-grabbing than they
are today, according to an article carried by the World Features
Syndicate. Today, you have books with dumb titles like ``The
Courage to Be Rich'' or creepy titles like ``Monica's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare those with a book published in 1865 titled ``How to Get
Fat.'' I know nothing else about this book, which is unfortunate
because I'd love to know what advice the author gave the overly
thin in the days before cable TV and stuffed-crust pizza. Eat more
lard, plow fewer fields and take more frequent naps would be my
guess.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be interesting to know if people were as obsessed
about getting fat in 1865 as people are about getting thin in 1999.
Was ``How to Get Fat'' a one-of-a-kind book or just one title on a
whole wall of the bookstore devoted to eating wrong and chubbing
up? Today, we have fitness gurus like Jane Fonda and Richard
Simmons. In 1865 did they have celebrities urging people to eat
more pork and drink more gravy? Wouldn't you love to see the video?
OK, maybe you wouldn't, but the point is that ``How to Get Fat'' is
a heck of a book title.
</P>
<P>
   Another book with an intriguing name was published in 1896 and
titled, ``Animals as Criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   You hardly ever read about the crimes committed by animals
anymore, which is odd because you've got to think that animals are
just as ill-behaved today as they were in 1896, perhaps even more
so. Could the Humane Society or PETA be guilty of a cover-up? Hard
to say.
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear what constituted criminal behavior in animals
in 1896. A bull that gores or a horse that kicks might be
considered criminal, but what about a dog that eats your slippers
or a cat that shreds the drapes? How would you go about punishing
your miscreant pets? Make them watch Little Friskies commercials
for 24 straight hours? Wouldn't that constitute animal cruelty?
Perhaps we should just avoid this book altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the subject of animals, another book with a boffo title
is the 1934 volume, ``Do Snakes Have Legs?''
</P>
<P>
   While one might think this would be a very short book (the
entire text consisting of the single word ``no''), you've still got
to believe that it would be more interesting reading than
``Monica's Story'' or even ``The Courage to be Rich.'' Either way,
a snake with legs would definitely qualify as a criminal animal, so
if you see one you should have it arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But even snakes with legs get better treatment than men
presumably do in the 1899 book titled ``How to Cook Husbands.''
Since this book was written in the days before microwaves, one has
to assume that the favored cooking techniques involved either a
large oven or a very deep pot or, perhaps, both. (For a truly
tender husband, you should marinate him in beer before cooking.)
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would like to know if this gross-sounding book was
written by the same author who wrote the 1885 classic, ``How to Be
Happy Though Married.'' If so, I'm guessing that somewhere along
the line the female author lost faith in her own advice and decided
that marital bliss could be better achieved by serving one's
husband as the main dish, perhaps accompanied by some fava beans
and a nice Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   Let us hope, for everyone's sake, that the author of ``How to
Cook Husbands'' was not also the author of 1904's ``Cold Meat and
How To Disguise It.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, if these were the dining options in the late 19th
century, it's easy to see how a book like ``How to Get Fat'' could
become a runaway best seller.

<P>
   A wall of cannons atop a grassy, open slope. Forty thousand men
killed or wounded in three days near Gettysburg, Pa. It was the
numbers that got to Frank Wildhorn, the composer of ``The Civil
War,'' the new Broadway musical opening on Thursday at the St.
James Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six hundred and twenty-thousand people died, almost as many as
died in all American wars combined, including World War II,
(italics)combined,''(end italics) Wildhorn said in a voice still
incredulous after four years of immersion in the subject of the War
Between the States. ``When you hear about those things and you are
a composer,'' he said, ``they inspire melody.'' If you are Frank
Wildhorn, the melody is ``accessible'' and the work is
``comfortable on the ear'' (his words).
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Broadway is devoted to revivals of American
classics _ both straight plays and musicals _ and imports from
London, Wildhorn is one of the few composers creating musicals that
are new, American and popular with audiences.
</P>
<P>
   His work has not, however, been a success with critics and what
has set Wildhorn noticeably apart on Broadway from composers like
Jonathan Larson (``Rent''), Stephen Flaherty (``Ragtime'') and Alan
Menken (``Beauty and the Beast'') are his reviews. ``Leaden,
solemnly campy,'' was how Ben Brantley, writing in The New York
Times, described ``Jekyll and Hyde'' when it opened in 1997. The
pop-opera score, Brantley said, ``makes `Sunset Boulevard' sound
like `Parsifal.' '' But the reviews had little effect on the box
office. ``Jekyll and Hyde'' has sold consistently well, helped by
fanatical fans known as Jekkies, as well as by Wildhorn's practice
of releasing CDs of his scores long before opening night on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was not the hit that ``Jekyll and
Hyde'' has been. It opened to lackluster reviews in late 1997 and
eventually dwindling ticket sales. A year later, the show was
recast and revamped. In a favorable review of the revised version,
Brantley said that even Wildhorn's ``syrupy'' pop ballads ``have
acquired a new ease.'' (``Pimpernel'' closes at the end of May, to
be reworked for a smaller touring version scheduled to reopen on
Broadway in the fall.)
</P>
<P>
   Easy tunes seem to come naturally to Wildhorn; he is a pop-song
writer by training. They are, however, all ``The Civil War'' has in
common with ``Jekyll and Hyde'' or ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' The
musical represents a major step in a new direction for the
40-year-old composer. The show has no plot beyond, loosely
speaking, the war's progress from the surrender of Fort Sumter in
1861 to the eve of the battle of Gettysburg in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   There are no heroes or villains, no crusading Dr. Jekyll, no
heinous Mr. Hyde and certainly no swashbuckling Percy Blakeney aka
the Scarlet Pimpernel. Instead, the composer and his two
co-authors, Gregory Boyd and Jack Murphy, have dispensed with a
traditional book, choosing to divide the cast into four groups of
seven: the Union Army, the Confederate Army, slaves, and various
civilians involved in the action on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The only historical character is the former slave and
abolitionist Frederick Douglass, portrayed by Keith Byron Kirk. The
cast also includes Michel Bell, Cheryl Freeman and Irene Molloy
under the direction of Jerry Zaks.
</P>
<P>
   What ``The Civil War'' has is songs: they are plot, character
and emotion rolled into one. In ``Northbound Train,'' a Yankee
captain (Michael Lanning) tells of his plans to fight one more
battle and then go home. ``Sarah'' is a musical love letter by a
Union corporal (Gilles Chiasson) knowing he will die in battle.
``Last Waltz for Dixie,'' led by the Confederate captain (Gene
Miller), is an anthem to rev up the troops for the battle at
Gettysburg. ``Each song is its own play, it's a world unto
itself,'' Wildhorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he and his collaborators _ Murphy wrote the lyrics;
Boyd provided dialogue and structure and was the trio's war expert
_ realized they did not want to create a fiction like the 1975
musical ``Shenandoah.'' Nor did they wish to take a documentary
approach, as Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward did in their 1990
television series ``Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the most of the recent explosion in Civil War-related
publishing, they devoured histories, diaries, letters, speeches and
historical novels, and found their vehicle: songs. The lyrics would
be drawn from real sources, like letters and diaries, and the music
would come from a variety of cultures and styles.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Wildhorn envisioned an oratorio, a musical composition
with a contemplative libretto, performed in a concert hall. But by
the time ``The Civil War'' had its first production _ last
September at the Alley Theater in Houston, where Boyd is the
artistic director and where the show was developed _ it was billed
as ``an epic musical event.'' Today Wildhorn calls it a ``musical
tapestry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fancy words aside, his intentions remain the same as ever.
Wildhorn wants to please audiences. To do that, he said, one has to
write in the ``musical vocabulary'' of today. In that respect, he
believes, he is no different from his predecessors in musical
theater's heyday. ``Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and the Gershwins
were writing in the musical vocabulary of their day,'' he said.
``They were (italics)the(nd italics) popular-song writers of the
day. Today, the vocabulary is black music, Latin and world music.
Theater needs to embrace all the musical vocabularies of the
present day, especially if it wants to attract new audiences, and
younger audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicals lost the attention of his generation, he said, because,
with some exceptions, they failed to embrace rock-and-roll: ``In
the 1960s and 1970s, with the birth of the radio-record business,
rock-and-roll became the music of the world. And music theater
closed ranks against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The music of ``The Civil War'' is both contemporary and
historical. Its ``vocabularies'' are a diverse mix of military
marches, rhythm and blues, country, Irish and English folk song,
gospel and, of course, Top 40 pop. (By contrast, a current Off
Broadway show on Theater Row entitled ``Reunion: A Civil War
Musical Epic in Miniature,'' presented by the Amas Musical Theater,
uses traditional music and songs of the period.)
</P>
<P>
   The songs for ``The Civil War'' began to flow after a weeklong
tour of battlefields, which Wildhorn took with Murphy and Boyd.
``Have you been to Gettysburg?'' Wildhorn asked, sitting in his
spacious office at Atlantic Records, where he is the creative
director of the Atlantic Theater imprint. ``The focus of the battle
is a hill and there's nothing on it, just grass, with cannons at
the top. When the general said, `Take that hill,' the soldiers
said, `For your honor, for the honor of Virginia, for God and
country,' and then they went and got slaughtered. When you walk up
that hill you ask, `How could they have done this?' Then you ask:
`My God, how did we do that to each other? How did these brothers
and sisters and fathers and mothers deal with it?''' From that walk
came most of the music for the show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Leading the tour was an elderly guide named Sally. ``Every half
hour,'' Wildhorn recalled, ``she would stop and go off and she
would have to weep. All during the day she gave us facts and
figures and she would always call the soldiers, North and South,
`My boys.' You saw how real this all was to her. You were drawn
into her world. If you open yourself up enough to let yourself be
drawn in, cool stuff happens. For me, I had to run to a piano.''
</P>
<P>
   The first song he wrote was ``I'll Never Pass This Way Again.''
It is a folk song with a steady, walking beat, delivered by David
M. Lutken as a Confederate Army corporal, who stands alone onstage,
picking and strumming an acoustic guitar. ``I was born beside this
river/'Bout a half a mile from here,/But I never seemed to
notice/That the water ran this clear,'' he sings as he is going off
to war, certain that he will ``never pass this way again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the songs are for soldiers. The actors playing
nonfighting blacks who are enslaved and later freed sing ``River
Jordan,'' led by Lawrence Clayton. It is an all-out gospel number,
complete with melodic noodling from the organ and chorus riffs on
``Hallelujah.'' ``Meet me by the River Jordan/Knee-deep in a rising
tide,/We will climb aboard that boat called Freedom,/And we'll all
sail over to the other side,'' Clayton sings, and the audience on a
recent preview night responded enthusiastically, exactly as
Wildhorn wished.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm going for,'' he said, ``is that visceral reaction you
get in the last minute of a football or a basketball game, or in a
Bruce Springsteen concert. It's almost out of control, it's sexy
and it's got a little danger in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs for slaves, the composer added, were relatively easy
to write. ``They're being treated terribly and they want their
freedom. It's clear. The goals are clear. What I wasn't clear on
was, why did they go and take that hill?''
</P>
<P>
   The answers came slowly, and they constitute the heart of ``The
Civil War.'' The reason most of the soldiers did not turn and run
at Gettysburg or any other battle, Wildhorn finally realized, was
that they believed in their generals, in themselves and in the
importance of bringing honor to their brigade, their families and
to God. ``With that spirit, they went for it,'' the composer said.
``With that spirit the war was fought. I know these are big words.
`Freedom' and `spirit' and `honor.' They are what made these songs
happen, because they are what drove the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs complete, the next task he set for himself was to get
as many top artists in pop music as he could for the album.
Wildhorn likes to record his shows early and release them as a
``concept'' album, then mount the theater production and follow it
with an original Broadway cast album.
</P>
<P>
   The business motives are obvious: a successful recording builds
an audience for the show. But there are creative reasons also. In
addition to out-of-town tryouts (``The Civil War'' spent three
weeks in New Haven), the initial recording can function as a
composer's workshop. Wildhorn cuts songs, writes new ones and has
the chance to write for specific voices.
</P>
<P>
   For the first recording of songs from ``The Civil War,'' the
composer wanted Nashville voices primarily, but the initial
reception was cool on Music Row. Doing a musical-theater piece,
said the singers' managers, would damage their clients' audiences,
credibility and careers. But Wildhorn has some credibility of his
own as the composer of several hundred pop songs _ among them,
``Where Do Broken Hearts Go?,'' a No. 1 hit for Whitney Houston,
``Don't Look in My Eyes'' for Kenny Rogers and ``I Do'' for Natalie
Cole and Freddie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to get the songs to the singers. Travis Tritt, Deana
Carter, Trace Adkins, Trisha Yearwood and Charlie Daniels perform
on the CD ``The Civil War: The Nashville Sessions'' (Atlantic
83090-2). A second recording, the double CD ``The Civil War: The
Complete Work'' (Atlantic Theater 83091-2), contains the
``Nashville Sessions'' as well as other performances, including,
from rock, Hootie and the Blowfish; from gospel, Bebe Winans; plus
Dr. John, Betty Buckley and Patti LaBelle. Wildhorn's wife, the
singer and actress Linda Eder, performs on both albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't afford to have these stars onstage for eight
performances a week, but you can get them on the recording, and
they help build awareness of the show,'' Wildhorn said. Marketing
techniques are nothing new to Broadway, he emphasized. ``In the old
days, sheet-music sales and big bands playing covers of the songs
were the means of spreading the music.''
</P>
<P>
   If his visions are realized, ``The Civil War'' may eventually
cover even wider territory. He plans a concert of the songs; an
abbreviated version of the score for high schools, and even a
Fourth of July celebration piece, replacing Tchaikovsky's ``1812
Overture.''
</P>
<P>
   Musical theater on the football field, after the potato-sack
races and before the fireworks? Wildhorn makes no apologies for
being popular and popularity-minded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the fact that pop is such a dirty word when it comes to
theater,'' he said. ``I'm writing in 1999, and my music is popular.
So if you call me a pop writer, I stand guilty as charged.''

   THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION 1999 SOUTHERN ECONOMIC SURVEY
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN GROWTH: IT'S SPRAWL Y'ALL
</P>
<P>
   The focus of this year's Southern Economic Survey, an annual
report on the South by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Business
department, is urban sprawl and how it affects cities of all sizes.
Journal-Constitution reporters visited cities in Virginia, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and
Texas to compile this report. The package includes stories on laws
and proposed legislation that may shape growth and future growth,
stress from increased commuting time, the impact of growth on
pollution and compliance with the Clean Air Act and a look at how
much longer the region might continure to grow. For information
about any of this material, contact the CoxNet desk in Atlanta at
404 526-5456.
</P>
<P>
   SESURVEY-OVERVIEW _ The South said ``y'all come'' and folk did.
Half the nation's 50 fastest growing metro areas are in the South.
Problem is, the region never planned ahead to accommodate so many
people with schools, public transportation, road and sewer
infrastructures, etc. Growth overload _ for years an issue in only
the country's biggest metro areas _ has filtered down to mid-sized
and small cities , and poses significant issues related to
continued economic growth. Government leaders, (using terms such as
smart growth and new urbanism ) _ from presidential candidate Al
Gore to governors in Georgia and Tennessee _ are contemplating a
raft of legislative possibilities to manage or contain sprawl.
Development _ a crucial source of new money in the South _ may be
reined in. What does it mean for the South's economic future?

   SESURVEY-CHARLOTTE _ Once again, this fast-growing city where
marble-and-glass banking towers soar into the Carolina-blue sky, is
talking trash about its neighbor down in Georgia. Charlotte long
ago grew weary of its runner-up status _ a Southern capital wannabe
running hard but still trying to catch up to Atlanta, it's
Olympic-sized rival 235 miles to the southwest. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SESURVEY-GI-TOWNS _ The boom is lopsided. While population and
jobs surge in some states, they are declining in others. Some of
those on the wrong side of the growth curve are grappling with the
effects of military bases that shipped out or scaled back. Places
like Pine Bluff, Ark., Charleston-N. Charleston, S.C.; and
Anniston, Ala. In habitually slow-growing central Louisiana, two
such towns are separated by 50 miles of pinelands, bayous and
attitudes. Alexandria, the bigger of them, mourned the loss of
England Air Force Base and expected doom. Seven years later,
economists and locals, including an attorney who put a million
dollars into launching a pro ice hockey team at the parish
coliseum, agree they are better off now. The former NCO club, PX
and hangers have been turned into space for computer makers,
airline contractors and such. Meanwhile, officials in Leesville,
the other, much smaller, town only recently concluded that economic
survival depends on attracting jobs other than those that serve Ft.
Polk, where the number of troops has been cut in half and once
healthy neighborhoods are covered with for sale signs. (Kempner,

   SESURVEY-SCTOWN _ MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Tacky coastal tourist
town gets suburbanization. Housing permits in the area have nearly
doubled in the last four year. Heck, they're even trying to build
an ``urban village'' a la Fredreick Olmstead on the air force base
that closed in 1993. How these two images play against one another
-- the Grand Strand where you can buy glued-together seashell
bracelets and see Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum along with rows
of new subdivisions and growing talk of ``smart growth.'' (Soto,

   SESURVEY-ALATOWN _ HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ Rocket City is
diversifying. The northern Alabama town has been trying to
re-invent itself as federally funded employment in the area
shrivels up. From 1996 to 2000, NASA projected a 30 percent
decrease in its jobs there. Still, this city of 170,000 people (and
its county, Madison) had seen a 62 percent increase in housing
permits in the last four years and 13 percent population growth
since 1990. Part of the strategy has been in trying to lure
research and manufacturing firms in software, engineering, telecom
munications, space vehicles and rocket propulsion. (Soto, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 33.

   SESURVEY-GATOWN _ ST. MARY'S, Ga. _ Quiet little St. Mary's,
which used to be known only as the place to catch the ferry to the
environmental wonders of Cumberland Island, has been a growth
magnet for the past decade. That's thanks to the U.S. Navy
submarine base ate Kings Bay. With each new sub assigned there, the
county grew by 1,000 people. Then, add in all the growth those
families have drawn. The population grew 50 percent during the
1990s. Money magazine named St. Mary's the fastest growing small
town in America in 1996. But now that the last sub has docked, in
1997, what's happened or what will happen to Camden? The area has
begun to attract. (Soto, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   SESURVEY-MISSTOWN _ OXFORD0, Miss. _ Oxford is the
quintessential small town - complete with antebellum homes, a
picturesque university, a town square, and the spirit of the
South's most famous writer, William Faulkner. So no wonder everyone
wants to live here. People who moved here thinking they'd found a
hidden jewel are finding out they are far from alone. Subdivisions
are popping up like dandelions, a new cancer center is bringing in
doctors and medical professionals in droves who need housing, and
Oxford is doing the unthinkable - sprawling. The old homes that
make this town what it is are now a fortune, and everyone is
terrified that Oxford is about to be malled. The wolf of the strip
mall is at the door, what to do? Mayor Pat Lamar is taking action -
she's hired a Georgia Tech team to organize rezoning and future
planning to keep the town as it is without stunting growth entirely
- a tricky proposition and one that undoubtedly many small towns
face. (Rochell-Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50.

   SESURVEY-NCTOWN _ GREENSBORO, N.C. _ In the year since this city
nabbed one of the Southeast's biggest economic plums, a $300
million, 1,500-employee Federal Express package sorting hub slated
to open in 2003, residents of a nearby country club neighborhood
have mobilized hoping to scare FedEx away. They've threatened
lawsuits and tried to muster public sympathy for their unfortunate
proximity to Greensboro's airport, which has agreed to build a
third runway to accommodate up to 60 early-morning FedEx flights
daily. In the meantime, life for many in the Cardinal subdivision
is on hold. People aren't able to sell houses, despite plummeting
values. ``We have one house that is empty now, and another has gone
rental,'' resident Kenny Ford said. ``Slowly we are going to turn
into a squatter's neighborhood.'' (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 54.

   SESURVEY-FLATOWN _ PORTSTJOE, Fla. _ While the rest of Florida
has enjoyed a sustained boom for the past two decades fueled by
retirees and tourists, sleepy Port St. Joe in the Panhandle has
relied on a more traditional smoke-stack economy. Things turned
sour, though, when the St. Joe Paper Company sold its Port St. Joe
mill to a new owner, who quickly announced big lay-offs. Last year
the mill closed for good, leaving thousands jobless and Port St.
Joe with Florida's highest unemployment rate. Now city fathers are
struggling to find a new foundation for the economy, hoping itis
not too late to ride the coat-tails of Florida's development boom
by bringing tourism to their out-of-the-way corner of the state.

   SESURVEY-COLUMBUS _ COLUMBUS, Ga. _ Georgia has been booming
economically, even outside the spotlight of Atlanta activity, in
smaller cities like Savannah, Valdosta and Brunswick. But no area
has been busier than Columbus, where economic development officials
estimate that 1998 capped 10 years of growth with $1.5 billion in
capital development and the addition of 14,000 jobs. Leading the
growth parade has been Total Systems, the credit card processing
business that has just opened a new $100 million
headquarters/campus in downtown Columbus on the banks of the
Chattahoochee River, complete with a colorful river walk for
employees and the public. Other financial services businesses have
prospered as well, and the new wealth and new interests has spurred
growth in the arts. Preservation-minded Columbus has renovated and
updated many of its buildings. But nothing shines like the new $15
million performing arts center downtown. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   SESURVEY-NEWORLEANS _ NEW ORLEANS _ Some cities are tapping into
the convention and tourism business for growth and development. One
feeds into the other. One way cities lure convention trade is by
touting all the things to see and do there. To compete, the city
has to get bigger and bigger to get stronger shows. Looking mainly
at New Orleans and Orlando. The convention business has really
spurred development in downtown new Orleans. More than 2,000 hotels
rooms are slated to come online by the end of the year. And there
is also a move afoot to tie the arts into the convention business.
Harrah's is opening right down the street from the convention
center at the end of 1999. (Poole, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

it has always wanted ,is more residents downtown. That seems to be
happening, with a scramble by several apartment developers to get
projects going downtown. But those, and other efforts, including
the development of a light rail system, have brought cries of foul
from minorities, who claim they're being left out of the
discussions. (Coffee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SESURVEY-AUSTIN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ After years of bitter
confrontation that embroiled even the Texas legislature and the
state supreme court, environmentalists and business groups in
techie, music-loving Austin are making peace and, incredibly,
agreeing on growth agendas. Plenty of environmentalists still don't
trust developers and vice versa. But city officials who oversee
extra restrictive development laws have been successful pushing
high-tech companies to less environmentally sensitive areas, like
downtown. The restrictive laws also should protect Barton Springs,
a clear springs near downtown that is a basic symbol of Austin. It
is visited on field trips by school children and some people swim
in it during lunch. (Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 38.

   SESURVEY-RALEIGH _ RALEIGH _ This hodgepodge of communities
strung together by I-40 and a world-renowned research campus
slammed into the messy side of growth almost overnight. Locals --
many of whom came from bigger cities -- like their home. But long
backups on I-40, Davis Drive and other byways have invaded living
patterns and work places. Traffic has replaced weather as the
conversation du jour. Now some techies turn down job possibilities
because of traffic. Scientists at Research Triangle Park times
their workouts on company treadmills to avoid evening rushhour and
RTP companies warn they may not be able to expand without traffic
improvements. Improvements are tough to come by. Each city in the
region has its own ideas on how to handle growth and RTP's
autonomous government authority only recently decided that the
problems are bad enough to get deeply involved in the issue.

   SESURVEY-POLLUTION _ In Atlanta, the risk to economic growth
from continued noncompliance with federal Clean Air Act standards

other areas, such as Charlotte, trying to avoid becoming the next
Atlanta in terms of pollution and congestion. (Ritzler, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.

   SESURVEY-TRAFFICJOBS _ ATLANTA _ Like thousands of Atlanta area
commuters, Cheryle Crumley dreads driving. She endures a 2 1/2 half
hour round-trip crawl on Georgia 400 to get to work at Emory
University. The round trip commute used to take just over an hour.
``It's horrendous,'' The Alpharetta resident said of her Ga. 400
trek, an ordeal she has been dealing with for six years. ``I fume.
By the time I get to work, I'm ready to murder a few people. It's
pretty stressful. And it's not going to get better until we have
some major lifestyle adjustments.'' Crumley isn't being flip. It's
her job as Emory's director of alternative transportation to find
ways to steer people out of Atlanta's vice-grip traffic. It's a
tough call. Atlanta's overtaxed odometers not only wreak an
emotional toll on individuals, but traffic congestion is costing
Atlanta employers $1 billion a year in lost worker productivity.

   THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION 1999 SOUTHERN ECONOMIC SURVEY
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN GROWTH: IT'S SPRAWL Y'ALL
</P>
<P>
   The focus of this year's Southern Economic Survey, an annual
report on the South by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Business
department, is urban sprawl and how it affects cities of all sizes.
Journal-Constitution reporters visited cities in Virginia, the
Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and
Texas to compile this report. The package includes stories on laws
and proposed legislation that may shape growth and future growth,
stress from increased commuting time, the impact of growth on
pollution and compliance with the Clean Air Act and a look at how
much longer the region might continure to grow. For information
about any of this material, contact the CoxNet desk in Atlanta at
404 526-5456.

<P>
   SESURVEY-OVERVIEW _ The South said ``y'all come'' and folk did.
Half the nation's 50 fastest growing metro areas are in the South.
Problem is, the region never planned ahead to accommodate so many
people with schools, public transportation, road and sewer
infrastructures, etc. Growth overload _ for years an issue in only
the country's biggest metro areas _ has filtered down to mid-sized
and small cities , and poses significant issues related to
continued economic growth. Government leaders, (using terms such as
smart growth and new urbanism ) _ from presidential candidate Al
Gore to governors in Georgia and Tennessee _ are contemplating a
raft of legislative possibilities to manage or contain sprawl.
Development _ a crucial source of new money in the South _ may be
reined in. What does it mean for the South's economic future?

   SESURVEY-CHARLOTTE _ Once again, this fast-growing city where
marble-and-glass banking towers soar into the Carolina-blue sky, is
talking trash about its neighbor down in Georgia. Charlotte long
ago grew weary of its runner-up status _ a Southern capital wannabe
running hard but still trying to catch up to Atlanta, it's
Olympic-sized rival 235 miles to the southwest. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   SESURVEY-GI-TOWNS _ The boom is lopsided. While population and
jobs surge in some states, they are declining in others. Some of
those on the wrong side of the growth curve are grappling with the
effects of military bases that shipped out or scaled back. Places
like Pine Bluff, Ark., Charleston-N. Charleston, S.C.; and
Anniston, Ala. In habitually slow-growing central Louisiana, two
such towns are separated by 50 miles of pinelands, bayous and
attitudes. Alexandria, the bigger of them, mourned the loss of
England Air Force Base and expected doom. Seven years later,
economists and locals, including an attorney who put a million
dollars into launching a pro ice hockey team at the parish
coliseum, agree they are better off now. The former NCO club, PX
and hangers have been turned into space for computer makers,
airline contractors and such. Meanwhile, officials in Leesville,
the other, much smaller, town only recently concluded that economic
survival depends on attracting jobs other than those that serve Ft.
Polk, where the number of troops has been cut in half and once
healthy neighborhoods are covered with for sale signs. (Kempner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 46.

   SESURVEY-SCTOWN _ MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Tacky coastal tourist
town gets suburbanization. Housing permits in the area have nearly
doubled in the last four year. Heck, they're even trying to build
an ``urban village'' a la Fredreick Olmstead on the air force base
that closed in 1993. How these two images play against one another
-- the Grand Strand where you can buy glued-together seashell
bracelets and see Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum along with rows
of new subdivisions and growing talk of ``smart growth.'' (Soto,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 41.

   SESURVEY-ALATOWN _ HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ Rocket City is
diversifying. The northern Alabama town has been trying to
re-invent itself as federally funded employment in the area
shrivels up. From 1996 to 2000, NASA projected a 30 percent
decrease in its jobs there. Still, this city of 170,000 people (and
its county, Madison) had seen a 62 percent increase in housing
permits in the last four years and 13 percent population growth
since 1990. Part of the strategy has been in trying to lure
research and manufacturing firms in software, engineering, telecom
munications, space vehicles and rocket propulsion. (Soto, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 33.

   SESURVEY-GATOWN _ ST. MARY'S, Ga. _ Quiet little St. Mary's,
which used to be known only as the place to catch the ferry to the
environmental wonders of Cumberland Island, has been a growth
magnet for the past decade. That's thanks to the U.S. Navy
submarine base ate Kings Bay. With each new sub assigned there, the
county grew by 1,000 people. Then, add in all the growth those
families have drawn. The population grew 50 percent during the
1990s. Money magazine named St. Mary's the fastest growing small
town in America in 1996. But now that the last sub has docked, in
1997, what's happened or what will happen to Camden? The area has
begun to attract. (Soto, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   SESURVEY-MISSTOWN _ OXFORD0, Miss. _ Oxford is the
quintessential small town - complete with antebellum homes, a
picturesque university, a town square, and the spirit of the
South's most famous writer, William Faulkner. So no wonder everyone
wants to live here. People who moved here thinking they'd found a
hidden jewel are finding out they are far from alone. Subdivisions
are popping up like dandelions, a new cancer center is bringing in
doctors and medical professionals in droves who need housing, and
Oxford is doing the unthinkable - sprawling. The old homes that
make this town what it is are now a fortune, and everyone is
terrified that Oxford is about to be malled. The wolf of the strip
mall is at the door, what to do? Mayor Pat Lamar is taking action -
she's hired a Georgia Tech team to organize rezoning and future
planning to keep the town as it is without stunting growth entirely
- a tricky proposition and one that undoubtedly many small towns
face. (Rochell-Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50.

   SESURVEY-NCTOWN _ GREENSBORO, N.C. _ In the year since this city
nabbed one of the Southeast's biggest economic plums, a $300
million, 1,500-employee Federal Express package sorting hub slated
to open in 2003, residents of a nearby country club neighborhood
have mobilized hoping to scare FedEx away. They've threatened
lawsuits and tried to muster public sympathy for their unfortunate
proximity to Greensboro's airport, which has agreed to build a
third runway to accommodate up to 60 early-morning FedEx flights
daily. In the meantime, life for many in the Cardinal subdivision
is on hold. People aren't able to sell houses, despite plummeting
values. ``We have one house that is empty now, and another has gone
rental,'' resident Kenny Ford said. ``Slowly we are going to turn
into a squatter's neighborhood.'' (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 54.

   SESURVEY-FLATOWN _ PORTSTJOE, Fla. _ While the rest of Florida
has enjoyed a sustained boom for the past two decades fueled by
retirees and tourists, sleepy Port St. Joe in the Panhandle has
relied on a more traditional smoke-stack economy. Things turned
sour, though, when the St. Joe Paper Company sold its Port St. Joe
mill to a new owner, who quickly announced big lay-offs. Last year
the mill closed for good, leaving thousands jobless and Port St.
Joe with Florida's highest unemployment rate. Now city fathers are
struggling to find a new foundation for the economy, hoping itis
not too late to ride the coat-tails of Florida's development boom
by bringing tourism to their out-of-the-way corner of the state.

   SESURVEY-COLUMBUS _ COLUMBUS, Ga. _ Georgia has been booming
economically, even outside the spotlight of Atlanta activity, in
smaller cities like Savannah, Valdosta and Brunswick. But no area
has been busier than Columbus, where economic development officials
estimate that 1998 capped 10 years of growth with $1.5 billion in
capital development and the addition of 14,000 jobs. Leading the
growth parade has been Total Systems, the credit card processing
business that has just opened a new $100 million
headquarters/campus in downtown Columbus on the banks of the
Chattahoochee River, complete with a colorful river walk for
employees and the public. Other financial services businesses have
prospered as well, and the new wealth and new interests has spurred
growth in the arts. Preservation-minded Columbus has renovated and
updated many of its buildings. But nothing shines like the new $15
million performing arts center downtown. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   SESURVEY-NEWORLEANS _ NEW ORLEANS _ Some cities are tapping into
the convention and tourism business for growth and development. One
feeds into the other. One way cities lure convention trade is by
touting all the things to see and do there. To compete, the city
has to get bigger and bigger to get stronger shows. Looking mainly
at New Orleans and Orlando. The convention business has really
spurred development in downtown new Orleans. More than 2,000 hotels
rooms are slated to come online by the end of the year. And there
is also a move afoot to tie the arts into the convention business.
Harrah's is opening right down the street from the convention
center at the end of 1999. (Poole, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SESURVEY-ORLANDO _ ORLANDO _ Orlando seems to have everything
going for it. It has Disney, conventions and is a destination stop
for national and international tourism. But what it lacks, and what
it has always wanted ,is more residents downtown. That seems to be
happening, with a scramble by several apartment developers to get
projects going downtown. But those, and other efforts, including
the development of a light rail system, have brought cries of foul
from minorities, who claim they're being left out of the
discussions. (Coffee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SESURVEY-AUSTIN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ After years of bitter
confrontation that embroiled even the Texas legislature and the
state supreme court, environmentalists and business groups in
techie, music-loving Austin are making peace and, incredibly,
agreeing on growth agendas. Plenty of environmentalists still don't
trust developers and vice versa. But city officials who oversee
extra restrictive development laws have been successful pushing
high-tech companies to less environmentally sensitive areas, like
downtown. The restrictive laws also should protect Barton Springs,
a clear springs near downtown that is a basic symbol of Austin. It
is visited on field trips by school children and some people swim
in it during lunch. (Kempner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 38.

   SESURVEY-RALEIGH _ RALEIGH _ This hodgepodge of communities
strung together by I-40 and a world-renowned research campus
slammed into the messy side of growth almost overnight. Locals --
many of whom came from bigger cities -- like their home. But long
backups on I-40, Davis Drive and other byways have invaded living
patterns and work places. Traffic has replaced weather as the
conversation du jour. Now some techies turn down job possibilities
because of traffic. Scientists at Research Triangle Park times
their workouts on company treadmills to avoid evening rushhour and
RTP companies warn they may not be able to expand without traffic
improvements. Improvements are tough to come by. Each city in the
region has its own ideas on how to handle growth and RTP's
autonomous government authority only recently decided that the
problems are bad enough to get deeply involved in the issue.

   SESURVEY-POLLUTION _ In Atlanta, the risk to economic growth
from continued noncompliance with federal Clean Air Act standards
is real, unless the metro area moves toward compliance. How are
other areas, such as Charlotte, trying to avoid becoming the next
Atlanta in terms of pollution and congestion. (Ritzler, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.

   SESURVEY-TRAFFICJOBS _ ATLANTA _ Like thousands of Atlanta area
commuters, Cheryle Crumley dreads driving. She endures a 2 1/2 half
hour round-trip crawl on Georgia 400 to get to work at Emory
University. The round trip commute used to take just over an hour.
``It's horrendous,'' The Alpharetta resident said of her Ga. 400
trek, an ordeal she has been dealing with for six years. ``I fume.
By the time I get to work, I'm ready to murder a few people. It's
pretty stressful. And it's not going to get better until we have
some major lifestyle adjustments.'' Crumley isn't being flip. It's
her job as Emory's director of alternative transportation to find
ways to steer people out of Atlanta's vice-grip traffic. It's a
tough call. Atlanta's overtaxed odometers not only wreak an
emotional toll on individuals, but traffic congestion is costing
Atlanta employers $1 billion a year in lost worker productivity.

 &HT;    Complexity elevates message-rich, working-class Scottish tale
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   he Joe in ``My Name Is Joe'' is another of British director Ken
Loach's sturdy working-class blokes. Except that, most of the time,
this Joe (Peter Mullan) is out of work _ an ongoing social theme
for old-time lefty Loach. Joe is also a recovering alcoholic (hence
the film's title).
</P>
<P>
   In between whatever odd jobs he can scrape together, Joe, who
lives in a grimly poor section of Glasgow, Scotland, coaches a
ragtag soccer team. Through Liam (David McKay), one of his players,
he meets Sarah (Louise Goodhall), a good-hearted social worker. The
two start going out, tentatively feeling their way through a
relationship that calls for a lot of compromises on both parts.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looks as if the Alcoholics Anonymous way _ one
day at a time _ will work out for Joe. But the fragility of the
peace he's made with his past becomes achingly clear when, trying
to help the debt-ridden Liam, he's drawn into an ``arrangement''
with some local hoods.
</P>
<P>
   Mullan, who won the best actor prize last year at Cannes (he
accepted in kilts), smartly displays the fascinating contradictions
of this seemingly ``average'' Joe. He's a man capable of tenderness
and rage, of open-minded tolerance and closed-off stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   Loach's evocative direction is as genuine as the Scottish burrs
(so thick the film has been subtitled). He's as much a humanist as
he is a polemicist, so, for all his message-mongering, what stays
with us most is his gruff devotion to his characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Name Is Joe'' is a slight but affecting movie, in which
kitchen-sink realism and contrived melodrama comfortably co-exist.
It's also a film in which ``happily ever after'' is, was and always
will be a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Name Is Joe''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Peter Mullan. Directed by Ken Loach. Rated R for
language, drug use, some discreet sex and mild violence. At Tara. 1
hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Acting is the strong point in this tale of
blue-collar blues in working-class Glasgow.

 &HT;    Doing time is easy in `Life'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Funny how Eddie Murphy can pull off a movie. ``Trading Places''
wasn't much without his charming smile. ``48 HRS.'' was everything
because of his tactless bravura. ``The Nutty Professor'' got wacky
only because of Murphy's Silly Putty way with latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' is like all those. It's Eddie Murphy as we like him
best _ all gung-ho full of himself and pretty nearly winking at his
own jokes in a buddy movie with Martin Lawrence. Murphy is Ray and
Lawrence is Claude, two New York guys bickering through more than
60 years in a Mississippi prison after getting life sentences for a
murder they didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares whether the script works?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Life'' doesn't work on many levels. Its story arcs
are pat. More than a few of its jokes are borrowed; Murphy does one
bit with a watch that echoes Albert Brooks' much funnier ``nest
egg'' routine in ``Lost in America.'' The movie's timing is such
that the dialogue can be completely drowned out by an audience's
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   But laughter, of course, is the point, and ``Life'' has its fair
share even when many of the jokes are wrapped in a string of
expletives that few but David Mamet could match.
</P>
<P>
   As Claude, Lawrence is in top form early on in the movie's
pre-prison days, when he meets the smooth-talking knockout Sylvia
(Lisa Nicole Carson). As his face contorts in classic ``Martin''
style, he can't recall his own name.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is best as the pair age in jail and the latex is layered
on. His old Ray is an astonishingly perfect depiction that's even
more marvelous than the jokes he's spewing. It's easy to see these
two are having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   And when the movie starts to lag _ as it often does _ a quick
cameo emerges: Yes, that's ``punk-funk'' master Rick James as 1930s
gangster Spanky Johnson; that's Clarence Williams III as poker
shyster Winston Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   They, like Murphy, help pull it all off just by being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence. Directed by Ted
Demme. Rated R for language and sexual situations. At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 49 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Nobody's been this good at what is basically bad
prison humor since Burt Reynolds.

 &HT;    Double-crosses are twice the headache for `Lover'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After X and Y kill Z, they pay R to do the same to Q. But Y pays
R double to actually knock off X because he's secretly involved
with Q, who used to be with Z. And so on, and so on. As the
juiceless double-crosses pile up in ``Goodbye Lover,'' you realize
that what you're watching is less a modern film noir than an
algebra problem, with all its attendant excitement.
</P>
<P>
   A good noir _ even a tongue-in-cheek one, like this wants to be
_ has to ground its hairpin plot with real people. No such luck
here. The folks in this movie are as slickly remote as the lavish
set decor and cinematography. One player plots her dirty deeds
while singing to ``The Sound of Music''; that's the extent of the
script's notion of character development.
</P>
<P>
   Embroiled in a sex-death-and-insurance scam, the cast includes
Patricia Arquette, failing to breathe life into a standard-issue
femme fatale role; Dermot Mulroney and Don Johnson as her husband
and brother-in-law; and Mary-Louise Parker as a colleague at their
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Given his list of stodgy movies (``The Misson,'' ``Fat Man and
Little Boy,'' ``The Scarlet Letter''), you might not expect
director Roland Joffe to have the sneaky hand it takes for noir, or
the right touch for comedy. You'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   The broadest laughs come from the usually precise Ellen
DeGeneres. She steamrolls through the role of a caustic police
detective stuck with wink-wink sight gags that play on the comic's
real-life homosexuality. (She chomps down ruthlessly on phallic
corn dogs and cozies up to a female who's trussed up helpless in a
bed.) For the record, her earnest, out-of-his-element partner is
winningly played by former Atlantan Ray McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Lover''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney and Ellen DeGeneres.
Rated R for sexuality, language and violence. At metro theaters.

<P>
   1 hour, 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Goodbye, good riddance.

 &HT;    REVIEW
 &HT;    `The Eel' charts recluse's rebirth
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's not so surprising that emotionally stifled Yamashita
(Koji Yakusho of ``Shall We Dance'') likes nothing except talking
to his pet eel.
</P>
<P>
   Recently paroled from prison, he's trying to build a new life as
a barber in a small Japanese town. Having destroyed his previous
life through a bloody, jealousy-fueled crime, he doesn't really
trust other people. Or himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the seriocomic morality fable ``The Eel'' (winner of the
Golden Palm at last year's Cannes Film Festival), director Shohei
Imamura charts the rebirth of this recluse, whom his new neighbors
find either hopelessly weird or quietly romantic.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter camp is Keiko (Misa Shimizu), a young woman from
the city who's recovering from a bad relationship and a suicide
attempt. Quietly insinuating herself as an assistant in Yamashita's
barbershop, she discovers that finding the key to the man's sealed
heart isn't as easy as she had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the subtitles and the unfamiliar setting, ``The Eel'' is
a recognizable kind of movie, at least in the abstract. Filmmakers
love stories about redemption and second chances. One of
Hollywood's favorite plot lines concerns an overworked father who
has to learn to make time for family. Dustin Hoffman cooks
breakfast for his son in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (one of the better
examples of the subgenre), and Michael Keaton gets reincarnated as
a snowman in ``Jack Frost'' (one of the worst). Good or bad, these
are movies whose idea of redemption can safely fit inside a
sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eel'' is after something larger, but succeeds only
fitfully. Part of this has to do with its constantly changing tone.
While Keiko and Yamashita's roles are like Sonia and Raskolnikov's
in ``Crime and Punishment'' (pure-hearted but worldly woman stands
by her bloodstained man), ``The Eel'' is somber one moment, giddy
the next. The characters include a young man who builds landing
pads for UFOs, and Keiko's ``colorfully'' insane mother, who likes
to dance the flamenco. The movie tries to camouflage its
conventional story line with comic digressions and doses of surreal
imagery and symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the mix keeps you engaged moment by moment. But
as a result, ``The Eel'' feels fragmentary, made of disparate
pieces instead of being one coherent work. Still, when you least
expect it, it reels you in with the director's offhand mastery,
including an extended, claustrophobic brawl scene in the
barbershop; it captures the buffoonery as well as the quicksilver,
irreversible violence that can happen in a fight. In other words,
it's an emblematic scene of the film's unique tone of slapstick
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eel''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Koji Yakusho and Misa Shimizu. Directed by Shohei
Imamura. Unrated, but contains nudity, bloody violence and
simulated sex. At Lefont Plaza. 1 hour, 57 minutes. In Japanese
with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An uneven Japanese tale of redemption, veering
between melodrama and slapstick.

`GOODBYE LOVER': THE HILLS ARE ALIVE, BUT, ALAS, BEN'S DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Easily the most bizarre creation of ``Goodbye Lover,'' a
comically tinged film noir whose characters appear to be
re-invented with each hairpin turn of its preposterous plot, is
Sandra Dunmore (Patricia Arquette), a scheming femme fatale who
spends nearly every waking minute listening to and singing along
with the soundtrack of ``The Sound of Music.'' As the movie opens,
Sandra is a Los Angeles real-estate agent married to Jake (Dermot
Mulroney), a sullen public relations executive with a major
substance abuse problem. At the same time, Sandra is secretly
carrying on an affair with Jake's older brother, Ben (Don Johnson),
whom she likes to handcuff to the furniture of her clients' fancy
homes while they're out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   In its opening scenes ``Goodbye Lover,'' directed by Roland
Joffe from a story by Ron Peer, holds out the prospect of a juicy
immersion in high-toned Los Angeles sleaze. But once the thud of
its wooden dialogue has settled into a deadly mechanical clomp _
about 10 minutes into the film _ you wonder why this risible movie
didn't go straight to video.
</P>
<P>
   The reason it didn't probably has to do with the number of stars
in the cast. Besides Ms. Arquette, Mulroney and Johnson,
Mary-Louise Parker appears as Jake's perky (but scheming) corporate
sidekick, Peggy. Ellen DeGeneres shows up as a cynical police
detective assigned to investigate Ben's fatal tumble from the patio
of Jake's high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of having a homicidal vixen attracted to music that's
synonymous with icky sweetness and light may be good for one ironic
wink. But it's symptomatic of a movie whose dialogue bears only a
distant resemblance to the way people really talk that it runs its
``Sound of Music'' gimmick into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest thing about ``Goodbye Lover'' is seeing how far the
director of ``The Killing Fields'' and ``The Mission'' has fallen.
As ham-handed as the screenplay, Joffe's direction resorts to such
clumsily desperate measures as extreme close-ups of lips, bizarre
camera angles for love scenes and pointless April Fool's tricks of
fantasy and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Following her somnambulistic turn in ``The Hi-Lo Country,'' Ms.
Arquette's inert performance in ``Goodbye Lover'' raises the
question of how any director could equate the blank, expressionless
passivity of her screen presence and colorless baby-doll voice with
fatal attraction. In both films, Ms. Arquette exudes all the erotic
energy of an inflatable doll with a taped voice muttering
potty-mouthed come-ons. &QL;

   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile. (SM) 1 hour, 46
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner,
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol, Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the toddler
leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94 minutes
chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of Bob Clark.
At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets dumber. (Bob
Longino) 94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookie's Fortune'' PG-13 (sexually suggestive scenes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Glenn Close,
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler
</P>
<P>
   and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   This Southern gothic shaggy-dog story goes down as sweet and
smooth as a double shot of Jack Black. Glenn Close, Julianne Moore,
Charles S. Dutton, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Ned Beatty and Lyle
Lovett are among those involved in the unexpected death of a gently
demented Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal.) A mellow Robert Altman
directs this magnolia-scented whimsy with affection and compassion.
(ERG) 2 hours. B+

   ``Cruel Intentions'' R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar,
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 37
minutes. C+

<P>
   McHugh, Fred Newman,
</P>
<P>
   Constance Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Nickelodeon series on which it's based, this movie's
appeal is centered in the carefully nurtured normalcy of its title
character, Doug Funnie, a nice kid coping with some typical preteen
passions. The gently anarchic, pro-environment plot is simply a
framework to dispense the quiet main-street morals and vivid
comic-book colors that make the wholesome Doug a superstar with
children. (Tom Sabulis) 1 hour, 17 minutes. B-

   ``EDtv'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity, sex-related
situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey plays the subject of a 24-hour-a-day
documentary in Ron Howard's new comedy. Yeah, it's too much like
``Truman Show'' for its own good, but the slick packaging and
strong cast (including Jenna Elfman, Ellen DeGeneres and Martin
Landau) help it stand on its own. (SM) At metro theaters. 2 hours,
3 minutes. B+

   This Cannes Film Festival award winner tells the story of a

bloody crime. It's an engaging but uneven mix of comedy and
melodrama. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes. In Japanese with subtitles. B -

 &HT;    RENO LISTS STEPS TO INCREASE TRUST OF POLICE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno outlined a series of
steps Thursday to restore trust between citizens and law
enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments, in a speech to the National Press Club, came
against a backdrop of questionable police-related killings around
the country and complaints about the use of racial profiling in
routine traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person should be subject to unreasonable force,'' Reno
said. ``No person should be targeted by law enforcement based on
the color of his or her skin. Equal justice under law must mean the
same thing to minority communities as it means to the nation as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged there is a perception, particularly among
minorities, that police have abused their power _ often targeting
minorities for unreasonable stops and searches _ in an effort to
reduce crime.
</P>
<P>
   Reno announced that the U.S. Justice Department would convene a
conference among law enforcement leaders and community
representatives, including young people, to discuss the issue of
police contact with the public.
</P>
<P>
   She also announced that for the first time, the Justice
Department's annual survey to determine whether people have been
the victims of crimes will ask whether they have been victims of
police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   While not specifically endorsing a bill that would require
police to list race on forms detailing traffic stops, Reno said she
supported the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``By keeping track by race of who is pulled over, why they were
stopped, which motorists are subjected to searches and the outcomes
of the stops, we can see where the problems exist and how extensive
they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also called for more community policing, greater police
accountability, expanded recruitment of minority officers,
increased civil rights enforcement by her department against police
misconduct, and better data collection in cases of police contact
with the public.

LAWRENCE AND MURPHY LET ``LIFE'' PASS BY IN AN AGREEABLE WAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Banks and Ray Gibson started 1932 as comfortable citizens
of Harlem. They finished the year as residents of Mississippi,
bustin' rocks for life on a chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy to make such a mess of their lives; Claude and
Ray worked hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Life,'' an agreeable, surprisingly low-key prison comedy
with touches of predictable drama, Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy
are Claude and Ray, two fellows paying a stiff price for being too
smart for their own good. And for being in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, a happy-go-lucky pickpocket, and Claude, a bank clerk, get
together because they both owe money to a Harlem racketeer. To pay
their debts, they go to Mississippi _ bickering all the way _ to
pick up a shipment of illegal hooch.
</P>
<P>
   Used to Harlem life, they don't expect the prejudice and
injustice down South. They sashay casually into a small-town cafe
and ask for pie. They get lots of dirty looks from the local
rednecks, but no pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are white-folks' pies,'' a suddenly alert Ray tells
Claude. Claude is incensed.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Claude and Ray are framed for murder. Faster than
they can say ``railroaded,'' they are changed from Claude and Ray
to prisoners Nos. 4316 and 4317, cheap and expendable labor for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 90 minutes or so, almost the entire movie, we
watch Ray and Claude spend 60 years arguing, escaping, plotting to
escape, learning to avoid trouble from bigger prisoners and racist
guards and growing old. Much of the time the film shoots for
laughs, and gets its fair share. Other times it aims for a
pedestrian poignance, i.e., an ashamed gay prisoner who can't face
parole after so many years intentionally gets himself shot rather
than go back to his family.
</P>
<P>
   The movie plays off any number of scenes familiar from a host of
chain-gang movies, the most obvious a fight scene that closely
mimics the Paul Newman-George Kennedy beating from ``Cool Hand
Luke,'' with Murphy as Newman.
</P>
<P>
   We don't go to this movie expecting originality or surprise. (If
you don't guess the ending in the first minute of the movie, you
just aren't trying). But it has such an unassuming style that it's
not hard to forgive its obviousness.
</P>
<P>
   The racism is played matter-of-factly. Consider that Murphy is
popular with both black and white audiences, and the movie is made
by white filmmakers, director Ted Demme (``Beautiful Girls'') and
producer Brian Grazier (``Apollo 13'').
</P>
<P>
   The film co-stars Bookeem Woodbine, Brent Jennings and Ned
Beatty. There's no sex, and violence is minimal, but the strong
language is not. The credits include muffed outtakes, so stick
around. &QL; 
Life &QL; 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence &QL; 
Now showing: at area theaters &QL; 
Rated: R for strong language and a shooting &QL;

   LONDON _ NATO's bomb hit a farm compound. But why were the
refugees in a walled ``compound'' to start with?
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo Albanians have always lived in farms with high walls and
large wooden gates, sealed off from the outside world. When you
travelled across Kosovo you could often tell the nationality of the
owner by whether the house was open or shut off.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for these huge medieval-looking stockades is that
rural Albanians live in extended families, so they need a lot of
space. Another is Muslim conservatism; rural Kosovars do not like
their wives and daughters to be seen by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Again, for Kosovo Albanians, the outside world in the form of
the Serbian police and authorities has always been a hostile force,
so the Kosovars feel safer behind their high walls.
</P>
<P>
   Have Albanians always lived in Kosovo? Serbs and Albanians argue
over which community first settled Kosovo, but there is no doubt
that it was mainly Serb in the Middle Ages when their princes built
many monastaries there.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians became the majority under the five-century-long
rule of the Ottomans, which lasted until 1912, when Serbia retook
the province in the First Balkan War.
</P>
<P>
   From then until the 1930s the Serbs tried to resettle the
province but the experiment collapsed in the Second World War and
Marshal Tito, Yugoslavia's leader, forbade the prewar colonists to
return.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Albanians settled in Kosovo from Albania proper
after the war, the real reason for the steep rise in the Albanian
population was their birthrate, the highest in Europe. &QL;

 HUMBLE PLAYGROUND MAY BE NAMED FOR DiMAGGIO  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco supervisor has sent Joe
DiMaggio's lawyer 10 ideas for honoring the Yankee Clipper, who
died last month. The most likely site here to be renamed for the
famed slugger, who made San Francisco his adopted hometown, is the
North Beach Playground.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to get formal approval from the DiMaggio's
lawyer, Morris Engleberg of Hollywood, Fla., Supervisor Gavin
Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally made a breakthrough and got in touch with Morris
Engelberg, who's representing the family, and he asked us to fax
along ideas,'' Newsom said. ``We've done that. We sent him 10
recommendations from over 1,000 we received.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them was the idea of renaming North Beach Playground, the
somewhat scruffy sandlot in the center of the neighborhood where
DiMaggio grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw that one as favorable in light of the connection with
kids and youth, which was a passion of DiMaggio's,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said the North Beach Playground was actually the public's
second choice behind Pacific Bell Park, the new San Francisco
Giants ballpark scheduled to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not a realistic option,'' he said. ``It's a $40
million hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also high on the list were renaming a street, but Newsom said he
and other supervisors wanted to avoid the predictable controversy
that renaming a street would bring.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg has said that DiMaggio would not want anything named
in his honor to replace something already named for someone else.
That nixed the idea of attaching his name to Moscone Field, where
DiMaggio and his brothers Dom and Vince often played baseball as
youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to create a legacy of discontent,'' Newsom said.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor, who once was a neighbor of the Hall of Fame
center fielder and American icon, had thought initially of renaming
North Beach Playground, but scratched the site when he learned it
had no grass and wasn't a recreational park.
</P>
<P>
   But with the DiMaggio family's blessing, Newsom decided the site
was fine. DiMaggio also played there as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said once he got the go-ahead from DiMaggio's lawyer, he
would consult with his board colleagues and the mayor and then
propose legislation to rename the playground after DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said private money would be used to improve the field.
</P>
<P>
   Although DiMaggio was born in Martinez, Calif., he grew up in
San Francisco, attended the city's schools and played for the San
Francisco Seals before joining the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   He became known as the Yankee Clipper by adoring fans, who
continued to be enamored of DiMaggio after he retired from baseball
because of his quiet dignity and a brief but highly celebrated
marriage to actress Marilyn Monroe.

   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But we saw other dark and terrible things on the road between
Djakovica and Prizren Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of terrified Kosovo Albanians, women and children and
old men, peering from behind black curtains as they were driven
east; row after row of burned out houses, some of them still
burning, a few just set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   And several of the dead along the road appeared to have been
attacked by machine-gun fire. Is NATO strafing the roads of
southern Kosovo as well as bombing them?
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say that 74 Albanian refugees were massacred on this
road on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   I counted 20 corpses _ or parts of bodies in three bombing
locations along a 12-mile stretch of highway and in the mortuary at
Prizren where a half-naked woman and a tiny girl covered in blood
lay on the floor partly covered in shrouds.
</P>
<P>
   Esmet Sulja, whose sister-in-law was in the mortuary, told
journalists brought here by Serb officials that he came from the
Kosovo village of Malitce and was told to move ``for his own
safety'' three weeks ago to Dobros.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he says he was driving his tractor containing 35
people in the trailer from Djakovica to Prizren when planes began
dropping bombs around him. The 46-year-old man, who had lacerations
on his face as he lay in a hospital bed, told us five of the
passengers had been killed in the trailer .
</P>
<P>
   There were terrible scenes along the road, for the Serbs had
left many of the bodies where they were found.
</P>
<P>
   A grey-haired old man lay cut in half in a tree, six corpses
including that of a very young woman lay in brightly colored
clothes in a field where they had been dragged after the air raid.
</P>
<P>
   I found a human head 50 meters (165 feet) away and skeletons
burned out in the back of another trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The munitions parked along the road bore several American
markings. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the world exploded in
front of him and Asmani's family disappeared before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there was a big blast, and I started running,'' said
Asmani, leaning on his walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, `my God, NATO is bombing us.' I ran
through the field like a mouse. I'm ashamed, but I'm too old to lie
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What is without doubt is that NATO planes bombed the very
refugees they were trying to help _ people like Asmani. NATO called
it a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy began just after midday on Wednesday when an attack
team of American F-16 strike aircraft, armed with laser-guided
bombs, took off from their base at Aviano, in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to fly over southwest Kosovo, specifically
over towns where Serb MUP (interior ministry) police _ those
responsible for the past month's ethnic cleansing _ had been
spotted, and over areas known to be ``strategic supply routes'' for
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at 15,000 ft. _ out of reach of antiaircraft artillery
and handheld surface-to-air missiles _ the pilot in the lead
aircraft was passing over open country between the village of
Decani and the town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of the single-seater aircraft the ground
beneath him was dotted with villages that had been set on fire.
Three, four, he counted, all recently set alight and still burning
and all, he presumed, the work of the MUP.
</P>
<P>
   Then, passing over a dirt road that linked the two settlements,
he saw movement on the ground. Looking closer he saw what he
thought was a 60-vehicle convoy of vehicles. At the front of the
convoy were three green trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I saw) three uniformly shaped dark green vehicles, look(ed)
like deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot
recalled, speaking on a tape played to reporters Thursday by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come (sic) to a stop at the next house down the road. I
am convinced now that that's (army and police) forces working their
way down toward Djakovica.''
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that he had identified the same forces who had been
setting fire to the villages, the pilot decided to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go (sic) in, put my system on the lead vehicle and execute a
laser-guided bomb attack on that vehicle, destroying the lead
vehicle,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that he was running low of fuel, the pilot and his
wingman _ the second pilot in the flight, who was marking the
target with a laser for the bomber _ pulled away. He passed on the
map coordinates of the target to the next ``flight,'' or squad, of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In turn this next flight spotted another three vehicles in a
compound beside the dirt track. Using the same laser-guided
weapons, this team then moved in to destroy these targets, dropping
three bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon another team of F-16 bombers attacked a
separate military convoy. These were spotted on a road bridge east
of Djakovica. There was no information about civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This is NATO's account of events. But Belgrade's version of
events is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the Serbs say there was no military convoy in the
area around Djakovica on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what NATO took to be military targets were two convoys
of refugees, separated by around 15 miles. And they were not
heading towards Albania, but were travelling back into Kosovo from
the border crossings at Cafta Prusit and Vrbnica.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs claim the first convoy to be hit was a procession of
1,000 people and 100 vehicles _ tractors and private cars _ struck
by three bombs as it passed the village of Maja, close to
Djakovica. They say 64 people were killed and another 20 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, they say NATO aircraft struck a second convoy, this
one a line of 600 people travelling on the same road but in the
village of Zrze, 15 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   While this may have been the second of NATO's targets, Belgrade
insists there were no military vehicles, just refugees' tractors
and trailers. They said another 44 people were killed at Zrze and
dozens more injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This was) a horrendous massacre'' claimed the Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic. ``This cannot be explained as an error
when the columns of refugees were bombed four times _ this was done
deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a massacre of Albanian refugees who were returning to
their homes in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   What can we know for sure? We know that innocent refugees were
killed on Wednesday by bombs dropped from NATO planes. We know that
they were desperate, exhausted people who had probably been on the
move for weeks, their only possessions the little they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   We can presume that they were not deliberately targeted by NATO
_ the political fallout from this ``accident'' will be bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   We must question Pentagon and NATO suggestions that Yugoslav MiG
fighters attacked the columns. Experts point out that NATO would
have spotted and shot down any Serb planes.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the refugees themselves would not have been able to
identify whether they were Serb or NATO planes. They simply talk of
being attacked from the air, of the ground exploding in front of
them, and of shattered bodies and twisted machinery.
</P>
<P>
   They talk of a horror that has become ingrained on their
memories. &QL;

<P>
   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the world exploded in
front of him and Asmani's family disappeared before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there was a big blast, and I started running,'' said
Asmani, leaning on his walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, `my God, NATO is bombing us.' I ran
through the field like a mouse. I'm ashamed, but I'm too old to lie
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   What is without doubt is that NATO planes bombed the very
refugees they were trying to help _ people like Asmani. NATO called
it a tragic accident.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy began just after midday on Wednesday when an attack
team of American F-16 strike aircraft, armed with laser-guided
bombs, took off from their base at Aviano, in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to fly over southwest Kosovo, specifically
over towns where Serb MUP (interior ministry) police _ those
responsible for the past month's ethnic cleansing _ had been
spotted, and over areas known to be ``strategic supply routes'' for
the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   Flying at 15,000 ft. _ out of reach of antiaircraft artillery
and handheld surface-to-air missiles _ the pilot in the lead
aircraft was passing over open country between the village of
Decani and the town of Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of the single-seater aircraft the ground
beneath him was dotted with villages that had been set on fire.
Three, four, he counted, all recently set alight and still burning
and all, he presumed, the work of the MUP.
</P>
<P>
   Then, passing over a dirt road that linked the two settlements,
he saw movement on the ground. Looking closer he saw what he
thought was a 60-vehicle convoy of vehicles. At the front of the
convoy were three green trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I saw) three uniformly shaped dark green vehicles, look(ed)

recalled, speaking on a tape played to reporters Thursday by NATO.

BOBBY MCFERRIN'S HAPPY AS A CLASSICAL CONDUCTOR AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ He's a conductor, classical composer, pops
composer, jazz vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   Is there one word to sum it all up?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a singer,'' Bobby McFerrin answers without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   McFerrin, 49, appears with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra this
weekend in performances sponsored by the Fort Worth Symphony
Orchestra Association at Bass Performance Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's been a classical star for years as both singer and
conductor, McFerrin is still remembered by many fans for a song
that's more than 10 years old _ the calypso-flavored novelty hit
``Don't Worry, Be Happy.'' (It didn't hurt _ or help, depending on
your perspective _ that the video co-starred a goofy Robin Williams
and stayed in music-channel rotation for years.)
</P>
<P>
   But here, McFerrin will conduct two of the keystones of the
symphonic repertoire, Beethoven's Symphony No. 2 and Prokofiev's
Symphony No. 1. He'll also perform as an improvisatory jazz
vocalist, first with two members of the orchestra, then by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The son of baritone Robert McFerrin, who, in 1955, became the
first male African-American singer at the Metropolitan Opera, Bobby
McFerrin received early training in music at the Juilliard School.
He learned singing around the house while growing up, watching his
father appear in recitals and operas and singing himself in church
and school choirs.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike his father, ``I didn't have operatic aspirations,''
McFerrin admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm half self-taught, and half schooled,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his impeccable classical training and connections
with the jazz mainstream, he came under the influence of
traditional African music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the African sound,'' he says. ``The simplicity, the
brevity. Music, livelihood, spiritual sense of self is all one.''
</P>
<P>
   McFerrin returned to his classical roots as a guest conductor
with the San Francisco Symphony in 1990; he conducted works of
Beethoven, Copland and Vivaldi with the Fort Worth Symphony Pops in
1992; and he was appointed ``creative chair'' for the Saint Paul
Chamber Orchestra in 1994. He lives in Minnesota with his wife,
Debra, and three children, ages 7, 13 and 17 _ all three of whom
are musical, he says. In Saint Paul, he is deeply involved in
educational programs and as conductor of regional and national
tours of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   By any standards, McFerrin has the most convincing crossover
credentials in an age when more artists than ever are climbing the
fence between the classical and popular fields. Few have had his
level of success as a popular artist ``and'' his level of ongoing
association with classical ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   He's now adding another credential with an opera he's writing
for the San Francisco Opera. The libretto, by Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner, explores the relationship
between an African-American woman and a Jewish boy; originally
scheduled for performance in 1997, it was postponed temporarily
when McFerrin's conducting career heated up more than anticipated
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   When he names his heroes, McFerrin includes his father, jazz
pianist Keith Jarrett (also known for his recordings of keyboard
works of Shostakovich and J.S. Bach), the jazz ensemble Weather
Report _ and Picasso, Charlie Chaplin and Fred Astaire. The common
thread of the last three, of course, is also easily recognizable in
McFerrin: the sense of playfulness and joy in what they are doing.

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever

<P>
   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.

<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ When NATO attacked the Belgrade suburb of Banjica
Tuesday, its third bomb blasted shards of glass into Dragana
Kristic's neck. The target had been a barracks 50 meters (165 feet)
away.
</P>
<P>
   So that obscene old cliche ``collateral damage'' comes to mind _
but for one thing. Dragana was lying in a hospital bed when she was
wounded, recovering from a cancer operation which surgeons had
performed only a few hours earlier. They had taken a
four-and-a-half kilo (ten pound) tumor from her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't the only victim. The bombs had vibrated through the
entire Military Medical Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The medical staff have hung a large red cross from the roof of
their hospital and a smaller red cross flag to the side of the vast
18-year old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombs were only 50 meters away; was that worth the risk to
this hospital?'' Dr. Nenad Markovic asked.
</P>
<P>
   His question was a moral one. True, this hospital is a military
institution. True, there are soldiers as well as civilians among
the patients. But wounded soldiers in field hospitals are supposed
to be safe from attack under the rules of war, as well as
civilians... &QL;

   BELGRADE _ Blood is beginning to splatter NATO's campaign in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Just under two weeks ago, it was the blood of 26 Serb civilians
in the town of Aleksinac. Then on Monday, it was the blood of 27
Serb passengers _ the latest figure for fatalities _ on a railway
train bombed by a NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, up to 60 Kosovo Albanian refugees were reported torn
to pieces by NATO bombs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That phrase ``collateral damage'' is beginning to sound ever
more than obscene...
</P>
<P>
   Unless it examines its own morality, NATO is now in danger of
looking like just another killer in the Balkans war. &QL;

   Eighty-year-old Dibran Asmani had been on the road for three
days in Kosovo, edging ever closer to the Albanian border he hoped
would offer safety. Instead, early on Wednesday afternoon, the
world exploded in front of him and Asmani's family disappeared
before his eyes.

   More than 36 hours after one of more convoys of Kosovan refugees
was hit by bombs dropped by NATO planes, details are only slowly
emerging as to what exactly happened between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. on a
road near Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of a lack of facts, or because there is mileage
to be made peddling disinformation, at least two versions of what
happened have emerged... &QL;

<P>
   TEVZICKI MOST, KOSOVO _ This is a horror story. There are no
other words for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of a series of massacres along a road lined with
torched houses and cherry blossoms, of smoldering skeletons and
women cut in half, of a man's head lying in a field with the wind
blowing his brown hair against the grass, and of corpses lying in a
squalid hospital nearby.
</P>
<P>
   NATO did all this, say the Serbs, and it is true that U.S.
munitions litter the road and fields around here, sometimes within
a few inches of corpses, body parts, human bones, smashed tractors
and trailers, their pathetic contents of old clothes, pots and
family snapshots lying around them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there were air strikes here. And NATO appears to be
responsible for an atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   But we saw other dark and terrible things on the road between
Djakovica and Prizren Thursday afternoon... &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Even in war, the first casualty, just occasionally, need not be
the truth. Sometimes indeed there is no alternative to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson of NATO's bombing of the Serb train on
Monday in which 10 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   And now with NATO's admission that allied planes were mistakenly
responsible for Wednesday's far deadlier attack on a refugee convoy
in southern Kosovo, the lesson is even more bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In this war, as every war in history, propaganda is a vital
weapon. It is vital for the Western democracies, where prosecution
of the conflict ultimately depends on public opinion _ but it is
also vital for Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   By fast public-relations footwork, NATO has neutralized the
train disaster. The slaughter of refugees, in which the Serbs claim
up to 70 ethnic Albanians were killed, will be far harder to cope
with... &QL;

   The relationship that embodies those strains is a love affair
that develops between May (Charlie Hardwick) and Roy (Bill Speed),
two proud working-class Britons now in their 50s. May was once a
fiery activist in the 1984-85 miners strike. Roy manages a nearby
private open-cast mine run by a development company with plans to
revitalize the region.
</P>
<P>
   May has two bitter teen-age children looking for a foothold in a
community that disintegrated after the British government closed
the local mine and left the town in economic ruins. By falling in
love with Roy, May, who is having severe physical problems
connected with menopause, is, in effect, sleeping with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two are on opposite sides of a political divide, the
movie also shows them to be soul mates who share a salty humor and
a fondness for the same 1950s show tunes.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet May's estranged alcoholic husband, Tony (Brian
Hogg), a shattered former coal miner who lives by himself in a
shack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scar'' is a high point of the new series ``Changing the
Guard,'' a survey of recent British films (11 features and 5
shorts) presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, that
begins screenings today at the Walter Reade Theater.
</P>
<P>
   In its naturalism, ``The Scar'' looks back four decades to
England's ``kitchen sink'' realism in which a new generation of
filmmakers, rejecting the upper-class gentility and patriotic gloss
of writers like Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan, turned their
attention to the postwar despair of the working class.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a crucial difference between the social outlook of a
movie like ``The Scar'' and the work of the ``angry young men'' of
the 1950s and 60s. Where the angry young Britons gazing into a
stagnant industrialized landscape saw only the oppression and
hopelessness of the economically pinched British welfare state, the
new British films acknowledge the social and economic dynamism of
post-Thatcherite England.
</P>
<P>
   True, the agents of that change might be coldly cynical
developers like the ones who appear briefly in ``The Scar,'' but
there is still no denying that the country is on the move.
</P>
<P>
   That movement and sense of possibility are palpable in
``Trainspotting'' and ``The Full Monty,'' the two hits that
signaled the new exuberance of British films. ``Trainspotting,'' in
sharp contrast to the sober black-and-white semidocumentary feel of
``kitchen sink'' movies, uses tricky editing and flashy
cinematography to express its characters' frisky mood, and the old
working-class despair has been replaced by a spirit of reckless
high adventure.
</P>
<P>
   If many of those characters come to bad ends, their misfortunes
aren't automatically attributed to the system. ``The Full Monty''
also ends on an irrationally happy note. If the movie's unemployed
steelworkers-turned-male strippers have shed some of their
inhibitions, they haven't solved their long-term economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited sense of adventure informs many of the films in the
series, four of which (including ``The Scar'') had screenings for
the press. In Antonia Bird's ``Face,'' a genre film demonstrating
that old saw about there being no honor among thieves, a gang of
five pull off a daring robbery that yields far less cash than they
had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first in a series of disappointments and betrayals
that ultimately leave the group's leader, Ray, (Robert Carlyle), a
latter-day Robin Hood in his own mind, isolated and disillusioned.
For all its obvious bleakness, ``Face,'' like the recent British
film ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' brims with a maniacal
energy that is far from despairing.
</P>
<P>
   David Yates' film ``The Tichborne Claimant'' is based on the
true story of a wealthy young Englishman of Victorian times who
disappeared and was presumed drowned while sailing around the
world. The family sends an African manservant, Andrew Bogle, to
Australia to look for him. Once in Australia Bogle persuades a
bogus claimant to pose as the missing heir, instructs him on
English manners and the family ways, and brings him back to England
when he's been thoroughly tutored.
</P>
<P>
   The reappearance culminates in a notorious lawsuit. By the end
of the movie, it's no longer clear whether the claimant is an
impostor. More than an entertaining historical drama, the movie is
a subversive allegory about the British class system in which the
aristocrats are every bit as boorish and crude as the loutish
claimant who is played with robust vigor by Robert Pugh.
</P>
<P>
   The most aristocratic of all, if refined manners and grace are
true indications of class, is the impeccably polite and
well-dressed African played by John Kani with an air of perfectly
refined reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is Andrew Kotting's ``Gallivant,'' a documentary
film diary that follows the director's 85-year-old grandmother and
his 7-year-old daughter (who suffers from a brain disorder and can
only communicate through sign language) on a three-month trip
around the British coastline. The jolly, scenic documentary uses
every cinematic trick in the book _ especially speeded-up sequences
_ to create a boundary-breaking sense of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated into the film are scores of spur-of-the-moment
interviews with farmers, fishermen, dockworkers and other everyday
people. The result is an intriguing group portrait of Britons of
every age and occupation who have little in common with the popular
image of Britain, which in many minds is synonymous with London.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying theme binding these wildly disparate films is the
British class system. In one way or another, many of the films in
the festival evoke resistance to the established status quo. That
resistance may involve extreme growing pains, as in ``The Scar,''
or it may simply be the cheery indifference to class and upward
mobility that are found again and again in ``Gallivant.'' In any
case, that old rust-stained, leaky kitchen sink has been
renovated. &QL;

`HIDEOUS KINKY': LIVE WITH MOTHER: ERRATIC, TO SAY THE LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kate Winslet knew best when she took on the offbeat adventure of
``Hideous Kinky'' after the outsized travails of making
``Titanic.'' She knew, among other things, that the central role in
Gillies MacKinnon's voluptuously exotic new film would offer any
actress a field day, and indeed she makes the most of its rich
possibilities. The time is 1972, the setting is Morocco and the
heroine is a young mother seeking a path to enlightenment no matter
where that path leads her two young daughters. As such, ``Hideous
Kinky'' belongs to the striking sub-genre in which it is the
baby-boom adults, not their children, who most need to come of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hideous Kinky'' is based on a novel by Esther Freud,
granddaughter of Sigmund and daughter of the painter Lucian, that
unfolds from one daughter's point of view. It's clear from this
enticingly atmospheric book that the author has lived through at
least some version of what she describes. Her story begins after
Julia (Ms. Winslet) has taken her daughters, Lucy (Carrie Mullan)
and Bea (Bella Riza), from London to North Africa without making
any particular allowance for their fears or desires in this
dazzling new home. The story perfectly captures Julia as a
well-meaning mother who has no notion that she need be anything but
self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon, always an interesting director whose credits include
the overlooked ``Regeneration,'' brings an even more intoxicating
sense of place to this film than he did to Ireland with ``The
Playboys.'' The colors and music of the Moroccan setting are so
enveloping (and so appealingly photographed by John de Borman) that
the film creates a sensual identity that reaches beyond its
storytelling. As with ``The Sheltering Sky'' and ``The English
Patient,'' the atmosphere is an overwhelmingly strong aspect of the
audience's experience, and the characters' way of penetrating that
atmosphere creates its own momentum. At the same time, the three
actresses here are so credible and earnest that the family's story
never recedes into its mesmerizing background.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most evocative aspects of ``Hideous Kinky'' (which
takes its title from the little girls' two favorite words) is its
authentic anything-goes spirit. It summons the kind of hippie
odyssey not compromised by any actual plans. So Julia arrives in
Marrakesh without any notion of how she will live, except on
support checks from a very distant husband who soon forgets the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Though her only clear goal is to visit the Algerian temple of an
esteemed Sufi, Julia makes ends meet in ways that send Bea, the
elder daughter, in search of stability. Neither child knows what to
make of their mother's romance with Bilal (Said Taghmaoui), a
street acrobat who is as indigent as she is. There's a direct link
between Julia and Bilal's openly passionate affair and Bea's
increasing yen for a school uniform to wear and textbooks to carry.
</P>
<P>
   With a style as warm and headstrong as Ms. Winslet's Julia is
herself, the film embarks on vivid side trips, as when it visits
Bilal's village and makes the uncomfortable discovery that he has a
wife. And it becomes an insightful look at what each of the various
characters need from one another. Ms. Winslet movingly captures
Julia in all her obliviousness and optimism, then watches how she
awakens in ways she least expected. If she fails to arrive at
enlightenment through familiar hippie means, she learns a lot of
other things along the way. &QL;

arrest also jeopardizes Strawberry's overall status as a major

substance-abuse problems and was previously suspended by baseball
for testing positive for cocaine. By Buster Olney.

`FRIENDS AND LOVERS': SKI WEEKEND: IT'S VERY WARM IN THE LODGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only glimmer of humor to be salvaged from ``Friends and
Lovers,'' an inept farce with the mentality of a tittering
15-year-old boy peering under the bedcovers with a flashlight,
emanates from Robert Downey Jr.'s clownish portrayal of Hans, a
bogus German ski instructor. During a Christmas weekend in Park
City, Utah, Hans successfully lures Carla (Claudia Schiffer), a
dim-witted aspiring model, from the clutches of her Neanderthal
suitor, Jon (Stephen Baldwin), by teaching her how to meditate.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons involve plenty of lascivious hands-on physical
contact. Downey, his hair blasted into a two-toned Don King-style
flare, adopts a German accent worthy of Peter Sellers at his
zaniest to play this lecherous impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Hans may be a louse, but he's certainly an improvement over Jon,
a leering boor given to loudly spouting his pet mathematical
theories about the size of female body parts. Many of the
characters in ``Friends and Lovers'' are so obsessed with the
dimensions of human erogenous zones that you soon wish they had all
been given tape measures ahead of time so they could strip and get
it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends and Lovers'' might make some comedic sense if these
people were still in their teens, but they're yuppies in their 20s.
Their destination is the comfy lodge of Richard (David Rasche), the
father of Ian (George Newbern), the whiniest of the group. Also on
hand are Jane (Suzanne Cryer), who is pregnant but refuses to name
the father; David (Danny Nucci) who's gay and a virgin; Lisa
(Alison Eastwood), and Keaton (Neill Barry). By the end of the
weekend nearly everyone has been paired off. And Richard and Ian,
who have been estranged, have come to terms in a grotesquely
mawkish father-son confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by George Haas, ``Friends and Lovers''
plays on the screen like an interminable, unedited test script for
an imitation of the television series ``Friends.'' As both a writer
and director Haas has so little feel for comedy that he is
completely reliant on the actors to find the clown inside their
characters. Only Downey delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the film's ineptitude is a running joke in which
Richard's attempts at cooking result in various kitchen mishaps.
You would think that the director could find some way to give such
stock bits as an exploding microwave or a mishandled coffee machine
a new comic twist, but he hasn't a clue. &QL;

SENATOR SAYS HE WON'T VOTE FOR WAR RESOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles Schumer, New York's junior senator, said
Thursday he would oppose a congressional measure to escalate the
conflict in Yugoslavia, stressing that he is against launching a
ground invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not support that at this point,'' said Schumer, a
Democrat who had voted in favor of the NATO bombardment that began
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is leading a push to adopt a
resolution authorizing the president to use whatever means
necessary to complete the Kosovo mission, including combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a presidential hopeful, said in a recent speech that
NATO had to begin ``fighting this war as if it were a war with huge
stakes involved, instead of some strange interlude between peace
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To that end we should commence today to mobilize infantry and
armored divisions for a ground war in Kosovo,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer isn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never say never, but I would need a lot of persuading''
before committing soldiers, he said. ``The adjective to describe my
attitude would be `dubious.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Loss of American lives is a terrible thing. I am willing to
countenance some of that if we are going to change things
structurally'' in Kosovo, said Schumer, adding he was doubtful
bitter rivalries between ethnic Serbs and Albanians would be
eliminated by a ground-force intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In recent meetings with senior Clinton administration officials,
including National Security Adviser Samuel Berger, Schumer said the
most pressing problem facing the White House was feeding the
500,000-plus ethnic Albanians displaced from their homes and
currently within Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is weighing the use of intermediaries to
contact Yugoslav leaders to ``allow either air drops or some kind
of convoy to go in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the consent of Yugoslavia not to fire on NATO cargo
planes, air-dropping supplies is considered a risky operation that
would leave the slow-moving planes vulnerable to missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader
Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., are trying to head off votes on the use of
troops until next week at the earliest. However, both said that if
Clinton were to commit soldiers, they would want to hold a vote
first in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., is seeking to force a
vote under the 1973 War Powers Act. The law requires both chambers
of Congress to vote on a military action 60 days after it has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell recently introduced two measures calling for the
withdrawal of American troops from the region or, alternatively, a
declaration of war. Under House rules, the measures must be voted
on no later than early May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are presently at war and it is an unconstitutional war,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia that is dominated by ethnic Albanians now under
siege from the Serbians. Several weeks of punishing NATO air raids
have failed to bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the
peace table to sign a treaty with the Albanian population in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal of the NATO air campaign is to destroy much of the
Yugoslav military equipment that is being used against ethnic
Albanians. Other goals are to force Milosevic to restore autonomy
to Kosovo and to allow NATO troops to enforce a peace agreement
there.

MOVIES' GREATEST HITS, WITH THE GREAT HIT MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Catherine Deneuve, Alain Delon, Robert De Niro and Gerard
Depardieu all make brief guest appearances in Agnes Varda's 1995
film ``A Hundred and One Nights'' opening Friday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the Ds. For this delirious birthday party in
honor of filmmaking's first century, Ms. Varda has made every grand
allusion she can manage and drawn upon every droppable name and
celebrity connection. She creates a whirl of film's greatest hits,
an overripe variety show that plays like the ultimate round of
Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her film as engaging as it is excessive is the
obvious affection with which Ms. Varda has collected these
memories. The vast array of film clips that surface here have been
chosen for their quirkiness or emotional impact rather than for
academic reasons. And the loose talk that links otherwise unrelated
sequences tends to be playful, despite the ample opportunities for
pomposity that this format provides.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most charming moments here finds Marcello
Mastroianni, who looks nothing but courtly while proclaiming
himself ``a moth-eaten seducer,'' arguing with Michel Piccoli about
on-screen baths. We see Mastroianni's ``8 1/2'' tub scene compared
with Piccoli's in ``Contempt'' while the stars argue amiably about
whether Fellini borrowed from Godard.
</P>
<P>
   Piccoli plays the preposterous central role here with just
enough brio to make it work. In what looks like Gloria Swanson's
pageboy wig, he appears as the baronial Simon Cinema, living in a
chateau filled with film posters, cut-outs and lobby cards.
</P>
<P>
   Simon is under the happy impression that he was instrumental to
just about everything in film's first century. Sitting regally in
bed, he talks about this so avidly that the oval-shaped insets in
the headboard keep changing, depicting Orson Welles when Simon
describes ``Citizen Kane'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon hires a pretty young cineaste (Julie Gayet) to jog
his memory, he greets her in ``Nosferatu'' drag as a get-acquainted
joke. More than a little of this would be lethal Piccoli's wry
authority keeping it in check.
</P>
<P>
   With a setup like this, anything goes. So Jeanne Moreau and
Hanna Schygulla drop by as two of Piccoli's screen wives. (``You
broke my heart by falling for that leather punk Fassbinder,'' he
tells the latter.)
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni, who puts in a gallant appearance in the largest of
the cameo roles, encounters Anouk Aimee and asks, ``Want to make
`La Dolce Vita' with me?'' Jean-Paul Belmondo arrives in a bowler
hat to play a memory specialist, and a talking cow requests a dry
martini in quite a peculiar tribute to Luis Bunuel.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's chauffeur dresses as Erich von Stroheim in ``Sunset
Boulevard.'' A bicycle is stolen, prompting someone to remark:
``Italian neo-realism strikes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Varda works in family references too. There is talk of her
late husband (''that old devil Demy'') and his ``Umbrellas of
Cherbourg,'' not to mention a hint of her own film ``Cleo From 5 to
7'' and a sizeable role for her son, Matthieu Demy, as an eager
young filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   While covering so many bases, Ms. Varda never makes more than a
glancing allusion to anything, and at times the film is such an
overloaded grab-bag that it grows exasperating. Or even baffling;
for unknown reasons, Stephen Dorff turns up in a pantheon of great
Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone drawn to ``The 101 Nights of Simon Cinema'' on the basis
of its own star power should know that Clint Eastwood and Harrison
Ford are seen for perhaps two seconds each and that De Niro has
never looked more out of place than he does wafting in a swan boat
with Ms. Deneuve to the tune of ``Sentimental Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   But whenever Ms. Varda galls her audience with such fluff, all
she needs is a clip from ``Pickpocket'' or ``The General'' to make
things right.

`JEANNE': SONGS AND TEARS (IF NO UMBRELLAS) ON THE STREETS OF
PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only France could have produced a charmingly eccentric bonbon
like ``Jeanne and the Perfect Guy,'' a bittersweet movie musical
that suggests an unlikely collision of ``The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg'' and ``Rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Giddily romantic one moment, gawkily militant the next, this
emotional seesaw of a movie switches back and forth between dreamy
love scenes and Act-Up demonstrations without its feet ever
touching the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The score by Philippe Miller, with lyrics by Jacques Martineau
(who directed with Olivier Ducastel), has many contemporary
flourishes but is still rooted in the unabashedly lachrymose Gallic
pop tradition of Michel Legrand. Although the movie deals directly
with the AIDS crisis, the only thing that really matters in its
scheme of things is true love: finding it, keeping it, losing it,
enshrining it.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeanne (the enchanting Virginie Ledoyen), a free-spirited
young receptionist for a travel agency who has had many lovers,
meets Olivier (Mathieu Demy) in a Paris subway car, she instantly
knows he is the man of her dreams. Once the car has emptied of
passengers, the two make love right then and there. At this point
they would probably run off and live happily ever after except for
one tragic complication.
</P>
<P>
   On their second date, Olivier tells Jeanne he is HIV-positive
from his days as a heroin addict. (He has since recovered.)
Olivier's health deteriorates rapidly, and after collapsing in his
apartment, he is rushed to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One day when Jeanne goes to visit him, she discovers he has been
discharged under the care of his parents. The hospital refuses to
disclose the family's address. Will Jeanne be able to track him
down for a last weepy farewell? Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Wispy subplots follow Jeanne's breakup with a casual lover who
won't take no for an answer. She also reunites with an old friend,
Francois (Jacques Bonnaffe) who is gay and has recently lost a
lover to AIDS. Unbeknownst to Jeanne, Francois is Olivier's mentor
in the Parisian division of Act-Up.
</P>
<P>
   The film tries to stir up pathos in Jeanne's and Francois' never
realizing their shared connection to Olivier, despite their
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   In its heart and soul, ``Jeanne and the Perfect Guy'' (``Jeanne
et le Garcon Formidable''), which opens Friday in Manhattan, is a
direct descendant of Jacques Demy's candy-colored musical sorbets,
``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' and ``The Young Girls of
Rochefort,'' films whose bubbly head-in-the-clouds romanticism make
the airiest Hollywood musicals seem almost cynical.
</P>
<P>
   The casting of Demy's son Mathieu as Olivier underscores the
lineage. He is adequate as a kind of male Camille around whom
everyone flutters anxiously, but he is no match for Ms. Ledoyen,
whose dark beauty, casual sensuality and amazing self-possession
radiates pure screen charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Jeanne and the Perfect Guy'' has a lot more spoken
dialogue than Jacques Demy's sentimental classics, its cloud-nine
atmosphere is very similar. So is the technique of the film, whose
characters crudely lip-sync their numbers to lush recorded tracks.
As Jeanne floats through the streets of Paris, male dancers glide
into step for quick dreamy pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that distinguishes ``Jeanne'' from its Gallic
forerunners is its sexual candor. The sight of young lovers
unself-consciously cuddling in bed and singing sweet nothings to
each other au naturel gives the movie a jolt of romantic heat.
</P>

`OPEN YOUR EYES': COMPLICATED MIND GAMES: LIFE IS GOOD, THEN GOES
BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is waking? What is dream? What is reality? What is fantasy?
What is sanity? What is madness?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions pervade ``Open Your Eyes,'' a psychological
thriller directed by Alejandro Amenabar. ``Open Your Eyes,'' which
darts among such relative novelties as virtual reality and
cryogenics, is at bottom a retelling of the story of Job for a
vain, materialistic, selfish age.
</P>
<P>
   Handsomely filmed in Madrid with an attractive cast, this
Spanish feature is unlikely to satisfy those who insist on linear
storytelling and pat endings. But in its deliberately vexing way,
``Open Your Eyes'' is a film with enough intellectual meat on its
stylish bones to give more adventurous moviegoers something to chew
on afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Its protagonist is Cesar (Eduardo Noriega), a good-looking,
25-year-old successful businessman with a well-appointed apartment,
three cars and a reputation for never spending two nights with the
same woman.
</P>
<P>
   He is about to lose all he values.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of ``Open Your Eyes,'' he would like to rid
himself of his latest conquest, Nuria (Najwa Nimri), and when she
appears uninvited at his birthday party, Cesar enlists Sofia
(Penelope Cruz), the date of his best friend, Pelayo (Fele
Martinez), in his effort to avoid her.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar's attention to the beautiful Sofia is less than innocent.
He takes her home; they are mutually attracted, although they do
not sleep together. When he leaves the next morning, Nuria is
waiting in her car to tempt him. He wavers momentarily, then
accepts her invitation. He declines the pills she offers. She downs
them, floors the accelerator and sends the speeding car hurtling
off the road, down an incline and into a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar awakes horribly disfigured, behind a mask, under
interrogation by a psychiatrist inside a cell where he is
imprisoned on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   From then on ``Open Your Eyes'' plays games with the minds of
Cesar and its audience. Having taken away his looks and Sofia, the
woman he might actually have loved, the film, like a fairy tale,
brings her back into his life and then, miraculously, restores his
ruined face.
</P>
<P>
   The film also restores the dead Nuria and turns its attention
intermittently to the mysterious Serge Duvernois (Gerard Barray),
who appears on television talking about cryogenics and the
possibility of life after death.
</P>
<P>
   But as the psychiatrist, Antonio (Chete Lera), tries to find out
what caused Cesar to commit a murder, there is Cesar speaking
behind the mask that conceals his still-ravaged face.
</P>
<P>
   The film's framing device is a talking alarm clock that starts
Cesar's day with the message ``Open Your Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Cesar's life a dream or a nightmare?
</P>

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ U.S. and NATO officials admit to
bombing at least two civilians convoys in Southwestern Kosovo
province on Wednesday that were headed into Albania mistaking them
for military convoys, as the U.S. Senate holds a hearing on Day 23
of NATO bombing of Serb targets in Yugoslavia. (Deans, Cox News
Service).

   KOSOVO-CONVOY _ KUKES, Albania _ Kosovar Albanian refugees who
were a part of the civilian convoy NATO officials admitted Thursday
bombing in southwestern Kosovo on Wednesday relate their accounts
of the tragic events. What is not immediately evident from their
accounts is which convoy was hit by the NATO bomb or just how many
civilians were killed and/or injured. Whatever the facts are, those
same refugees say that they are glad for NATO's actions and does
not want the alliance to stop. (Kunstel, Cox News Service). WITH

supportive of the U.S. war strategy in Kosovo, does not appear to
be in the administration's inner circle of war planners. A look at
Gore's role and how the war's outcome could affect his presidential
campaign. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

<P>
   Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ KUKES, Albania _ Thousands of Kosovar Albanian
refugees began straggling across the border here and in Macedonia
on Wednesday, a week after Serb forces had shut down the refugee
flow out of the province. Aid officials are expecting up to 50,000
refugees to come across Thursday as Serb military gangs clear out
remote villages in the mountain areas. Developing. (Kunstel/Holmes,

physicist Steven Weinberg takes the discussion of the universe's
past to the next level and talks about whether it was ``designed''
or just happened. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   DOLEWOMEN _ How likely is it that independent and Democratic
women would vote for Elizabeth Dole in open primary states like
Georgia and California? The answer could hold the key to her
chances to become the GOP nominee for president. Dole so far has
said little about her positions on a wide range of issues, but in
Georgia, she has attracted the support of some prominent
conservative women, including DeKalb Commissioner Elaine Boyer and
state Rep. Renee Untermayer. As her positions become known, can she
attract both moderates and conservatives? (Sherman, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   JESSEJACKSON _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson begins a seven-day trip
through Missisippi on Saturday (april 17) with a rally at the
Lorraine Motel in Memphis, site of MLK's assassination. His trip
highlights his new crusade to ''build a bridge from Wall Street and
Silicon Valley to the Delta and Appalachia.'' He wants
disenfranchised Americans - those who haven't cashed in on the
country's wild prosperity- to assert themselves by registering to
vote and organizing and demanding things like fair wages, health
care, family leave, etc. And he wants the govt. to encourage
investments in the South. He plans other trips through other
Southern states as well. (Konigsmark, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   FREAKNIK _ Black College Spring Break appears to be getting a
slow start. No college students in site; vendors say they are
steadily selling Freaknik T-shirts, but to locals who appear to be
mostly younger or older than college-age. Police presence is high,
but they don't have anything to police yet. (Campos/Suggs, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   ONIONS-ALIENS _ Four juveniles were among 27 illegal aliens from
Mexico arrested in Vidalia this week in housing so squalid that
even veteran Immigration officials were shocked. The illegal aliens
were among thousands of workers pouring into South Georgia as this
year's harvest of famed Vidalia onions begins.(Davis, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   HOMESCHOOL-COLLEGE _ Students who are home-schooled are starting
to knock on the door of higher education and finding that their
nontraditional educations are making admission more difficult. SAT
and ACT test scores are frequently weighted more heavily than those
from traditional students and some students may be held to higher
standards on tests and grades when Mom or Dad is also Teacher and
Counselor. The movement, more commonly associated with elementary
students, is maturing and is expected to graduate as many as 1
million students over the next 10 years. That's a critical mass
that colleges and universities say they must learn how to deal
with. Education groups _ one of which has set up a special
committee on the subject _ are now urging members to begin
developing policies on how to evaluate the home school application.

`LIFE': `BIG YUKS IN THE BIG HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Life'' packs Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence off to a
Mississippi state prison and lets them trade quips while doing hard
labor. It's hard to miss the basic unfunniness of this situation.
(Nobody who saw last year's prize-winning prison documentary ``The
Farm: Angola U.S.A.'' is liable to be in stitches.) But this
mild-mannered comedy proves more likable than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the humor springs from the curmudgeonliness developed by
Claude Banks (Lawrence) and Ray Gibson (Murphy) over 60-odd years
of needling each other. The two actors have this down to an art
form by the time they are elaborately aged and grizzled by Rick
Baker's makeup effects and have reached the point of arguing about
Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   As directed broadly by Ted Demme, ``Life'' begins with a
present-day burial, then flashes back to the days of Prohibition.
It is then that Lawrence's mousy bank teller first meets Murphy's
brazen con man (Ray stole Claude's wallet) and the two find
themselves reluctantly stuck together. Both indebted to the same
bootlegger (played by Rick James), they are sent from New York to
the deep South on a bootlegging mission and encounter stubborn
racism along the way. As written by Robert Ramsey and Matthew
Stone, the film doesn't know how to treat that situation, waffling
between kidding and indignation. But it knows how to give Murphy
enough wisecracks to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy in particular develops a more substantial personality
than might be expected here. As he evolves affectingly from a
fast-talking hotshot into an old man with the growl and gait of a
venerable blues singer, he seems to be reaching for a greater
acting opportunity than this lightweight material can offer. It's a
performance that feels solid even when the film is at its most
formulaic, or when it vacillates strangely. At one point, ``Life''
goes straight from a comedic moment to a sentimental dance to a
suicide. At another, one montage spans 28 years by mixing up the
characters' fates and important historical milestones in the manner
of a self-important music video.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Murphy make an entertaining team. And they are
surrounded by a supporting cast that makes the prison setting more
pleasant than it has any right to be. While the place seems to grow
so cushy that it's only a matter of time before the inmates take up
golf, actors including Brent Jennings and Miguel A. Nunez Jr. turn
stock roles into fairly fresh ones.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the film, which is invitingly scored by Wyclef Jean, are
Clarence Williams 3d as the poker player whose death lands Claude
and Roy in prison and Ned Beatty as the story's only non-villainous
white character. As out-takes over the closing credits indicate (a
cell phone ringing in 1932?), the actors seem to have had a good
time.

DARING THE READER TO SEE WHAT HE SEES

  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the essays in this new collection of the nonfiction of
Harold Brodkey, who died of AIDS in 1996, is called ``Jane Austen
vs. Henry James,'' and it is typical of Brodkey's literary
criticism. Brodkey begins by closely scrutinizing the first
sentences in two of Austen's novels; then he compares them with the
first sentence in one of James.' He foments theories from those
opening sentences, among them that Austen (whom he regarded as the
greater writer) and James exemplified what he calls sexlessness.
</P>
<P>
   He then sprints onward with that idea, zigzagging over the
broken field of his subject, spinning out related notions
intensely, impetuously, without always bothering with syntactical
coherence. One very long sentence from that essay gives a sense of
Brodkey's writing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The music of the technique _ the words, the rhythm, the
enclosing music of the effectiveness _ amounts to something in an
English form, a semi-Platonic tone of pragmatic antifable, real and
practical in an Anglo-Saxon manner, with an ungreat Anglo-Saxon
greatness to it, literary greatness in a democratic-imperial tone:
democratic within its class and immodest in its claim to its rights
and imperial in its snobbery (of a kind), in its mastery and
control of subject and motion of narrative _ and self-willed in the
extreme in its inventiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an astonishing sentence, brilliant even as it almost
dares the reader to declare it seminonsensical. What, after all,
does ``the enclosing music of the effectiveness'' mean exactly?
While I think I get the seeming self-contradiction in ``ungreat
Anglo-Saxon greatness,'' I'm not sure what ``self-willed in the
extreme in its inventiveness'' means. (``Self-willed'' is used
often enough in these essays to become a kind of mantra.)
</P>
<P>
   There is much in Brodkey's essays on subjects ranging from the
personal morality of Woody Allen to the pleasures of October that I
find tiresome in their undisciplined sprawl, in Brodkey's tendency
to engulf an idea in an inundation of words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as many have noted about Brodkey, he was a writer who took
risks. He was original. He did not produce definite conclusions so
much as he explored ideas and language as he put words down on
paper. Certainly the essays collected in this handsome volume are
uncompromising; they are craggy, ruggedly individualistic,
sometimes as purposely ugly as some paintings by Picasso. Brodkey
might have described them as self-willed in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Brodkey was best known for his short stories, especially those
collected in ``First Love and Other Sorrows'' and ``Stories in an
Almost Classical Mode.'' Not long before he died, he wrote a memoir
of his illness, ``This Wild Darkness,'' that was a powerful, moving
self-portrait of courage and humor in conditions of extreme
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   The essays in ``Sea Battles on Dry Land,'' most published in The
New Yorker, show many sides of Brodkey. They vary in quality. Some,
like his 27-page profile of the comedian Carol Burnett, published
in Esquire in 1972, are hard to get through _ too long, too
intellectual for their topic and not on a subject of great current
interest. Many others are brilliant. They reveal a writer able to
put the ordinary world under a microscope and to tell the rest of
us, peering at the same world through naked eyes, what we do not
see.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is a segment from ``The Subway at
Christmas:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing I would probably be late now for an appointment in
midtown, I calmed or distracted myself by cataloging how many
earringed people there were, and earringed so variously, from mere
splinters of glitter, through a typesetter's store of dots, hoops,
and 0's, up to Ping-Pong-ball-size hoops, and up to plastic
constructions the size of harmonicas (on a tall, longhaired,
straight-haired woman with a heavily powdered face and no lipstick
and rimless glasses and wearing a white leather hat with a blue
plastic see-through visor). Then I cataloged the haircuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodkey came of age during World War II and began publishing in
the 1950s, and there is something of the 50s style that inheres in
his essays. They are, for example, full of a sense of avid
discovery about the varieties of sexual expression in the culture,
the essay on the sexlessness of Austen and James being one example.
Brodkey in this sense anticipates the great gender vogue that has
swept into literary criticism, but there is none of the
self-consciously imitative quality in Brodkey that is found in
others writing on the same themes. The essays are verbally dense
and highly discursive, in the fashion of William S. Burroughs or
Norman Mailer. Brodkey treats the high culture and the popular one,
from ``Mansfield Park'' to ``Pretty Woman,'' accumulating points of
analysis on both like a man piling a plate high with buffet-table
desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of the essays are those on movies and movie
stars, like Marlon Brando (``the androgynous and sensitive
lower-class or classless brute'') and Woody Allen at the moment of
his scandalous affair of several years ago. ``Certain sorts of
behavior are within the range of the normal for a movie star and
not for us, especially if the star, man or woman, has the status
and degree of public meaning of being `legendary,' '' Brodkey
writes.
</P>
<P>
   At times Brodkey's writing is such a luxuriant plant that the
reader gasps for some open space, wishing for a reprieve from the
heavy flow of opinions and words, but then there are moments of
unadulterated magic, like the short, humorously poignant essay on
Thanksgiving or the more purely poignant piece titled ``AIDS and
Loss in a City of Ghosts.'' The latter essay, written before
Brodkey knew he had AIDS, is an elegiac but unsentimental chronicle
of what New York was losing as so many died.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Political rage and gallows jokes, art talk and
gossip and argument about movements and schools, sloppy polemic and
nifty malice, odd bits of media poetry and a great magnificence, a
splendor, a rage of hospitality toward language, toward words and
gesture _ for the moment, they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those phrases, especially the ``rage of hospitality
toward language, toward words and gesture'' applied to Brodkey, and
he is gone, taking with him an original mind and a prodigious
capacity to be interested in the passing panorama, and to translate
that interest into a rich river of insight. He is gone, and he is
missed.

RAT-A-TAT OF COLLECTIONS UP FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The adage that antiques are passed down ``from
generation to generation'' is being given new meaning by recent
activity in the international auction markets.
</P>
<P>
   Between sales just completed and others coming up, no less than
five major collections of mostly 18th- and 19th-century furniture
and decorations, which each took decades to assemble, are being
dispersed. It certainly seems as if baby boomers are shopping
somewhere besides Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   At Sotheby's New York on March 29 and 30, the sale of the
collection of Alberto Pinto, the Paris-based interior designer,
totaled $6,309,655, greatly surpassing the presale high estimate of
$4.6 million. Pinto said he had decided to sell his Continental
furniture, French porcelains and the decorations in his magnificent
Paris apartment because they no longer suited his style of living.
He said he wanted to live in a more modern way.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors from South America, Europe and the United States
scooped up nearly 700 lots. Pinto's Napoleon III Aubusson carpet
sold for $96,000; it was expected to sell for $50,000 to $70,000. A
19th-century Indian enameled silver cockatoo went for $63,000; its
estimate was $10,000 to $15,000. And a Russian neo-classical
chandelier sold for $96,000, compared with its estimate of $40,000
to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two days, the Milan auction house, Il Ponte Casa
d'Aste, has sold the contents of the apartment of Renzo
Mongiardino, the legendary Milanese interior designer, who worked
for the Gianni Agnellis, the Randolph Hearsts, Prince Radziwill,
the Ermenegildo Zegna family and Baron Hans Henirich
Thyssen-Bornemisza and his five wives. Mongiardino died last year
at the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
   The lots sold from Mongiardino's apartment were not quite as
valuable as some of the items he bought for his clients. He was
famous for his proclivity to fabricate objects to look antique; he
would have a leather tile painted to look like old Portuguese
faience, for example, rather than buy the real thing, which was
often cheaper. At home, he had genuine 19th-century antiques that
were more quirky than valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The 697 lots in the sale included a set of Gothic Revival carved
mahogany armchairs, two Western polychromed wooden busts of a
``Chinese Emperor and Empress,'' a gilded wood sunburst clock,
Empire-style stools with carved lion-head armrests and a Murano
glass chandelier in shades of pink and turquoise.
</P>
<P>
   Today Christie's New York is conducting two sales. Its morning
auction is of ``Important Silver, Objects of Virtu and Russian
Works of Art.'' It has 343 lots, including a group of elegant
European gold, enamel and gem-set snuffboxes and several objets
d'art from the Russian workshop of Carl Faberge.
</P>
<P>
   The Faberge pieces include an amusing gold-mounted nephrite cane
handle shaped like a duck's head, which is estimated at $20,000 to
$30,000, and a remarkable 1913 figurine of an accordion player
carved in lapis lazuli, jasper, quartz and granite, which is
estimated at $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly sumptuous object is a circa 1725 German
nautilus cup surmounted by a ferocious silver-gilt dragon with ruby
eyes that is estimated at $100,000 to $150,000. Though its maker is
unknown, its workmanship is truly a tour de force.
</P>
<P>
   This piece is a perfect example of Rothschild taste, or ``le
style Rothschild,'' the kind of precious object the family has
collected for hundreds of years. For example, Baroness Marie-Helene
de Rothschild kept a silver-mounted nautilus shell made in Augsburg
on the dining room table of the Hotel Lambert, the Paris house on
Ile St.-Louis that she shared with Baron Guy de Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The Baroness once said the Rothschilds had silver animals in
their houses in Germany because the silver would catch the fading
light of a cold winter afternoon, adding warmth to a room.
</P>
<P>
   Mongiardino, coincidentally, helped the Rothschilds decorate the
Lambert, which was built by the architect Louis Le Vau in 1644.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Christie's sale is of 247 lots of ``Important
English Silver From a New England Collection'' consigned by an
unidentified American collector who started buying silver years ago
as a student at Harvard from the Manhattan dealer S.J. Shrubsole.
</P>
<P>
   The lots trace the history of English silver. There are two 1544
apostle spoons from the time of Henry VIII that later belonged to
J.P. Morgan, an Elizabeth I tankard from 1587, a James I spice box
from 1610 in the form of a scallop shell, George II silver
candlesticks made by Paul de Lamerie's workshop in 1744 and a
George IV silver wall clock with the maker's mark of Paul Storr,
London, 1829.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two very rare William and Mary wall sconces,
circa 1690, that were recorded in the 1721 inventory of silver in
Kensington Palace; most royal silver sconces were melted down to
pay for wars.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, from Thursday to Sunday, Sotheby's New York is
selling about 1,500 lots of furniture and decorative arts from the
estate of Betsey Cushing Whitney. Some paintings and prints from
Mrs. Whitney's estate will be auctioned on April 29 and 30;
important 19th and 20th-century paintings will be sold on May 10.
All these works are on view at Sotheby's in New York beginning
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whitney was married to John Hay Whitney, publisher of The
New York Herald Tribune, ambassador to Britain, a venture
capitalist and philanthropist. Mrs. Whitney, who died last year,
put together their elegant residences in New York City; London;
Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; Manhasset, Long Island, and Thomasville,
Ga., with the help of Sister Parish of the Manhattan firm
Parish-Hadley.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parish was a clever decorator, but many of the prettiest
things in the sale are not intrinsically valuable. Nonetheless, the
auction includes some important pieces, including a small Louis XVI
table signed by Jean-Henri Riesener, the best and probably most
expensive furniture maker of his time; a 12-fold Chinese Coromandel
lacquer screen; a set of 10 George III painted armchairs, and a
bronze Louis XV mantel clock with a base in the form of a
rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   The figure is inspired by a Durer drawing, and the clock is
signed St. Germain, for the Paris clockmaker active between 1743
and 1775. The piece is estimated at $150,000 to $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Christie's London announced that on July 8 it would
sell about $40 million worth of art and objects that the Nazis
confiscated from the Rothschild family in Austria. This sale
includes French antiques, including a Riesener commode; silver, and
porcelains as well as scientific instruments and Old Master
paintings that have been hanging in Vienna's museums for 50 years
but were recently returned to the family.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of who is collecting today, there may be a changing of
the guard. Nonetheless, these auctions should prove that pedigree
and cachet are still a winning combination.

LOVE, MARRIAGE AND AN EX-HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Richard Crane learns that his ex-wife plans to marry her
much younger lover, he is determined to leave a medical conference
in Iceland and get to Manchester in time to prevent her from making
a fool of herself.
</P>
<P>
   Though Richard is played by the urbanely attractive Michael
Kitchen, he looks quite foolish himself in a furry anorak, trekking
home by dog sled and kayak early in ``Reckless, the Sequel.''
</P>
<P>
   That comic image sets the lighter tone for this continuation of
last year's delicious, darkly comic romance, in which Anna (the
utterly believable Francesca Annis) left Richard, the prototype of
an arrogant surgeon, for a new life with Owen Springer, a sensitive
doctor 15 years her junior. Played with irresistible energy by
Robson Green, Owen still has the great virtues of being handsome in
a not-too-pretty way as well as wildly in love with Anna.
</P>
<P>
   As the sequel begins, a year has passed and Owen has just
proposed to Anna. The story quickly veers away from its mordant
roots to focus on a more mundane question: Will the wedding take
place? ``Reckless, the Sequel'' is an appealing domestic comedy
with moments of real emotional pull. It cannot match the brash
invention of the original, but its characters remain as smart,
likable, wrong-headed and vengeful as ever, usually all at once.
</P>
<P>
   As he interferes with Owen and Anna's wedding plans, Richard has
plenty of company, with loads of relatives getting into the act.
Anna's calculating sister arrives from New York and bluntly asks
Owen the obvious Oedipal question: ``Your mum's dead, isn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, she is. But Owen's father continues to be a
working-class rock and source of common sense. It says much about
Richard that his own parents wouldn't miss their
ex-daughter-in-law's wedding, and that the elder Crane is willing
to give the bride away.
</P>
<P>
   Richard is as wickedly ruthless as ever, though more sympathetic
in his genuine dismay over losing Anna. Desperate to convince her
of her mistake, he searches on the Internet for evidence that the
marriage will be doomed. (The word ``infidelity'' turns up 22,000
matches.) He also orchestrates a more practical and effective
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Though its humor is smoothly appealing, ``Reckless, the Sequel''
is most engaging in its moments of startling honesty. Will Owen, in
his early 30s, and Anna, in her late 40s, have children? That
question comes up during a huge argument in which a sad and
frightened Anna is seen in a close-up that makes her look, quite
intentionally, every bit her age.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes of unexpected truth make it clear that the sequel,
like the original, was written by Paul Abbott, one of the true
television talents at work today. (He also wrote the original
``Cracker'' and the mystery ``Touching Evil,'' in which Green
played the hero.)
</P>
<P>
   The pull of this latest ``Reckless'' may elude people who missed
the original. The intensity and sheer rightness of the match
between Owen and Anna is assumed rather than re-established here.
Anyone who watched that match take shape will want to catch this
lively, if unsurprising, next step.

MATTER OVER MIND: A FREUDIAN TROVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How should we interpret the writings of Sigmund
Freud? One way to regard him has always been as a literary figure
rather than as a scientist. Thomas Mann once even endorsed Freud's
nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``My self-knowledge tells me I have never really been a doctor
in the proper sense,'' Freud himself wrote near the end of his
life, having observed earlier, apropos of patients like Anna O. and
the Wolf Man: ``It still strikes me, myself, as strange that the
case histories I write should read like short stories and that, as
one might say, they lack the serious stamp of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Stone, a Harvard professor of psychiatry, in a lecture to
the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, recently picked up on these
remarks, arguing that psychoanalysis and Freud really belong to the
arts and humanities. ``As academic psychology becomes more
scientific and psychiatry becomes more biological, psychoanalysis
is being brushed aside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``Plato, Hegel, Michelangelo, da Vinci,
Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky and Sartre helped to shape Western
civilization and its conception of the human condition without any
systematic proofs of their contentions, and so, I suggest, did
Freud.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatry, Stone adds, ``will survive in popular culture, where
it has become a kind of psychological common sense,'' which seems
undeniably true, technical terms like repression having long ago
been absorbed into ordinary speech.
</P>
<P>
   Because it caused a widely publicized fracas even before the
plans for it were made final, the exhibition ``Sigmund Freud:
Culture and Conflict,'' organized by the Library of Congress and
opening Sunday at the Jewish Museum, will almost surely attract big
crowds of curiosity seekers. Crowds now being a dominant feature of
the museum experience, they are also, to a degree,
self-perpetuating, since people tend to want to go where other
people already are. The resulting frustration involves trying to
see what is on view in a throng. Freud might have noted how we tend
to seek out what we abhor.
</P>
<P>
   I mention reading and crowds at the start because the exhibition
consists primarily of handwritten, sometimes barely legible,
documents: mostly letters and manuscripts, many of them in German.
A library exhibition, it requests that we stand and read much of
the time, a taxing job in a milling mob.
</P>
<P>
   There are also text panels, interspersed with family
photographs, odd works of art and other objects (including the
couch) that Freud owned. All of this is supplemented by video clips
from films, television programs and home movies in which we see
Freud, his sisters and associates.
</P>
<P>
   Being neither a psychoanalyst nor a historian of psychoanalysis,
I would not presume to say whether the show should please his
adherents or whether it will mollify detractors who, among other
things, have called it, sight unseen, ``an effort to polish the
tarnished image of a business that's heading into Chapter 11.''
</P>
<P>
   But I think it is a fair guess, considering the general climate
surrounding Freud, that no exhibition (or book or lecture or
newspaper article) could possibly satisfy both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of hard facts, you get from the show no more
information about his life or work than could be gleaned from an
introductory book or encyclopedia article. This is simply the
nature of a library exhibition. The collected writings of Freud
occupy 24 volumes, in addition to which the Library of Congress
owns more than 80,000 items of Freudiana, from which most of the
130 objects that we see here have been chosen, so the show barely
qualifies as a sampler.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is perhaps no subject that is less intrinsically
visual, less suited to the format of an exhibition, than
psychoanalysis, whose precepts are so intangible that they are
unfalsifiable.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Roth, the curator, faced with this problem and desiring
to placate conflicting camps, obviously labored to compose lively
explanatory panels that elucidate Freud while conceding, where
necessary, enough of what you might call incriminating evidence
against him. The results occasionally have the chary tone of
presidential depositions.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the show anyway. It is cleverly designed. Most people
will glance only at the documents, maybe reading a few pages here
or there, because that's human nature, but everyone will gravitate
to the films and television clips. The organizers clearly
understood this. The clips include snappy excerpts from Olivier's
``Hamlet'' and ``The Simpsons,'' Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' and ``The
Dick Van Dyck Show,'' a range of things to illustrate the suffusion
of psychoanalysis into popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Freudians who worried before the fact that the show would
not adequately take into account their criticisms on one level
should not have feared, because the clips alone are comically
damning.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously, after all, can you take Freud's theory of
transference after watching Natalie Wood playing a psychiatrist and
Tony Curtis playing her patient in ``Sex and the Single Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: You must realize, of course, that this is simply
transference. You worship me not because I'm attractive but
because, to your subconscious mind I have become . . . a father
figure.
</P>
<P>
   CURTIS: A father figure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the brouhaha caused by the show, what will
attract many people to it is also the illusion of physical
proximity to its subject. Letters, manuscripts and objects are like
relics. The more apt word in Freud's case might be fetishes.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder whether he would have fully appreciated the
psychological allure of his belongings. Evidently, Freud wanted his
papers destroyed after his death, though of course you don't have
to be a Freudian to doubt whether that's what he really desired,
because, if so, he could have destroyed them himself.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of his papers and objects is partly fetishistic,
partly educational and partly esthetic. It is often said that he
was not esthetically inclined, which seems correct, up to a point.
Famously, like Jean-Martin Charcot, the great French pathologist
with whom he studied, he collected antiquities. Archaeology became
his favorite metaphor for psychological analysis. But he did not
demonstrate much appreciation for the purely visual aspects of what
he owned.
</P>
<P>
   And while he wrote brilliantly about Leonardo and Michelangelo,
his interpretive interests were always psychological. Basically, he
conformed to the Victorian mold of an art critic, focusing on the
characters of the people portrayed in a picture or sculpture and
their emotional effect on him, not on the balance of a composition
or its other formal properties.
</P>
<P>
   We should remember that in 1900, when ``Interpretation of
Dreams'' was published, the figures commanding respect as
authorities on art included Nietzsche, Tolstoy and Benedetto Croce,
all of whom equated art with feeling. Freud's subjective bent was
in keeping with the ideas of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he didn't trust subjectivism altogether. Amusingly,
he remained willfully blind to the two main subjectivist currents
in modern art, Expressionism and Surrealism, both of which claimed
to be indebted to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no patience with lunatics,'' he complained. And about
an Expressionist portrait, he wrote to a friend: ``I received the
drawing which allegedly represents your head. It is ghastly. I know
what an excellent person you are. I am all the more deeply shocked
that such a slight flaw in your character as is your tolerance or
sympathy for modern art should have been punished so cruelly.''
</P>
<P>
   People like the artist, he said, ``should be the last allowed
access to analytic circles, for they are all too unwelcome
illustrations of Adler's theory that it is precisely those with
severe inborn defects of vision who become painters and draftsmen.
Let me forget this portrait in wishing you the very best for
1923.''
</P>
<P>
   We have had most of a century to adjust our vision to what Freud
could not see. And it has made us perhaps more sensitive to the
peculiar charge of certain visual experiences, which in a
conventional sense do not, at first, seem esthetically significant.
That includes this Freud exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Edmund Morgan, writing in The New York Review of Books
about a new George Washington exhibition, also consisting largely
of handwritten documents, noted how the effect in that case was
``less intellectual than affective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Curators, like historians, strive for objectivity, but they
have to select and simplify far more drastically than in a book,
and the resulting subjectivity is obscured by the authenticity of
the objects,'' he wrote. ``Because an exhibition's interpretation
thus pronounced carries such power, it can provoke surprisingly
violent protests from those who find it unfair that they cannot
present a conflicting interpretation with similar authority. The
thesis of a book can be answered with another book, but how do you
answer an exhibition?''
</P>
<P>
   I might put it differently: that the aura of the objects
automatically sanctifies the subject of the exhibition. Any show
about Freud, but especially one containing his materials, glorifies
him because this is in the nature of monographic exhibitions. One
surmises that the anti-Freudians have grasped this fact: they knew
that all exhibitions have a celebratory implication, which in some
ways is beyond the control of the curator.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan touches on the crucial question: who gets control of the
aura? Like many private papers given to libraries, the Freud
materials arrived at the Library of Congress with restrictions,
imposed by the donor, the Sigmund Freud Archives. To commemorate
the fact that some previously restricted materials would be opened
to the public in 2000, the library decided to organize this
exhibition, as a kind of coming-out party, and appointed a
committee of experts, including Roth, the curator.
</P>
<P>
   We might ask: to what extent should public libraries ever be in
the business of accepting restricted papers? How is restricting
information, and selecting those who may use it, consistent with
the liberal mission of a public library?
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Freudians had fair reason to ask about the distribution
of authority over his materials. At the same time, of course, the
public can easily be underestimated. It is one thing to recognize
that people will be attracted to a show because they are drawn to
the aura of the objects in it, and another to say that they will be
unable to draw their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, ``The West as America,'' at the National
Museum of American Art, caused nearly as much of a stir as the
Freud show when its curators appended tendentious texts to
19th-century American paintings chronicling the westward expansion
of the United States. The result was a backlash from visitors who
balked at being told how to look at paintings that they could see
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that the anti-Freudians have also misjudged the
public's ability to think for itself.  &QL;

TRIBE ASKS CONGRESS FOR $1 MILLION TO SOLVE FETAL DEATH MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Herbert ~~~``Ike'' Whitish, chairman of the
Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe in Washington state, asked Congress
Thursday for $1 million to help solve a mysterious fetal death
problem that has plagued the tribe for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a lot of money for a small tribe,'' Whitish said
of his 202-member tribe in Tokeland on the state's southwestern
coast. But he added, ``We are at a point in our existence that if
something isn't done, then we don't know what's going to happen to
us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe first became aware of the problem in 1992 when it
realized that 10 of 19 pregnancies since 1988 had ended in
miscarriage, stillbirth or the death of a baby within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16 pregnancies since 1997, only one child is still alive. A
woman in the tribe is due to have a baby next month, but Whitish
said she has been in and out of the hospital with many
complications in the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   He said two women on the reservation had suffered from a rare
disorder in which the embryo died quickly but precancerous cells
continued to grow, making the women think they were still pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta sent researchers to the reservation to study the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Whitish told the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the
Interior that the $1 million would enable the tribe get to the
bottom of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The request includes $560,000 for an environmental laboratory on
the reservation that would test water and sediment for pesticides,
herbicides and fecal bacteria. Another $250,000 would pay for
transporting expectant mothers to Seattle or Tacoma to visit
doctors who specialize in high-risk pregnancies. The rest of the
money would cover genetic testing and the hiring of a full-time
community health nurse to provide home health care and education to
expectant mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., subcommittee chairman, said he would
``do his best'' to fulfill Whitish's request but added that this is
``a tough year, budget-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government is projected to run huge
surpluses over the next decade, discretionary spending for domestic
programs is still subject to strict controls contained in the 1997
balanced-budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Like other agencies, the Interior Department, which helps fund
Native American programs, is expected to receive an overall cut in
funding levels next year from its current level. The new budget
year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government became involved in the Shoalwater case in
1994 when it funded a study by the Environmental Protection Agency
and provided money to help build a medical clinic on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies found high levels of pesticides in
nearby cranberry bogs but were unable to link the pesticide levels
to the fetal deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA recommended further study of the area's air and ground
water and continued monitoring of the cranberry drainage area, but
Whitish no money was appropriated for such work.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tribe thought the problem had been solved when four
healthy babies were born between 1993 and 1996. But then the
mysterious deaths began recurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid to have babies,'' Whitish said in an
interview after he testified. ``Somehow or another we must find
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitish has spent this week in the nation's capital meeting with
his state's congressional delegation, other lawmakers on the House
and Senate Appropriations Committees and officials from the
National Institutes of Health and the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   While Whitish expressed hope that his tribe will get the $1
million, he said he realizes he faces heavy competition. He was one
of 50 tribal representatives testifying before the House panel
Thursday, all of whom wanted federal money.

``GOODBYE LOVER'' IS DECEIVINGLY CLEVER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warner Bros. worries that film critics might reveal to audiences
who's doing what to whom in ``Goodbye Lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't dream of it, WB. But it will make any review rather
enigmatic. This wry and sneakily funny film-noir pastiche is so
cleverly and solidly integrated that you can't even describe one
female's wonderful costume changes because they reveal crucial plot
points.
</P>
<P>
   This was directed by Roland Joffe from a screenplay credited to
Ron Peer, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow.
</P>
<P>
   Habitues of the Turner Classic Movies cable channel will pick up
the ticklish mood of the piece right away, from such noir talismans
as a blonde in a black beret, ``Mildred Pierce'' on a TV,
references to the gas chamber which California long ago abandoned
for lethal injection and the Edward G. Robinson role from ``Double
Indemnity,'' played by Ellen DeGeneres.
</P>
<P>
   This pastiche differs from the the real thing in that it is
play-cynical; the old '40s films were genuinely acidic.
</P>
<P>
   There are four names above the film's title. It's not revealing
much to report that each of them is doing something to the other
three. At issue is whether what appears to be a double-cross is a
triple-cross, and if the filmmakers are going to step up to another
level and try a quadruple-cross. This has a ``plot,'' folks, and
you need to pay attention. It has no bathroom breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra (Patricia Arquette), married to Jake (Dermot Mulroney),
is a real estate salesperson who's having a red-hot affair with Ben
(Don Johnson), who works in the same PR firm with Jake. Even more
inconveniently, Ben and Jake are brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It is classic noir: otherwise sane, even useful men, made into
virile simpletons by sexually consuming women. ``Why do I keep
taking these risks?'' moans Ben after a notably stupid red-hot
scene. ``Because you can't help it,'' says Sandra.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion: that this triangle has four sides _ little brown
office wren Peg (Mary-Louise Parker) just might be sandbagging us _
and that one (or more) of the sides may be planed off.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres plays LAPD Det. Rita Pompano, called in to investigate
foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Although what starts happening isn't a surprise, the filmmakers
skillfully delay the ``reason'' for its happening.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reward of the film is more in humor than in
suspense, it's not at all a burlesque. Even the purest film noir is
but a differently inflected line reading away from overt black
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has fun with this, and the fun is infectious. Special
notice is given to Arquette and DeGeneres. The latter has the best
dialogue and running gags with John Neville, as a rookie, spiritual
partner who needs wising up.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra dresses herself like a Barbie, with a special,
``together'' outfit for each occasion. Theadora Van Runkle's
costumes are very funny, again, without being overt. You start to
realize that Sandra's not dressing for the people in the film;
she's dressing for us, to deceive us. In this movie, even the
clothes are double-crossers. &QL;

NEWS ITEMS ON THE GREAT WHITE WAY

<P>
   Tony Guessing Heats Up
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the Pulitzer Prize for drama for ``Wit'' on
Monday marked the beginning of awards season, a period of delight
for amateur handicappers and anxiety for just about everyone else
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The next up are the awards from the Outer Critics Circle, made
up of critics who report on New York theater for out-of-town media.
The nominees, which were announced on Monday and include work from
both Broadway and off Broadway, may offer a hint of what the major
Tony Award races will look like. The awards will be presented on
April 26, a week before Tony nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Common wisdom is that at the Tonys, best actor honors will be a
showdown of salesmen: Brian Dennehy's Willy Loman in ``Death of a
Salesman'' versus Kevin Spacey's Hickey in ``The Iceman Cometh.''
The Outer Critics nominated those two as well as Corin Redgrave
(``Not About Nightingales'') and Roger Rees (the Off Broadway play
``The Uneasy Chair'').
</P>
<P>
   In the best actress category, Dame Judi Dench (``Amy's View'')
and Zoe Wanamaker (``Electra'') received Outer Critics nominations,
as well as Kathleen Chalfant (``Wit''), Elizabeth Franz (``Death of
a Salesman'') and Swoosie Kurtz (``The Mineola Twins''). Expect Ms.
Dench versus Ms. Wanamaker at the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The field for the best actress Tony is considered so competitive
that the producers of ``Salesman'' successfully lobbied the awards'
administration committee to allow Ms. Franz, who plays Linda Loman,
to be considered a featured, rather than a lead, actress.
(Generally, actors listed above the title _ as Ms. Franz is _ are
considered leads.)
</P>
<P>
   For best play, the Outer Critics nominated ``Amy's View,''
``Closer,'' ``The Weir'' and ``Not About Nightingales.'' The
noticeable exception was ``Side Man,'' whose producers are hoping
for Tony nods.
</P>
<P>
   In musicals, the group chose ``Fosse,'' ``Parade'' and ``The
Civil War,'' which received seven nominations, despite still being
in previews. ``Swan Lake,'' which was deemed not to be a musical by
the Tony committee, is the fourth nominee. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Season Unfolds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In bits and pieces, the new season is coming into focus, both on
and Off Broadway. Here is a preview:
</P>
<P>
   ``Voices in the Dark,'' by John Pielmeier (``Agnes of God'') is
likely to be the first play of the 1999-2000 Broadway season. Ben
Sprecher, one of the producers, said that they had the $1.375
million budget and that a deal was close for a small Broadway
house. He plans an Aug. 12 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Ashley will direct, and Judith Ivey will star. Ms.
Ivey said the play was a thriller about a radio host who is stalked
by a caller.
</P>
<P>
   Off Broadway, it looks as if the Atlantic Theater Company will
be celebrating its 15th anniversary with old friends. Neil Pepe,
the artistic director, said the company will stage a complete
season of the work of David Mamet, the Atlantic's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Details are being worked out, but confirmed highlights include a
production of ``The Water Engine'' in the fall and a revival of
``American Buffalo'' in February 2000. It will star William H.
Macy, the company's other founder.
</P>
<P>
   And at a location to be determined, the always colorful life of
the designer Isaac Mizrahi will be taking another fabulous turn.
Mizrahi, who folded his unprofitable fashion line in October, is
developing a one-man show for next season. Moises Kaufman (``Gross
Indecency'') is directing, and Peter Jones is the musical director.
Dori Berinstein and Susan Quint Gallin are producing.
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi is still writing the show, but Bob Fennell, a spokesman,
said it would be ``an entertainment, with stories and songs for the
stage.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane Is Back &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane has been a busy man since his last turn on a New
York stage last February in ``Mizlansky/Zilinsky, or `Schmucks,'''
at the Manhattan Theater Club. He's filmed two movies, played house
in Los Angeles and made a foray into sitcom land, in the
now-canceled NBC series ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lane is returning to New York to star in ``Do Re Mi,'' the
season's final offering from the Encores concert series at City
Center, which has no relation to the television series. The show,
which also will feature Randy Graff and Stephen DeRosa, opens on
May 6.
</P>
<P>
   A satire on the music business, the 1960 musical originally
starred Phil Silvers as Hubert Cram, a bungling striver, the part
Lane will play. ``I always heard it was a poor man's `Guys and
Dolls,''' Lane said. ``But I think if aliens discovered the CD,
they'd say, `Ah, this must be musical comedy.'''
</P>
<P>
   While working on ``Do Re Mi,'' Lane said he will also be in a
reading of ``Wise Guys,'' Stephen Sondheim's new musical, with
Victor Garber. That project is expected to have a workshop
production in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be looking for an apartment. ``In the last episode of
the TV series, my character said, `I'll go back to New York, they
always liked me in New York,''' he said. ``I guess I'm fulfilling
that prophecy.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Iceman Cometh,'' which opened last week to ecstatic
reviews, is extending its run until July 17. As part of the
three-week extension, producers will sell about 100 more $20
student tickets per night. (The show's regular top ticket price is
$100.) Spacey said, ``We're determined to give this show to as many
people as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Allison Janney (``The View From the Bridge'') will play Kate
in the Public Theater's production of ``Taming of the Shrew'' in
June in the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. Max Wright is also
cast.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Berliner Ensemble, the famed political theater company
founded by Bertolt Brecht 50 years ago, will make its first
appearance in the United States in early July with performances of
Brecht's ``Arturo Ui,'' at the University of California campuses at
Berkeley and Los Angeles. Then, the company will disband before
reconstituting under new artistic leadership in August.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jace Alexander, the director of ``Snakebit,'' will take over
the role of Jonathan in the play for two weeks beginning on April
22; David Alan Basche, who regularly plays Jonathan, is filming a
television pilot. ``We did an exhaustive search, and found me,''
Alexander said. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The rap group Public Enemy plans to release its
new record through Atomic Pop, an Internet record label and Web
site, allowing buyers to download the album from their computers.
Executives at music and Internet businesses say this is the first
time a well known, platinum-selling recording act has released a
new album this way.
</P>
<P>
   The record, ``There's a Poison Goin On,'' will be available
through the Internet in early May (via download and mail order) and
in record stores beginning on June 16, Al Teller, founder of Atomic
Pop, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The price for downloading the album has not been set, Teller
said, adding that the record would sell for $10 through the mail
and for the regular price of a CD in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy's move is slightly ahead of the technology. Though
Atomic Pop has not decided which of several competing formats it
will use to compress the album into a computer file, Teller said
that in any format it will take ``a very long time'' to download
the entire recording. ``People are going to have to be patient,''
he added. Depending on the computer, the downloading will take five
minutes to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year the music industry has been preparing to
transfer a portion of its business to Internet sales, with updates
and technological advances being announced almost daily. Just five
months ago Public Enemy ran afoul of its previous label, Def Jam
Records, when the group made unreleased music available at no cost
on the Internet without its label's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Its new deal with Atomic Pop is a large step in the music
industry's march toward digital music distribution. If Public
Enemy's approach succeeds, it could inspire like-minded bands to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is inevitable, and everything is about to change,''
said Chuck D, the rapper who leads Public Enemy. ``Once one record
goes through this, it's the shovel in the dirt.'' Teller said that
because there were no manufacturing costs for downloaded music, his
label would offer lower prices for customers and more profit to the
artists for each CD sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Teller said, artists ``will see a
larger dollar amount than from the traditional way of selling
records.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival executives in the Internet music business called Public
Enemy's deal a smart one, a good way to drum up publicity for the
record, even though it is likely to sell most of its copies through
stores. And representatives of Internet labels that had negotiated
with Chuck D said he was very conscious that his endorsement of an
Internet site would attract other established acts looking for
deals and asked for a very high advance payment. (The Atomic Pop
site is at www.atomicpop.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Teller and Chuck D declined to discuss the exact terms of their
contract, which was for only one record. But unlike traditional
contracts, in this one the group will retain the rights to its
master recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Teller used to be the chairman of MCA Music Entertainment and
the president of CBS Records, where he worked with Public Enemy on
its first albums.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s Public Enemy revolutionized rap, adding volume
to the music's political message. Today, considering that rap fans
do not reward pioneers with record sales, the band is holding on,
with its last full studio album entering the pop charts at No. 14
in 1994 and its recent soundtrack to the Spike Lee movie ``He Got
Game'' peaking at No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy and Def Jam Records parted ways in January. Chuck D
said a conflict arose when Sony sold its 50 percent stake in Def
Jam to Polygram in 1995 and did not offer Public Enemy equity in
the company. Def Jam did not return calls seeking comment in time
for publication. With his Internet deal, Chuck D once more
considered himself a ``rebel without a pause,'' as he once rapped,
with the Internet his wild West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony, WEA, Universal, EMI and the notorious BMG,'' he said,
naming the five major recording companies. ``They can always give
Chuck D a call, and I can tell them exactly what to do with the
wild, wild West. I can give them a template. But it will cost each
one of them royally.''

   Revisions And Revisionists
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most documentaries, Joseph Dorman's ``Arguing the World''
has now touched all points of distribution since its completion in
1996. In 1997 it was shown at the Jewish Film Festival in New York,
and in 1998 there was a short commercial run at Film Forum. In
January it was on PBS, and on Tuesday it was released on home video
by First Run Features.
</P>
<P>
   The film examines America's cultural and political progression
from the socialism of the 1930s to the conservatism of the '80s as
viewed by four New York intellectuals _ Irving Kristol, Daniel
Bell, Nathan Glazer and Irving Howe _ who metamorphosed themselves
throughout those decades and helped shape the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The ``lean, information-packed narrative doesn't waste a word,''
Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Dorman began the project about 12 years ago. ``I was casting
about for a film to do,'' he said this week, ``and I happened to
have Irving Kristol's `Reflections of a Neo-Conservative' on my
bookshelf.'' In it was a recollection of the author's days as a
Trotskyite and the furiously energetic exchanges at City College
among a legion of politically charged young intellectuals who
emerged from the impoverished Jewish working class in New York
during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always admired the people Kristol was hanging out with,''
said Dorman, who is 40. ``For me it was fascinating to trace their
political trajectories.''
</P>
<P>
   The paths of the four men cross the ideological byways of much
of the century, from the Stalinism and anti-Stalinism of the '30s,
to Hitler, the upheaval of the McCarthy era, the rise of the New
Left in the '60s (in the film Bell and Tom Hayden, a former leader
of Students for a Democratic Society, remain distinctly unfond of
each other), the Berkeley free-speech movement, the 1968 protest at
Columbia University, the McGovern campaign of 1972 and the gradual
conservative turn by the time of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a neo-something,'' Kristol says.
``Neo-Marxist, neo-Trotskyist, neo-liberal, neo-conservative. I'm
going to end up a neo. Just neo, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape is $39.95. Information: (800) 488-6652.
</P>
<P>
   DVD: Growing, Growing
</P>
<P>
   In the old days Ron Rich listed 8,000 titles in his Laser Disk
Guide. Now the quarterly publication has been renamed the DVD
Guide, lists about 2,800 disks and serves as a kind of periodic
summation of how the format is progressing. Here are a few of
Rich's related observations.
</P>
<P>
   In March 266 DVD titles were released, up from 125 in January.
Movies, new and old, make up about 75 percent of the releases.
``Special interest'' categories (everything from old television
shows to exercise programs) account for about 10 percent. Music,
primarily concerts, is about 5 percent. Pornography is a small but
active area (several hundred titles).
</P>
<P>
   Rich said prices were holding steady at $19.95 to $25. A
conflicting report in Video Business magazine says prices have
risen 6.2 percent over the last year to an average of $26.53. The
guide is $3.95 and is available where DVD's are sold.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   A Bug's Life
</P>
<P>
   In a movie from Pixar, the computer animation company, thousands
of ants are threatened by a small but efficiently intimidating gang
of grasshoppers. To save his fellows, the whimsical Flik (left)
heads off to get help. A bumbler, Flik doesn't inspire much
confidence, but he does bring back a traveling band of circus bugs.
Of what assistance they are supposed to be is at first unclear, but
the film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``makes jaunty,
imaginative use of both extraordinary technology and bold
storytelling possibilities.''
</P>

   Monument Avenue
</P>
<P>
   A group of boyhood friends turned car thieves fiercely try to to
survive in Charlestown, a gritty Irish-American enclave of Boston.
The nominal plot revolves around their efforts to cover up a
killing, but the real story is how they struggle to hold on with
booze, amphetamines, pride and their loyalty to one another. Denis
Leary is effective as one of their leaders, as is Colm Meany as his
paranoid rival, in Ted Demme's film, which ``is remarkable for the
skills with which it gets under the skins of its largely
unsympathetic characters and makes you care about them'' (Stephen
Holden).

<P>
   The Siege
</P>
<P>
   When terrorist bombs start going off all over New York City, the
FBI and CIA's attempts to crack the case get bogged down in
internecine power games between Anthony Hubbard (Denzel
Washington), the self-righteous agent in charge, and Elise Kraft
(Annette Bening), a mysterious Mata Hari type from the agency who
seems to have slept with most of the suspects. With the
investigation stalled, a large detail of Army troops appears under
the command of Gen. William Devereau (Bruce Willis), who decides to
herd every Arab-American male he can round up into a downtown
prison camp in a film that never eases its ``visual demonizing of
Arab characters or its way of titillating the audience with
terrorist stunts'' (Maslin).

date: April 20.
</P>
<P>
   A Night at the Roxbury
</P>
<P>
   Trying to infiltrate a trendy club, two flat-out morons, Steve
and Doug Butabi (Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan) get lucky when they
get into a fender-bender with their idol Richard Greico (who plays
himself). Frightened of a lawsuit, Greico gets the boys (those
heretofore mercifully silent head-bobbers from ``Saturday Night
Live'') inside the Roxbury, where they annoy women and others.
Outside they do more of the same in a film that is much like the
brothers: ``undeniably pathetic but strangely lovable'' (Anita
Gates). &QL;

Release date: April 20.

<P>
   Smaller films _ the kind most people see on video _ have their
own best-renter list. Here are some current leaders on Video
Business magazine's list of movies that appeared in no more than
475 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   CLAY PIGEONS. David Dobkin's ostentatiously hip genre spoof
constantly confounds expectations as a too-nice drifter (Joaquin
Phoenix) winds up a suspected serial killer in Montana. 1998.
Polygram. $106.99. 104 minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   PERMANENT MIDNIGHT. In a cautionary tale, the television writer
Jerry Stahl (Ben Stiller) goes on a druggy slide. 1998. Artisan.
$107.37. 85 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   PECKER. In high satirical form, John Waters puts a camera in the
hands of a little fellow from Baltimore called Pecker (Edward
Furlong) and lets him shoot every banality he comes across.
Naturally the New York gallery crowd loves the stuff, and Pecker
becomes a celebrity. But his heart belongs to Baltimore. 1998. New
Line. $107.12. 87 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. With the same cool fury as his ``In
the Company of Men,'' Neil LaBute's film eviscerates three male
characters (Ben Stiller, Jason Patric and Aaron Eckhardt) who have
little on their minds beyond an obsession with sexual performance.
1998. Polygram. $106.99. 99 minutes. R.
</P>
<P>
   PI. Interests as diverse as Orthodox Jews and the stock market
want the theory developed by Maximilian Cohen (Sean Gillette), who

`SLC PUNK!': IT'S A TOUGH JOB BUT SOMEONE HAS TO BE A PUNK IN
UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How does a punk apply for a job in a clothing store?
</P>
<P>
   A: He walks in wearing an obscenity printed on his jacket and
introduces himself by shouting ``Hey!'' Then he says he hates
everything in the shop but adds: ``I want to sell clothes.
(italics)Women's(end italics) clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does a punk save the rain forests?
</P>
<P>
   A: He slams his fist on a table and yells:
(italics)``Somebody's(end italics) gotta fight for them!''
</P>
<P>
   There's enough of this in James Merendino's ``SLC Punk!'' to
make sense of its punk-proof locale for an absurdist coming-of-age
comedy. Only his own real experience as an alienated teen-ager in
Salt Lake City, circa 1985, could have led to such a (perhaps
deservedly) overlooked time and place.
</P>
<P>
   So in what one of his characters calls ``a religiously
oppressive city, which half its population isn't even that
religion,'' he presents the amusing exploits of a group of friends
led by Stevo (Matthew Lillard). Stevo is the rare punk who may be
headed for Harvard Law School without even trying. He makes an
entertaining rebel, but he's about as authentic as his blue hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!'' finds humor in the tameness of Stevo's wild
streak. He's the kind of anarchist who makes rules about how
anarchy ought to work. And he shares with his pals, notably a
Mohawked guy nicknamed Heroin Bob (Michael Goorjian in the film's
funniest performance) for his terror of needles, a paper-thin
veneer of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   These are punks who hate to break glass but do it, quaking, just
as a matter of principle. Even if they have to travel all the way
to Wyoming to shock anybody (or buy full-strength beer), they feel
honor bound to try.
</P>
<P>
   Lillard narrates the film in a glib, high-speed manner that
eliminates any further chance of a raw edge. Instead, this is a wry
anecdotal comedy better defined by its polish than by punk
trappings.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``SLC Punk!'' seems to be serious in championing Stevo's
opinions and pronouncements, it's a lot funnier when finding these
characters seriously in over their heads. A clean-cut-looking
friend remarks: ``The world has no way to clean itself. That's why
there's so much dust.'' That makes him a lot more dangerous than
the punk brawl seen here, which Stevo takes time to analyze. With
diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   ``SLC Punk!'' is likable for its outlandishness, less so when it
shows a self-important streak. For all of Merendino's jump-cutting

FEDS CONSIDER WAYS TO PLUG FLOW OF DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 and GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With millions of dollars hidden in gasoline tanks, transmissions
and portable toilets, smugglers have opened what one federal
official called ``a drug-cash pipeline from New York to Texas'' in
an effort to get their profits out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, U.S. Customs Service inspectors nationwide are
finding more cash than ever and are poised for yet another record
year of seizures of undeclared money.
</P>
<P>
   So much money is being found _ $68.4 million last year _ that
the issue has caught the attention of the House Banking
subcommittees on financial institutions and oversight and
investigations, which held hearings Thursday on how to plug the
flow of profits from the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   With half of the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, ``foreign drug
cartels have developed extensive money-laundering operations within
the state,'' Don Clemmer, an assistant Texas attorney general, told
the House panels.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Clemmer testified, authorities discovered $11
million in suspected drug money stashed in a semi-truck near
Abilene, in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the driver was transporting the money to
Mexico after hauling a load of marijuana to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   As much as $57 billion a year is laundered in the United States,
according to Clemmer. As much as $30 billion goes through Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York-to-Texas cash pipeline appears to be the flip
side of the emerging Texas-to-New York cocaine pipeline,'' said a
Customs official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The confiscation of cash leaving the country at the Southwest
border rose to $14.4 million in fiscal 1998 from $3.3 million in
fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other finds Customs has made are $5.6 million hidden in the
false roof of a semi-truck in El Paso in 1997 and $15 million
hidden in cargo containers in Miami in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Large amounts of undeclared cash seized at the borders and at
airports is often considered suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing federal regulations at banks and smaller financial
institutions have left drug cartels few options other than
smuggling their profits out of the Unites States before trying to
pass them off as legitimate, said Kevin Dellicolli, head of
financial investigations for the Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be $9,000 wrapped around your body or $9 million
stuffed in a suitcase,'' Dellicolli said in an interview. ``They
can not spend it until they get it moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, if a person fails to declare cash of $10,000
or more to Customs inspectors, the money is seized and subject to
hefty administrative fines or permanent forfeiture to the
government. Criminal penalties include up to five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Drug kingpins have stepped up efforts to smuggle the cash out of
the United States, where banking and currency laws have made it
more difficult to mask the origin of the money, said Bonni
Tischler, assistant U.S. Customs Service commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent trends have pointed to a marked increase in bulk
shipments of cash,'' Tischler told the House subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1998, which ended Sept. 30, Customs seized $68.4
million _ an increase over the $55 million seized in 1997. Tischler
said bulk cash shipments have been discovered at the nation's
largest airports, seaports and across the entire Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has prompted lawmakers to consider tougher penalties
for individuals who smuggle money to avoid currency transaction
reports required on deposits at financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the federal banking regulators and law enforcement
officials have made money laundering through insured depository
institutions more difficult, money launders have apparently
resorted to smuggling of large amounts of U.S. cash and currency
over the border,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., chairwoman of
the subcommittee on financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also are looking to crack down on money services
businesses, or MSBs, neighborhood check-cashing services,
money-exchange houses and stores that sell money orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement and Congress have known for some time that
money launderers have used nontraditional financial institutions
such as MSBs,'' Roukema said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers, though, said Congress should remain focused on
large financial institutions, which have historically been used by
drug kingpins to hide profits from narcotics and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious problem with large financial institutions
here and abroad,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., ``I would rather
double efforts on banks than to attack money laundering at
neighborhood check-cashing businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said some U.S. banks have been
involved in suspicious transactions with foreign institutions under
investigation for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the big boys. I'm concerned about
Citibank, and that's no secret,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Waters questioned the relationship between
Citibank, Confia Bank in Mexico and Raul Salinas, the brother of a
former Mexican president, who allegedly moved millions in drug
money into Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' ties to the two banks has been under scrutiny by
investigators here and abroad.

ST. LOUIS: THE RIVER RUNS BY IT, HISTORY THROUGH IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In 1904, St. Louis was the fourth largest American
city. It was rich, river-rich, thanks to the Mississippi, then the
nation's main north-south artery. Although Chicago had developed
into the dominant railroad hub, St. Louis deemed itself the
rightful capital of the Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   So the city staged the grandest, giddiest, most glorious fair
the world had ever seen, on this continent or any other, the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. It outshone Chicago's Columbian
Exposition of 1893 _ that was the point _ and included the first
Olympic Games ever held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Its palaces and exhibitions spun fantasies of perpetual peace
and plenty, and it taught the country, with a little help years
later from Judy Garland, a song not soon forgotten:
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet me in St. Louis, Louis,
</P>
<P>
   meet me at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me the lights are shining
</P>
<P>
   anywhere but there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the apogee; life in St. Louis has never been quite as
sweet since, and people here still murmur wistfully about the
summer of 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But the lights did not go out right away. St. Louis prospered
through the next few decades, a ``solid expanse of bricks and
mortar'' stretching away ``into dim, measure-defying distances,''
as Mark Twain wrote, making money on beer and shoes even as it fell
behind boomtowns like Detroit and Los Angeles. It built an array of
big-time cultural and civic institutions that serve it well to this
day. And fate found ways to keep its name on the nation's mind.
</P>
<P>
   A musician named W.C. Handy came to town in 1914, sat on the
riverbank overlooking the Eads Bridge, an engineering marvel that
was built at the same time as the Brooklyn Bridge, and wrote a tune
called ``St. Louis Blues.'' That made two songs about St. Louis
that most Americans could hum or whistle or dum-de-dum; can any
other city in the United States make such a claim?
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, a skinny young pilot from Minnesota named Charles
Lindbergh set up shop in St. Louis. After flying airmail to Chicago
for a while, he turned in 1927 to a group of local businessmen to
finance a plane for an attempt to fly solo across the Atlantic
Ocean. Some thought him a crackpot, but nine of them ponied up the
needed $15,000. In gratitude, Lindbergh painted the words ``Spirit
of St. Louis'' on the nose of his frail, silvery Ryan monoplane.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison Keillor, the professional Midwesterner, recently said
on his radio show that in his part of the country, ``We cause them
pain, and that makes them the artists they are.'' He was talking
about St. Louis and distinguished writers who once lived here, like
Marianne Moore, Tennessee Williams and T.S. Eliot. Especially
Eliot, who grew up at 2635 Locust St., the son of a wealthy brick
manufacturer, but spent his writing life in England.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis stayed with Eliot. ``There is something in having
passed one's childhood beside the big river which is incommunicable
to those who have not,'' he wrote late in life. The fog in ``The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock'' is the fog from the factory
chimneys across the Mississippi, he said, and the urban themes in
his poems echo his early fascination with the St. Louis slums.
</P>
<P>
   Other creative spirits, especially musicians, had something of
the city in them, though this was never a jazz or blues capital on
the level of New Orleans, Chicago, Kansas City and New York. Fate
Marable's orchestra, with Louis Armstrong on cornet, played on
riverboats that tied up at St. Louis. Chuck Berry, Tina Turner,
Miles Davis, Josephine Baker and Scott Joplin were born here or
worked here. Blues clubs like Mike and Min's still dot the old
Soulard neighborhood, where a farmer's market has operated since
1779.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians were the product of a large, vibrant black
community, which co-existed, sometimes nervously, with the dominant
German-Americans. Not entirely by coincidence, St. Louis today has
two nationally prominent congressmen: one black, Bill Clay, and one
German-American, Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   It was a German, Max Beckmann, driven from his homeland by the
Nazis, who gave St. Louis its greatest distinction in the visual
arts.
</P>
<P>
   After living out World War II in semi-hiding in Amsterdam, the
gregarious, ambitious Beckmann came to St. Louis to accept a
teaching job at Washington University. He found not only ``trees at
last, ground under my feet at last,'' as he wrote in his diary, but
also a generous friend and patron in the person of department-store
magnate Morton May. The St. Louis Art Museum is the richer for
their friendship; it houses the world's premier Beckmann collection
and fine groups of works by major German Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   This spring (through May 9) the museum, whose building, by Cass
Gilbert, is the sole surviving structure from the 1904 fair, is
staging a show designed to examine Beckmann in a new light. He
always aspired to conquer Paris, but he never did; here, his
pictures hang alongside those of Picasso, Matisse, Braque and
others. Beckmann does not suffer by comparison. He is clearly not
the equal of Matisse the master colorist or Picasso the inspired
innovator, but his slashing brushwork and stinging colors impart a
swaggering energy to his canvases that can make the French masters
look a bit effete.
</P>
<P>
   Reliving the Gilded Age
</P>
<P>
   Across Forest Park from the art museum is the Missouri
Historical Society, where you can pretend for an hour or so that
you are visiting St. Louis in the Gilded Age, which lasted from the
end of the Civil War to the 1890s, or attending the world's fair.
With a nice skepticism that never degenerates into cynicism, the
fair exhibition examines myths spawned by the great exposition,
including the canards that ice cream cones and hot dogs originated
there.
</P>
<P>
   If it is music that one seeks, St. Louis is well endowed for a
city of its size. The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra plays in Powell
Hall, a converted movie palace with stunning acoustics, under the
baton of the Dutchman Hans Vonk. Founded in 1879, it is the second
oldest orchestra in the nation, and often listed among the six or
eight best; Time magazine, perhaps too exuberantly, decreed in 1983
that it stood second only to the Chicago Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Maestro Vonk, whose style is the epitome of modesty and economy,
makes a contrast to Leonard Slatkin, the adventurous and
demonstrative conductor, now in Washington, who spent 17 years as
music director here. Slatkin returns from time to time to conduct
the American works that are one of his specialties, while Vonk has
added Russian and French pieces, including Messiaen's Turangalila
Symphony, to the usual Austro-German diet.
</P>
<P>
   Classic musicals are revived every summer at the 12,000-seat
amphitheater of the Municipal Theater Association of St. Louis,
known to the locals as the Muny. A six-week, 31-performance spring
season is offered by the Opera Theater of St. Louis, which shares
the stage of the Loretto-Hilton Center, in suburban Webster Groves,
with the Repertory Theater of St. Louis. This year's feature is the
premiere of a new work by Paul Schoenfield, ``The Merchant and the
Pauper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rep is the leading theater company in town, despite its
out-of-the-way location. Next season its program will range from
Shakespeare to Sondheim, with the first major production of a new
play by Lanford Wilson a high point. Wilson's 1980 drama,
``Talley's Folly,'' won the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Close to Powell Hall in the Grand Center district is the St.
Louis Black Repertory Company, with an Afrocentric take on classic
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the fabulous Fox, another converted movie theater.
It houses musicals, concerts and special events in an interior of
indescribable gaudiness, which the management describes as a
leading example of ``the Siamese-Byzantine style.'' Bangkok meets
Istanbul; is this a great country or what?
</P>
<P>
   Yogi, Joe and Stan
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as if every other restaurant in St. Louis is
owned by a sports hero. There's Mike Shannon's and Ozzie's and
Dierdorf and Hart's. But then St. Louis has always been a sports
town, as the old-time catchers Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola, both
native sons, keep saying.
</P>
<P>
   As late as the war years, St. Louis was one of only four cities
in the country (along with New York, Philadelphia and Chicago) with
more than one big-league baseball team. It had the National League
Cardinals, of course, a team just as popular in 1999, with
Bunyan-size Mark McGwire, the home-run king, as it was in the
heydays of Dizzy Dean and Stan (The Man) Musial.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals built a huge following outside of Missouri; there
was no major league team west or south of St. Louis then. The
hapless American League Browns, on the other hand, were the subject
for years of a familiar taunt: ``First in booze, first in shoes and
last in the American League.'' Awash in debt, they gave up and
moved to Baltimore in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   By then, St. Louis was struggling, and it has struggled since
with economic change and racial tensions that bred poverty and
crime. The city was a pioneer in urban redevelopment, seeking to
eradicate slums but building new ones instead, like the infamous
Pruitt-Igoe project, whose 33 towers became gruesome national
symbols of good intentions gone wrong. They were demolished in a
telegenic cloud of dust in 1973, only two decades after they
opened.
</P>
<P>
   What was left behind _ much of the immense midtown area between
downtown and 1,300-acre Forest Park, which was the site of the fair
_ was a wasteland. Charles Eisendrath, a St. Louis native whose
family settled here after the Civil War, still calls the area
``Hiroshima Flats.'' Eisendrath, who teaches at the University of
Michigan, says the city ``smashed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The area has plenty of big employers. Anheuser-Busch, which
dominates the American beer market, has its main office and a
century-old brew house, full of gigantic copper kettles, just south
of downtown. There are dozens of buildings in the Budweiser
complex, with enough crenellations and battlements to outfit
several medium-size castles. It has been growing ever since
Eberhard Anheuser and his son-in-law, Adolphus Busch, started in
business in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   Malinckrodt and Monsanto produce chemicals here. McDonnell, now
part of Boeing, builds aircraft components on the north side. Trans
World Airlines has its headquarters here, as do Emerson Electric
and Ralston Purina.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's population has shriveled, declining from a peak
of 857,000 in 1950 to 397,000 in 1990, as its suburbs have grown.
Clayton, LaDue, University City, Florissant and dozens of other
communities ringing the city have attracted not only the well-to-do
but also middle-class and working-class fugitives from the largely
black north side and the largely ethnic south side.
</P>
<P>
   Little Lombardy
</P>
<P>
   When Pope John Paul II visited St. Louis in January, the city
found itself derided in The Washington Post as ``a hard-knuckle
up-South city far removed from the Potemkin village of the
Budweiser commercials'' _ the ones where the brewery's team of
Clydesdales canters through a leafy landscape.
</P>
<P>
   True enough, as far as it goes. But St. Louis has neighborhoods
of character, too. Like the oak-lined, gated streets called private
places, packed with faux chateaus built 80 or 90 years ago and
carefully maintained since. And the Hill, a spic-and-span square
mile of modest frame houses, bocce clubs, salami shops, red-sauce
restaurants and red-white-and-green fire plugs, centered on St.
Ambrose Church, a scaled-down, red-brick replica of the Romanesque
cathedrals in Lombardy, whence came most of the Hill's settlers.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has The Post-Dispatch, flagship of the Pulitzers, not
as influential as it once was, maybe, but still many notches above
average. It has Washington University, where 18 Nobel laureates
have done research, and St. Louis University, the oldest west of
the Mississippi, a Jesuit institution that has taken the lead in
reviving the shabby district around its campus.
</P>
<P>
   And it has the Missouri Botanical Garden. ``If you do nothing
else,'' our friend Tony Bommarito told my wife, Betsey, and me,
``go to the garden,'' which seemed like bum advice a few days after
the year's last snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Captivating Gardens
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. These are gardens for all seasons. Nowhere in the
United States, except in the Bronx, will you find their equal. Even
on a chilly day early in March, we found them captivating:
camellias in full bloom in the Linnean House, with primroses
underneath, to give us a foretaste of spring; crocuses and
snowdrops pushing bravely through the crusty ground outside, winter
honeysuckles and Ozark witchhazels belying the season with their
scents, and the fanciful shapes of trees, both evergreen and
deciduous, in the extensive Japanese garden.

   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   ADAM'S MARK, Fourth and Chestnut Streets, (314) 241-7400. The
view's the thing, but not the only thing, at this red-brick
leviathan (814 rooms) overlooking the Gateway Arch. Sharp
management has improved the service, the rooms are better-looking
than the chain-gang norm and you can choose between indoor and
outdoor pools. Faust's restaurant serves bounteous brunches. Double
room rate: $99 to $230.
</P>
<P>
   HYATT REGENCY ST. LOUIS, St. Louis Union Station, (314)
231-1234. The 65-foot, barrel-vaulted lobby, covered in seafoam
green Arts and Crafts tiles, takes the breath away; there is
nothing like it in any other American hotel. Bravo for the Hyatt
organization, which has added attractive if slightly snug rooms and
a pool to a brilliant rehab job. Service is a bit shaky. Double
room rate: $135 on weekends to $230 on week nights.
</P>
<P>
   OMNI MAJESTIC, 1019 Pine St., (314) 436-2355. A favorite of
visiting musicians and other performers, the Majestic is a National
Historic Landmark, built in 1913 and fittingly restored. Small,
with only 89 rooms, it is also a question mark as owners pass
through a revolving door. Once independent, then a Crowne Plaza,
now an Omni, it felt a bit soulless on a revisit. Double room rate:
$99, weekends; $139, week nights.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   RITZ CARLTON, 100 Carondelet Plaza, Clayton (314) 863-6300. The
Ritz is the city's best hotel by a country mile, and not just
because the competition is feeble. Fifteen minutes from downtown
St. Louis in suburban, swinging (yes, swinging) Clayton, it has a
lobby that's perfect for drinks, and oversize marble bathrooms. Try
the amazing applewood-smoked Ozark bacon at breakfast. Double room
rate: $155 to $370.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAFE MIRA, 12 N. Meramec Ave., Clayton, (314) 721-7801. He's
only 27, but Mike Johnson has been around, and it shows in the
dishes he serves at his casual black-and-white restaurant. He
conjures a first course from asparagus, San Daniele ham, goat
cheese and the thin sheets of pastry used in making brik, a
favorite North African dish. He bones short ribs and serves them
with hoisin sauce and grilled pineapple relish. He adds carrot
``spaghetti'' to a dish of calamari and rock shrimp to provide a
bit of crunch. Fun. Good.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSING, 7823 Forsyth Ave., Clayton, (314) 721-7375. Two chefs
from Daniel in New York have set St. Louis on its conservative ear
with this stylish bilevel establishment. A piece of poached skate
that all but melted into a pile of mashed potatoes, giving the same
effect as a brandade of cod, formed the centerpiece of a satisfying
meal that began with roasted beets and goat cheese and ended with
perfectly simple, simply perfect vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   TONY'S, 410 Market St., (314) 231-7007. There is a bold sign in
the kitchen. ``Pride,'' it says, and that quality permeates Vince
Bommarito's whole operation. Subtly lit, a bit old-fashioned, with
waiters in dinner jackets transferring food from serving dishes to
plates at tableside, this is the city's best, most cosmopolitan
dining room. From carpaccio to canolli (filled with fresh whipped
cream as ordered), by way of red-sauced pasta and superb veal, the
menu covers Italian classics plain and fancy.
</P>
<P>
   GIANPEPPE'S, 2126 Marconi Ave., (314) 772-3303. You'll find the
soul of St. Louis food on the Hill, the close-knit neighborhood
where Italians have clustered for a century. Pepe Profetta and his
mother, Gabriella, come from Palermo, but try their red snapper in
the style of Livorno anyway. They can cook almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   HARVEST, 1059 South Big Bend Boulevard, (314) 645-3522. Stephen
Gontram's place specializes in ``rustic American food,'' and it's a
knockout. A local pioneer in modern cooking, opened 16 months ago,
Harvest charmed us with its sand-hued decor, its fat all-American
wine list and its homey Midwestern touches: for example,
sweetbreads with pureed parsnips, and a Maytag blue cheese risotto.
</P>
<P>
   TED DREWES, 6726 Chippewa St., (314) 481-2652. This white frame
building has been dispensing manna, disguised as frozen custard,
since 1929. Take-out only; closed in midwinter. Order a cone, a
cup, a sundae or a shake, known here as a ``concrete'' because it's
so thick; whatever you choose, you'll taste whole eggs, honey and
pure cream.

THE ROUGH POETRY OF A SELF-REFERENTIAL ROBERT FRANK   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Frank's recent photographs have messages
scratched into them and labels scrawled onto them. They are packed
with recycled objects and pictures, verbal and visual puns and
frames within frames within frames. Describing them is a lesson in
madness. So here goes.
</P>
<P>
   One of Frank's multi-print works is called ``Find Your Roots:
Explain My Roots.'' It is a laconic study in four parts. The top
left photograph shows a white sky marked with a black, rootlike
streak. The top right photograph shows the same white sky with a
real black root hanging in it. The bottom two pictures are of Frank
pointing to the pictures of roots above him. He points with his
middle finger, his gesture so benign, so like St. John the Baptist,
that you actually have to count his fingers to see that he's
flipping you the bird. Behind him is the shadow of his finger
projected on a screen, near a nest holding a root or branch.
</P>
<P>
   These may not be Frank's roots; they may not be roots at all.
But ``Find Your Roots/Explain My Roots'' seems to include the basic
elements of his work over the last 25 years: it is comically
symbolic, allusively self-involved, plaintively adolescent,
obsessed with time, date, land, frame and point of view.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the Robert Frank who created ``The Americans'' 40
years ago. Pace Wildenstein MacGill's two-part exhibition is a
testimony to just how much he has changed since then. There is one
roomful of Frank's portraits of a miner, Ben James, taken in
Caerev, Wales, in 1953, five years before ``The Americans'' came
out. These are straight documentary pictures: the miner works,
visits a pub, lifts a white cup to his black face and finally
bathes, bending over a free-standing metal tub while his wife reads
the paper. These could have been taken by Bill Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   That old documentary style is long gone. What has replaced it is
a ruthless, sardonic, self-involved examination of time and space.
The gallery's main exhibition, ``Robert Frank: From the Canadian
Side,'' is devoted to the work that Frank has done since 1974 in
Mabou, Nova Scotia. From these 23 works it appears that all the
dusty sadness he found on the coal miner's face has been
internalized.
</P>
<P>
   To replenish his in-scape, Frank is constantly reshuffling,
rearranging, reframing his possessions, his memories, his
photographs, and even the sticks and bones around his home. It is
as if he's looking for something he lost. Sometimes it's painful.
Sometimes it's comical.
</P>
<P>
   One of his works, ``Mabou, N/S'' functions like a directional,
or temporal, compass that is stuck. Four photographs of a
campground with tree stumps, tables and chairs are arranged in a
square. The two on the right are nearly identical, and so are the
two on the left. What distinguishes them is that the top two were
taken in winter, in snow, and the bottom two were taken in summer,
in sunlight. You get each image in each season. What is the point?
Maybe to show what time and space give and take away.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all so earthshaking. In one-half of a two-part
photograph from 1977, the word ``words'' has been clipped onto a
clothesline with clothespins. In the other half, the word has moved
out of the frame so that only ``wo'' is left hanging with a lot of
idle clothespins. The self-referential word, a comic figure, will
soon be gone. Another work shows three postcards of waterfalls that
seem to be falling over a waterfall composed of them. In these
pictures, the stakes are small. As time passes, words and images
move out of sight, out of frame.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what his ostensible subject, Frank manages to be
self-referential. In the two-part picture, ``Monday Morning in
Mabou (Old Snapper), January 5, 1988,'' there's a photograph of a
typewriter whose roller holds a picture of a horse with the words
Old Snapper. Below that is a typewritten, hand-signed note: ``that
day _ I thought that I AM THE OLD SNAPPER.'' And he is. A second
photograph in this work shows a shelf of Brownie cameras on a shelf
and a hand waving a sheaf of paper so quickly that it appears like
a white flash from a bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the objects Frank uses _ screens, shelves, landscapes,
figurines _ none appears more often than the picture frame. In the
six-part work called ``Fire Below: To the East America,'' the key
prop is an empty frame from a gas station sign, the kind that sits
on springs so it doesn't blow away. Frank uses this plangent object
to frame his wife and his house in snow, to frame a wire fence and
sky, to frame snow and weeds, as if the film frame alone were not
enough to hold back time. He's right. Time has passed. The word
``yesterday'' scratched into one of the pictures proves his defeat.
That defeat is reiterated in yet another picture, showing an old
man clutching the gas-station frame with one hand and pointing away
from it with his other hand.
</P>
<P>
   What is this plaintive obsession with frames? Death perhaps.
Frank's two children died tragically, and in this show his memorial
to his son, Pablo, contains no fewer than eight frames. There are
picture frames framed by window frames. There is a frame that Frank
has scrawled around his own sullen portrait. But the most
rudimentary frame of all is the arrangement of logs around a grave
site. That frame captures what Frank seems to be trying to show
again and again: that nothing will ever be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about time. The snow comes. The landscape changes. The
shadows creep up on the cabin. The film runs out. Robert Frank's
work is rough poetry.

SAN FRANCISCO GETS BANK TROVE  
 KELLY GIFTS TO MOMA  
 STAFF-BUILDING AT THE WHITNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of intense negotiations, the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art has acquired 10 works of art for about $60 million
from the Fukuoka City Bank in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Japanese banks, Fukuoka spent millions of dollars
collecting contemporary art during the boom years of the 1980s, but
when financial times got tough in the 1990s, it began liquidating
its art. For months, dealers, auction house experts and collectors
have been trying to get a piece of the Fukuoka Bank's art holdings,
because its collection includes so many outstanding paintings and
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   When the San Francisco Museum, in partnership with several key
trustees and patrons, finally made a deal with the bank to buy 10
works from its collection, strict confidentiality agreements were
signed between all parties.
</P>
<P>
   David Ross, the museum's director, confirmed that the museum
would eventually acquire a major collection, though he would not
say whose collection or where it came from. He said he was unable
to discuss either the specifics of the art or the deal itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that a collection was acquired for the museum
by several trustees and patrons,'' Ross said. ``This is an
astounding group of works. It's all part of our ongoing effort to
acquire great masterpieces for San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the negotiations confirmed that among the stars
in the Fukuoka collection that will eventually hang on the walls of
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is Jasper Johns' ``0 Through
9.'' One of the artist's seminal works from 1960, this is a
patchwork of bright colors in spiky strokes, in which the numbers 0
through 9 are visible.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the group going to San Francisco is a Francis Bacon from
1963, ``Study for Velazquez''; an almost-black grid of eight
squares by Ad Reinhart from 1959, and an early Calder mobile. Roy
Lichtenstein is represented, too, with a large Leger-inspired
painting from 1978. Other artists in the group are Leger, Warhol,
Chuck Close, Frank Stella and Yves Kline.
</P>
<P>
   This is only a portion of the Fukuoka Bank's holdings, and those
close to the negotiations say the discussions to acquire several
other key works are still under way.
</P>
<P>
   No American museum has been as big a player in acquiring the
best contemporary art available as the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art. This year alone, nearly $100 million worth of art has
either been pledged or given to the institution by trustees and
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who helped pay for this latest group of works, the only
name the museum would confirm was Phylis Wattis, a trustee for the
last 26 years. Ms. Wattis has given the museum an immense body of
art recently, including works by Warhol, Duschamp, Magritte and
Rauschenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Is Given Kellys
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Museums often depend on the kindness of artists, as
well as of trustees, to enhance their permanent collections. This
is certainly true of the Museum of Modern Art, which this week
announced four gifts from Ellsworth Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   And another work by the artist, ``Meschers'' (1951), named after
the French village where the work was conceived, has been promised
to the museum by its chairman, Ronald Lauder, and his wife, Jo
Carole Lauder, president of the museum's International Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our aim to have the most important collection of
Ellsworth Kelly's work of any museum,'' said Glenn Lowry, director
of the Modern. ``This is all part of a larger commitment to insure
that our collection of contemporary artists equals that of our
early modern masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the artist's gifts are working drawings for ``Sculpture
for a Large Wall,'' from 1957. The work had been rescued from the
abandoned Transportation Building in Philadelphia, for which it was
designed. It is a large sculpture _more than 11 feet high and 65
feet wide _ that has 104 anodized aluminum panels in primary colors
and black. It was given to the museum in October by the Lauders.
</P>
<P>
   Another gift from Kelly, ``Dominican,'' dates from 1952, while
he was living in France. The painting is on a vertical canvas and
features bands of gold, white and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Currently on view at the museum, through July 6, is the special
installation ``Ellsworth Kelly: Sculpture for a Large Wall and
Other Recent Acquisitions.'' It includes several drawings and
collages as well as three paintings _ ``Three Panels: Orange, Dark
Gray, Green,'' from 1986, ``Chatham VI,'' from 1971 and ``White
Curve VII,'' from 1976 _ that were given to the museum last year by
the Douglas Cramer Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Appointments
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are still many important job openings at the
Whitney Museum of American Art. After losing four curators and its
head of education and programming in a little over three months,
its director, Maxwell Anderson, has been scurrying to fill many
slots.
</P>
<P>
   This week he announced two appointments: a photography curator
and a new head of education and public programming.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Wolf, associate curator of photography at the Art
Institute of Chicago, has been named photography curator. She will
be the first full-time photography curator at the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   Heading up the museum's education and programming will be
Melissa Phillips, founding executive director of the Media
Workshop, a nonprofit organization that provides professional
development for the educational community. Ms. Phillips replaces
Constance Wolf, who resigned from the Whitney in December to become
the director of the Jewish Museum in San Francisco. Ms. Phillips,
who begins her new job on July 1, will oversee the development of
the museum's educational programs, its library and independent
study program.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top jobs still open are a curator for contemporary art
and a curator of postwar art.

QUAYLE AGAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When former Vice President Dan Quayle announced
Wednesday that he is running for the Republican presidential
nomination, he forced us to face once again the reality that he's
not John F. Kennedy _ and doesn't even come close.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, dear.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it gets worse. Quayle's not Al Gore, either.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush's vice president has a paper resume of
elected public service that doesn't look bad. But that's only if
you've forgotten that his performance as White House second banana
was a national joke and his prior Senate service totally
undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   And we are about to be reminded of these truths: He was a drag
on the 1988 Republican ticket. He vanished into political limbo
after Bill Clinton defeated Bush in 1992. He sought to repot his
image by abandoning Indiana, his home state where he had won his
only elections, and moving to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is repeating his familiar, dog-eared campaign themes that
others articulate better.
</P>
<P>
   He was in over his head a decade ago. Nothing since indicates
his neck has been stretched upward.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush paid any attention to Quayle's opinions either in public
or private during their four years together, nobody noticed. But
now Quayle insists that having been veep gives him the experience
to run the economy, the country and whatever foreign difficulties
come our way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's best qualified to be the next president?'' Quayle, 52,
has the temerity to ask. Who, indeed? Well, think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Surely not a fellow who hasn't held public office for seven
years, who dodged the Vietnam draft by hiding out in the National
Guard and who eagerly cheered the unpopular, partisan congressional
drive to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Surely not a fellow whose wispy veephood pales by comparison
with Gore's aggressive, influential and upfront role. Surely not a
fellow who claims to reject isolationism but is scared of the use
of ground troops in Kosovo, taking a mushy position that leaves
hawkish Sen. John McCain as the premier GOP voice on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Surely not a fellow whose plaintive refrain in vague defense of
``family values'' has not changed in the past decade, although our
concept of those values has been in transition. He says he is
firmly against abortion, yet he has acknowledged that if his
daughter needed one he would support whatever she wanted to do. His
claim to ``moral leadership'' is empty. What has he done about it
except to talk a good game?
</P>
<P>
   He is still beating up on the 1992 television show Murphy Brown
about an unmarried pregnant woman, a show that has since been
canceled. (At least he has not taken on Teletubby Tinky Winky for
carrying a pink pocketbook, as far as is known.)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was never qualified to be vice president in the first
place. Bush selected him in 1988 out of some mistaken dream of
promoting a youthful successor who would grow in the job but not
challenge Bush's own power, as a smarter, older candidate might
have done.
</P>
<P>
   It promptly became clear that this was not one of Bush's better
decisions. During Quayle's 1988 campaign debate with Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the
conservative Republican compared himself with the liberal President
Kennedy, with whom he had nothing in common but youthful election
to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen blew him away by noting sharply and correctly, ``I knew
John Kennedy. John Kennedy was a friend of mine. And you, senator,
are no John Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The barb had the immediately recognizable ring of truth, and it
has stood the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is in the basement in the polls. He is already blaming
the press and the ``elites'' for his lack of political support, a
sure sign of a weak candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he running for the presidency? Does he want to emulate
Harold Stassen? Does he think Americans are idiots?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he misses being the target of late night television
jokes. Monica Lewinsky is gone, we hope. Room for Quayle again.

`MARIKO MORI:' DRAWING ON A RICH LODE OF SHINTO-BUDDHIST CULTURE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Japanese-born artist Mariko Mori, 32, has been an
art-world darling in the past few years, and it's easy to see why.
Her videos and billboard-size computer-generated photographs, in
all of which she appears, are smart, beguiling things,
technologically at the head of the class and as laced with
addictive riffs as inspired pop songs.
</P>
<P>
   Her work also touches on a number of subjects in vogue at the
moment: adolescent fantasy, narcissicism, fashion. It surely comes
as an answered prayer to a segment of the art establishment _
middle-aged, white and male for the most part _ that has been
campaigning for something called a Return to Beauty as a decade of
impassioned, opinionated, often intransigently messy esthetic
activity winds down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mariko Mori: Empty Dream'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art
through Aug. 15 is the first local showcase of the artist's work
and has already been seen in edited versions in London, Chicago,
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. It's a career survey, though the career
covered isn't much more than five years old. The work itself, about
a dozen pieces, feels stretched a bit thin over the wide expanses
of Brooklyn's contemporary galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But insubstantiality, even emptiness of various kinds, are among
Ms. Mori's themes, and she makes entertaining and increasingly
interesting uses of them. In her earliest photos (like all her work
they represent the efforts of a substantial production crew) she
turns a jaundiced but intensely engaged Warholian eye on the
floating world of consumer culture, particularly on a vapid fashion
industry. The latter she knows from the inside: she graduated from
fashion school in Tokyo, worked for a while as a model and still
designs her own costumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the three-panel ``Play With Me'' (1994) she is seen standing
outside a busy Tokyo video store, dressed in form-fitting plastic
armor and a cascading turquoise Barbie wig. She looks like a cross
between a samurai waif and a robotic streetwalker who may have
materialized from the video game beside her.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Tea Ceremony III'' (1995), she is an interplanetary geisha,
dispensing tea to businessmen. Her ``office lady'' uniform is
regulation black, but her tight-fitting silver cap has pointy
Martian ears. In ``Birth of a Star'' (1996), named for a television
talent show, she is the demonic punk incarnation of the look-alike,
sound-alike ingenue singers who are Japan's premier teeny-bop
idols.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, the work gets bigger and spacier.
Consumerist jokes still prevail in the towering, multipanel ``Empty
Dream'' (1995). Ms. Mori shows up as a mermaid here, though the
real attraction is the setting, an indoor Japanese theme park that
replicates a tropical beach. But despite the picture's size, it
really doesn't say much new. Hybrid creature, hybrid world; made
for each other. That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Then with two works from 1996, the short video ``Miko no Inori''
(``The Shaman-Girl's Prayer'') and the photo mural ``Last
Departure,'' Ms. Mori moves into a different, distinctive, more
mysterious realm. In the video, which plays simultaneously on five
small screens, she looks coquettishly extraterrestrial. With silver
hair and menthol-blue eyes, she rotates and massages a glass globe
in her hands as if conjuring the future.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Last Departure'' she assumes the same persona but is shown
full length and in triplicate, enshrined inside a fabulous
spaceship (actually a digitally morphed image of Osaka's
hypermodern Kansai airport). There's an iconic cast to this triad:
the figures suggest Buddhist Barbarellas. So it's no surprise to
find Buddhist and Shinto goddesses taking over in the work that
follows.
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-D video ``Nirvana'' (1996-97) _ the title refers to the
blissful emptiness that is the goal of Buddhist spiritual practice
_ Ms. Mori appears as the popular deity Kichijoten, in a
peach-colored kimono and floating over a Dead Sea landscape tinted
an acidic orange-pink. She executes a sequence of ritual gestures,
accompanied by a band of cartoon musicians who zoom out toward the
viewer before the whole scene dissolves into galactic mist.
</P>
<P>
   Four panoramic photos continue the Buddhist theme in tableaux of
the four elements. In one, ``Burning Desire,'' the artist is a
multi-armed tantric bodhisattva wearing Tibetan-style robes and
levitating over a bleak stretch of the Gobi Desert in Central Asia,
through which Buddhism traveled eastward from India. Four guardian
figures (Ms. Mori again), chic in lama hats and embroidered silk
halter tops, float on clouds of flame around her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mori's blend of eclectic religious symbolism, cyber
technology and pop culture is well informed on all three fronts.
When she turns her attention to Japanese spirituality, as she does
in the recent two-part ``Kumano,'' the results are even more
complex and erudite.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to a Pacific peninsula in the south of Japan's
main island, a region of breathtaking natural beauty saturated in
religious myth. It is the site of an important Buddhist pilgrimage
circuit; legendarily Buddhist saints departed in boats from its
shores in search of the Pure Land paradise. Also here are some of
the country's highest waterfalls, many of them worshiped as Shinto
gods. The sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom the imperial family
descends, has her shrine at nearby Ise.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Kumano'' photo-mural, a purifying waterfall streams
down through a grove of cedar trees; a high-tech forest shrine
hovers like an apparition, as does Ms. Mori herself in the guise of
the sun goddess with her symbolic mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, the image of the goddess flitting like a ray of
light among the trees alternates with a scene of Ms. Mori
performing the tea ceremony, whose elaborate etiquette she learned
as a child. She gives it an unconventional tweak here by including
an ancient bronze Chinese vessel among the utensils she uses, yet
another indication of the hybrid, pan-Asian nature of much of her
recent work.
</P>
<P>
   This synthesizing bent is summed up in the show's single
sculpture, ``Enlightenment Capsule,'' a clear tear-drop-shaped
container enclosing a large plastic lotus. The lotus is a Buddhist
symbol of purity. In this piece it is illuminated by sunlight
brought into the museum by fiber-optic cable and cleansed of
harmful ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering process was invented by the artist's father, the
late Kei Mori, and is used in Japan to light urban underground
offices. ``Enlightenment Capsule,'' in which spirituality and
science merge, is a memorial to him. (Reportedly, the lotus
radiates a polychromatic glow on sunny days; it didn't when I was
there in a rainstorm.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Ms. Mori is piling more and more into
her work, both in terms of ideas and of technology. She has
certainly tapped into a rich source of material in Shinto-Buddhist
culture, one which has been fruitfully explored by many postwar
Japanese artists, Hiroshi Sugimoto among them. She cannily spices
it up with dashes of super-hot Japanese animation,
pleasure-principle sensuality and a sense _ Warholian again _ of
the near-devotional power of glamour, celestial or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Is the result a feel-good, passive, New Age art, technically
advanced but ideologically conservative, the opposite of the
body-fixated, mortality-obsessed work that preceded it in the
1990's? Will its shelf life be as short as yesterday's hit single?
It is hard to say, and ``Empty Dreams'' leaves such questions up in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   What it does confirm, though, is the presence of a young and
prodigiously gifted artist who has taken big leaps in a few short
years. She has moved beyond, or at least refined and recast, the
subjects that initially made her popular, and has begun to create
an art that is personal, national and global, one that turns a
culture's most revered myths into a Space Age drama of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Where she will take all of this, and whether she will bring her
original audience with her, remains to be seen. But at this point,
it looks as if the future is on her side. &QL;

   Saturday is the 35th anniversary of the introduction of the
Mustang, which was unveiled at the New York World's Fair in April
1964. Although it may be too late to park your Mustang among the
3,000 expected at Lowe's Motor Speedway (formerly Charlotte Motor
Speedway) in Concord, N.C., where the Mustang Club of America is
holding its anniversary get-together through Sunday, there are
plenty of products on sale all year to help one celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. is selling a set of 41 Mustang trading cards
for $9.95 and a commemorative poster for $6.95; they can be ordered
by calling (877) 359-3277. There's also a Mustang edition of
Monopoly, with pewter playing pieces including a '65 fastback and
the original front grille. (No, the ``Go to Jail'' square is not
represented by the unloved Mustang II).
</P>
<P>
   This summer there will be Midtown Madness, a CD-ROM racing game
developed by Microsoft that lets players choose any of 10 Mustangs
to do battle with traffic, pedestrians and the police on the
streets of Chicago.  &QR;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Occasional rain will fall in a swath from northern Illinois to
southern New England as deep low pressure moves slowly eastward
over the southern Great Lakes. Accompanying the rain will be gusty
breezes from the northeast, adding a damp chill to the air. Farther
west, rain showers will end as snow showers and flurries across
southern Minnesota and Iowa. Low clouds will circulate around the
storm into Arkansas and western Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The upper-level support for the storm in the form of a
disturbance at 18,000 feet will cross the Ohio Valley. This
disturbance will spawn several lines of showers and thunderstorms
across Ohio and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Bright sunshine will develop in the Carolinas and southeastern
Virginia as gusty winds from the southwest descend the east slopes
of the Appalachian Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front attendant to the Great Lakes low will trudge across
Florida during the day, bringing a few thunderstorms to central and
southern portions of the state. However, the spotty rains will
provide little relief from the drought gripping the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies but very chilly air will cover most areas of the
central Plains and Western states as high pressure remains perched
in the foothills of the Rockies. A few low clouds will be trapped
in the light winds beneath the high pressure, insuring another
dull, wintry day along the Front Range in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast states will be sunny and very warm with the
exception of a few high thin clouds arriving along the Oregon and
northern California coast by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Power of Wind
</P>
<P>
   Strong, gusty winds blowing across the Plains Thursday prompted
advisories for motorists driving high-profile vehicles. When the
wind blows, it exerts a force on a given area of an object. As the
wind increases, its force also increases as the square of the wind
speed. That is, the force per unit area of a wind of 20 mph is four
times greater than the force of a wind of 10 mph. The total force
exerted on a van, for example, which has a high profile and thus a
large area, can become mighty when crosswinds are strong, sometimes
causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

HUNTSMAN CORP. AGREES TO PAY $2.7 BILLION FOR IMPERIAL CHEMICAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Utah)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Huntsman Corp. said Thursday that it would pay $2.7 billion
for control of four businesses owned by Imperial Chemical
Industries of Britain, a deal that would make Huntsman the world's
largest privately held chemical company.
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman's annual sales would more than double, to $7.4 billion,
under the deal. The four Imperial businesses would go into a joint
venture, of which Huntsman would own 70 percent. Huntsman would buy
Imperial's share of the venture in three years, at a price
negotiated then.
</P>
<P>
   For Huntsman, based in Salt Lake City, the deal represents quick
entry into Asia and parts of Europe where Imperial is strong but
Huntsman is virtually unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Jon M. Huntsman, the company's chairman, said its overseas
invisibility was an important reason for pursuing the joint
venture. ``It was important to signal to Asian customers that there
would be a transition, that this wasn't an abrupt end to ICI,''
Huntsman said. He said the venture would be called Huntsman ICI for
a year, then renamed Huntsman International.
</P>
<P>
   For Imperial, the sale means that it can pay down part of its
$6.4 billion debt, much of it left over from the $8 billion
purchase of Unilever's specialty hemicals operations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deal that ICI needed to do,'' said Frank J. Mitsch, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes less than four months after American and European
regulators scuttled Imperial's plans to sell its titanium dioxide
business, which is included in the Huntsman package, to DuPont and
NL Industries for $1 billion. Since Huntsman and Imperial have
complementary markets and products, and since the deal is a joint
venture, few analysts expect regulatory opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic impact on each company is less clear. Both have
been shedding commodity chemicals _ lookalike chemicals like
styrene that sell by the ton and are differentiated only by price _
and focusing on specialty chemicals, technologically complex
products like foams with small niche markets and high profit
margins. Each says the deal furthers that goal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, they are both right. Some of the businesses _
petrochemicals like aromatics and olefins used to make plastics,
for example _ are clearly commodities. Others, like polyurethane
foams used in car interiors and shoes, are generally accepted as
specialties. Several analysts suggested that selling polyurethanes
was the price Imperial paid to get Huntsman to buy aromatics.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the other products involved in the deal are open to
hairsplitting over definition. For example, titanium dioxide is a
low-technology white pigment generally sold in bulk _ hence,
Imperial labels it a commodity. Yet, since titanium dioxide, which
is used in paints, paper and plastics, has shown better price
stability than most commodity chemicals, Huntsman counts it as a
specialty chemical.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the definitions, analysts say Huntsman got the better
of the deal. ``The price isn't even adding to ICI's earnings,''
said Peter Blair, Salomon Smith Barney's European chemicals
analyst. Others say Huntsman will wring huge costs, and thus heavy
profit, out of the businesses. ``Jon Huntsman is one of the best
managers in the chemical industry,'' said J. Jeffrey Cianci, a
portfolio manager at Jesup Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial may do better in its future dealings with Huntsman.
Chemicals prices have been depressed for a while, but are soon
expected to rise. That could affect the price Huntsman pays
Imperial for its acrylics business, which Huntsman is talking about
purchasing. Huntsman concedes that if chemical prices are high in
three years he must pay a rich price for Imperial's share of the
joint venture. ``No question, if the market goes up, they can ride
up with it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Long shadows: Past is prologue in the Balkans
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was, as Robert D. Kaplan arrestingly wrote, ``the grand old
man of dissent before the world had ever heard of Lech Walesa.'' We
easily forget. For that matter, Milovan Djilas himself is
forgotten, a period piece from a time we thought was past. But the
past is never past in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Kaplan paid a visit to Djilas' apartment whenever
he visited Belgrade. Kaplan was living in Greece and reporting
periodically on Yugoslavia for The Atlantic Monthly and The New
Republic. There wasn't much company. As Kaplan wrote in ``Balkan
Ghosts: A Journey Through History'' (Vintage Books, $13 paperback),
it was ``a lonely task because few were interested in what was
going on in the place, or where it might be headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Djilas was one who did, a former communist who broke with
Marshall Tito after Tito had broken with Stalin. ``After the first
few visits,'' Kaplan wrote, ``our conversations became eerie
affairs, because I realized that Djilas was always right. He was
able to predict the future. His technique was a simple one for an
East European, but a difficult one for an American: He seemed to
ignore the daily newspapers and think purely historically. The
present for him was merely a stage of the past moving quickly into
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans' blissful ignorance
</P>
<P>
   When Kaplan finished ``Balkan Ghosts'' in 1990, no publisher was
interested in a book on the ethnic fissures in Yugoslavia. The
Balkans? Where are they again? Like Rebecca West's classic ``Black
Lamb and Grey Falcon,'' Kaplan's is ``an idiosyncratic travel
book,'' and one whose real subject is the grip of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Americans had never heard of Kosovo, could
not have told you who the Serbs were, who the Albanians were, why
each hated the other and why, 500 years after a historic battle
that was news to Americans, people were being slaughtered in the
name of ethnic purity. They only knew what they read in the paper
or saw on TV, and in both the sense of Balkan history was
breathtakingly nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that it was in the Balkans that the most murderous
century on record began, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was
assassinated in 1914 by a young Bosnian Serb. Within weeks all of
Europe was at war. And it is apparently with the Balkans that the
century will end, the same age-old hatreds
</P>
<P>
   refueled.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, just for the record, was the Battle of Kosovo, and
it took place in the year 1389. On June 28, in a place consecrated
as the Field of Blackbirds, the Turks ``delivered the final defeat
to the Serbs,'' as Kaplan writes, ``leaving their bodies for
carrion birds to devour.'' In 1989, as the West watched in
disbelief as the Soviet Union imploded, Serbs commemorated the
600th anniversary of a defeat they cannot forget. Granted, it is
not simply a battle in the 14th century they live with, but also
the collective memory of 500 years under Islamic Turkish rule. Even
so, past haunts present.
</P>
<P>
   In certain parts of the world, there is no end to it, and a
Westerner wonders, naively, how it ever got that way. Religion, as
ever, is at the heart of it, mounting crusades at a pope's command,
enjoining the faithful to undertake holy wars, subjugating people
who worship a different God _ or the same God but in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   `Like Lebanon. Wait and see'
</P>
<P>
   From later visits to Belgrade Kaplan recalls sitting in Djilas'
apartment and hearing of the cataclysm to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Yugoslavia?'' Kaplan asked in the wake of Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms and subsequent unrest in the Soviet Union.
Djilas smiled and answered: ``Like Lebanon. Wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Djilas was a man tough enough to have negotiated one-on-one with
Joseph Stalin, and prescient enough to have seen the past in the
future: Slobodan ``Milosevic's authoritarianism in Serbia is
provoking real separation. Remember what Hegel said, that history
repeats itself as tragedy and farce. What I mean to say is that
when Yugoslavia disintegrates this time around, the outside world
will not intervene as it did in 1914.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it has, proving Djilas wrong on at least one count. But the
hatred of one for another had always been there. Local in nature
but international in consequence, it was the dynamic that drove
Balkan history. As he traveled about Yugoslavia, Kaplan kept with
him wherever he went a copy of West's ``Black Lamb and Grey
Falcon,'' a thousand pages of excursions into Byzantine
archaeology, pagan folklore, Christian and Islamic thought and the
fascist mind that forever haunts Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a warning, of near-perfect clairvoyance, of the danger
that totalitarianism posed to Europe in 1940 and beyond,'' he
writes. Then as now, people starved, died with bullets in their
backs, ran for their lives, fearfully cradled their children,
prayed to God for help that did not come. Some need only witness
history. It was their fate to live it.

 &HT;    Atlanta-based booker sells fun in the sun
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vacation Express has taken an express route itself. In
only a decade, the Atlanta-based company has grown from a
small-time outfit offering a handful of Jamaican getaways to one of
the Southeast's leading tour operators. It books 140,000 travelers
a year on excursions throughout the Caribbean and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Vacation Express was bought by Air Tours, a leading
international operator based in Britain. Co-founder Kevin
Hernandez, who remains Vacation Express' president, is upbeat about
the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know they are dealing with a reputable
company,'' he says. ``Air Tours has been around for 22 years. They
have credibility with the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacation Express recently added Costa Rica to its list of
destinations, which include Cancun, Nassau, St. Croix and Grand
Cayman. But Hernandez says there are no plans to expand beyond the
Caribbean and Mexico. ``We feel it's best to stay focused,'' he
says, adding that package tours to Cancun account for about 70
percent of business.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to expand into the cruise market. On April 26,
vacationers can begin making reservations for two seven-night
Caribbean cruises, the first offered by the company. The Air
Tours-owned cruise line will be called Sun Cruises.
</P>
<P>
   One cruise departs from Aruba beginning Nov. 20, with two
itineraries _ Barbados, St. Lucia, Granada, Margarita Island and
Curacao; and Barbados, Antigua, St. Martin and St. Kitts. The other
cruise sets sail from Cancun beginning Nov. 27, and visits Cozumel,
Honduras, Grand Cayman and Jamaica. Prices start at $599 for Cancun
and $749 for Aruba and include port charges, meals and
entertainment. Airfare is extra.
</P>
<P>
   As with other operators, Vacation Express tours are priced
according to accommodations, date of departure and length of stay.
In addition to offering last-minute discounts on trips that are
slow sellers, the company regularly slashes prices on off-season
trips. A $399 budget trip to Cancun, for instance, can go for as
little as $299 in the fall, when tourism to the Caribbean is down.
</P>
<P>
   Based on customer feedback, accommodations at each destination
are classified as ``budget,'' ``moderate,'' ``deluxe,'' ``luxury''
or ``ultra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a hotel doesn't meet our customers' expectations, we lower
the rating,'' says Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on Vacation Express tours, call
404-321-7742 or visit the Web at www.vacationexpress.com. To book a
package tour, call 404-315-4848 or 1-800-309-4717.

 &HT;    Even with a discount package, Mexico's tourist capital can be a
budget-buster
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANCUN, Mexico _ It wasn't a good omen.
</P>
<P>
   I had, with some skepticism, signed up for an el cheapo package
to Cancun _ $399 for round-trip air and three nights in a hotel to
be named later. And here we were, halfway to Mexico's sun and
tourista capital and the plane was _ what? _ turning around. A flap
on the chartered Boeing 727's wing, it seems, had gotten stuck.
</P>
<P>
   I was worried I'd gotten stuck, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the comic relief: In rambling, fractured English, the
pilot attempted to explain the unfortunate turn of events. ``We
apologize,'' he grumbled over the intercom, ``for the
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he meant ``inconvenience.'' Or maybe he was just being
blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, a sense of unease came over me as we took off from
Hartsfield the second time, after a quick fix. My mission had been
to experience one of those too-good-to-be-true Cancun deals you see
advertised everywhere _ this one offered by the Atlanta-based tour
operator Vacation Express. I would determine, in the name of
consumer advocacy, if it was a bargain or a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Before departing, I had been inundated with cautionary counsel.
My travel agent attempted to warn me away from the trip, having
heard reports of inferior accommodations and endless airport waits
on other budget excursions. My upstairs neighbor regaled me with
stories of hotel roulette _ he had lucked into posh digs on his
last visit, but friends who had shelled out an equal amount of
money found themselves in an aging lodge with cramped, cavelike
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague characterized Cancun as ``like Miami Beach, but
cheesier.'' Another one raised the specter of a vengeful Montezuma
and urged me to avoid drinking the water _ or even eating lettuce
and other food washed in it _ at all cost.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters scarier, I was going during spring break, when
legions of drunken, hormonally charged college students turn Cancun
into a 24-7 frat party. MTV was even filming its annual spring
break special there this year.
</P>
<P>
   A retired couple I met on the plane, Bill and Charlotte McCary
of Rome, Ga., seemed to have the right attitude about the impending
craziness. ``Our granddaughter told us, `Don't come back without a
piercing!' '' chuckled Charlotte, 65.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCarys could laugh at a distance _ they were staying at
an all-inclusive resort far from the throbbing discos and pungent
beer bars. I was staying at ground zero, in the heart of Cancun's
hotel zone.
</P>
<P>
   Would the taut, tanned teen crowd take one look at my graying
goatee and pronounced paunch and shout, ``Hit the road, Pops?''
Would I be stuck in some Mexican version of the Bates Motel? Would
I accidentally ingest some lettuce and become a human hostel for a
roiling mass of parasitos?
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the only thing I had to fear in Cancun was
fear itself. That, and running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Sun 'n' funds
</P>
<P>
   Ka-ching! The cash register bell went off in my head as I tipped
the porter who carried my luggage to a waiting bus outside the
Cancun airport. That sound, along with tunes by Madonna, which
seemed to be playing in every restaurant, nightclub, store and
vehicle I entered, would haunt me for my entire trip.
</P>
<P>
   As we rolled past an endless procession of billboards _ Wet 'n'
Wild! Outback Steakhouse! McDonald's! _ on our way to the hotel
zone, our bus host told us that the water in Cancun was purified
and we should feel free to guzzle it at our leisure. I remained
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   He then gave us the lowdown on the city's ``time-share sharks.''
These people troll Cancun's street corners, shopping centers and
even some hotel lobbies, luring innocent travelers into
interminable time-share presentations with promises of free meals
and tour discounts. ``Remember, if you don't sign up for a
time-share, you don't get anything,'' the guide warned. ``And
you've just wasted five or six hours of your vacation listening to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The time-share sharks are just one of the more flagrant examples
of Cancun's relentless pursuit of cash. Everywhere you go, the city
nervily thrusts its collective hand into your pocket. In the crafts
markets, where trinket peddlers beckon you with cries of ``Come
into my shop, just for the hell of it!'' and, most oddly, ``Buy
something for your neighbor's wife!'' In the discos, where hotsy
cocktail waitresses grab you by the face and try to force $2 shots
down your throat. And in the streets, where determined urchins wave
colorful yarn bracelets at tourists and screech, ``One dollar! One
dollar!''
</P>
<P>
   Budget vacation? Ha!
</P>
<P>
   I even felt that insistent paw at my hotel, the Cancun Clipper
Club. A low-slung, unpretentious resort with a hacienda feel, the
Clipper Club is tucked, with stunning metaphorical appropriateness,
between a chaotic crafts market and a TGIFriday's.
</P>
<P>
   Besides accommodations, my package tour included round-trip
airfare and bus transfers to and from the Cancun airport.
Everything else, from the hotel's continental breakfast (including
Frosted Flakes, here known as ``Zucaritas'') to the room safes, was
extra.
</P>
<P>
   After checking in, I linked up with my tour representative,
assigned by Vacation Express to pitch me on various activities in
and around Cancun. Within minutes, she had sold me on something
called a Jet Ski Jungle Tour ($38) and a morning of horseback
riding on the beach ($53).
</P>
<P>
   Most package trips include such tour touters, and though meeting
with them isn't mandatory, I was glad I did. I wouldn't have missed
cantering in the shocking-blue Caribbean surf atop the feisty steed
Lucero. Or Jet Skiing through mangrove-lined canals to a becalmed
inlet for a snorkeling interlude over picture-perfect coral beds.
</P>
<P>
   I had just wrapped up my powwow with the Royale Tours agent when
a representative from the hotel approached me and invited me to a
``welcoming party'' by the pool that evening. I went up to my room
_ a clean, no-frills studio with a kitchenette and tile floors _
unpacked, washed up, took a nap and bounded down to the fiesta
around 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   A mariachi band was bopping through ``La Bamba.'' People were
milling about, sipping margaritas. I noticed a buffet on the far
side of the pool. Strolling over, I grabbed a plate and immediately
came upon a heaping bowl of lettuce. I backed slowly away, my
stomach churning, and headed for the plates of cheese quesadillas
and steam-trays of barbecue chicken.
</P>
<P>
   After loading up my plate, I turned to find a seat by the pool
and came face to face with a woman brandishing a receipt pad and a
money pouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be $15, please,'' she said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Ka-ching!
</P>
<P>
   . . . And this ancient
</P>
<P>
   structure dates back
</P>
<P>
   to the Carter era
</P>
<P>
   You don't go to Cancun looking for history. Those awesome Mayan
ruins that draw archaeology buffs to the Yucatan Peninsula are an
hour or two away, in Chichen Itza to the west and Tulum to the
south. The picturesque fishing village and pirate's graveyard on
Isla Mujeres is an hourlong boat ride north.
</P>
<P>
   Cancun has . . . gorgeous ocean vistas . . . and (here's
something you don't see everyday) malls!
</P>
<P>
   The Forum, anchored by a mammoth Hard Rock Cafe, casts its
corporate shadow over sunbathers on the Playa Gaviota Azul, a
crowded public beach. The Plaza Caracol, next to the Cancun
Convention Center, entices wealthy shoppers with its Waterford,
Gucci and Cartier boutiques. The Plaza Flamingo houses outposts of
the U.S.-based chain restaurants Pat O'Brien's and Planet
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Founded just 29 years ago on a 13-mile, inverted L-shaped strip
of fine white sand on Mexico's Caribbean coast, Cancun was never
intended to be anything other than a tourist town. Yet, for a place
often criticized for its inauthenticity, it may be the most
authentic example of Mexican ingenuity and enterprise. The city has
brought breathtaking bounty to a region previously known for bloody
conflict (Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortez battled Mayan
warriors on the nearby island of Cozumel in 1519) and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   You sense that everyone's determined not to kill the golden
goose. Crime is rare, usually limited to the occasional
pickpocketing. And the hospitality is unsurpassed. The term I heard
repeated by the locals most often, other than various monetary
amounts, was ``amigo.''
</P>
<P>
   The influx of visiting ``amigos'' represents a better life for
many who would otherwise suffer from Mexico's depressed economy.
Like 20-year-old Roberto Mendoza, who moved to Cancun from
Veracruz, Mexico, seven months ago. In that time, he has learned
serviceable English and has landed a job as a waiter at the
disco/cafe Club Xtreme. Mendoza's parents and siblings will soon
join him, leaving behind their hometown for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Veracruz, jobs are so-so,'' he said. ``But in Cancun,
wow.''

   CANCUN, Mexico: in Cancun, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you say ``party
</P>
<P>
   'til you puke'' in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   ``Vaya con Dios (Go with God),'' I mumbled to the slight,
shirtless youth who was sleeping the morning away in the stairwell
of my hotel. As I gingerly stepped over him, I wondered how many
college-age revelers had bopped till they dropped in stairwells,
bathtubs and poolside cabana chairs across the hotel zone.
</P>
<P>
   February brings Mexican students, on break. The summer months
draw Brazilian tourists, while Europeans usually venture over
around the Christmas holidays. But from roughly the first of March
through Easter weekend, young Americans own Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   They travel in packs from party palace to party palace, guzzling
flaming shots of tequila at Dady Rock, flashing flesh at La Boom's
bikini and hot male body contests, downing toxic margaritas at
Senor Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hooley, a 40-year-old engineer from Norcross, thought it all
a little familiar. ``It's no different from Atlanta on a Saturday
night,'' he reasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Hooley was sipping beer on the beach with three new pals from
Canada, all several years older than the average spring breaker.
Mike Smith, a stocky, 26-year-old car salesman from Nova Scotia,
found the discos ``intimidating. You go into a place like La Boom,
and there are all these pumped-up guys with their shirts off. If we
go in there to try and pick up chicks, forget it.'' Nevertheless,
Smith was drawn to Cancun in part because he read on the Internet
that it had the best guy-to-girl ratio of all the spring break hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe all that you read, gringo: At times, Cancun seems
like it's populated almost exclusively by skinny-legged,
baseball-capped, glassy-eyed dudes.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the males simply make a more forceful impression.
Carolyn Gillen, down for a week of ``sun and partying'' with three
other 21-year-old Tufts University female undergrads, lamented the
guys in the bars ``trying to grope us all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Complained Bridget Mazour: ``It's like birds to food.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillen, an international relations major like Mazour, shared her
list of ways to spurn would-be suitors. ``Moving away and dancing
with the girls you came with is a tactic we use often. Dirty looks
work, so does elbowing them. And if all else fails, you just look
them in the eye and say you have absolutely no interest in them
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite those pesky guys, all four were glad they'd come.
They had previously spent spring break in Florida and pronounced
Cancun more beautiful, its weather more dependable. ``I know it's
cheesy here,'' admitted Mazour. ``But I think Daytona Beach is
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the fray
</P>
<P>
   While chatting with Bill and Charlotte McCary on the flight
down, I suggested we get together later during the trip. I had in
mind a nice, leisurely lunch at some seaside cafe, where we would
share notes on Cancun's pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarys, however, were feeling a bit more adventurous.
``We're taking you parasailing,'' insisted Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Given that my two biggest phobias are the ocean and heights, I'd
sooner have painful dental surgery while dancing naked at my high
school prom. But Charlotte had parasailed on previous visits and
promised there was nothing to it. ``They just wench you out off the
back of the boat and then reel you back in,'' she said
nonchalantly. Even Bill was going to do it, and he had bruised ribs
from falling off a ladder a few days before.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I found myself squatting in a harness on the back
of a modified fishing boat at sunset on the last full day of my
trip. I had already been quite the daredevil that day. After
brushing my teeth with water from the tap that morning and wolfing
down a turkey sandwich _ with lettuce! _ for lunch, I set off to
meet the dreaded parasailing vessel at the McCarys' hotel, the Blue
Bay Club Marina in the tiny, dusty village of Puerto Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   There was a marked contrast between the McCarys' accommodations
and mine. Their package _ also offered by Vacation Express, at
about $500 per person _ included free meals, an open bar, admission
to the resort's musical shows and discos, access to a secluded
beach stocked with Jet Skis and sailboats. Their accommodations
were a one-bedroom suite, complete with a full kitchen, living room
and dining area. The only drawback, for party animals anyway, was
location _ Cancun was a 30-minute boat or bus ride away.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, when we made it to the dock, the boat captain and his
one-man crew looked weary from dragging spring breakers around the
Bahia de Mujeres (Bay of Women). Great, I thought. In their
exhaustion, they'd probably forget to hook up my harness correctly
and I'd plummet to a certain death. Or they'd pull me too fast, the
parachute would rip and I'd plummet to a certain death.
</P>
<P>
   As I ever so courageously stepped up for my turn, the captain
threw the boat in gear and the parachute, emblazened with the
Corona emblem, caught the wind behind me. As the 280 feet of rope
unspooled, I put a white-knuckle hold on the harness straps and
shut my eyes. Every so often, a kink in the spool would send a jolt
up the line. I'd bark a word that would make a nun blush and grip
the harness even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, I was at the end of my rope. Literally. I looked
right _ the sun was sinking from a cloudless sky, casting a
burnt-orange glow on Cancun's resort towers. I looked down _ dark
coral beds and sprawling white sand bars peeped through the clear
blue bay waters.
</P>
<P>
   I relaxed. I even smiled. I think I was finally starting to get
Cancun. My vacation had been no bargain _ I had spent at least $400
over my package tour price on meals, tips, tours, tips, nightclub
cover charges and . . . uh, did I mention tips? But I'd gladly part
with all that dinero again for another glimpse of this
heart-stopping view.
</P>
<P>
   Up here, there was no Madonna, no listing frat-boys bellowing
``Ohio State is in the house!'' Below, I knew that Cancun was
ka-ching-ing away. But I was too high to hear it.

 &HT;    If you go: Cancun
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Cancun is 880 miles southwest of Atlanta, on
the northeast tip of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Other than charter
flights offered by many tour operators, AeroMexico (in conjunction
with Delta) is the only airline that makes daily nonstop flights
from Hartsfield. Round-trip fares are $248 (weekdays), $278
(weekends). You can book through either AeroMexico or Delta; the
AeroMexico fare is good through May, the Delta fare is open-ended.
Flights on American Airlines connect in Miami; flights on
Continental Airlines connect in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting in: You will need a passport or birth certificate and
a photo ID to enter Mexico. Keep these in a safe place during your
stay. You need them to get out, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to pack: Cancun's average temperature is about 80 degrees
year-round, but it can get considerably hotter on summer
afternoons. Pack clothes suitable for warm weather; shorts,
loose-fitting shirts and sandals are the typical Cancun uniform.
Most restaurants, bars and shops have come-as-you-are dress codes,
but you might bring one nice outfit for that special evening out.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cashing in: The exchange rate fluctuates, but usually not
drastically. (The current rate is about 9.4 pesos for every
dollar.) Some people prefer to lock into one rate by exchanging all
their money at the beginning of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. currency is accepted virtually everywhere in Cancun.
And it can be costly to change pesos back into dollars. If you're
not sure about how much you're going to spend on the trip, keep
your dollars, or only exchange a small portion of them. Most
merchants will give you change in pesos, and you can use the spare
Mexican coins for tips, trinkets and bus rides.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get on the bus: Rental cars are available in Cancun, but not
recommended. Traffic is heavy and the drivers tend to be
aggressive. Also, traveling by taxi is expensive _ a cab ride from
the airport to the hotel zone can run you $25. There are no meters
in Cancun taxis. Drivers determine price, but you can haggle.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, buses run every five minutes around the clock between
the hotel zone and downtown Cancun. One-way fare is around 45
cents. Most tours to nearby attractions, such as the ruins of
Chichen Itza and the islands of Isla Mujeres and Cozumel, include
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other package tours: Delta Vacations offers ``standard,''
``preferred'' and ``ultimate'' packages to Cancun and Cozumel. For
information and pricing contact a travel agent or call
1-800-755-4224. Or visit the Web site, www.deltavacations.com.
</P>
<P>

Vacations, available through a travel agent, or visit

   HOLLYWOOD _ By her own admission, Courtney Love, the onetime
enfant terrible of the rock music world, does not respond well to
the word no. But in a long, enthusiastic interview here, she said
she was already prepared to hear the dreaded word as she gears up
to tackle her new love, movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love has formed a production company, Epitome Productions,
and it has just signed up its first project, ``I Think We're Alone
Now,'' a coming-of-age comedy.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Ms. Love said, she and her Epitome partner, Janet
Billig, will be producers, along with the independent production
house Dimension Films, which is run by the Weinstein brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Love said what she really wanted to do was direct, and
she wanted this project to mark her debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I want to direct,'' Ms. Love said. ``Actually, I
want to direct pretty soon,'' she added. ``Actually, I have a real
fire in my belly about this. I'm going to make a real pitch to
direct this movie, and I know they're going to say, `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``Usually I just persist and get it done. But in
this case if there's a rational reason, I'll listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love, 33, has evolved beyond her alternative rock
beginnings. She played a prominent part in Milos Forman's movie
``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' as the pornographer's drug-addicted
wife. She received a number of honors for her role, including the
New York Film Critics Circle Award for best supporting actress. She
also had a role in ``200 Cigarettes,'' a recent coming-of-age film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said that her heart was still in her music, and that
she was still working with her band, Hole. In fact, she added, she
was about to go on a tour with the group. But she said that a great
passion in recent years had been studying the movie-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge, really huge fan of movies, and I've been studying
probably everything about them in my autodidactic way,'' she said.
She added that Epitome is also developing an idea for a television
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said one reason she had been drawn into the world of
film was that her best friends these days were producers,
specifically, female producers. For instance, she said that she had
become close with Stacey Sher, an executive at Jersey Films, Danny
DeVito's film company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The naturally stylish, mentoring ladies that I've been meeting
have been producers as opposed to people in music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love emphasized that she was very ambitious for commercial
as well as artistic success in the world of film. ``I'm being
honest,'' she said. ``It's important that people know I'm a
businesswoman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love said that she intended to act in some of her projects,
and that she already had two other films in the works. One will be
done jointly with Drew Barrymore's production company, and a third
is being set up with Jersey Films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my vinyl,'' she said. ``I love my albums. I also just
read the greatest script I've ever read, by Cameron Crowe. This is
where I'm at. I've matured a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Batting Two for Three
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Berman compares movie-making to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bat one for three, you're a star,'' said Berman,
chairman of Village Roadshow Pictures, a production company. ``As
in baseball, you strike out every now and then, but hopefully not
too often.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not been a problem for Berman so far. His company is
just 18 months old, and of its first three releases, two _ ``The
Matrix'' and ``Analyze This'' _ have been home runs. Even better,
those successes have helped revive, at least temporarily, the
sagging fortunes of Warner Brothers, its co-producers on the films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' and ``Analyze This'' have been the two biggest
hits of the year. After just two weeks, ``The Matrix,'' a
science-fiction thriller that reportedly cost slightly less than
$70 million to make, has earned $73.3 million. ``Analyze This,'' a
comedy about a mafia boss who seeks help from a therapist, cost
about $45 million and has earned $86 million since its opening a
little over a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Village Roadshow's third release, ``Practical Magic,'' with
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, has earned about $50 million
since its release last fall, about the same as it cost. ``My job
right now is making my partners understand this is not the way it's
going to always be,'' Berman said. ``I think this is partly
beginner's luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Village Roadshow represents two important Hollywood trends:
companies outside the business trying to produce movies and
companies involved in co-productions with big studios.
</P>
<P>
   Village Roadshow Pictures is a subsidiary of a big Australian
theater and entertainment company, Village Roadshow Limited, which,
like many companies with some involvement in distributing
entertainment products, has been trying for several years to
develop its own movies. The company also has an important
connection to Warner Brothers, where Berman, a lawyer by training,
used to work as president of worldwide production.
</P>
<P>
   All the big studios have been doing more co-productions these
days, in which they pay just part of the cost of big movies as a
way of sharing the risks. This method limits the profits on big
successes, but it also limits losses on the all-too-frequent duds.
</P>
<P>
   Village Roadshow has a co-production arrangement under which it
splits the cost of producing its movies with Warner Brothers, which
handles the distribution and marketing of the films. Berman said
that of the movies he would produce with Warner, some would be
developed creatively at Warner and some at Village Roadshow.
</P>
<P>
   The young company has $300 million to invest in movies. It has
promised to help produce 20 movies over five years, but Berman said
he expected Village Roadshow to do 30 or so.
</P>
<P>
   When Berman left Warner Brothers in 1996, he became a producer.
But, he said, he found himself yearning for the days when he bought
projects rather than developed them, and so he leaped at the offer
from Village Roadshow to head up their new production division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a movie picker,'' Berman said. ``This gives me the best of
both worlds.'' His picks for later this year include ``Three to
Tango,'' a comedy with Neve Campbell and Matthew Perry; ``Deep Blue
Sea,'' a thriller with Samuel L. Jackson and L.L. Cool J, and
``Three Kings,'' an action picture with George Clooney, Mark
Wahlberg and Ice Cube.

<P>
   Glamorous Shocker of '60s
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s are remembered for, among other things, sexual
liberation and drug experimentation. But in the view of writer Paul
Rudnick, one of the most lasting legacies of the era is that it was
the beginning of today's cult of celebrity. And to Rudnick , few
people embodied the desperate desire for fame, and devised a better
plan for achieving it, more than novelist Jacqueline Susann.
</P>
<P>
   Rudnick's new film, ``Isn't She Great,'' is about the life of
Susann. By tracking the life of the author, who wrote the steamy
novels ``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Love Machine'' and ``Once Is
Not Enough,'' the movie examines how one writer used the excitement
and sense of possibility in the era to create an exciting and
highly commercial image, and also used the media to transform
herself into a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which stars Bette Midler as the hard-living novelist
and Nathan Lane as Susann's husband, Irving Mansfield, is scheduled
for release in January.
</P>
<P>
   Rudnick, author of the script for the movie ``In and Out'' and
of the off-Broadway play ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,''
said he had written the screenplay for ``Isn't She Great'' as a
comedy that was also meant to be poignant and sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s were a time of high and outrageous style, and also a
time of sexual revolution and taboo breaking,'' Rudnick said.
Referring to Susann, he added: ``But even by those standards, she
was considered terribly vulgar and beyond the pale. She needed the
sexual frankness of that generation to do what she did.'' He
continued, ``I don't think there could have been a Jackie Susann at
any other time.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Andrew Bergman, is based on an article
about Susann that was written by Michael Korda, who had been one of
her editors. The article, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1995,
added new details about her larger-than-life style, as well as
about some of the tragedies that marred her years.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered for years from breast cancer, from which she died
in 1974, and she had an autistic child. When Susann was asked about
the child, Rudnick said, she would say he had asthma. ``She made
this demented leap from autism to asthma, but it was all part of
her invention of herself and her system of self-promotion,''
Rudnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Susann was also known for her partying, drug use and sexual
exploits, but those things, too, became part of her aura and
contributed to her success. Rudnick said one of the more remarkable
truths was that she was not a very good writer. But she did know
how to titillate and how to use her own life and the public's
fascination with show business to captivate readers hungry for
glimpses of a '60s lifestyle they could only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shameless and gutsy, and she had a blast,'' Rudnick
said.

<P>
   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal,
Lisa Kudrow and Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110
minutes). The title, concept and teaming of these co-stars are all
funny before the lights go down, so think of this comedy as an
offer you can't refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is
shaken, De Niro is hilarious simply by playing his role halfway
straight, in classic goodfella style. His mobster finds just the
right comic foil in Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters
the immortal: ``When I got into family therapy, this wasn't the
family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more where that came from in
this breezy comic treat (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``COOKIE'S FORTUNE,'' starring Charles S. Dutton, Glenn
Close, Patricia Neal, Julianne Moore and Liv Tyler. Directed by
Robert Altman (PG-13, 118 minutes). What a treat. The sweet
assurance and guerrilla wit of Altman's vintage ensemble films make
a copacetic return with a Southern small-town black comedy.
Seamlessly made and completely enveloping, it tells of the
machinations set off when a wealthy old woman (Ms. Neal) outrages
her diabolically genteel niece (Ms. Close) by committing suicide.
As the old woman's dearest friend and the niece's unwitting
nemesis, Dutton is rock solid and appealing. The entire cast works
on a single wavelength as Altman makes the most of a well-woven
screenplay by Anne Rapp (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS,'' starring Elodie Bouchez and
Natacha Regnier. Directed by Erick Zonca (R, 113 minutes; in French
with English subtitles). In this very special French film about two
freewheeling young women, their turbulent friendship is frayed by
sexual passion and economic realities. The weaker and more
head-turning of the women (Ms. Regnier) falls for the advances of a
rich nightclub owner, while her fiery friend, played with
unforgettable immediacy by Ms. Bouchez, rages against what she
views as imminent disaster. In the process, Zonca shows astonishing
acuity in observing how the women's diverging values affect every
aspect of their lives. A rare and wrenching drama (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``EDTV,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Ellen DeGeneres,
Woody Harrelson, Jenna Elfman and Rob Reiner. Directed by Ron
Howard (PG-13, 120 minutes). In this good-humored, deceptively
easygoing satire, Howard holds up a fun-house mirror to a world
ruled by voyeurism and specious fame. The subject matter is
familiar by now, but this film about a Trumanesque nobody as
24-hour-a-day television star has a shrewd way of drawing the
audience into its web. Permeated by all the crassness and absurdity
inherent in celebrity-mad culture, and by our collective obsession
with snoopy trivia, it features a fine ensemble cast and a
dependably jokey screenplay by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. It
helps that most of the principals, in a cast that also includes
Elizabeth Hurley, have played this game for real and act their
roles with a comic vengeance (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``FOLLOWING,'' starring Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw and Lucy
Russell. Directed by Christopher Nolan (not rated, 70 minutes).
This artfully manipulative black-and-white film noir, recently
shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series, doles out its
plot details in cryptic fashion. ``I decided to structure my story
in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete
understanding of each new scene as it is first presented,'' the
filmmaker has said. And he makes that technique work in shattering
a tale of James M. Cain-style conniving into several time frames. A
man named Bill likes to follow strangers until he finds one named
Cobb, who is curiously helpful as a mentor in crime. No-budget
enough to have been shot on a year's worth of Saturdays while the
principals held weekday jobs, it ties together neatly in the end
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``FORCES OF NATURE,'' starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck.
Directed by Bronwen Hughes (PG-13, 102 minutes). Does Ms. Bullock's
loopy girl-next-door charm really make audiences want to follow her
anywhere? If so, they'd better be prepared for an amusement park
ride with old folks, a long romp through Kmart and the other
equally desperate settings for a road movie that otherwise has
nowhere to go. A would-be screwball romantic comedy about a man
thrown together with a zany drifter en route to his own wedding, it
shows off Ms. Bullock to amusing if overly frenetic advantage.
Affleck fares less well with the film's wimpier role. Some of the
material's many gaps are filled by special-effects hail and
windstorms, which are as close as the title comes to making any
sense (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``GO,'' starring Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant,
Taye Diggs, William Fichtner, Scott Wolf and Jay Mohr. Directed by
Doug Liman (R, 100 minutes). This three-episode demimondaine comedy
borrows truckloads of inspiration from ``Pulp Fiction'' but still
has some flash and personality of its own. Liman, who shot the film
as well as directed it, uses a supermarket as ground zero and sends
a sullen cashier (Ms. Polley) out to make a drug deal. Then he
embellishes this situation fully enough to send his film down the
rabbit hole into neo-Tarantino adventures, some of which (guys go
to Las Vegas, then get into trouble with strippers, gunplay, car
theft and a brake-screeching chase) are a lot more tired than
others. The ensemble cast shows cool comic flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,'' starring Jason
Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and
Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since
``The Usual Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool
macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a
quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making
videos and commercials, actually an advantage for a change. There's
not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining is
Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's gallery
of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is juggle
assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who, figuratively
speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MATRIX,'' starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and
Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120
minutes). The time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will
be all but incomprehensible to non-technofreaks. And the film
borrows unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a
big debt to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the
storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special effects are
indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a
gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a
Prada model while behaving like an action hero. One of the main
stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive cinematographer. He and the
Wachowskis provide a couch-potato epiphany: while the characters
seem to be performing marvelous feats, they're often lying
stock-still in the grip of virtual reality (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``METROLAND,'' starring Christian Bale and Emily Watson.
Directed by Philip Saville (not rated, 99 minutes). Based on an
obviously early novel by Julian Barnes, this drama assails the
bourgeois life of a once-free spirit dragooned into being a
commuter, husband and father. This story is set in the 1960s and
70s, which makes its social observations a lot more dated than,
say, Edith Wharton's. But to its advantage, the film has a Mark
Knopfler score, a crisply incisive performance by Ms. Watson and a
highly photogenic one by Bale. But as the character who once
yearned to ``go to Paris and be an artist,'' he must handle the
story's most sophomoric Gallic pretensions with a straight face
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (the Oscar winner for best film,
best original screenplay, best art direction, best costumes and
best comedy score). Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow (the
best-actress winner), Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench
(best supporting actress). Directed by John Madden (R, 113
minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an
exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film
unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm
and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of
his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan
theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy
today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine,
tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized
starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TANGO,'' starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and
directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro
(PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and
virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say
that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most
electrifying dance film, Saura offers transfixingly beautiful
glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can
conjure. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the
nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly
consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TRUE CRIME,'' starring Clint Eastwood, Isaiah
Washington, James Woods and Lisa Gay Hamilton. Directed by Clint
Eastwood (R, 127 minutes). In his most quietly poignant film since
``A Perfect World,'' Eastwood directs a death row thriller with
redemption on its mind. Beginning almost casually, and taking on
growing urgency as it moves toward an imaginatively suspenseful
ending, it tells of a jaded newspaper reporter who, to his own
surprise as much as anyone else's, finds himself fighting at the
11th hour to save a possibly innocent man from execution. Eastwood
is older than the man he plays, but not too old to be plausible as
the father of an adorable little girl in the cast; she happens to
be his real daughter (Maslin). &QL;

   ALFRED HITCHCOCK CELEBRATIONS. The anniversary of Alfred
Hitchcock's birth doesn't arrive until Aug. 13, but that isn't
stopping anyone from celebrating the centennial of the master of
suspense (1899-1980). Two notable tributes begin Friday. At the
Museum of Modern Art ``Alfred Hitchcock,'' with more than 50
features, shorts and documentaries, as well as an exhibition of
posters, photographs and papers, is trumpeted as the most
comprehensive Hitchcock film retrospective ever mounted in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in conjunction with the film retrospective, the Museum of
Television and Radio is presenting ``Hitchcock by Hitchcock: A
Centennial Salute,'' a complete retrospective of the 20 television
films he directed between 1955 and 1962, along with some rarely
seen interviews and a documentary on Hitchcock by Richard Schickel.
At the Museum of Modern Art the opening day's attractions include
three silent films: ``The Blackguard'' (1925), a melodrama directed
by Graham Cutts from a Hitchcock screenplay; ``The Pleasure
Garden'' (1926), another melodrama that was Hitchcock's debut as a
director, and ``The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog'' (1926), a
Jack the Ripper tale characterized by atmosphere and, what else,
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Television and Radio series begins with a weekend
program called ``Unveiling Vera Miles,'' three programs starring
the woman who was to replace Grace Kelly as Hitchcock's leading
lady. Continuing through June 13 at the Museum of Modern Art in
Manhattan, the series, ``Alfred Hitchcock,'' is free with museum
admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or
older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what
you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Screening information:
(212) 708-9400.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing through June 6 at the Museum of Television and Radio,
in Manhattan, the series, ``Hitchcock by Hitchcock,'' is free with
museum admission: $6 for adults, $4 for students and people 65 or
older and $3 for children under 13. Information: (212) 621-6800

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The women of a certain age are smiling. Looking into
the faces up and down the aisles, you can see the pleasure in their
eyes, sense the frisson the moment holds. Now they are breaking
into warm and unexpectedly sustained applause: it's only a kiss,
for Pete's sake. More to the point, it's only ``The Sound of
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction is more than an expression of collective
approval for the marriage plans of Captain von Trapp; there is
something else going on between this actor and audience. Surveying
the faces across the rows once more, the eyes appear to be clouding
up with the mists of teen-age crushes that have never completely
burned off. ``Oh, yes,'' their girlish grins declare. ``We go  &UR; way &LR; 
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Richard Chamberlain they all have eyes for. At 63, the
trim, immaculately groomed actor still exudes lynxlike
handsomeness; add the familiar faraway gaze, and you not only have
a flashback to young Dr. Kildare, but you also have made flesh of
Rodgers and Hammerstein's brusque Tyrolean taskmaster, whose stony
facade cracks at the sound of Maria's yodeling soprano and a chorus
of children's do-re-mi's.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain recently assumed the role of von Trapp in the
``Sound of Music'' revival that has been running for a year at the
Martin Beck Theater, and it turns out to be particularly fortuitous
casting. With the aid of a charming, silken-voiced newcomer named
Laura Benanti playing Maria, Chamberlain makes this cardboard
coupling work.
</P>
<P>
   Although it remains a part for a non-smiler, Chamberlain doesn't
freeze us out. He subtly raises von Trapp's temperature in ways
that eluded his predecessor, Michael Siberry. Like his faithful
fans, he mists up at all the right moments.
</P>
<P>
   His performance is one of those rare instances of replacement
casting that compels a theatergoer to ask, ``Why didn't they think
of him in the first place?'' Maybe they did. Whatever the
circumstances, this ``Sound of Music'' is appreciably better than
it was a year ago, and in the nonstop revolving door of Broadway
role playing, it is one of the best examples of how a show's stock
can rise on the strength of its personal investments.
</P>
<P>
   As with the stock market, too, the Broadway trading floor is
almost always active. ``Beauty and the Beast'' alone has a
relatively new Belle, beast and candle. Jekylls come, Hydes go; new
Phantoms emerge from the fog on a regular basis, and there's
frequently a fresh face consigned to death row in ``Chicago.''
``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' meanwhile, not content with mere
recasting, is cutting some minor roles when it returns in the fall
after a tour, giving the show the dubious distinction of being the
first to engage in wholesale downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with new appearances could become a reviewer's
full-time job. To scope out just a few of the more noteworthy new
recruits, return visits were paid to five long-running shows that
recently have had turnovers in major roles: ``The Sound of Music,''
``Cabaret,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Miss Saigon'' and ``The
Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The revisits turned up both familiar faces in new settings, like
Andrea McArdle, the latest Belle in ``Beast,'' and performers whose
visages are new to Broadway, like Mary McCormack, now playing Sally
Bowles in the revival of ``Cabaret.'' In every case, though, the
actor's challenge is exactly the same: convincing us that as far as
the 10th Phantom, 8th Belle or 3d Sally is concerned, the part was,
is and always will be theirs. Here is a brief report card about
each.

   ANDREA McARDLE, ``BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.'' Ms. McArdle, the
original spunky orphan in ``Annie,'' began her professional life
singing to a furry co-star. Now two decades later she's at it
again, playing the spunky heroine of Disney's busy cartoon musical
at the Palace Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Palace itself is no picnic these days; attending ``Beauty''
there is a little like promenading through the Port Authority.
Children squirm and cry out, roving bands of tourists wander the
aisles; the man behind me, a Spaniard, sang along with the
production in a Castilian accent, and reacted menacingly to a
request for the observance of common courtesy. I spent the rest of
the show listening to the score in stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Things are no less hectic onstage, where several actors,
particularly some portraying the enchanted furnishings in the
Beast's castle, now outrageously ham it up, resorting to
unconscionable pauses on punch lines and mugging the livelong
night. (Beth Fowler, as a gentle and dignified singing teapot, is a
notable exception.) Into this din strolls Ms. McArdle, underplaying
nicely as if oblivious to the huffing and the puffing of the
armoire and the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McArdle is Broadway's goddaughter, and anyone who saw her in
``Annie'' can't help feeling a sort of pride in how well she has
grown up. The voice is crisp and powerful, and she looks splendid
in Belle's coloring-book evening dress. And yet there isn't all
that much to Belle; watching the actress, you're reminded of
Marilyn, the normal-looking ingenue in the ghoulish family of ``The
Munsters.'' Someone, sometime is going to put the energy Ms.
McArdle so carefully conserves to real use again.
</P>
<P>
   MARY McCORMACK, ``CABARET.'' While Ms. McArdle contends with the
audience's memories of an old performance, Ms. McCormack must make
peace with a recent one. Natasha Richardson won a Tony last June
for her role-redefining turn as a Sally Bowles coming apart at the
wretched seams. Jennifer Jason Leigh came apart next and now the
task belongs to Ms. McCormack, whose resume includes more film than
stage work and who makes her Broadway debut here in Sam Mendes'
crowd-pleasing production, ensconced quite mesmerizingly at Studio
54.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I didn't see Ms. Leigh, but based on the reviews, it seems safe
to conclude that vocally, Ms. McCormack is the strongest Sally of
the three; an appealing effortlessness prevails in her delivery of
``Mein Herr'' and ``Perfectly Marvelous'' that was lacking in Ms.
Richardson's numbers, and she's also persuasive at Sally's reckless
insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Ms. Richardson played Sally as a burnt-out Mayfair bird,
the physically bigger Ms. McCormack turns her into a slumming
sorority girl who lands a job at the Kit Kat Klub not through sheer
nerve, but because this sort of thing comes easy to her; Sally just
happens to have a good voice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not as much is percolating in her performance when Sally's
relationship with Clifford, the writer, and her artificial bonhomie
begin to collapse. There's no evidence of an abject need for
attention, or for Clifford (played affectingly by Boyd Gaines, who
replaced John Benjamin Hickey). And in Sally's disintegration,
revealed during her rendition of the title song, Ms. McCormack
seems more frustrated than desperate; the self-defining moment
lacks fire.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, Ms. McCormack meshes comfortably with an
ensemble that may be the best this production has put together.
Alan Cumming as the MC continues to amaze; Michele Pawk's Fraulein
Kost and Ron Rifkin's Herr Schultz are the show's hard and soft
cores, and Blair Brown's bone-weary Fraulein Schneider is nothing
short of a heartbreaking revelation.
</P>
<P>
   LEA SALONGA, ``Miss Saigon.'' Ms. Salonga, unlike Ms. McCormack,
has only herself to top. She was the first Kim, the Vietnamese
heroine of the Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg musical,
and now she's also the fifth. Having won an Olivier Award in the
West End and a Tony on Broadway for the role, it's no wonder Ms.
Salonga would want to return to the field of her greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Her victory walk is a coup for the audience, too. The actress,
with a voice as hopeful as daybreak, may be a little old to play 17
convincingly, but it's not much of a stretch; she assumes the part
again as easily as she slips into a pair of silk pants. (Luoyong
Wang, continuing as the Engineer, remains the production's
wonderfully oily, grasping fixer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Saigon'' leaves some theaterogers cold _ my companion for
the matinee, seeing it for the first time, was perplexed by the
show's sentimental oversimplifications of a troubled era _ but I'm
won over by the show's melodic suppleness. Among the mega-musicals
its score is the most romantic, and Ms. Salonga is its purest
interpreter. If ``The Last Night of the World,'' her duet with the
excellent Will Chase playing her American paramour Chris, doesn't
get to you, you're not a fool for love or even for a decent love
song.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing aspects of Ms. Salonga's return has
nothing to do with her performance per se, but with the casting of
Margaret Ann Gates as Ellen, the woman Chris marries after the war.
Ms. Gates is Asian; in my several previous visits to the show,
Ellen was always played by a Caucasian actress. Through Ms. Gates'
Ellen, the bond between Ms. Salonga's Kim and Chase's Chris seems
even more durable, and the show's emotional foundation gets some
shoring up. It makes complete sense that Chris would find a mate
who reminded him physically of Ms. Salonga.
</P>
<P>
   HUGH PANARO, ``THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.'' ``Pitiful creature of
darkness,'' the actress sings. ``What kind of life have you
known?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not to the theater reviewer she croons. This is another
Broadway beauty addressing another Broadway beast, or rather,
Sandra Joseph's Christine Daae shedding a symbolic tear over
Panaro's Phantom.
</P>
<P>
   They are as attractive and musically gifted a pair as the last
two or three I have seen in these roles, which from multiple
viewings have begun to seem as mechanical as the flickering hulk of
a chandelier that has been descending from its mooring in the
ceiling of the Majestic Theater since the last year of President
Reagan's term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' is an efficient piece of theater that remains hugely
popular; the franchise is safe in the hands of Panaro, seen on
Broadway last season as suitor to a singing and dancing Siamese
twin in ``Side Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is lithe and compact, a bantamweight in half-mask. The
voice is a solid uppercut; the portrayal lands a few emotion-packed
blows to the solar plexus. More it would be churlish to ask of
Panaro, whose tenure begins the designation of the arrival of new
Phantoms in the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN, ``THE SOUND OF MUSIC.'' Watching
Chamberlain going about his business with a consummate sense of
style and technique is to be reminded of how few bona fide leading
men there are for Broadway musicals. Yes, he's too old for Ms.
Benanti, but what singing star with stage experience are you going
to get to play an Austrian aristocrat sought by the Nazis for
conscription in the German navy, Mandy Patinkin?
</P>
<P>
   When Chamberlain takes charge, all's well in the theater and not
just for his fans. Even those who don't remember the episode of
``Dr. Kildare'' in which he sang ``Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo'' can appreciate
being in the presence of an actor who knows his way around the big
score.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At this point in Ignat Solzhenitsyn's fledgling
career as a pianist and conductor, people who have not heard him
before inevitably come to his concerts with the combination of
curiosity, hope and skepticism that attends performances by
children of the famous.
</P>
<P>
   For Solzhenitsyn, who is 26 and has been performing publicly
since his late teens, no direct comparisons can be made, since his
parents are not musicians. But there is the overpowering
association with his father, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel
laureate who is both an iconic figure in contemporary Russian
literature and a symbol of conscientious resistance against
repression in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   If the younger Solzhenitsyn finds this daunting, he doesn't show
it, onstage or off. He can hold the spotlight on his own.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, where he lives, he has been conducting the
Concerto Soloists Chamber Orchestra since 1994, and became its
principal conductor in January. His performances in New York as a
recitalist, concerto soloist and chamber player, since 1992, have
shown him to be an uncommonly thoughtful, communicative musician.
Sunday, he can be heard again here, when he plays the Shostakovich
Quintet with the St. Petersburg String Quartet at the 92d Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   Shostakovich, one might think, veers close to home in the sense
that the composer, like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, was often at odds
with the Soviet authorities. But Shostakovich reportedly had mixed
feelings about the elder Solzhenitsyn; he admired his writing and
courage in facing down the regime until he was exiled in 1974, but
was critical of what he regarded as Solzhenitsyn's aspiration to be
regarded as a modern Russian saint.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the Quintet in a recent interview, Ignat Solzhenitsyn
focused mainly on musical issues: whether the strings should play
with or without vibrato in the exposition of the second movement
fugue, for example, or whether the third movement should be played
at a moderate tempo that he described as ``a pedantic
ruthlessness,'' or at a brisk, hard-driven one.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of his father's relationship with the composer
cannot be resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They met on several occasions,'' he said. ``But they weren't
close. Sometimes people hit it off, and sometimes they don't. And I
think that by the time they met, in the mid-60s and early '70s,
Shostakovich didn't have much overt fight left in him, while my
father was in the most dynamic years of his political fight. But
they were interesting meetings for my father, certainly. He has
written his impressions of them. I don't think he's published them
yet, but I'm sure that eventually they will come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and broad-boned, with dark blond hair, clear blue eyes and
a deep baritone voice, Solzhenitsyn is open and gregarious. Having
just spent three weeks preparing his Philadelphia ensemble for
performances of Bach's ``St. John Passion,'' he and his wife of two
months, Carolyn, stopped in New York for a few hours on their way
to Cavendish, Vt., for a 10-day vacation at the family's farmhouse,
which he and his two brothers have maintained since their parents
returned to Russia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging conversation, he expounded energetically on
whatever came up, from Bach, Beethoven and Shostakovich to the Cold
War, the New York Yankees and the heavy metal rock bands he
listened to when he was growing up in Vermont. He neither avoids
nor deflects discussion of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking into my father's office and hearing a
Beethoven symphony for the first time,'' he said, as a way of
explaining the childhood roots of his desire to become a conductor.
``I just stopped and said, `What is this?' And my father said,
`This is Beethoven' and showed me the boxed set. He had tapes of
one of Karajan's cycles, the one from the 1970s, which he used to
listen to when he was writing or thinking. I was just blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be difficult to argue that Solzhenitsyn's
childhood was like everyone else's. He was 18 months old when his
parents were expelled from the Soviet Union, in 1974, after the
publication in the West of ``The Gulag Archipelago.'' The family
lived in Zurich until July 1976, when they moved to Vermont. There,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn essentially cloistered himself in his study,
often working 16 hours a day on installments of his ``Red Wheel''
cycle. Russian was the language spoken at home, and the writer told
his sons that a boulder on their property was a magic horse that
would take them back to Russia someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, my parents always dreamed of going back,'' Solzhenitsyn
said. ``Obviously, there was no greater enemy of the regime than my
father. But the country, the people _ it was home. In many ways, he
was lucky to have been arrested and exiled. I think it prolonged
his life; he's just turned 80, and he's in good health, which is
amazing considering everything he's been through. Even so, it was
involuntary exile. They would have preferred to stay and fight on
the spot, as they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we grew up with that _ not just a love for Russian
literature, music, culture and painting, but with a very clear
family goal, that someday Russia will be free, and we will be able
to go back. My father always believed that he would outlive
Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia before his parents, as the
soloist on a 1993 tour by Mstislav Rostropovich and the National
Symphony. Now he returns at least once a year to perform and to
visit his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking only Russian at home meant that Solzhenitsyn had
problems with English when he began attending school. But today he
speaks without an accent. He considers himself equally fluent in
English and Russian.
</P>
<P>
   One might imagine that Solzhenitsyn also experienced other kinds
of cultural clashes and pressures during his school days, given his
father's open criticism of what he perceived as the shallowness of
American culture. But that, the pianist said, was never a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that from an early age, we were able to accept it as
something quite natural that we lived in a bipolar world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never really put his foot down. He wasn't strict in
the sense of `You can do this, you can't do that.' We didn't have a
television at first, and when we got one, we were allowed to watch
an hour a week, plus the news. But we could only get two channels,
with a roof antenna. And when you had no TV before, an hour wasn't
a bad deal. Rock music? We all got into it at some point, and so
long as we didn't have it blaring across the house, it was OK.It
was basically heavy metal _ Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Kiss, some
of the better real old rock groups. I don't think either my father
or my mother had a very high opinion of most of it.''

 &HT;    CHILDREN OF THE CAMPS: TERROR AND TEARS FOR THE SMALLEST KOSOVAR
REFUGEES

<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ In part, it is a war against children.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the more than 500,000 refugees filling the
makeshift camps across Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, are under
the age of 14, according to a United Nations estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw their houses destroyed and loved ones killed by Serb
forces in the campaign to ethnically cleanse them from Yugoslavia's
embattled Kosovo province. Others have been separated from their
families. Many do not understand why they are living in tents and
why they cannot go home. Most have seen the fear in their parents
eyes as families were wrenched from their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of their stories:
</P>
<P>
   The shy little girl playing in the cramped refugee tent is a
motherless child. Nearby, the careworn woman with tears pooling in
her dark eyes is a mother without her children.
</P>
<P>
   Their sad lives intersected at Brazda refugee camp near the
Yugoslavian border after a terrifying flight from the mayhem in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny brown-haired girl, Jehona Aliu, 5, was discovered April
7 wandering amid the debris of a sprawling encampment at the Blace
border crossing. The night before, Macedonian police had abruptly
carted off tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians who had fled
Kosovo, shipping some to camps within Macedonia and others to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Jehona was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the exodus from Kosovo, Fatmire Cecelija, 27, was separated
from her two young boys on April 1. A neighbor offered to take them
in his car, which was warmer and safer than the crowded
tractor-cart the family was in. The car and the tractor were
separated on the road by Serb forces. Her frantic search for Agon,
6, and Ardin, 3, in other refugee camps has produced no results
since she and her husband crossed into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the mother without her children and the child
without a mother were placed together by British NATO troops, who
had been caring for Jehona in their tents.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing seems logical and natural. It is motivated by
whole-hearted hopes that the mother and child can find comfort in
each other.
</P>
<P>
   But the deep trauma of refugees defies pat solutions. Forced at
gunpoint from their homes, severed from their daily routines and
possessions, searching desperately for missing family members --
there is no tidy answer to ease the distress.
</P>
<P>
   Jehona sometimes cries out in the night, and speaks often about
seeing her parents and brothers and sisters again.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally spent, Fatmire concedes that she does not have much
mothering to give the little girl. Jehona's presence only reminds
Fatmire of her missing boys and makes it all the more difficult to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope they are not back in Kosovo,'' fretted Fatmire
tearfully, as she flipped through a pocket-sized photo album with
snapshots of her boys. ``As long as they are out of Kosovo there is
hope that they are safe and sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 5, Jehona seems to understand the woman's strain. It is
Jehona who sings songs and recites stories in an apparent effort to
soothe both herself and the woman who is her temporary guardian.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl tells Fatmire: ``These are the stories I am
going to tell your sons when they come back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the younger children of the camps do not understand what
has happened to them, but they know the ugliness they have
witnessed. And the beauty they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   In a makeshift school started earlier this week at the
Neprostino refugee camp, scores of kids were given paper and
felt-tipped pens and instructed to draw their recent experiences in
the escape from Kosovo with their families.
</P>
<P>
   The results were as predictable as the images on your nightly
newscast. Streams of people marching down a road. Tanks. Dead
bodies. Men with guns. Buildings ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my own house burning. Not only my house, but all the
houses in the neighborhood,'' said Vesel Rustemi, 10, explaining
his piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   Experiences in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia and other wars show that
allowing children to draw gives them a healthy emotional outlet.
They may not always be able to talk about their emotional trauma,
but they can paint it, according to teachers and child
psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   The therapy has proved its value throughout the world. But this
small boy didn't like it. We asked him how he felt while drawing
his artwork, a scene of houses on fire. ``It is not a relief for
me,'' Vesel said. ``It just makes me want to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, at a field hospital run by the Israeli army at
another refugee camp, Brazda, they have also provided paint,
brushes and paper. No therapy was intended here. It is simply a
means to keep the kids occupied while they wait for parents or
siblings being treated at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   They are not told what to draw, and mostly they do not paint
scenes of destruction. Instead, there are pictures of trim houses,
bushy trees, flowering gardens, dogs and cats and the shining sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be a psychiatrist to see what they miss,''
said Dani Engelhard, a pediatrician from Jerusalem. ``They are
drawing their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Arta Halili is a freckle-faced girl with big
brown eyes and a love of poetry. Prodded by the teachers, she stood
before the class at the improvised school at the Neprostino refugee
camp and recited a rhyme she had composed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no peace in the Balkans until Kosovo is saved.
When a rifle shot is heard in Kosovo, the echo can be heard
throughout Europe,'' she said in a strong, clear voice.
</P>
<P>
   She impressed the three American reporters present. She was
poised and seemed to be coping well with the desperate condition of
her people. We wanted to know more about her.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we asked her to tell us about her life in Kosovo. She
loves school, she said. Math is her favorite subject and she wants
to be a nurse when she grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, we asked her about the day the Serb forces came to her
village. As she told her story, the facade crumbled and a
frightened girl emerged.
</P>
<P>
   She was in her sixth-grade class, she said, her big eyes going
wet and the words choking in her throat. There were men with guns.
She paused, looked away from us, then continued: They said school
was closed, the students would have to go home.
</P>
<P>
   She fled to Macedonia with her ailing father, her mother and six
siblings, including a 3-month-old brother.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, her voice again breaking, she cannot attend the
camp school regularly. As the oldest child, it is her
responsibility at the camp to stand in the long food lines three
times a day and carry food back to her family's tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult thing,'' she said simply, ``is the fact
that I am a refugee.''

 &HT;    NEW REFUGEES MAY SIGNAL ANOTHER WAVE OF MASS EXPULSIONS FROM
KOSOVO

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Thousands more Kosovo refugees crossed
Thursday into Macedonia and Albania, raising new concerns that a
massive tide of refugees will spill south as Serbian forces
continue their systematic emptying of Kosovo villages.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees arriving in Macedonia said thousands
more were behind them, trying to make their way to the border while
avoiding Serbian paramilitary groups and Yugoslav soldiers clearing
remote towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the houses are burning, so everybody is on the road to
somewhere -- to Macedonia, to Albania, anywhere but there,'' said
Selvete Veseli, 35, who arrived with her family Thursday in
Macedonia from the southern Kosovo town of Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing last week that it had halted the expulsions,
the Yugoslav regime appears to be driving out a new stream of
refugees as it continues its purges in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 new refugees crossed into Macedonia on Thursday,
including a group of 3,000 who arrived at night at the Lojane
border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Morina border point in Albania, more than 3,000 refugees
had crossed from Kosovo by early evening Thursday, according to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting more in the coming days, and we're preparing
for more. How many is anyone's guess,'' said Paula Ghedini
spokeswoman for United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov cautioned that his country
could not handle the new arrivals. He urged other countries to
share the burden.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian officials fear the strains on their delicate
multiethnic balance and their poor economy could destabilize the
government and foment unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday and today we were again faced with a new huge wave
of refugees from Kosovo,'' Gligorov told parliament. ``The fact
remains that the state has limited ability to accept more
refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the UNHCR, Albania has now accepted some 315,000
refugees, with 118,000 streaming into Macedonia and 67,200 to
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   NATO says 400,000 or more ethnic Albanians could be secluded in
remote villages or living in the wilderness along border areas that
may have been mined by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   At the Blace crossing in Macedonia, refugees reported that they
heard shelling in the hills, what they assumed were Serbian forces
leveling villages. They also said Yugoslav army and Serb forces
solicited bribes of about $160 or more per person before allowing
them to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
   From Urosevac, Serbs were sending trains packed with refugees to
a point near the border, then ordering refugees to walk along
railroad tracks for the border area with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The Macedonian police were refusing entry for some refugees
Thursday, claiming that their orders were to hold back the refugees
until an international aid agency could confirm that they had space
in the camps to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 3,500 refugees who had arrived by early morning
Thursday in Albania were taken to a makeshift camp sponsored by the
Greek government.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new arrivals Thursday said they had been walking for
days, were exhausted and in need of both food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, word that the border was open has spread
in Kosovo, prompting families to come out of hiding and make an
effort to leave, the refugees said. They said thousands of ethnic
Albanians crowded the Urosevac train station waiting for space to
go south.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shoulder to shoulder,'' said Fatima Azemi, 33. ``You
couldn't move and there were not enough trains. Many people gave up
and went into the streets intending to walk to Macedonia.''
</P>

report from Albania.

 NEW YORK: most of it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn's interest in classical music developed largely as
a result of his curiosity about the baby grand piano that came with
the farmhouse. A neighbor taught him to read music when he was
about 5, and he slowly worked his way through a collection of easy
classical pieces that he found in the piano bench. His parents,
having known families in which children came to regard music
lessons as a form of oppression, were disinclined to have him study
the instrument formally, particularly since he was happy to ``tool
around the keyboard,'' as he puts it, and was not begging for
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after a visit by Rostropovich, the cellist and
conductor, who left Russia voluntarily around the same time
Solzhenitsyn did, and whose Soviet citizenship had been revoked in
1978 because of his outspoken criticism of the Soviet government.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was playing nearby, he would come to have dinner and
see my parents, and it was typical Slava,'' Solzhenitsyn said,
using Rostropovich's nickname. ``He would arrive, make a huge
splash, and leave a burning fireball in his wake. At the time, I
think I could play a Tchaikovsky waltz, Bach Minuets, really
elementary stuff, and when he heard me, he asked my parents who my
teacher was. They said: `What are you talking about? He's just
fooling around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rostropovich told the Solzhenitsyns that they should find a
teacher, but when an initial search in Cavendish proved fruitless,
they gave up. Two years later, Rostropovich came to dinner again,
and when he heard that the young pianist was still teaching
himself, he took young Solzhenitsyn to see the pianist Rudolf
Serkin, who lived about an hour away, in Guilford, Vt. Through
Serkin, Solzhenitsyn found his way to Chonghyo Shin, who
specialized in talented young pianists. During the years he studied
with her, he played his first public recital and won a competition
to play a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 11, he began studying with Luis Batlle, Serkin's
assistant. The lessons, as he describes them, lasted five or six
hours, two of which were spent on the piano repertory, and the rest
on music theory, counterpoint, composition and musical dictation.
After three years, when he was 14, Solzhenitsyn went to London on
his own, and remained there for three years' study with Maria
Curcio, a student of Artur Schnabel. Solzhenitsyn regards her as
his principal mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She taught me everything I know about piano playing,'' he
said. ``I was competent when I came to her, but those were amazing,
formative years, musically and personally. Coming from Cavendish to
London, it was a lot to take in. And her dedication to music _ not
just to music as an abstract concept, but music as it is filtered
through humans, and as a force to help, move and unite people _ is
something I continue to be inspired by.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back now, Solzhenitsyn considers that his piano studies
ended when he left London. From London, he moved to New York, where
he had a few lessons with the Chilean pianist Claudio Arrau. Arrau,
who was 88, invited Solzhenitsyn to join him on a yearlong world
tour. He was to be part of Arrau's entourage, with all expenses
paid, and he was to have lessons on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But Arrau died before the tour began. Solzhenitsyn then enrolled
at the Curtis Institute, in Philadelphia, where he studied the
piano with Gary Graffman and conducting _ he was a dual major _
with Otto Werner-Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really need any more pianistic training,'' he said,
``but you never outgrow the need to play for someone who can listen
judiciously. What was interesting about Graffman was that although
he is known for playing the big Russian Romantic works, he is
equally authoritative in every other part of the repertory. I know
I could rely on his musical taste, and I still play for him a
couple of times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn's love of Russian culture doesn't extend to the
peculiarly Russian school of pianism that prizes thunderous
sonorities and technical display. His performances are powerful and
assertive when the music demands those qualities, but subtlety and
careful phrase-shaping are the more striking attributes of his
playing.
</P>
<P>
   His repertory preferences, too, run toward the Austrian-German
school rather than the Russian: Bach's ``Goldberg'' Variations,
Beethoven's ``Diabelli'' Variations and sonatas by Beethoven and
Schubert have been his calling cards in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the Russian repertory, he said that he admired
Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues and Second Sonata but that he
did not think of the original piano version of Mussorgsky's
``Pictures at an Exhibition,'' the Tchaikovsky piano works or
Shostakovich's other solo keyboard pieces as masterpieces. He loves
the Russian symphonic repertory, though, and his conducting career
gives him an opportunity to perform it.
</P>
<P>
   His connection with the Concerto Soloists Chamber Orchestra
began soon after his graduation from Curtis, when the group's
founder and music director, Marc Mostovoy, invited him to conduct
some children's concerts. When another conductor canceled a program
in the orchestra's regular series, Mostovoy invited Solzhenitsyn to
take over, and made him an assistant conductor and an associate
conductor before appointing him principal conductor this year. He
has also just started to take on guest conducting engagements with
regional American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that seems to be missing in Solzhenitsyn's career
right now is a recording contract. But that seems not to worry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have turned some things down,'' he said. ``I don't want to
make records just for the sake of having some on the market, or to
fill a repertory gap in a record label's catalog. Recording is
something I take very seriously. It's there forever, it's
posterity, and it has to be something you feel convinced about. On
my deathbed, I want to be able to look back at my recordings and
say, `That's pretty good _ I wouldn't do it that way now, but it's
valid.' So I'm letting things come as they may. I'm not in a
hurry.''

labored to push back the fields. But the sugar industry has grown
up as part of a transformed South Florida landscape. As a result,
the battle over the Everglades and the water it needs to regain
health is also about economics and power, agribusiness jobs and
growing cities.

BURTON, STODDARD ON HUMBLE ROAD TO STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're the next superstar driver/crew chief combination in
NASCAR Winston Cup racing, and as unspoiled and unpretentious as a
couple of Saturday night racers at Cowtown Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton and Frankie Stoddard have been sitting atop the Cup
points chase for nearly four weeks, time enough to take them
seriously. And time enough to take a serious look at what makes
them click.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely not ego. And definitely not geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win a race, \Rwe\S don't think that just because we won
means we're gonna go win next week,'' said Burton, 31, a native of
South Boston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that if we don't work hard enough right now, that we
won't make the race at Martinsville,'' said Stoddard, 30, a native
of North Haverhill, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Stoddard, a Cup crew chief for 40 races, was referring to the
ominously named Goody's Body Pain 500 at Martinsville (Va.)
Speedway on Sunday. For a team that regularly struggles during
qualifying, Stoddard's remark rates as an exaggeration. But in a
garage area where some top Cup drivers and crew chiefs use their
public relations representatives as human shields, or their
expensive motorhomes and haulers as hideouts, Burton and Stoddard
have remained refreshingly accessible and thoroughly candid.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, of course, launched what proved to be his breakthrough
season in April 1997 with his first career Cup victory at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. Burton since has added six victories
and admitted that he has had to rein in his temper off the track
and raise his level of aggressiveness on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a do-or-die attitude about me that gets me in trouble
sometimes,'' said Burton, driver of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford
Taurus owned by Jack Roush. ``The benefit of that is I have a
passion for what I do. I don't like to lose. I don't like to make
mistakes. It means a lot to me, so I get mad. I'm trying to make it
a little bit easier for those guys to be around me and tolerate
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for getting aggressive on track, who will ever forget Burton
and Jeff Gordon trading paint in the final stages of the Mountain
Dew Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway in September 1997?
Gordon won a $1 million bonus that day en route to the second of
his three Cup championships. But Burton added to his legion of fans
via a grand display of NASCAR-style grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out racing cars very cautiously,'' said Burton, who
has a 52-point lead over Dale Jarrett heading to Martinsville's
flat, paper-clip layout. ``I was criticized for years because I
wasn't aggressive enough. Well, the reason I wasn't aggressive was
because I didn't think I was good enough to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Roush and his band of perfectionists in 1996
helped dispel that fear. Eventually, Burton convinced Stoddard to
leave the Northeast for North Carolina, where he joined Buddy
Parrott's fledgling crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly surprised to be here,'' Stoddard said. ``I'm
honored to be here. I don't know that we're one of the top teams
yet. I'm hoping that we're gonna get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Check the Cup point standings, gentlemen. They say you've
arrived.
SPOTLIGHT ON... CAPPS ADDS MORE TEST MILES AFTER STUMBLING NHRA
START
</P>
<P>
   NHRA Funny Car driver Ron Capps didn't get to compete at Houston
Raceway Park on Sunday, and he has been working overtime ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Capps' failure to qualify for the O'Reilly Nationals has kept
his team in a full-bore testing mode. Capps and crew spent Monday
and Tuesday running laps at HRP in Baytown.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the team began the first of two days of runs down the
all-concrete Texas Motorplex quarter-mile in Ennis. Round 5 of the
National Hot Rod Association schedule, the third annual Castrol
Nationals, is scheduled for April 22-25 at the Plex.
</P>
<P>
   Capps, the points runner-up to eight-time champion John Force
last year, has been in a performance funk. He was a first-round
loser in each of the season's first three events and tested
extensively at Gainesville (Fla.) Raceway on the Monday and Tuesday
after the Mac Tools Gatornationals last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran good in testing at Gainesville, and I had a lot of
optimism going to Houston,'' said Capps, driver of the Copenhagen
Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 owned by Don ``The Snake'' Prudhomme. ``I
don't even want to say anything any more because it didn't happen
last weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Capps and crew chief Roland Leong have elicited the help of Dale
Armstrong, crew chief on the Top Fuel car of teammate Larry Dixon,
in an attempt to get their five-disc clutch program sorted. Dixon
turned the quickest lap in NHRA history, a 4.486-second pass,
during qualifying last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Capps, who led the Funny Car class with five victories in 1998,
said he has been reduced to cheerleader for his crew. Meanwhile,
Force, the winner of three of four events this season and the
national elapsed time record-holder (4.788 seconds), is racing on
another level. That's why Capps' team is adamant about running the
five-disc clutch and developing a cylinder head program designed by
Leong cohort Steve Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some new cylinder heads, and they work too good
almost,'' said Capps, who is 14th in points. ``We're trying to find
out what these heads want. John Force is running Alan Johnson
heads, and we knew we had to build something in-house to keep up
with him. We've got the best minds in the world over here, trying
to cope with this.''
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
RAY SHOWING THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ray of Plano had two of the top-10 speeds posted during
open testing for the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500
on May 30. Ray's top lap at 227.072 mph is the fastest unofficial
speed in a new-formula IRL car at the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. The previous record was 223.797 mph by Tony Stewart, the
driver Ray replaced at Team Menard, on May 15, 1998. Tests were

QUICK HITS LONG, WINDING (PIT) ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Management at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway will unveil its
newfangled pit-road plan for the 0.526-mile track during the
Goody's Body Pain 500 this weekend. Instead of separate pits on the
frontstretch and backstretch, NASCAR's Winston Cup regulars will
navigate down one long, continuous pit road.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is at the beginning of Turn 3 with an exit at the
end of Turn 2. In theory, the redesign is supposed to eliminate the
disadvantage normally associated with pitting on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   A 35 mph speed limit will be in effect during Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a car on pit road for a long, long
time,'' said Paul Andrews, crew chief on Jeremy Mayfield's No. 12
Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``I'm not sure what the record is for cars
caught speeding on pit road in a race, but I bet there'll be a new
one Sunday.''
LITTLE E SWAPS RACES
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's decision to delay the debut of its updated Monte
Carlo stock car until the start of the 2000 season has prompted a
change in the five-race Cup schedule of Dale Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of competing in the Winston 500 restrictor-plate race at
Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway on Oct. 17, Little E will run the
Exide NASCAR Batteries Select 400 at Richmond (Va.) International
Raceway on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't make sense for us to build a \R1999 model\S car, or
have Dale Jr. drive a car, that we could only use for one race,''
said Dale Earnhardt, the seven-time Cup champion and owner of his
son's No. 8 Budweiser Chevy.
TIRE TEST SET AT TMS
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack, the reigning Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion,
is among six drivers scheduled to test tires for Goodyear at Texas
Motor Speedway on Monday and Tuesday. Brack will be joined by A.J.
Foyt Racing teammate Billy Boat, Davey Hamilton, Buddy Lazier,
Scott Sharp and Mark Dismore in anticipation of the Longhorn 500K
night race June 12.
LAST LAPS
</P>
<P>
   Texan Tim Beverley has appointed Bill Ingle interim crew chief
for Tyler Jet Motorsports and the 10-10-345 Pontiac Grand Prix
driven by Rich Bickle. Ingle, formerly of Rudd Performance
Motorsports, replaces Phil Hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer's/Edy's Grand Ice Cream has extended its promotional
contract with three-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon through 2000.
Gordon will be featured on special cartons of Goo Goo Cluster later
this month. Enjoy.
LAST WORDS

   ``The best thing he's told me is, `You can't win the Kentucky
Derby riding a mule. We'll fix this car.'''

BUSH DONATIONS TOP $7.5M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush raised $7.5 million for his
presidential exploratory campaign in less than a month without
holding a fund-raiser, according to records released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money reported in his filings to the Federal
Election Commission puts Bush well ahead of the contributions
reported so far by his potential opponents for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the amount of money I raised,'' Bush said.
``I'm off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls give Bush the edge against a crowded field of
announced and potential Republican candidates, and put him ahead of
Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic Party nominee in
2000. Bush formed an exploratory committee last month but has said
he would not make a decision about running for the presidency until
the state legislative session wraps up at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that before running, ``I wanted to make sure that
behind the polls there was some solid support and there appears
there is. We've still got a lot more work to do, but it's a good
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised the money without holding any fund-raisers or
traveling to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, potential GOP rival Pat Buchanan was in Austin
raising money for his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting between the two had to be canceled because of
scheduling problems, but the two did talk on the telephone
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to be the proper thing to do is make a courtesy call
on the governor,'' Buchanan said. ``It's the way my mommy raised
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably the best known Republican governor we have right
now, a potential candidate for president of the United States, as I
am,'' he said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has a loyal following but has not raised the kind of
money Bush has. Buchanan raised $552,870 from Feb. 22 to March 31,
but he also has spent about half the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent relatively little money to raise the $7.5 million.
His committee reported expenses of $854,000, and much of it went to
running the committee office in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, Bush announced he would form a federal
exploratory committee so he could test the waters for a potential
presidential campaign. He plans to travel to some key states in
early summer before deciding whether to formally enter the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   His fund-raising strength will play a key role in that decision,
he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the tremendous support from people across the
country for my exploratory effort,'' Bush said. ``I offer my
sincerest thanks to those who have contributed and also to the many
people who have generously volunteered their time to help this
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 23,339 people contributed to the committee, including
5,237 who gave $1,000 each, the maximum allowed under federal
campaign contribution rules. The money was raised between March 4
and 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised a little more than half of the money _ nearly $4.1
million _ from Texans.
</P>
<P>
   The average contribution was $325.24. The governor also loaned
$13,810 to his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Little money has been spent so far in other states, but that is
bound to change. Bush's committee allocated only $29.70 in New
Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary, and none so far
in Iowa, which holds the first caucus. He also spent small amounts
in Arizona, New Jersey and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reported raising $8.9 million and spending $2 million by
the end of the first quarter of the year. Former Sen. Bill Bradley
of New Jersey, a Democrat, raised $4.3 million and spent $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Austin, Buchanan said he and Bush probably
differ on some issues. But he said he doesn't expect an ugly
campaign, should Bush formally enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, it certainly will not be personal at
all,'' Buchanan said. ``We'll have a robust debate on the issues. I
can guarantee that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The solar system is not alone as an array of planets orbiting in
the gravitational embrace of a shining star.
</P>
<P>
   Laying to rest any lingering notion of the Sun's family being a
singular phenomenon in the universe, astronomers announced on
Thursday the detection of three large planets around Upsilon
Andromedae, a solar-type star 44 light-years away. Solitary planets
had been observed around several other stars in the last four
years, but this is the first clear evidence showing another star
accompanied by multiple planets in a stable system bearing some
resemblance to the Sun's.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the planets are several times more massive than Jupiter,
the solar system's giant, which is 318 times heftier than Earth.
The third planet, with at least three-quarters the Jovian mass, is
so close to the star that it completes a full orbit _ its year _
every 4.6 Earth days. Astronomers said that they would not be
surprised if they eventually find other, more distant objects
around the star.
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers greeted the discovery with unbridled
enthusiasm. They called it a major milestone in planetary science.
Here, finally, was what they had eagerly been seeking: another
planetary system to compare with their own. They expected further
study of the Upsilon Andromedae system to challenge some theories
of planet formation and evolution, and probably hatch new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Of even greater philosophical as well as scientific importance,
the discovery encouraged astronomers in their growing belief that
the universe abounds in stars with planetary systems. This, in
turn, increased the probability that some of them include habitable
worlds, scientists said, though no such claim is being made for the
newly discovered system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single planets we found around other stars was a glorious
discovery, but the architecture of other planetary systems had been
missing,'' Dr. Geoffrey Marcy, a leader of the discovery team, said
in an interview. ``Here for the first time, we can see a kinship
between these planets and our own solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a theorist of planetary systems at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, who must come to grips with the
implications of the findings, said simply, ``This is exciting
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made independently by two teams, one from San
Francisco State University and the other from the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
They joined in announcing the results at a news conference in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A full report, which has already been reviewed by more than a
dozen independent astronomers, has been submitted for publication
in The Astrophysical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two completely independent sets of observations gives
us confidence in this detection,'' said Rischer, of the San
Francisco team. And Marcy, the team leader and most prolific
discoverer of extra-solar planets, said, ``I would bet my house on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Upsilon Andromedae is a nearby bright star visible to
the unaided eye, the three planets cannot be seen even with the
most powerful telescopes. Astronomers infer their existence, orbits
and minimum masses from years of careful study of their
gravitational effects, characterized as reflex motions, on the host
star. In their orbital courses, the planets tug first one way and
then the other on the star, causing ever-so-slight changes in the
star's velocity.
</P>
<P>
   This observational technique has been responsible for the
detection of 18 Jupiter-class extra-solar planets since 1995, when
Swiss astronomers found the first planet around another normal
star, 51 Pegasi.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Noyes, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer, said the new
observations should dispel any doubts that these objects are true
planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nagging question was whether the massive bodies orbiting in
apparent isolation around stars really are planets,'' Noyes said in
a statement. ``But now that we see three around the same star, it
is hard to imagine anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Lin, a theorist at the University of California at
Santa Cruz who has sought to explain how such huge planets could
exist so close to their stars, much closer than Jupiter is to the
Sun, said the new detections should enable scientists to evaluate
their various theories. They are struggling to understand if
systems with several super-Jupiter planets, traveling eccentric
orbits close to their stars, are more typical than the solar
system, with its gaseous giant planets all traveling circular
orbits at great distance from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very important discovery,'' Lin said in an
interview. ``It tells us that planetary systems are quite
ubiquitous, and some of them are quite stable. It also tells us
that the existence of habitable planets is highly probable.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although Earth-size planets could exist in the Upsilon
Andromedae system, astronomers said, they would be undetectable
with current search methods. In any event, they would be unlikely
to exist in what astronomers think of as the habitable zone of a
planetary system, close enough to be warmed by the star, like
Earth, but not so close as to be baked like Mercury and Venus.
Also, the gravitational forces of Jupiter class objects in that
vicinity would more than likely have cleared it any small planets.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery teams calculated that the middle planet in the
Upsilon Andromedae system is in an orbit corresponding to the
distance of Venus from the Sun. It is at least twice the mass of
Jupiter, making the complete circuit every 242 days. The outermost
known planet, at least four times more massive than Jupiter, orbits
the star about once every four earth years at a distance comparable
to the region between Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers suspect that these giant planets are, like Jupiter
and Saturn, huge spheres of gas without a solid surface. But, also
like Jupiter and Saturn, they could have many large moons.
Possibly, Lin speculated, on one of these moons there could be
liquid water, and atmosphere and other conditions conducive to
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' Lin remarked, ``on one of those satellites, I
would probably have a beach-front property.''
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to Upsilon Andromedae had already been
discovered by Marcy and Dr. R. Paul Butler in 1996. At the time,
they detected additional motions of the star suggesting other
companions, but only with repeated observations and careful
analysis could they be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers were less surprised by the discovery than relieved.
For several months, they had generally assumed the existence of
extra-solar planetary systems. After all, the Sun is a common type
of star, one of 200 billion in the Milky Way alone, and beyond lie
more than 80 billion other galaxies. It hardly seemed likely that
the Sun's planets were unique.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery is expected to tax the ingenuity of
theorists. It had been thought that such giant gas bodies could
only form at great distances from a star, out where temperatures
are low enough for ice to condense and begin the process of
planetary formation as gaseous spheres. Finding the single
Jupiter-class object near stars had forced scientists to invent
migration theories, explaining how the planets might have formed at
greater distances and then worked their way in closer to the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mystified at how such a system of Jupiter-like planets
might have been created,'' Marcy said of the Upsilon Andromedae
system. ``This will shake up the theory of planetary formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss of the Carnegie Institution said the discovery could upset
conventional ideas explaining giant Jupiter-class planets. ``Maybe
nature has many ways of making giant planets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next milestone, astronomers said, would be finding evidence
of another system with a Jupiter-class planet out at a distance
from its star corresponding to Jupiter's from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we do,'' Marcy said, ``there will always be the question
of whether the solar system is a cosmic freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Harvard-Smithsonian team were Dr. Sylvain
Korzennik, Dr. Peter Nisenson and Adam Contos, a graduate student.
Dr. Timothy Brown of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
worked with them. Their observations were made at the Whipple
Observatory near Tucson, Ariz. The San Francisco team used the Lick
Observatory near San Jose, Calif. Butler, formerly at San Francisco
State and now at the Anglo-Australian Observatory near Sydney, is
the lead author of the journal report on the detections.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a decade or more before spacecraft are in place to
look for Earth-size planets of other stars.
</P>
<P>
   After years of searching and speculation, both fanciful and
educated, the discovery of multiple objects orbiting Upsilon
Andromedae marked the beginning of the science of comparative
planetary systems.

BOOING AN NBA THAT NO LONGER EXISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Here is what Rick Pitino was really saying after
Wednesday night's latest tedious evening at the Fleet: ``Can't we
all get along?''
</P>
<P>
   The sad answer may very well be no, at least not for the
forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   The players don't understand the fans and the fans don't like
the players. The president/coach wishes the season weren't even
taking place. The 1999 Boston Celtics campaign, declared Rick
Pitino, is a ``debacle to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The only good news is that, starting Friday, only seven home
games remain.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to understand why things are so bad between the
Celtics and the fans. Bear with me as I try to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the idea that the Boston Celtics as an organization
have spoiled this city and its basketball fans. From 1956 until
approximately 1992 (Larry Bird's last year) the Celtics were
winners, and often champions. Down periods were brief. The two
specific rebuilding periods took five and two years, respectively,
to produce a championship. It was quite natural to think that the
Celtics would always be great. Worse yet, it was quite natural to
start thinking that they actually owed it to you to be great, just
because you were you, wonderful you. (This is a corollary of the
narcissistic entitlement view held by so many Red Sox fans.)
</P>
<P>
   Those people may or may not still be going to games. Some are
disillusioned. Some have been priced out. Some detest the NBA's New
World Order of Noise and Hype, preferring, instead, sport to quote,
entertainment, unquote. I suspect the diehards of the 1960s and
1970s, and even their offspring, are now basically stay-aways.
</P>
<P>
   But some of them undoubtedly do go, and they are very unhappy
patrons. They have known too many good times and they have been
privileged to see too many great players. They are very hard
markers.
</P>
<P>
   That's one category of unhappy Celtic fan. Next up are the
people who got overly excited about the arrival of Rick Pitino and
who may not have understood that going from 15 wins to 36 was the
easy part. They underestimated the ramifications of having so many
important young players on the team and never thought that having
17 of the first 26 games on the road would have such a detrimental
effect on the team. You can include me in that group, but now I
understand. The schedule was a killer. This team could not handle
it.
</P>
<P>
   The three key players are very young. Antoine Walker is 22. Ron
Mercer is 22. Paul Pierce is 21. Larry Bird, in case you've
forgotten, was a 23-year old rookie. Sam Jones was a 24-year old
rookie. These are different times. The NBA is a vulture's league,
preying on the emotional weakness of the young. Is it any surprise
that the best teams _ Utah, Miami, Portland, Houston, Indiana _ all
depend on players who have been around anywhere from six to 16
years? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   I believe there is only one real reason to boo, and that is lack
of effort. Repeated stupidity is aggravating, but not booable. And
anyone can make a bad judgment. You think Larry Bird didn't take
some foolish shots?
</P>
<P>
   Fans at the Fleet have become so hostile they now boo Just
Because. On Wednesday night Antoine Walker came down on a fast
break _ yup, an honest-to-God fast break _ and pulled up for an
open foul line jumper. He missed. And he was booed.
</P>
<P>
   That was ridiculous. The shot in question would have been taken
by John Havlicek and Larry Bird, because it was the proper
basketball judgment. Antoine takes it, and when it doesn't go in,
he gets booed? This is irrational fan bahavior.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where we are now, and in this case some of it is
Antoine's fault and some of it is Rick Pitino's fault. Antoine
would not accept the fact that all the shoulder-wiggling and
hot-dogging he indulged in during his first two years did not amuse
his own fans. He would not accept that his fruitless coast-to-coast
ventures, often ending in a strip somewhere in the foul lane, were
counter-productive. At his best, the fans have been tolerating him.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino made matters much worse by naming him captain before his
22d birthday. That naive act insulted the savvier fans. It amazes
me that Pitino couldn't see this. He was recklessly setting up
Antoine for a fall from grace. I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
Rick Pitino is such a 24-hour conglomerate he no longer has any
real contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What we now have at the Fleet is a fandom that pines for the old
days; that loathes the truly insulting and irrelevant ``game
presentation'' that assumes you really haven't come for the game;
and that is extremely resentful of the player salaries and the high
ticket prices (it cost me $3 to see Game 7 of the 1966 Finals from
the loge, and I've got the ticket stub to prove it). Mixed in are a
large number of kids whose only interest in being in attendance is
to see themselves on the jumbotron, and who will mimic their elders
when the booing starts.
</P>
<P>
   The basic 1999 NBA game, of course, is beyond dreadful. It is
positively numbing compared to its glory days of the mid-1980s.
Instead of T-shirts, the Parquet Patrol should be shooting refunds
into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The players have raw skill, but few are grounded enough in
fundamentals to have anything resembling a Plan B if the defense
takes away Plan A, which is so often does. Worse yet, the coaches,
as exemplified by Friday night's guest, the thoroughly reinvented
Pat Riley, have strangled 99.9 percent of the offensive life out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks are as frequent as human sacrifices on Boston
Common. With the game lacking all semblance of grace, flow and
beauty, winning really does become the only thing, and the Fleet
fans really do expect the Celtics to lose. Thus, on-court mistakes
are self-fulfilling prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   The players, who know so little about their athletic ancestry,
are absolutely clueless. The fans think they stink and hate them
for the money, which, the players reason, was not extracted at the
barrel of a gun, so far as they can recall. Being immature, they
cannot understand how they can be booed at home, where things are
supposed to be lovey-dovey. They tighten up, play worse and down
come the boos. Pitino is correct. The booing serves no purpose. The
players, Walker included, really are trying.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone is overreacting. It wasn't even that bad at the
Fleet on Wednesday. There have been many worse nights this season.
Hey, with less than a minute to go, they were a good Paul Pierce
shot away from winning. But when the game was over Pitino yelled at
a fan _ Rick, this has got to stop _ and then he was practically
begging people to stop booing Walker and Walker was in ther locker
room feeling sorry from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   We've had bad teams and unpleasant atmospheres around here
before (Hello, Sidney), but this is something different. The entire
Boston NBA experience is somehow off its axis. The real problem
isn't Pitino, and it isn't Walker and it isn't the 14-24 record.
The real problem is that even if the Celtics were 24-14, or even
34-4, and on their way to the playoffs the fun we once knew in this
league is gone. Our beloved game has been hijacked by some weird,
alien force. It's all sadly wrong. The Fleet fans may not realize
it, but what they're really doing when they boo is lament an NBA,
that, for us, at least, no longer exists.

TRADES SHAKE UP NFL DRAFT PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trades aren't made every day in the NFL, but there was one
Thursday that sent a few teams scurrying to maneuver for a
favorable position in Saturday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts traded three-time Pro Bowl running back Marshall Faulk
to the St. Louis Rams for a second- and fifth-round pick in the
draft. It would seem the Colts, picking fourth, will take Ricky
Williams, though some think they may attempt a fast one, take
Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey or Southern Cal linebacker Chris
Claiborne and draft a running back in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans Saints are trying to do everything to get
Williams, and Thursday were talking to the Browns, Eagles, and
Bengals, all of whom pick ahead of the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also trying to move up to take one of the
running backs, and if they could get to the fifth spot (Washington)
they could land Miami's Edgerrin James. The Redskins reportedly
became more receptive to a deal with the Patriots after the Rams
made their move. The Rams had been trying to move up to five to
take Williams or James, but now have their running back. So now the
Rams (picking sixth) will either stay put and take Ohio State wide
receiver David Boston, or try and move down.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are also trying to move up and are willing to offer
players, but the Redskins want picks. And New England has the picks
_ five in the first three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may also take a shot at the Bengals' No. 3 spot.
While they're strongly leaning toward taking a quarterback, likely
Oregon's Akili Smith, they would listen to a strong pitch for draft
picks, according to one source. The Bengals are not the richest
team in the league and if they selected Smith, they'd be looking at
a $10 million to $12 million signing bonus. They would also like to
draft two good offensive linemen and New England's first-round
picks (20th and 28th) as well as considerations in the 2000 draft
would allow them to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts appear to be gambling that neither the Patriots nor
the Saints will be able to move into the top three. They may be
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Rams coach Dick Vermeil, who likes older, more established
players _ like Faulk _ told reporters in St. Louis, ``We're very
excited about it. I think it's an outstanding move for our
organization. Our first-round pick is in tact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were definitely in position to take James, but felt
Faulk was the sure thing and NFL proven. That's the way some teams
feel about the difference between Williams and James, including
Saints general manager Bill Kuharich, who said, ``James has been
the guy for one year. Ricky's been the guy for four years. James is
more of a home run hitter and Ricky is more of a pounder, a
wear-them-down guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have acquired a brand-new offense with quarterback
Trent Green and guard Adam Timmerman. Last year, Tony Banks was the
quarterback and their top rusher was June Henley, who gained 313
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, 26, was trying to renegotiate his seven-year deal, which
has two years remaining. He is scheduled to make $2.2 million this
year. Faulk rushed for 1,319 yards, caught 86 passes for 908 yards,
and scored 10 touchdowns. His 2,227 total yards from scrimmage was
the sixth-highest total in NFL history. He was second to Terrell
Davis in rushing yards and was third in receptions. He led all NFL
running backs in both receptions and reception yards. Baltimore,
the Giants, and Oakland were all considering making a run at Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were never approached.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terry Glenn and his agent, Jim Gould, met with Patriots coach
Pete Carroll this week concerning a possible schedule for Glenn in
training camp and during the regular season. Glenn is trying to
stay healthy all season and has mapped out what he would feel would
be an ideal schedule . . . Third-down specialist Troy will be
staying away from the strength and conditioning program this
season. The receiver is not pleased with the status of his contract
talks.

CNBC'S WITTY, BULLISH BUSINESS COVERAGE PAYS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business and sex long have toiled as cooperative bedfellows, but
it doesn't mean business on TV is sexy.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder CNBC continues to be a revelation. That a cable
channel devoted to the world of button-down business has survived
is one thing; that it has thrived is yet another.
</P>
<P>
   Making business visually palpable to both stock market experts
and those merely getting their feet wet was at one point economic
suicide, particularly for a niche channel where the most action
comes from that stock ticker tape dancing across the bottom of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But CNBC, which is owned by NBC and celebrates its 10-year
anniversary Friday night with a one-hour recap special, has in many
ways become the principal broadcast source of business and
financial news. It's a major player in a market that has in the
past five years become surprisingly pervasive on television.
</P>
<P>
   Look at CNN programs such as ``Moneyline'' and the cable
network's CNNfn, the all-business news station started four years
ago. There's also Bloomberg Television and PBS' ``Wall Street
Week,'' whose financial reports are often followed by egregious
puns.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of 401(k), many Americans have reasons to follow the
stock market and understand mutual funds. CNBC even offers a
glossary of financial terms for its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profiting From Experience _ Ten Years at CNBC'' will look back
to the late '80s and CNBC's coverage of stories like the '89
mini-crash and the failed UAL Corp. leveraged buyout. Clips from
the early days of programming such as ``The Money Wheel ``Street
Signs'' and ``Power Lunch'' will be aired.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's veteran anchors Sue Herera, Bill Griffeth Ted David and
Ron Insana will talk about their stories, while NBC President Bob
Wright and CNBC President Bill Bolster offer up the cable channel
as the trend-setter of biz TV.
</P>
<P>
   Crediting CNBC, actually a late player in the game, with
whetting our appetite for TV business elicits strong arguments pro
and con. Media analyst David Tidwell takes the middle-of-the-road
view, saying the cable channel has done many things well _ the most
notable of which is being in the right place at the right time.
</P>

   ``For certain, business has become an actual beat for the major
network newscasts because of the number of American baby boomers
getting into mutual funds has exploded,'' says the Cleveland-based
Tidwell.
</P>
<P>
   Now people who have only a few thousand bucks tied up in funds
feel like part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you see someone like a Peter Jennings introducing
more personal finance stories on (ABC) and why `The Dorfman Report'
(a discussion of the day's hot stocks on CNBC) becoming such a
popular viewer destination,'' he says. ``You could say economics
has shifted from the vague and global to the personal at a time
when CNBC was on the air. They merely shifted with the wind, so to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The Financial News Network, which was then followed by CNN and
others, was already up and running with business news when CNBC
started. But at that time, according to Bolster, business news was
dryly reported and largely aimed at Wall Street traders,
professional money managers and retirees who dabbled in the market
from the safe distance of a golf course. But in 1991, things began
changing when CNBC acquired FNN, which was on the brink of closing
shop.
</P>
<P>
   After swallowing FNN, CNBC sharpened its visual look with better
lighting and camera angles; the network even started coaching
anchors on how to jazz up interviews with corporate executives and
money managers whose only relationship with television was watching
one. (Later, they'd add younger anchors and some women, like Maria
Bartiromo, who's known, for better or worse, on the trading floor
as ``the money honey.'')
</P>
<P>
   Critics sliced into CNBC for spending too much time on on-air
appearance and trying to ``entertain'' its audience; they said that
such frivolity was getting in the way of the real work. But younger
viewers are said to have followed, and the network is now in 65
million homes, 160 million worldwide. That's still tiny when
compared with network television, or even large cable suppliers
like ESPN. But it's still far ahead of CNNfn, which has stalled at
10 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC isn't letting up. One of the cable network's breeziest
programs is ``Squawk Box,'' the 3-year-old show about the stock
market that gives viewers a behind-the-scenes look at how Wall
Street works. To understand its power and influence, consider that
CEOs are known to drop everything to be on the show.
</P>
<P>
   What also has helped CNBC: the channel's relationship with The
Wall Street Journal, which supplies news and trade sources. (In
Asia and Europe, NBC and Dow Jones are co-owners.)
</P>
<P>
   Says Tidwell, ``You can't get ratings if people don't watch.
It's a little like luring someone in and then hitting them over the
head. That might be an odd way of putting it, but niche networks
have to do what it takes to get viewers to sample over and again,
and then stick with it as something they'd rather not do without.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolster agrees with that, but adds that CNBC profits from a time
when global engagements are economic rather than political or
military.
</P>
<P>
   To Bolster, economics isn't just a market story. ``It's a social
story,'' he says. ``You don't have to have millions in the stock
market to know and understand this.''

EQUIPMENT SNARLS EMISSIONS TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARCIA BIEDERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The revised New York state emissions-testing program is leaving
its own trail of exhaust. Service stations and dealers complain
about late installation and frequent breakdowns of the new
high-technology equipment used to check vehicle emissions, and some
motorists have had difficulty finding stations that can test their
cars before the inspection stickers expire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're backed up _ other shops are sending cars to us,'' said
Mike Gonta, an employee of Automotive Express on Fourth Avenue in
Brooklyn, as Eddie Andrades Jr., an inspector, tested a car on the
shop's new dynamometer. With the car stationary but its drive
wheels turning on rollers, the equipment measured emissions as
Andrades accelerated to nearly 60 mph under load _ simulating the
effects of hills. He adjusted his pressure on the gas pedal in
response to an arrow that moved on a computer screen outside the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Andrades said of testing with the ``dyno.'' But
few others in the inspection business would agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since it came into widespread use in nine counties last month,
the machine has generated headaches and legal action. Repair shops,
equipment suppliers and the state Department of Motor Vehicles all
place the blame in different quarters, but all agree that problems,
though on the decline, are likely to persist for a while. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dynamometer test is the centerpiece of a new
emissions-testing program required in the New York metropolitan
region by the federal Clean Air Act. In New York state, nine
counties are affected: Rockland, Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and
the five boroughs of New York City. The new test is conducted along
with the safety inspection that has long been required. The
combined emissions and safety check costs car owners $35, compared
with $19 for the old test.
</P>
<P>
   Because many shops could not afford new test equipment _ which
costs up to $40,000 to $60,000 installed _ the number of inspection
stations in the region dropped to 3,900, from 5,000 under the old
program.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, the state's latest deadline for dynamometers to be
up and running, hundreds of garages were still waiting for
equipment suppliers to install software, said Lou Vagnone, field
supervisor of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers
Association, which represents independent shops in New York City.
``It became a monster,'' Vagnone said. Once the software was in, he
added, it proved trouble-prone.
</P>
<P>
   Marylou Rocco, service director for Bi-County Saturn, which
operates four service departments on Long Island, said it had been
a struggle to serve her customers. At two of her stores, the dynos
have periodically broken down, she said. The vendor of those
machines has not yet installed software at one store, she said, and
has been slow to respond to calls for service. The dealership has
tried to shield its customers from the problems, she said, taking
their cars to a local gas station for inspection when the work
could not be done on-site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our best to keep these poor people happy,'' Mrs.
Rocco said. ``They're our loyal customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is a key reason for repair shops to stay in the
inspection program. Although they get to keep most of the $35 fee,
and they may charge for any adjustments made to get cars to pass
the emissions test, many shop owners say they do inspections mainly
as a service to regular customers. (Because the emissions standards
are being raised gradually, the failure rate has changed little,
state officials say.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rocco's company, which purchased seven machines, expected
better service, she said, ``but it seems that maybe the vendors
weren't ready,'' despite two extensions of the state's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the motor vehicle department, Jennifer Post,
said that vendors, as well as the garages that do the testing, had
had ample time to prepare. But, she said, ``they dragged their
feet.'' On March 15, the department began severing its data
connections to inspection stations that were not in compliance,
shutting them out of the testing system. On March 30 alone, 800
shops were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Post said the cutoffs were necessary, because the three
vendors certified by the state had been installing equipment at a
snail's pace. Since the vendors' contracts were with individual
inspection stations, not with the state, the department wanted the
stations to put pressure on the vendors to get the machines
running, Ms. Post said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, though the vendors were the target, ``it was the shops that
got hurt,'' said Steve LaBonte, director of dealer services for the
Greater New York Auto Dealers Association. In addition to
inspecting cars for consumers, dealers must inspect their own used
cars before selling them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the day after 800 shops were cut off, the New York State
Association of Service Stations obtained a temporary restraining
order from state Supreme Court in Albany against the motor vehicles
department. The order, which has withstood two appeals, has allowed
shops to issue inspection stickers without having to conduct a
dynamometer test, Ms. Post said. Still, by Tuesday 87 percent of
the shops had complied with the dynamometer-test requirement, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the department dug in its heels, each of the three
certified equipment suppliers was installing about four machines a
day, Ms. Post said. Now, she said, the rate is about 21 a day for
each supplier.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the restraining order is set for next Friday. By
then, 95 percent of the shops are likely to be in compliance, and
the service station association does not plan to seek an extension,
its executive director, Ralph Bombardiere, said. He said that the
vendors had been working hard to catch up. John Corlett, assistant
director of government affairs for the Automobile Club of New York,
said there had been no complaints about inspection delays in the
New York metropolitan area, though some members have had to go
somewhere other than their usual repair shops. ``My sense is that
it will work itself out,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bombardiere said inspectors were still getting used to the
dynamometer, which he compared to a Nintendo game. The test has to
be repeated if the inspector ``driving'' the car fails to stay
between parameters on a screen. This may challenge old-timers
unschooled in computers but is no big deal to those who grew up
with video games. At Automotive Express, Andrades said he and
another technician have had no trouble completing inspections,
including the safety check, in 35 or 40 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught on quick,'' said Andrades, who is 22. &QL;

   KUKES, Albania _ At the age of three, Arta clings to her papa,
screams at seeing a truck or motorcycle -- or anything that moves
and makes noise -- and is too terrified to climb into a car.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach to life is not so hard to understand if you know
that a few weeks ago her house back in Kosovo was circled with
tanks, and Serbian paramilitary soldiers were shooting up the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After that, her family walked four days to get to safety here in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   She is a severe case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 20 cases like this over in the cultural palace,'' said
Elvana Zhezha, the coordinator of the Albanian Center for Human
Rights, who is running the psycho-socio program for children here
in coordination with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
   The cultural palace is a communist-era activities center now
housing both refugees and programs to help them. It is part of the
ad hoc network of shelters raised for 100,000 refugees who
descended upon a city with a population of 25,000. Fully half these
refugees are under 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF trained 30 Albanians, mostly healthcare professionals, to
work with children like Arta who are blanketed by the shock of war.
</P>
<P>
   Zhezha said she is hoping now to train doctors and nurses among
the Kosovar Albanian refugee population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take the experience with them,'' she said, when and
if the ethnic cleansing is reversed and they can return to their
ravaged homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The mental and emotional damage done to children in wartime
situations like this is an often hidden problem, but it is among
the most critical and long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest concern is sanitation and hygiene, followed by
psycho-socio problems,'' said Paul Martin, the UNICEF coordinator
here.
</P>
<P>
   These youngsters have the advantage of being generally healthy
to start with. They are not malnourished or plagued with exotic
diseases, as poverty-stricken Africans often are, and they are
already toughened by rough country living.
</P>
<P>
   But they have disadvantages, too. The youngest and most
vulnerable children of three years and under often don't get fully
washed for weeks when families have been travelling like these
have.
</P>
<P>
   Behija Thaci is grateful for the two pampers a day she gets from
a local church for her six-month-old daughter, but she needs more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't enough because of the diarrhea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the intense pressure of moving across embattled territory,
families land in a refugee camp where toilets and clean water are a
long walk away, or they may end up in a field that has neither.
Water that is available is cold enough to leave infants wailing.
</P>
<P>
   At tent camps and tractor parking areas, parents everywhere can
be seen dropping the pants of their little ones to let them relieve
themselves wherever they happen to be. On Thursday at one new tent
camp, where chemical toilets stood available 50 yards away, mothers
took their tykes to a closer grassy spot that happened to be next
to a stream where others were washing clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But those are conditions that will be alleviated and are not so
likely to leave deep scars.
</P>
<P>
   Zhezha talked about young girls of 13 or 14 who were raped in
front of their families, an offense that in a Muslim population
leaves as deep a stigma on the victim as on the predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also children traumatized from the scene where Serb
soldiers -- three or four of them -- raped the mother,'' she said.
``Imagine what it would be like seeing your mother scream and
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of troubled children can be seen everywhere. The silent
small faces with unnaturally wide-opened eyes peering out of
plastic covers on tractor-drawn wagons. Aggressive children who
kick and punch and dart away from their parents. The screams when a
helicopter passes -- a frequent event in this mountain region where
supplies are most easily carried on whirlybirds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these children need serious counselling, but for now
they must do with the aid of people with two weeks training in how
to deal with troubled children.

FINANCIAL SITUATION IMPROVED, MEMBERS OF D.C. CITY COUNCIL PUSH FOR
TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Okla., Va.)  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest measure of the District of Columbia's
march from annual budget deficits to surpluses, a majority of the
city council members Thursday proposed cutting taxes for residents
by $418 million as an economic stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes phased-in reductions of personal income
tax, commercial property taxes and business taxes over three years,
making it one of the most ambitious plans put forward by the
council since the city was placed under a financial control board
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Mayor Anthony A. Williams and members of Congress who
oversee district affairs expressed some hesitation about the size
and shape of the package, with concerns that it could effect the
delivery of city services, the mere fact it was proposed reflected
how far the economic recovery of the district has come in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never even would have contemplated this two years ago,''
Jack Evans, a Democrat who is one of the bill's co-sponsors, said
in an interview. ``But it shows that the D.C. council is playing a
real leadership role in tax policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans and eight other members of the 13-member council appeared
at a news conference Thursday to discuss details of their proposal,
which they said is designed to bring district taxes more in line
with those of neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It was, at once, an extraordinary show of political force, not
only for the initial support by enough council members to make it
veto-proof, as several of them assured, but also for its texture:
The group included both of the council's Republicans as well as
seven Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing aspects of the plan, they stressed that the city's
1998 surplus of $112.5 million and conservative estimates of
surpluses for this year and next would make the cuts possible
without affecting city services.
</P>
<P>
   The members also said the cuts were the most prudent way to stem
a population flow that has cost the district hundreds of thousands
of residents over the last four decades. From 1960 to 1997, the
city's population fell to 523,124 from 763,956, a 31 percent drop
that also took hundreds of small businesses out of the district and
depleted the tax base.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they make suburbs and moving vans, this city is
imperiled,'' said David Catania, a co-sponsor of the package and
one of the Republicans. ``Are we going to be the engine of growth
for this region or not? It starts with tax parity.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the city's former chief financial officer who recently
completed his first 100 days as mayor to generally favorable
reviews, said he would prefer a more narrow approach to cutting
taxes, at least until it could be demonstrated that spending
programs would not be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a hearing Thursday of the district subcommittee of
the House Appropriations Committee, Williams said, `My particular
druthers, focusing on tax reductions where you see real benefits,
is small businesses. There is an extraordinary discrepancy between
what our businesses pay and what they pay in the surrounding
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Ernest J. Istook Jr. of
Oklahoma, said he applauded tax cuts as ``maybe the most important
part of economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   But addressing Williams, City Council Chairwoman Linda W. Cropp
and Alice Rivlin, chairwoman of the financial control board, Istook
said he wanted to make sure that the ongoing efforts to improve
management of city agencies would continue, keeping the tax cuts
viable.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers praised the City Council for the tax plan, but
expressed the hope that Williams would be more supportive of it.
Rep. James P. Moran Jr. of Virginia, the ranking Democrat, said,
``The only problem is that it did not come from the mayor, as head
of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, chairman of the House Oversight
subcommittee on the district, agreed, saying ``it would be good to
have the mayor on board.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``The city has to do this to stay competitive with
the suburbs. If they don't do it, I don't see how they can build a
middle class or a business tax base.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax plan would reduce the district's personal income tax
rate by 1 percent a year for three years. Currently, district
residents who make more than $20,000 annually pay 9.5 percent, one
of the highest rates in the country. But even those earning less
are now paying 8 percent or 6 percent, which is still more than
residents of Maryland who pay 5.75 percent and Virginia who pay 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would lower the current corporate tax of 9.975 to 8.5
percent the first year and by an additional percent in each of the
next two years, leaving the district between Virginia's rate of 6.0
percent and Maryland's 7.0.
</P>
<P>
   And almost all of the district's property taxes would be reduced
to make the rates more competitive with Maryland and Virginia.

those on the losing side of the vote, including the float
committee's president, have launched a campaign to kill the ``Party
Animal'' float saying it presents the wrong image, sends the wrong
message about Glendale. (Will move in the ``a'' national and ``n''

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ NATO admits that one of its

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ As sentiment in Congress grew

field for a resurgent Kosovar rebel force. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Brussels, Belgium) _ Russia has endorsed most of
the peace plan for Kosovo offered by Germany this week, European

PATAKI CALLS NEW YORK A MODEL FOR THE NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sounding like a national political candidate, New
York Gov. George E. Pataki on Thursday held up his state as a model
for the country in cutting taxes, spurring job growth and paring
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the four years since I took office, New York has cut taxes
more than any other state,'' Pataki told a House panel on
government reform. ``We've cut taxes 36 times, returning $19
billion to the taxpayers so far. And when all the tax cuts on the
books take full effect, that number will grow to over $52
billion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To paraphrase Frank Sinatra, if you can cut taxes in New York,
and cut them more than any other state, you can cut taxes anywhere.
Even Washington,'' Pataki said, referring to ``New York, New
York,'' one of the late star's hit songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is precisely what Washington should commit itself to
doing, by cutting taxes and strengthening the freedom that makes
America thrive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While he hasn't announced whether he will seek the Republican
presidential nomination next year, Pataki has not quelled
speculation either. He recently visited New Hampshire, where the
nation's first presidential primary will be held, and he has begun
to make speeches across the country to raise his profile.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field is already crowded. It includes former Vice
President Dan Quayle, former American Red Cross chief Elizabeth
Dole, publishing magnate Steve Forbes, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan and
conservative activist Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front runner, and Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., have not yet announced their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's appearance Thursday before the House Committee on
Government Reform was aimed at enhancing his image as a so-called
``compassionate conservative'' who has wielded a budget ax while
boosting educational and health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   He told lawmakers that his administration has cut 20,000 state
government slots through attrition, reduced regulations on
corporations to encourage record job growth and cut welfare rolls
dramatically, all while running record-high state budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican and Democrats on the committee seemed impressed,
with several asking Pataki for advice on how he would handle fiscal
policy at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the panel chairman, said, ``You sure
you don't want to run for king? I like what you are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the governor that his
efforts to spur job growth have helped the region. ``Connecticut is
a better place from what you've done in New York,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., praised Pataki for providing a
state education program that allows schools to stay open into the
early evening so that students may attend additional classes while
parents work.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., told the governor that while the two
of them often disagree about state policies, Pataki has been open
and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Janice Schakowsky, D-Ill., challenged Pataki's
statistics, asserting that New York's debt is climbing, while its
bond rating is falling. She said President Clinton and federal
policies should also be credited for New York's success.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki argued that he inherited from his successor, Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo, the state's poor credit rating, which he said has
improved during his tenure. He also blamed Cuomo for the state's
high indebtedness and said that he is now slowing the rate of
increase.

REFUGEES VOICE NATO SUPPORT, DESPITE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINA, Albania _ As Serb soldiers gazed through binoculars from
the Kosovo side of the border, Metullahe Beqiri limped onto safe
ground Thursday after a 96-hour journey on foot, sobbing as she
collapsed at a guard station here.
</P>
<P>
   Then Beqiri, 53, looked back at the troops who had driven her
out. ``It is the Serbs who have bombed the civilians,'' she wailed.
``NATO has not done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of ethnic Albanians around her offered the same insistent
testimony, despite admissions by NATO officials that a missile had
struck two caravans of refugees the night before, killing as many
as 75 civilians as they fled Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   Many crossing the border Thursday said they had even heard and
seen the bombing, describing severed body parts, and shredded
belongings lying in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   But they refused to believe anybody but the Serbs could have
done something wrong. Their loyalty to NATO seemed impenetrable,
particularly among the hundreds of refugees who arrived on foot
Thursday afternoon in the worst physical condition that
humanitarian aid officials have seen since the exodus from Kosovo
began.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complaints that more than three weeks of NATO
airstrikes had failed to stop the forcible expulsion campaign of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Nor was there outrage over
civilian attacks, even among those who accepted that NATO might
have made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO said to us, `Excuse me,' I would forgive them, because
NATO is bombing to bring peace in Kosovo,'' said Mal Krasnqi, 42, a
dentist from the town of Decan. ``NATO knows the situation in
Kosovo. They know what is happening there. They are the only ones
who can help.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing support for NATO came as Serb troops dug new
outposts in the hills surrounding the border crossings, where they
had fired mortar shells the night before.
</P>
<P>
   It also came as thousands more Kosovars entered Northern
Albania, the bulk of them women and children separated from their
families, all of them dazed and on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials said the people arriving Thursday and the night
before were more physically damaged than any previous group, having
walked for three or four days without food or sleep, many of them
bleeding from schrapnel cuts and bruised from being beaten with
hammers and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Three babies died during the journey, and an 18-month-old died
Thursday after arriving at a refugee camp in Kukes, doctors said.
Up to 100,000 refugees have descended on the tiny northern town in
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, refugees also showed signs of malnutrition,
aid workers said. Serb troops apparently have killed farmers and
livestock and destroyed raw food supplies in the areas of Drenica
and Kopiliq.
</P>
<P>
   One man said he had tried to rescue his family from starvation
by buying food from a store, but had been stopped by Serb troops
who confiscated everything but his bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have not been eating,'' said Angela Walker of the
United Nations World Food Program. ``It seems as if the situation
is getting pretty grave across the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees _ as well as humanitarian officials _ said they
feared Serb troops might escalate their attack on northern Albania,
where shelling and sniper fire have crossed the border with
increasing frequency over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mere pinpricks into the hillside, Serbian mortar shells exploded
here and damaged nothing but the grass on Wednesday night, sparing
some 200 refugees seated nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian police had anticipated Serbs might eventually shell
civilians and warned humanitarian organizations not to draw
attention to themselves in the hours before the 1:40 a.m. attacks
began. At the same time, there has been an increasing military
presence in Kukes, as Albanian soldiers have set up new checkpoints
and gathered their forces at an outpost near the border in order to
protect civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But several refugees feared that they had not escaped danger
yet. From the border, they could see Serb soldiers dragging new
supplies onto a mountainside Thursday, running back and forth along
trenches, and carrying what appeared to be mattresses into the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   Fabrie Roma, 38, crossed into Albania shortly after midnight,
having walked four days from her home in Drenica with her five
children in tow. Serb shells began to fall across the border
shortly after she crossed into Albania and ``at first we were very
afraid because we thought the Serbian people would come into
Kukes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid when I heard the shells,'' she said, ``but then I
thought they were probably the shells of NATO, not Serbia. So I did
not worry.''

EX-PAKISTANI LEADER FOUND GUILTY OF CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister,
was found guilty of corruption Thursday in what she denounced as a
politically-motivated verdict, sentenced to five years in prison,
and barred from political activity.
</P>
<P>
   A special antigraft court also convicted her husband, Senator
Asif Ali Zardari, of taking kickbacks from a Swiss company. The
couple was fined $8.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto, who was in London when the verdict was announced, told
BBC television that her conviction was an attempt by the Pakistani
government to divert international attention from its controversial
tests of nuclear-capable missiles in the past two days. It was also
a ploy, she said, to distract from a British court's decree this
week fining the family of Pakistan's prime minister $30.5 million
for failing to repay a business loan.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto denounced the judge who sentenced her as a ``crony'' of
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, her political nemesis,
saying the judge ``is not impartial, he's not fair, he's not doing
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto's attorney and close adviser, Iftikhar Gilani, said by
telephone from the Pakistani capital Islamabad that the verdict was
an ``utter surprise'' and vowed to appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if Bhutto, leader of the opposition Peoples'
Party of Pakistan, would be stripped immediately of her seat in
Parliament, and whether she would be jailed upon her return to
Pakistan. The court barred Bhutto and Zardari from politics for
five years after they are released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto says she was denied the right to rebut the evidence
against her. The Supreme Court last week ordered the lower court to
rule on the admissibility of the evidence, and the verdict had not
been expected until next week.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the Globe two months ago, Bhutto had
dismissed the evidence against her as ``fabricated, forged, and
perjured'' and said she was ``appalled, traumatized, and
tormented'' by what she called a campaign by enemies to remove her
from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she was named her party's ``president for life,''
earning rebukes from critics who said accepting a lifetime post was
hypocritical for someone who espouses democracy. Bhutto, who was
educated at Harvard and Oxford, has twice been elected prime
minister and twice dismissed for alleged corruption and
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   When Bhutto was first elected in 1988, she was the first woman
leader of an Islamic nation and by far the most popular leader in
Pakistan's history. Since then, her reputation has suffered amid
reports of gross corruption and officially sanctioned killings of
suspected terrorists in Karachi. The government has accused her and
her family of amassing $1.5 billion in ill-gotten wealth, and court
documents linked her and her husband to about $137 million in
alleged kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto has been charged in five other graft and influence cases
yet to be tried. Her husband is accused in 14 cases and has been
held without bail for two years on charges that he masterminded the
murder of her brother and potential rival, Murtaza Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto and Zardari were found guilty of taking millions in
``consultancy fees'' from Societe Generale de Surveillance, a Swiss
company hired to inspect shipments to determine customs duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic heart of it is not whether the Swiss companies paid
a consultancy fee or not . . . If they paid a consultancy fee,
that's normal business practice,'' Bhutto said two months ago. She
said she had saved Pakistan millions of dollars by hiring the Swiss
firm, preventing massive tax evasion by shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto said the government has taken the property of 155 people
and claimed it is hers. The government said the others were
fronting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto also said the courts were stacked with judges loyal to
Sharif or who have grudges against her. One is the son of a judge
who sentenced to death her father, former prime minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutto has accused Sharif and Saifur Rehman, head of the
antigraft bureau, of tax evasion, loan defaulting and corruption,
and called the cases against her political vendettas. This week,
the London High Court ordered an engineering company owned by
Sharif's family to pay $30.5 million in overdue loans, said Aitzaz
Ahsan, the Senate leader of thePeoples' Party of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Safdar Abbasi, a Bhutto aide, accused the government of
trying to ``destroy the only viable political opposition in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western diplomat in Islamabad mourned her apparent downfall,
but said she appeared to have brought it on herself. ``There was a
time when her name was synonymous with something progressive in a
place that's not known for very much good,'' the diplomat said.
``It's almost universally accepted that she's better than Nawaz
(Sharif), but they're cut from the same cloth. Right now, the track
record suggests neither of them can get Pakistan much closer to a
democratic, civil society.''

RUSSIANS MARK 50TH BIRTHDAY OF POP QUEEN ALLA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MOSCOW _ She is bigger than The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, or
Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, you say: How can anyone be bigger than Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Alla Pugacheva, the reigning queen of Russia's pop music
scene.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to The King, was Elvis's birthday ever
front-page news? Thursday, Russian news media broke from daily
coverage of Kosovo to give top headlines to Pugacheva's 50th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Did Elvis ever bring home the country's highest civilian award?
Thursday, Pugacheva stopped by the Kremlin, where President Boris
N. Yeltsin handed her a medal for ``service to the fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Beatles once won a similar honor in Britain, but where
are they now? Pugacheva has reigned as Russia's top pop diva for
over a quarter century; her last single, ``Take Me Along With
You,'' dominated the local airwaves in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones can match that kind of longevity, but there
are entire age groups of Americans who never liked the Stones. Just
about everyone in Russia has his or her favorite Alla Pugacheva
song.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the showwomanship of a Liza Minnelli, the powerful
voice and staying power of a Cher or Tina Turner, and the
diva-esque demeanor of Elizabeth Taylor, who dropped by for
Pugacheva's birthday, Pugacheva has sold more than 150 million
records in the former Soviet Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future they will ask, `Who was Leonid Brezhnev?' ''
went one irreverent Russian joke back when Brezhnev ruled as the
Soviet Union's supreme leader. ``And the answer will be `A minor
political figure in the Pugacheva era.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, barely hiding his admiration in a brief Kremlin
ceremony that topped the nightly TV news, teased Pugacheva with a
playful update of the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be remembered as one of the political leaders of the
era of Pugacheva,'' the president said before raising a champagne
toast. Politicians across the spectrum joined in congratulating the
singer.
</P>
<P>
   While her popularity crosses party lines and generation gaps at
home, Pugacheva has not translated well outside the
Russian-speaking world. In a European music competition in Dublin
in 1997, she placed a disappointing 15th. She toured the United
States last year and played for Russian enclave communities.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Russia often have trouble understanding the
Pugacheva phenomenon. Prancing about in short dresses that do not
pretend to hide her none-too-svelte figure, flailing her red locks,
Pugacheva performs in a style known here as ``estrada,'' a Russian
mixture of rock, pop, and torch-song romance that she essentially
invented in the mid-Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the birthday of the mother of Soviet-Russian pop
music,'' screamed one headline.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paving the way for a generation of pop stars,
Pugacheva has become the matron of her own pop dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Her fourth husband, 31-year-old Filip Kirkorov, is a Russian
megastar in his own right, equal parts Prince, Liberace, and
Engelbert Humperdinck. So is Pugacheva's 27-year-old daughter from
a previous marriage, Kristina Oberkaite. And so is Oberkaite's own
recently estranged husband, Vladimir Presnyakov Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Back when nearly every musician allowed to perform repaid the
Communist Party leadership with patriotic songs about the Soviet
state, Pugacheva stuck to her own program. Never a dissident, her
petulant defiance of Soviet protocol often won her headlines _ and
enemies that would have undone a less popular star.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1981 concert, she embarrassed a group of late-arriving
Communist functionaries by stopping the show while they took their
front-row seats. When a party newspaper denounced her, she tore up
the article during the next night's show.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pugacheva cameos in other people's videos, tools
around Moscow in a white stretch limo, and takes care of business
in a private jet named ``Alla.'' Like Liz, she has a line of
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, Pugacheva is still a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian stars unabashedly lip-synch their way through
concerts. Not Pugacheva. Russia's aging diva still always sings
live.

 &HT;    REFUGEE CONVOY BOMBINGS STILL WRAPPED IN MYSTERY
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0416.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Multiple questions and scores of missing
refugees remained Thursday in the aftermath of bombings of Kosovo
refugee caravans, despite the admission by NATO military command
that one of its jets apparently delivered a strike in error.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many convoys were blitzed and who dropped the bombs
on which ones are the critical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees still reeling from one of the Wednesday assaults
adamantly refused to believe that NATO could hit refugees, and they
just as stridently demanded that NATO continue and even step up its
attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was not NATO. They are trying to help us,'' said
Xhevrye Bojrami, 28, a numbed mother of six whose husband was
killed when an explosion rocked the tractor and wagon carrying
their family and about a dozen other refugees. Her husband Ferhati,
35, had been driving.
</P>
<P>
   She said at least four bodies, including that of a friend whose
head was blown off, were taken away immediately by Serbian police.
Two wounded refugees also were taken to a hospital in nearby
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Descriptions of the incident by Bojrami and 14 other refugees in
the caravan do not square with the view given to journalists taken
from Belgrade to a bomb site and morgue in southwest Kosovo. They
saw dozens of dead and wounded, and were told by Yugoslav
authorities that these were the victims of the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the refugees interviewed from the caravan that
arrived here overnight Wednesday spoke of so many victims or so
much road damage as the journalists saw Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the NATO preliminary report says a truck in a civilian
convoy was hit by a NATO bomb, while these refugee caravans had no
trucks. They were comprised of tractors and thousands of people on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently more than one caravan was bombed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, what happened to the rest of the refugees from
the convoy that Serbian Yugoslav officials maintain was bombed by
NATO? Neither journalists here nor investigators for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have
found refugees here who describe a bombing attack that left at
least 60 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from the caravan that arrived late Wednesday and in the
early hours Thursday set the number of victims at between two and
six. They also claimed that at least two MIG-21s -- the kind the
Yugoslav air force flies -- had been circling low before the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The widow Bojrami said the planes struck three times, missing
them with the first two bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do nothing to protect the children. We could do
nothing except just keep traveling to get out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two men with experience either in the Yugoslav military or
aviation insisted the bombers flew as low as 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know planes very well. I used to work at Yugoslav Air
Transport in Belgrade,'' said Bajram Citaku, 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a MIG-21. It was this color green,'' he said, pointing
to a lime green jacket. ``I saw the flag that was on the tail.''
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that NATO may have mistakenly bombed a caravan,
but that the Serb military then began dropping bombs on others and
blaming it on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   A former Yugoslav soldier interviewed separately also described
the plane as a MIG of the same color.
</P>
<P>
   Citaku, who was heading the group on foot directly behind the
short line of tractors, said that Serb police at the bombing site
stopped the group to say: ``Have you seen how NATO attacked you?''
</P>
<P>
   Others heard similar comments from Serbian police and military
along the way. They did not believe the Serbs and hardly could
believe this American journalist when told NATO actually might have
done the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of course it cannot be NATO, but the Serb military.
Because I trust, I have lots of belief in NATO,'' said Sania
Fazliu, 27, a geological engineer.
</P>
<P>
   She and others who passed the bomb site on foot said the Serb
police were filming the wreckage and interviewing a wounded man. He
was coerced into saying that NATO had bombed the convoy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it was the fault of NATO, she said, the bombing of
Yugoslavia cannot be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ask that the attacks be intensified and even that
ground troops come inside Kosovo,'' she said. ``Without this, there
will never be a solution.''

IN THIS AD, REAL STORY IS IN TINY TYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The employment ad offered ``Test Preparation For POSTAL JOBS
$13.19-$18.43//HR.'' It said: ``Fully Paid On The Job Training,
Ages 17 and Up _ Green Card Ok No High School Diploma Needed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom, in type far smaller than any other printing in
the ad, it read, ``Independent From U.S.P.S.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some job-hunters understand what's going on. They understand
that the Government Careers Center, which placed the ad, is a
private entity, separate from the U.S. Postal Service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They may even understand that the Government Careers Center is a
business selling test-taking strategies to people interested in
postal, government or law enforcement jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others don't. That bottom line of type is tiny, and ``Government
Careers Center'' sounds pretty official. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neil Thursby of Kansas City says it sounds like a rip-off.
Thursby called my attention to the ad after two of his relatives
responded to it and were charged $10 each to fill out paperwork _
before they learned of the $357 cost to take 10-hour postal exam
training classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``$10 might not sound like much to some people, but to some
unemployed people it's a lot to lose before they find out that they
maybe can't afford the thing at all,'' Thursby said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I agree. The up-front fee puts a worse taste in my mouth about
an ad that is confusing enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with James Boyce, who said he was director of the
Government Careers Center in Kansas City. He's a congenial guy who
said clearly that the company was in no way affiliated with the
post office or any government entity for which it offers training. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that there were no guarantees that a client
will pass the Postal Service's entry tests, much less get a job at
a post office or sheriff's department or any other agency for which
test preparation is sold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boyce agreed that the bottom-line disclaimer was in tiny type.
But he defended the legitimacy of the test-preparation business. He
equated it to preparing for the SAT or LSAT, noting that people pay
lots of money for those classes with no guarantees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll give him that. But I didn't buy Boyce's defense of the ad.
I think the bit about ``fully paid, on-the-job training'' is
misleading. It's the job applicant who's paying Boyce's company,
not the other way around, and there's no job involved _ yet, or
maybe ever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boyce said the salary and benefits listed in the ad were ``along
the lines of giving them an indication of the job benefits they'll
receive if they get hired by the post office.'' To which I say: Let
the post office take care of announcing its own benefits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boyce asked me to be kind when I wrote about this. I said I'd
grant that test-preparation companies may offer valuable training
and assistance to those who need it and are willing to pay for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But my charity doesn't extend to endorsing the ad. Tom
Rebottaro, a postal inspector, said that it was technically not
fraudulent but that it could prey on ``people who don't understand
that they're only getting practice tests.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again: Buyer beware. &QL;

MARROW TRANSPLANTS LITTLE HELP IN BREAST CANCER, STUDIES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Initial reports from clinical trials of bone marrow transplants
for advanced breast cancer offer little evidence that they extend
life, but researchers say the findings reflect an inconclusive
``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitive answers may take at least three more years, the
researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging finding was that the gruelling and costly
therapy may give some women extra months or years before the
disease returns, even if there's no proof that they survive longer
than women on standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And, the scientists said, it is possible that this delay in
relapse of the cancer may, when the patients have been studied for
a longer period, translate into added life for some patients Even
if the transplants weren't shown to be very effective, at least so
far, cancer specialists said the findings would remove the pressure
some women now feel to undergo the rigorous treatment because they
really have no other choice, and would encourage franker
discussions between patients and doctors with more data on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which included over 2,000 women in the United
States, Scandinavia and South Africa, were released by the American
Society for Clinical Oncology, an organization of cancer physicians
and researchers. The reports will be officially presented at ASCO's
annual meeting in Atlanta next month, but ASCO posted them on the
World Wide Web Thursday because so much interest has been focused
on the controversial treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the results showed that standard therapy and
high-dose, bone-marrow-transplant therapy yield comparable outcomes
in advanced cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five studies whose preliminary findings were released
Thursday did, however, show a survival benefit for women getting
the transplants, but the trial involved a relatively small number
of patients. They were women being treated for primary tumors and
10 or more cancer-containing lymph nodes. Carried out at the
University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, it showed that only 17
percent of women on the high-dose chemotherapy had died after five
years, compared with 35 percent of those getting standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study, involving 738 U.S. women with tumors and
10 or more positive lymph nodes, high-dose treatment led to a 68
percent chance of being alive without breast cancer after three
years, compared to 64 percent for women who had ``intermediate''
chemo _ higher doses than standard but not so high as to require a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Women with metastatic breast cancer, who have the poorest
long-term outlook, were studied by the Philadelphia Bone Marrow
Transplant Group. A total of 199 women who had responded to initial
treatment with standard chemo were randomly assigned to receive
high-dose therapy and a transplant or conventional ``maintenance''
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The results after three years showed no difference in survival
or the time it took for their disease to begin worsening, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   A small French study found no significant difference in the
survival of women with metastatic breast cancer between the two
treatments, though the high-dose therapy patients had only a 51
percent relapse rate at three years compared to 79 percent in the
standard-dose patients.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth study, carried out among Scandinavian patients found
no overall benefit to high-dose chemotherapy compared with
conventional therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000 women who volunteered for the studies are only a small
fraction of an estimated 12,000 women have undergone the
transplants, choosing the painful and somewhat risky procedure
because they felt it gave them a chance at survival, even though
there was no data to support that belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypothesis going into these trials, our hope, was that the
more aggressive approach would prove clearly superior to standard
therapy,'' said Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer
Institute. ``But based upon these studies, high-dose therapy has
not yet been shown to be superior to lower-dose treatment.'' Even
if it proves equivalent, he said, the high-dose treatment would
have to demonstrate superiority, because it also entails greater
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Then NCI sponsored two of the clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Because the results are so new, they haven't yet been analyzed
thoroughly, and researchers said it's possible that the figures
could yield some circumstances or some women in whom the
transplants might be more beneficial than the average.
</P>
<P>
   The inconclusive findings make it all the more urgent for women
to enter clinical trials in which they would be randomly assigned
to standard treatment or high-dose chemotherapy, said research
officials. Up to now, most women have shunned the trials, out of
fear that they wouldn't be assigned to transplants, which they
believed or hoped would give them a better chance at survival. For
that reason, the trials have been plagued with slow enrollment, and
the results have been long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the data showed that women in both ``arms'' of the
trial _ those that received transplants and those who got only
chemotherapy _ fared significantly better than expected, perhaps
because they got better treatment while in the trials.

 &HT;    A sweet surprise from Altman
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This is good. We have caught Robert Altman,
perhaps the best inconsistent director of our time, on an upswing.
A string of troubled films made by Altman this decade _ ``Ready to
Wear,'' ``Kansas City'' and ``The Gingerbread Man'' _ is yielding
to the critically embraced ``Cookie's Fortune,'' the prickly
director's sweet 'n' sour hymn to Southern family tradition, which
opens today in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, this is good. Known for cantankerous spells and a
congenital aversion to Hollywood protocol, Altman is the last
director you want to press while he's dragging the corpse of a
battered movie through publicity hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Altman on this day is unencumbered by grievances. (On
the state of Hollywood: ``It's really quite dreadful.'') Famously
outspoken and a trifle crunchy around the edges _ at 74, he's
brushing codger status _ Altman doesn't swaddle his opinions in
bubble wrap, doesn't suffer fools, period. The adjectives
``cynical'' and ``misanthropic'' stick to his films as ``nut job''
sticks to Roberto Benigni. He was one of his generation's first
Hollywood mavericks, and may be the last. A dying breed.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, the man is riddled with buttons. Let's press this one, the
red-hot button embossed with ``The Gingerbread Man.'' Altman still
bristles at the mishandling of the 1997 film by distributor
Polygram Pictures. After an ugly battle for final cut (Altman
prevailed), the company, Altman contends, willfully sabotaged the
marketing of the movie, a dark thriller based on a John Grisham
script and starring Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   The experience ``left a terrible taste in my mouth,'' says
Altman, calling from New York. ``The fact is the picture should
have and would have done quite well, and they just buried it. But
those guys have all been fired and that company has been bought by
the one I'm working for now (October Films). They said if 'Cookie's
Fortune' works, they're going to re-release 'Gingerbread Man.' I
would love it if they would, even if in just a small way. It was a
disgrace, a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman's wish may come true. Considering its below-$8 million
budget and the charitable reviews it's received since showing at
the Sundance Film Festival, ``Cookie's Fortune'' should do fine.
Altman's track record in the 1990s, after all, isn't hopeless. He
has made a trio of critically exalted films, including the Vincent
van Gogh biopic ``Vincent &AMP; Theo,'' ``Short Cuts'' and his
Oscar-nominated commercial comeback ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   A departure from cynicism
</P>
<P>
   It won't hurt that ``Cookie,'' an intimate comedy of manners,
marks brighter tonal territory for the director. Written by
one-time Austinite Anne Rapp and set in rural Mississippi, the
big-hearted tale wafts on the lazy, humid rhythms of the Southern
Gothic, complete with dirt roads and dirty little secrets,
dim-wits, sweethearts and eccentrics. Glenn Close, Patricia Neal,
Charles S. Dutton and Liv Tyler star.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, it's a sharp departure from Altman's scabrous
Hollywood satire ``The Player'' and the corrosive human tapestry
``Short Cuts,'' bitter depictions of modern amorality run amok.
``Cookie'' trades in compassion, family, love, loyalty and justice.
It's downright sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out that way and it kind of surprised me, I must
say, that that kind of tone came from it. I'm not used to that,''
Altman says. ``I don't know if 'nice' is the right word. A little
nicer, sweeter or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Altman points to Rapp. ``It's the writer. That's
really her tenderness and voice and style in there. It seems to
change things noticeably.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, a 48-year-old first-time screenwriter who's working on a
second script with Altman, says the sweeter side is simply her
contribution to their symbiotic working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot more cynical than I am and I'm a lot more
sentimental and sappy than he is,'' says Rapp from her Los Angeles
home. ``I think somehow I soften him when he needs to be and he
hardens me when I need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman works closely with his writers. He developed the
``Cookie'' story with Rapp, who then brought in a completed script
with which they continued to tinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's loosely based on a short story I had written,'' Rapp
says. ``We sat around and talked about the story before I wrote the
script and he gave me his ideas and exactly what it should be
about. He's a very strong-willed person but my working experience
with him has been fantastic. His attitude with me from the very
beginning was 'I love the way you write and I don't want to change
the way you write.' I just do it my way but it's his prerogative to
take the script and do whatever he wants to with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman has been known to rewrite scripts and slap his pseudonym,
Al Hayes, on them. Not so with Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but praise for Bob as far as the way he's
handled me as a writer,'' Rapp says. ``He's created an environment
where I have no qualms about going out and hanging off a tree limb,
because that's the only place you find the berries. I know if I go
too far he'll catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   An actor's director
</P>
<P>
   For all its atypical gentility, ``Cookie's Fortune'' still feels
like a Robert Altman film. His metier is depicting epic schmears of
humanity through which characters flitter to the swoony rhythms of
life and speak in riots of overlapping dialogue. ``Cookie's''
all-star cast _ Chris O'Donnell, Julianne Moore, Ned Beatty and
Altman veteran Lyle Lovett are also featured _ is another sprawling
people-scape, though one bound by the script's tight structure.
</P>
<P>
   From his 1970 wartime dramedy ``MASH'' to the quintessential
Altman epic ``Nashville'' (which bustled with 24 central
characters), on down to the dismissable ``Ready to Wear,'' Altman
thrives on huge ensemble casts. He's known as an actor's director,
and stars will kill to work with him. It's this star power that has
allowed him to keep working, despite a spotty track record.
</P>
<P>
   Why do actors scramble to work with Altman?
</P>
<P>
   ``They do because I insist that they become creative and do the
work they want to do,'' he says. ``All of the actors come in and
really do their own thing. They like to do that. They don't want to
come on the set and be told 'Say these words and go home.' Once I
get a film cast, 80 percent of my creative work is finished. The
picture is suddenly in their hands and I'm just sitting there kind
of watching it grow like topseed. I just have to keep it in the
boundaries so it doesn't become something else. What I really want
to see is something I've never seen before, something that's
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as actors flock to his sets, Altman will remain a busy
man. Yet, despite hits like ``The Player'' and his stature as one
of the greatest living directors, mainstream Hollywood is loathe to
finance an Altman project. An artist who insists on doing things
his way, Hollywood long-ago branded him a ``difficult'' director.
</P>
<P>
   So these days he looks to Europe for funding. That's where he's
getting most of the money to make the picture he and Rapp are now
working on, ``Dr. T. and the Women,'' a comedy about a Dallas
gynecologist that satirizes the Dallas country club set. The
collaborators are targeting a fall shoot in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five main markets in Europe and I can usually go in
with a script, a cast and my name,'' says Altman. ``I'm still quite
popular over there. It ain't easy. But I'm tenacious, and that
gives me a terrific edge.''

 &HT;    Quirky characters key ingredients in `Cookie's Fortune'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Surely Robert Altman's most compassionate film
to date, ``Cookie's Fortune'' has the dramatic scale of ``American
Playhouse'' and a heart the size of an antebellum plantation house.
The human comedy, set in quaint Holly Springs, Miss., is sweetly
mellow, with just a jot of that old Altman arsenic to give it fizz.
It's a decided trifle in the director's 30-film oeuvre, but one
whose rewards satisfy in their own modest way.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of the absurd wriggles through one-time Austinite Anne
Rapp's screenplay, a lolling small-town mystery flecked with a
measure of the Southern Gothic that's just short of cloying. We
meet Cookie (Patricia Neal in a rather stagey performance), the
town's oddball matriarch who, as Rapp vividly etches her, puffs a
ridiculous old pipe, yearns vainly for her dead husband, and then,
almost happily, blows her brains out. This kooky Cookie, quite
early on, crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   She's left a crucial scrap behind _ a suicide note that spells
out her final deed. But when her estranged niece, Camille (a funny,
fussy Glenn Close), finds the old woman's corpse, she literally
gobbles the suicide note and burps, ``No one in this family commits
suicide!'' It's a matter of social respectability, you see. She
busily turns the suicide scene into a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayberry-ish local police find they have no choice but to
arrest Cookie's gentle and loyal housemate, Willis (Charles S.
Dutton). It's a difficult seizure for these lawmen, as Willis is a
trusty fishing buddy. The crux of the story hinges on how long the
unstable Camille and her dim sister, Cora (Julianne Moore), can
conceal the truth about Cookie's demise. It's no surprise that
Altman reserves his bile for Glenn's Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Other plotlines swirl about this easy-going tapestry, including
a young-love element between Cookie's favored relative Emma (a fine
Liv Tyler) and a clumsy deputy sheriff (Chris O'Donnell), the
town's Barney Fife. Lyle Lovett gives another dryly vague turn in
an Altman film, this time as a catfish supplier who has an
unarticulated crush on Emma. The movie never follows through on
this storyline, a minor flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Altman likes crowded casts, mini-nation ensembles that can fill
all the rooms of his elaborately baggy stories (see ``Nashville''
and ``Short Cuts''). Though ``Cookie'' is structurally tighter, the
director as usual orchestrates his teeming charges with style,
teasing out subtle and self-possessed performances, save for a rare
lapse into the theatrical. And though screenwriter Rapp draws
Dutton's Willis as a frustratingly passive lunk, the actor brings
to the role a lumbering dignity that bears a saintly glow.
</P>
<P>
   Altman nails a pitch-perfect tone throughout. His Southern tale
is suffused in rambling melancholy and moves to the plaintive plink
of bluesy guitar. (The soundtrack is by former Eurythmic-- David
Stewart and is co-performed by U2's The Edge.)
</P>
<P>
   While ``Cookie's Fortune'' is too light to love, it's been a
spell since Altman has demonstrated this much affection for his
characters. It suits him nicely.

 &HT;    'Life' delivers a harsh sentence to viewers: Boredom
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In ``Life,'' director Ted Demme invents a whole
new genre: the epic prison comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy and Martin
Lawrence, ``Life'' begins during the Depression and ends in the
present day, and nearly all of its action takes place on a
Mississippi prison farm. As an audience, we feel every second creep
by.
</P>
<P>
   I've got to hand it to Eddie Murphy. He's certainly trying to
reinvent his persona, although I'm not sure how successful his last
few efforts have been. Judging from the roles he's played lately,
he appears to be trying to grow as an actor: either physically
larger as in ``The Nutty Professor'' or chronologically older as in
``Life.'' His shtick is as quick and raw as ever, but it languishes
within Demme's schizophrenic story, co-written by Robert Ramsey and
Matthew Stone.
</P>
<P>
   What starts as a typical Murphy buddy comedy gradually turns
into ``The Odd Couple'' in prison. Ray (Murphy) and Claude
(Lawrence) are unceremoniously introduced in the men's room of a
1930s speakeasy. A fast-talking Ray gets them off the hook when
they're threatened by a disgruntled kingpin, but the deal he
brokers throws them together for an extended illegal road trip.
Faster than you can say ``Beverly Hills Cop: The Pension Years,''
Ray and Claude are thrown into a Southern jail. For life.
</P>
<P>
   Demme's soft focus on their volatile friendship would work if
only the tender moments were more subtle. But Demme (Jonathan
Demme's nephew) is intent on making us see how this friendship has
transitioned from a cross-country moonshine run gone bad to a
poignant relationship between two men spending their twilight years
together.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie is a compendium of jokes that exploit the
threat of prison sex (a genre unto itself) with an occasionally
hilarious gag or line thrown in for relief. The most bizarre
element in ``Life'' is a montage sequence using footage that looks
as if it's been lifted from the History Channel. The abrupt shift
in mood is so jarring, it's one of the most unintentionally funny
moments in the film. As black-and-white documentary footage rolls
by, color sequences featuring various inmates are interspersed to
show the passing of time. The camera holds on each inmate for about
five seconds, and then their images fade off-screen, symbolic of
their passing from the lives of Ray and Claude. The montage is so
Forrest Gumpian, it seems outrageously out of touch with the rest
of the movie. Only Wyclef Jean's score makes the sequence remotely
tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   True Murphy fans will no doubt troop out to see ``Life.'' They
may even like him in it. Murphy and Lawrence are well matched;
they're just in the wrong movie.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest waiting until ``Life'' comes out on video. Rent it,
fast forward through the bulk of the movie, then play the end
credits. Demme has included the movie's outtakes, which never fail
to be more fun than the movie they nearly ruined. Look for the
scene in which Lawrence and Murphy ride in a Depression-era
automobile. As they say their lines, a ringing cellular phone
interrupts their exchange. Ever the performer, Murphy answers the
phone and says something to the effect of, ``What?! It's called a
cell phone. Yeah, I'm one of the first to have one!''
</P>
<P>
   If only the rest of ``Life'' had such a pulse.

 &HT;    Motherhood seen from maternal perspectiveBy Alison Macor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If it does nothing else, the latest documentary
from Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker validates one of the most
powerful myths about motherhood: Mothers do have eyes in the back
of their heads.
</P>
<P>
   During the end credits of ``Moms: Mothers Talking About
Motherhood,'' an outtake shows Dusty Rhodes beginning her interview
with the filmmakers. Suddenly she whips around in her seat and
yells at two of her six children who have been lurking in the
shadows outside the room. ``I said out, all right? I'm not gonna
tell you again!'' Then she turns back to the camera, composes
herself and says sweetly, ``Excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a humorous moment that will appeal to mothers, parents and
even children, and it keenly illustrates what Kolker means when he
says, ``We're interested in the human comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moms'' debuts as part of the monthly Texas Documentary Tour.
Audiences will be among the first to see this engaging documentary
before its Mother's Day broadcast on PBS (May 9).
</P>
<P>
   Founders of the Center for New American Media in New York City,
Alvarez and Kolker worked with fellow documentarian and University
of Texas Professor Paul Stekler on the award-winning PBS series
``Vote for Me: Politics in America.'' Alvarez and Kolker will
personally introduce ``Moms'' and answer questions about their
film.
</P>
<P>
   Partners for more than two decades, Alvarez and Kolker have won
numerous awards for documentaries such as ``American Tongues,''
which explores Americans' speaking habits, and ``Louisiana Boys _
Raised on Politics,'' which examines the rich and lively political
history of that state. They met in New Orleans in 1975, and
together they developed and produced programs for community
television. Soon after, Alvarez and Kolker formed their own
production company.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1998, Alvarez and Kolker began preproduction on
``Moms'' by seeking out and interviewing more than 100 mothers,
primarily in New York, Boston and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this enormous vetting process,'' said Kolker, speaking
from his home in New York. ``Louis and I and our associate
producers (Alice Rubin and Sophia Maroon) must have spoken to
hundreds of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they had posted a call for subjects on their Web site
(www.cnam.com), they actually had better luck finding women through
word of mouth. Kolker groaned at the memory of the lengthy and
sometimes labored process. ``Oh, god. It's sort of a combination of
happenstance and people you know knowing other people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted a certain amount of regional diversity,'' he
said. ``Then, within the regional diversity, different kinds of
people, different walks of life and different ethnic groups.'' The
result is a rich mix of perspectives that crosses cultural,
regional and economic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The women were interviewed alone, in pairs or in threes. Their
stories inspire a range of emotions. When they appear on screen,
they are not identified. At first this absence of information is
unsettling: Who are these women?
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree it's a privacy issue,'' explained Kolker (all
of their names appear in the final credits). On another level,
Kolker and Alvarez purposely did not identify the mothers on-screen
to achieve a certain amount of universality among the different
stories. ``There are tremendous commonalties,'' Kolker said. ``It
doesn't really matter who you are or where you come from.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fascinating portraits in ``Moms'' involves
Rhodes, the mother of six with the eyes in the back of her head.
She is a self-proclaimed taskmaster, and she color-codes each of
her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not Josef Stalin,'' Kolker said, laughing as he
described their interviews. ``It really was military. But on the
other hand, she also has a really loving relationship with her
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally entertaining is the way Kolker and Alvarez chose to
shoot their final credits. The mothers of the film's key personnel
appear on camera, announcing their children's roles in the
documentary. It is a potentially saccharine moment made appealing
by the unschooled ``performance'' of each mother.
</P>
<P>
   Kolker and Alvarez knew from the beginning that they were going
to end the film this way. For Kolker's mother, it probably was her
first on-camera appearance. She surprised her son by singing, along
with Alvarez's mom, the children's ditty ``Do You Know the Muffin
Man?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me tell you,'' said Kolker. ``My mother never sang
that song!''
</P>
<P>
   Which just confirmed for Kolker something he suspected all
along: That when women become mothers they also become members of a
secret club where they all know the handshakes, code words and
battle cries.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the documentary, a mother laughs good-naturedly
and asks them, ``Why am I telling you all these things?'' Kolker
thinks their candor is the result of having a lot of experience but
very little opportunity to share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had ever asked them about being a mother. The more we
talked, the more things came out,'' said Kolker. ``They're
tremendously candid, often profane ... almost startlingly open.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the film itself.

ASTRONOMERS CONFIRM EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER SUN, THREE PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers have clearly identified the first true solar system
outside our own with the discovery reported Thursday of a family of
three giant planets circling a nearby star.
</P>
<P>
   Although not seen directly, the three planets revealed details
of their nature _ their masses, their distances from the star, the
shapes of their orbits and the length of their years _ by the pull
they exert on the star, Upsilon Andromedae, a near-twin of the sun,
as they orbit around it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that two different groups of astronomers, working
independently, found exactly the same set of detailed information
about the three planets, from observations made at different times
and using different telescopes, added to their certainty about what
they had found, the astronomers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just cinched the whole thing,'' said astronomer Geoffrey
Marcy of San Francisco State University in an interview. When he
first realized that his group's conclusions matched those of the
other team, with ``independent sets of data, independently deriving
the same three planets ... you can't do any better than that in
science,'' Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   With one such find now clear out of the 107 stars that have been
monitored for up to 11 years by Marcy's group, ``it implies that
planets can form more easily than we ever imagined, and that our
Milky Way is teeming with planetary systems,'' said Debra Fischer,
an astronomer at San Francisco State and member of that team. The
confirmation will also encourage those who hope to find signs of
life elsewhere in the universe. The Milky Way, the galaxy that
holds the sun and Earth, contains about 200 billion stars.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery ``really establishes that these are planetary
systems in the sense we know and love,'' said Robert Noyes, an
astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in
Cambridge, Mass., who led the other team. While more than 18 stars
have been found to have single planets since the first such
discovery in 1995, ``if we find individual ones, there's a nagging
question of `is it really a planet?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some astronomers have said that such large, single
planets _ most of those found so far are larger than Jupiter, the
solar system's biggest _ could have formed by a completely
different process than theorists believe brought about the nine
planets of our own solar system. These unearthly worlds, some
thought, might be more akin to fizzled stars, and thus reveal
nothing about the likelihood that other systems similar to our own
would someday be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof of the pudding is if you find a multiple planet
system,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite decades of intensive searches for planets orbiting other
stars, this is the first such clear-cut discovery, although some
earlier finds came close.
</P>
<P>
   One system of three planets was found in 1992 orbiting a pulsar
_ the dead, burned-out remnant of a star that exploded eons ago.
But theorists aren't even sure if those ``planets'' existed before
the explosion or are just remnants of that cataclysm, so they are
considered irrelevant to understanding the process of planet
formation. And the hellish radiation-soaked environs of the pulsar
preclude any hope of finding life there.
</P>
<P>
   And in January, Hubble telescope pictures showed a ring of dust
around another star, which some astronomers said suggested there
must be two planets keeping the ring in place. But there could be
other explanations for the ring, some astronomers say, and even if
there were two planets there the observations could not reveal
anything about their sizes or orbits.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the new finding provides clear and detailed
evidence of a true planetary family. And, Marcy said, another of
the stars that his group has previously found a planet around also
shows preliminary signs of an additional planet, but because it
appears to be on a much longer orbit _ perhaps 15 to 25 years long
_ it could take several more years to find out for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered planetary family is quite different from
the solar system, which has small, rocky worlds like Earth orbiting
close to the sun, and large gaseous planets like Jupiter farther
out.
</P>
<P>
   Upsilon Andromedae's innermost planet, which had already been
discovered by Marcy and Paul Butler of the Anglo-Australian
Observatory in 1996, is about three-quarters Jupiter's mass, but
orbits the star in just 4.6 days at a distance of less than 6
million miles _ a sixteenth of Earth's distance from the sun, and
far closer than any planet in the solar system. The next planet is
twice Jupiter's mass, and orbits at about the distance of Venus _
the planet next-in from Earth. The outermost planet is about four
times Jupiter's mass, and orbits at a distance between those of
Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   The innermost planet orbits in a circle, but the other two
follow elliptical paths, unlike the sun's planets.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists have come up with a whole panoply of ideas to explain
the recent discoveries of giant planets that were far closer to
their stars than was thought possible. But this new system will
present them with a real challenge. None had predicted the
possibility of multiple Jupiter-class planets in elliptical orbits,
and some astronomers _ including Marcy himself _ had said that one
such planet should make it impossible for any others to form.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has yet determined whether it would be possible for
smaller, Earth-sized worlds to coexist with such giants in lopsided
orbits, or whether they would be expelled from the family by the
bigger planet's gravitational disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But if it turns out to be possible for smaller planets to exist
in such a system, it will be some time before we know about it,
because the method used to find such planets so far relies on
detecting the gravitational tugs of the planet on its star, so only
the biggest ones show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our observations can't rule out Earth-sized planets as well in
this system, because their gravity would be too weak for them to be
detectable with present instruments,'' said Peter Nisenson, an
astronomer on the Harvard-Smithsonian team.
</P>
<P>
   A new space-based telescope array planned by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, called the Space
Interferometry Mission, could make detections of much smaller
planets possible within the next decade.

GRAUDATE STUDENTS TO DISCUSS ORGANIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, graduate students have complained about the long
hours and skimpy pay for teaching assistants, while faculty members
have railed against the erosion of tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In a push to create a national student alliance and develop
stronger ties to labor, hundreds of graduate students and faculty
from around the country will hold weekend conferences starting
Friday at Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and Kent State universities. At
Yale, participants will discuss union organizing with AFL-CIO vice
president Linda Chavez-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching assistants have stepped up union organizing at 16
publicly supported colleges, including the University of Michigan
and the City University of New York. In March, teaching assistants
at the University of California at Los Angeles voted to join a
United Auto Workers local despite opposition from the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Yale, the university recruits a lot of us, gets us to teach
while we are here, and then won't hire us as faculty because there
are no jobs,'' said Anthony Dugdale, a spokesman for the
2,000-member Graduate Students Organization at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 study by Yale graduate students contends that full-time
faculty teach only 30 percent of all classes. Dugdale said the
university has created teaching requirements that ``force us to
teach with very little remuneration and with a $12,500 salary cap
for all teaching assistants. Yet, we do most of the teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, said the study is
``absolutely wrong and designed to confuse the public rather than
enlighten it . . . . The truth is, faculty at Yale not only teach
the courses, but they are the primary instructors in courses that
account for 93 percent of undergraduate enrollments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of two University of Massachusetts faculty
unions have commissioned a study to determine how many tenure track
jobs have been lost over the last decade. Last year, the two UMass
unions asked the administration not to reduce the proportion of
full-time teaching done by tenured track professors. The request
was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of full-time faculty at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst is unequivocally lower than it was 10
years ago,'' said sociology professor Daniel Clawson, chairman of
the Coordinating Committee of Scholars, Artists and Writers for
Social Justice, a sponsor of the event at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Clawson contends the total number of full-time faculty at UMass
Amherst was approximately 1,400 a decade ago, but it has shrunk to
1,200 even though the university has roughly the same number of
students. He said the university is using more lecturers and
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to teach 75 students in my introductory class and I
knew many of them,'' he said. ``I now have 225 students and three
teaching assistants. Instead of having full-time faculty who can
give direct personal contact, the work is most likely to be done by
teaching assistants. Replacing tenured faculty positions (with
graduate students) has become a national trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pearson, associate chancellor of UMass-Amherst, said the
ratio of full-time faculty to graduate teaching assistants has
remained the same. ``There has been a decrease in the number of
faculty, but there also has been a concommitant decrease in the
number of undergraduate students.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said an administration-backed study of graduate teaching
assistants shows that in 1989, 15.3 percent of all instruction of
undergraduates was done by gradaute student assistants. By 1997,
she said, that had dropped to 14.3 percent.

RUSSIANS MARK 50TH BIRTHDAY OF POP QUEEN ALLA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ She is bigger than The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, or
Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, you say: How can anyone be bigger than Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Alla Pugacheva, the reigning queen of Russia's pop music
scene.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to The King, was Elvis's birthday ever
front-page news? Thursday, Russian news media broke from daily
coverage of Kosovo to give top headlines to Pugacheva's 50th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Did Elvis ever bring home the country's highest civilian award?
Thursday, Pugacheva stopped by the Kremlin, where President Boris
N. Yeltsin handed her a medal for ``service to the fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Beatles once won a similar honor in Britain, but where
are they now? Pugacheva has reigned as Russia's top pop diva for
over a quarter century; her last single, ``Take Me Along With
You,'' dominated the local airwaves in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones can match that kind of longevity, but there
are entire age groups of Americans who never liked the Stones. Just
about everyone in Russia has his or her favorite Alla Pugacheva
song.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the showwomanship of a Liza Minnelli, the powerful
voice and staying power of a Cher or Tina Turner, and the
diva-esque demeanor of Elizabeth Taylor, who dropped by for
Pugacheva's birthday, Pugacheva has sold more than 150 million
records in the former Soviet Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future they will ask, `Who was Leonid Brezhnev?' ''
went one irreverent Russian joke back when Brezhnev ruled as the
Soviet Union's supreme leader. ``And the answer will be `A minor
political figure in the Pugacheva era.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, barely hiding his admiration in a brief Kremlin
ceremony that topped the nightly TV news, teased Pugacheva with a
playful update of the joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be remembered as one of the political leaders of the
era of Pugacheva,'' the president said before raising a champagne
toast. Politicians across the spectrum joined in congratulating the
singer.
</P>
<P>
   While her popularity crosses party lines and generation gaps at
home, Pugacheva has not translated well outside the
Russian-speaking world. In a European music competition in Dublin
in 1997, she placed a disappointing 15th. She toured the United
States last year and played for Russian enclave communities.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Russia often have trouble understanding the
Pugacheva phenomenon. Prancing about in short dresses that do not
pretend to hide her none-too-svelte figure, flailing her red locks,
Pugacheva performs in a style known here as ``estrada,'' a Russian
mixture of rock, pop, and torch-song romance that she essentially
invented in the mid-Seventies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the birthday of the mother of Soviet-Russian pop
music,'' screamed one headline.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to paving the way for a generation of pop stars,
Pugacheva has become the matron of her own pop dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Her fourth husband, 31-year-old Filip Kirkorov, is a Russian
megastar in his own right, equal parts Prince, Liberace, and
Engelbert Humperdinck. So is Pugacheva's 27-year-old daughter from
a previous marriage, Kristina Oberkaite. And so is Oberkaite's own
recently estranged husband, Vladimir Presnyakov Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Back when nearly every musician allowed to perform repaid the
Communist Party leadership with patriotic songs about the Soviet
state, Pugacheva stuck to her own program. Never a dissident, her
petulant defiance of Soviet protocol often won her headlines _ and
enemies that would have undone a less popular star.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1981 concert, she embarrassed a group of late-arriving
Communist functionaries by stopping the show while they took their
front-row seats. When a party newspaper denounced her, she tore up
the article during the next night's show.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pugacheva cameos in other people's videos, tools
around Moscow in a white stretch limo, and takes care of business
in a private jet named ``Alla.'' Like Liz, she has a line of
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, Pugacheva is still a maverick.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian stars unabashedly lip-synch their way through
concerts. Not Pugacheva. Russia's aging diva still always sings
live.

MONTENEGRINS SHAKEN BY NATO AIR ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ The loud thump of at least 14 missiles
resounded in the streets of the Montenegrin capital Thursday,
sending locals to windows and bridges for a better view and egging
on thousands who had gathered downtown for an anti-NATO rally.
</P>
<P>
   The whoosh of warplanes at about 7 p.m. made people stop in the
street, looking skyward to watch the first attack in nine days on
the territory of this relatively pro-Western government.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief, anxious delay, the Montenegrins heard the dreaded
result: A series of booms that sounded terrifyingly close, followed
by at least three huge, billowing clouds of black smoke. Police
raced up the steps of the Presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The windows on my building were rattling,'' said a shaken Maja
Donovic, a university student. The sound of the bombings punctuated
the yells and singing of a crowd of several thousand people,
ranging from students to elderly people and mothers with strollers,
who were in the midst of a pro-Yugoslav, anti-NATO demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of frightening the protesters, the air attacks seemed to
strengthen a growing anti-American sentiment here _ a syndrome that
happened in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade after bombing began
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid of anyone _ not even the US, said a
middle-aged man who would only identify himself as Zila. Yugoslav
President ``(Slobodan) Milosevic will overtake Clinton _ 100
percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local media said the bombs fell on five targets, including both
Podgorica airport and the Sipanic military airport, where a total
of eight bombs were dropped. The Sipanic airport is an ethnic
Albanian neighborhood, residents here said. Several nearby hills
were hit, including one near the port of Bar, on the Adriatic
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Local TV also reported that the Yugoslav Army had shot at NATO
planes from Bar Thursday afternoon, leading to speculation that the
bombing was in retribution or meant to hit air-defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was a stunning development for the government of
Montenegro, which has not shared the anti-Western, anti-ethnic
Albanian sentiment of its sister Yugoslav republic, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the bombs fell, a high-level government
adviser, Radomir Sekulovic, told a reporter confidently that there
would be no more bombing against Montenegro. Montenegro, a tiny,
mountainous republic tucked between the battleground states of
Serbia, Kosovo and Albania, has found itself in an unhappy middle
political ground.
</P>
<P>
   The republic has continued a dialogue with the West, and has
strongly denounced the ``ethnic cleansing'' of Kosovo by the Serbs.
It has tried to help Montenegrin men avoid the Yugoslav military
conscription.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of refugees have streamed over the border from
Kosovo to Montenegro, which says it can't afford to take care of
them for long. The price of feeding the refugees and providing them
with medical care and shelter comes to about $50 million a year,
Sekulovic said _ a substantial chunk of Montenegro's $2 billion
yearly budget.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their neighbors the Serbs, Montenegro has been supportive
of both local independent media and foreign media. International
journalists who cross the border into Montenegro from Croatia are
met warmly with a glass of locally distilled cognac and an offer to
call a taxi into town.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin Press Center has interceded to free several
European journalists who were arrested by the Yugoslav army. But
despite the warm embrace of things Western and ethnic Albanian,
``we still get bombed,'' Sekulovic lamented. ``It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Montenegro's relationship with Serbia is getting
worse, edging even toward a civil war, analysts say. ``We are in a
constant state of precaution,'' Sekulovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has sent an estimated 20,000 troops to Montenegro _ a
force loyal to Milosevic, and an overwhelming presence in this
republic of 500,000 people. Montenegro's police force numbers just
8,000-10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has told Belgrade that the junior republic is willing
to allow the Yugoslav Army to protect Yugoslav interests from
Montenegro, but not to wage aggression, Sekulovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montenegrins will not be killed for the purposes of Mr.
Milosevic,'' he said. ``We would prefer civil war in that case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears that public opinion is turning away from the
moderate, conciliatory rhetoric of their president, Milo
Djukanovic. The anti-NATO rallies have been growing in both
frequency and fervor. ``NATO _ thank you. You have made us
united,'' said one poster Thursday. Other posters featured
Milosevic.

JAIR FOCUSING ON PLAYING TWO-WAY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ In his two seasons with CSKA in Bulgaria,
1996 and '97, Jair played forward and his sole objective was
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jair, in his second season with the Revolution, is playing
right midfield, and it's important that the Madison Park High
School product play a two-way game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've improved a lot in my time here,'' said the 5-foot-8-inch,
154-pound Jair, 24. ``When I came here, I wasn't the type of player
who liked to defend a lot, but now I'm willing to defend. I have to
play both and I'm willing to. I really want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked playing for Thomas Rongen, now head coach of D.C.
United. Jair had been working out with the Revolution during his
offseason from CSKA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here on vacation with my family and I wanted to keep in
shape so I called the Revolution to see if I could train with the
team,'' Jair said. ``It wasn't a tryout. I was just trying to keep
in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Jair didn't want to return to his Bulgarian team,
which owed him money. It took nearly three months for FIFA to get
him his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rongen helped me a lot,'' said Jair, who set up the tying goal
against D.C. United Saturday in a 3-2 shootout loss at Foxboro
Stadium. ``He gave me a lot of confidence. He respects my game and
I respect him as a coach. He always told me to improve on my
strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Jair was hit every time he touched the ball against D.C. United,
and ``Thomas Rongen knows the way I play, and that's probably
something that he told his players,'' Jair said. ``He must have
told his players not to give me too much space.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach/goalie Walter Zenga stresses defense to all his
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I have to do and I try to understand,'' said Jair.
``I just want to do better and better every game.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Jair broke his left ankle against the Kansas City
Wizard in early May and was expected to sit out the rest of the
season. He returned in late September, however, and started eight
of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of training and conditioning,'' Jair said. ``I got
back on the field at about 60 percent and I just needed some games
and played some games against second-division teams. That's the
only way I could get in shape. I worked a lot and I have to thank a
lot of people for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jair gets just four tickets each game and, having grown up in
Roxbury, he sometimes has 50 friends and relatives on hand. ``So a
lot of people have to pay to come to the games,'' he said,
chuckling.

 &HT;    Rams acquire Colts' Faulk
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a draft that was to be a call to arms, the
attention turned to legs Thursday. The Indianapolis Colts made one
major trade to overhaul their running game, and the New England
Patriots continued to work on a similar deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis traded star running back Marshall Faulk to St.
Louis for second- and fifth-round selections in this weekend's
draft. The Colts were wary of Faulk's unhappiness with a contract
that has two seasons left.
</P>
<P>
   The swap sets up the Colts to select Heisman Trophy tailback
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Colts officials insisted they are not concerned by reports that
Williams has ballooned back to 248 pounds or that the scale was
rigged at his workout last week. Williams was listed in the Texas
media guide at 225 pounds, played in a bowl game at 237 and checked
in at 244 pounds for the combine workouts two months ago. For his
workout in San Diego on Tuesday, Williams reportedly weighed 224
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Leland Hardy, who represents Williams, denied that his
client is out of shape and that the scale in San Diego registered
an erroneous weight. ``Ricky could play a game today if he had
to,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Faulk led the NFL in total yards from scrimmage in
1998, Colts officials indicated privately they never regarded him
as the kind of back who could take a team deep into the playoffs.
The Rams ranked No. 29 in rushing offense last season and didn't
have a back gain more than 313 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a premier back and didn't have to surrender our No. 1
pick to do it,'' St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil said. ``That's a
pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   New England has two first-round picks and spent the past two
days trying to move up into position to draft a top back. The

first-round pick, this offseason to a potentially career-ending

MICROSOFT TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON COUNTERFEIT SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What looks like Microsoft computer software and runs like
Microsoft software but isn't Microsoft software? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fake Microsoft software _ and the world's largest software maker
is trying to crack down on it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has filed civil lawsuits against four small Kansas
City area computer companies, accusing the businesses of selling
counterfeit copies of Microsoft's most profitable products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits filed in federal court in Kansas City and Kansas
City, Kan., are part of a national push by Microsoft Corp. to stop
the illegal sale of counterfeit software. In recent weeks, the
company has filed dozens of lawsuits across the country against
small computer companies that it alleged sold bootleg software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this area, Microsoft sued Payless Computers Inc., Kansas
City; Elite Technology, Kansas City, Kan.; 101 Computing (also
known as A Plus Computers), Lenexa; and Telectronics Inc., Overland
Park. It accused the companies of selling illegal copies of
Microsoft's Windows 95 and Office Professional 97 software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officers of the companies said they had done nothing wrong and
accused Microsoft of filing lawsuits to generate publicity and
scare the computer resale market. Company officials said they
purchased the software through distributors and have sales receipts
to prove it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the owner of an area company said he was sued after
asking Microsoft for advice on whether two copies of Office
Professional 97 were counterfeit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Nguyen, president of Payless Computers, said he was
bidding on a contract to supply 400 copies of Microsoft Office
Professional to an area company. He said a distributor offered him
the software for $199 a copy _ far below the $500 retail price.
Nguyen offered to sell the 400 copies for $219 each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company buying the software wanted to make sure the
bargain-basement software was the genuine article. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to do the right thing by submitting the
software'' to Microsoft for review, Nguyen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, Nguyen's business was sued after a Microsoft
investigator purchased copies of Windows 95, Office Professional 97
and the Windows NT server operating system at the company's retail
store. Microsoft alleged that all the software was counterfeit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other area company officials made comments similar to those from
Nguyen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the invoice from where I bought them (software) from a
company in Chicago,'' said Sam Dien, Telectronics president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft crackdown was welcomed by Dave Allen, president of
DASH, an Overland Park computer company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been begging them to do it for a long time now,'' Allen
said. ``Microsoft has not been proactive enough in addressing this
problem. The counterfeiters have been doing this for so long, they
figure they can get away with it with impunity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DASH loses about $100,000 a year in ``bottom-line profits'' to
companies selling computer systems that Allen thinks have
counterfeit software, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, one of the easiest ways to become a low
bidder is to use counterfeit software,'' he said. ``For a $13
million company like us, you could make a case that $100,000 is the
lion's share of our profit down the drain.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeiting Microsoft software has become an art form. That
makes determining which software is real, and which isn't,
difficult for consumers and retailers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Microsoft added copyright safeguards to make
counterfeits easier to spot. Microsoft added holographic images to
CD-ROMs and special ink, printing and metallic holographic threads
to certificates of authenticity supplied with software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped bootleggers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although copyright safeguards are becoming more sophisticated,
bootlegging has never been easier. CD recordable drives that allow
consumers to make copies of software on CD-ROMs cost less than
$300. Sophisticated desktop publishing programs and document
scanners make duplicating manuals and other documentation easier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the real counterfeiting is done by larger organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The counterfeiters are pretty much like organized crime,''
said Cori Hartje, a Microsoft licensing specialist in St. Louis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some efforts are more organized than others. Last year, armed
raiders in masks and black fatigues stormed a Microsoft plant in
Ireland and stole 100,000 certificates of authenticity for the
company's software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft isn't trying only to protect its own intellectual
property and profits, said Nick Psyhogeos, a corporate lawyer for
the company. He said the company also is trying to protect
consumers from bootlegged software that could contain viruses or
other problems that could damage a computer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to send the message even further, Microsoft commissioned
a study by a research firm to show the economic impact of
counterfeit software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company said that counterfeiting costs Americans 130,000
jobs, and costs software companies $3 billion nationwide. The study
by International Planning and Research Corp. said counterfeiting
costs Missouri $200 million in lost sales and $6 million in taxes.
In Kansas, the figure is $90 million in sales and $4 million in
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeit software seems to be flourishing on the online
auction sites. Microsoft employees work with the auction sites
daily to have such ads removed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon on eBay, the Internet's largest auction
site, about 200 copies of Office Professional were being bid on,
often with prices under $30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Retailers say that Microsoft created some of the problem
itself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While large retailers often sell full _ not upgrade _ versions
of Windows 98 for more than $200, large computer manufacturers may
pay much less for the same software. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, some companies with overstock sell the software on
what has become something of a software gray market. Prices for
legitimate copies of Windows 98 often are $90 or less at stores
that buy through the gray market. &QL;

MORE TAX FILERS, UNDERSTAFFED REVENUE DEPARTMENT MEANS LONGER WAIT
FOR REFUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's at least one downside to Kansas' booming economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With more people employed, the state Department of Revenue
expects to receive more than 200,000 additional individual income
tax returns this year than last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But with a tight labor market in Topeka, the department hasn't
been able to hire as many workers as it needs to quickly process
the returns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That means taxpayers will wait longer for refund checks than in
past years. (But don't wait to file; the deadline still is
midnight.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those filing returns on paper, the state is projecting a
refund wait of six to eight weeks. Last year, the wait was four to
six weeks. For returns filed electronically, either by computer or
telephone, the refund wait is projected at 10 to 14 days. Last
year, the wait was eight to 10 days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state is encouraging anyone who can file electronically to
do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The revenue department is 40 people short of the number of
seasonal data-entry workers it hoped to hire. The jobs pay $5.96 an
hour to start. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not able to pay more than this, so we're competing with
the private sector for the same type of workers who can get paid $9
and more an hour for work in the private sector,'' said department
spokeswoman Angela Goering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the increase in returns, Goering said, could be
attributable to the department's efforts to improve customer
service. The department has tried to make tax forms easier to
understand and has added staffing in taxpayer assistance centers in
Overland Park, Topeka and Wichita, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the state had received about 910,000 of the 1.5
million individual income tax returns it estimates it will receive
this year. Last year, the state received 1.27 million returns. A
large number of taxpayers traditionally file on or near deadline
day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state is estimating it will receive $1.9 billion in income
tax revenue, up from $1.74 billion last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, changes in the way state returns are processed have
speeded refunds, said Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Missouri
Department of Revenue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state has processed 1.33 million returns so far this year,
compared with 1.27 million at the same time last year, Miller
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said it was unclear whether there has been a sizable gain in
the number of tax filers this year, or whether taxpayers simply
filed returns earlier. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa and Nebraska, the numbers of returns filed so far also
are up somewhat. Nebraska has received 806,792 so far, compared
with 793,771 at the same time last year. Through April 9, Iowa had
received 920,000, compared with 881,000 at the same time last
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal tax returns from Kansas are processed at the Internal
Revenue service center in Austin, Texas, and Missouri returns are
processed in Kansas City. For those filing paper returns on or near
the deadline, refunds should arrive in five to seven weeks, said
Rollie Woods, senior communications specialist with the
Kansas-Missouri district of the Internal Revenue Service in St.
Louis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those filing electronically, refunds could come in as few as
10 days with direct deposit, or three weeks for a paper check. &QL;

WAGONEERS HEAD WEST IN SEARCH OF THE GOLD RUSH EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prospectors who pushed west in California's Gold Rush 150 years
ago had a knack for adventure, enough cash to last six months and
the American dream of easy money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People riding with the Official Gold Rush Wagon Train, which
rolls through Kansas City this weekend, want to recapture the
experience. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day pioneer Morris Carter and a crew of nine set out this
month from St. Charles, Mo., on a 2,500-mile, five-month journey
along the California Trail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite modern amenities such as the car seat that carries
Carter's 22-month-old grandson, the coolers of food in the back of
Carter's wagon and the truck-drawn trailers that on any given day
provide respite for livestock, this is not an easy life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a new perspective on history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have certain amenities along the way...but you
get to a point where your mind isn't seeing railroad tracks and
telephone poles,'' Carter said. ``Your mind rolls back in time, and
you are actually in an entirely different world.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who provides historic expeditions from his home base in
Wyoming, led a similar trek in 1993 to celebrate the 150th
anniversary of the Oregon Trail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crew members left behind jobs and businesses to earn their keep
on Carter's wagon train: cooking meals; caring for the 10 teams of
mules and horses; driving one of six prairie schooners. They share
a desire to test themselves, to see whether they could have been
forty-niners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each wagon is an authentic reproduction, Carter said. A wooden
bench in front _ no cushions _ seats three adults. Overhead, the
tan wagon cover stretches across wooden bows. Riders speak over the
clippety-clop of horses' hooves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some days the train travels 12 or 14 hours, creeping at 4 mph.
The crew sleeps in or under the wagons. Members cook and eat
outside, even when it rains. And forget bathroom breaks; the train
makes only planned stops, to water the horses, eat lunch or set up
camp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trip is financed by donations from some states and cities
the wagon train visits and by ride-along fees for people who join
for a day or more, Carter said. He puts the final cost at
$200,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In some respects the wagon train's path differs from established
history, said John Mark Lambertson, director of the National
Frontier Trails Center in Independence. Most forty-niners took
steamboats on the Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri rivers, buying
wagons and supplies in Independence and Westport before taking off
for California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest travel was not over land, but by water,''
Lambertson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he had read trail diaries that established St. Louis
and St. Charles as the genesis of westward travel. In any case, he
said, the trip does not focus on the Gold Rush alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our story is not just about the forty-niners,'' he said.
``It's about the journey and all of the people that went.'' &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wagon train is scheduled to arrive this afternoon at the
National Frontier Trails Center, 318 W. Pacific, Independence. The
center plans to stay open until 8 p.m. for visitors who want to
talk to Morris Carter and his crew. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the train will stop at noon for lunch at the
Rice-Tremonti Home, 8801 E. 66th St. in Raytown, before continuing
to Santa Fe Elementary School, 8908 Old Santa Fe Road, where a 2:30
p.m. visit is scheduled. The group will camp Friday and Saturday
nights at Schumacher Park, 91st and Old Santa Fe Road in Kansas
City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bannister Mall will hold a breakfast for the wagon train at 8:30
a.m. Saturday in the food court. The event will be open to 50
visitors, who must make reservations by calling Lou Austin at
765-3900. The wagon train will also stop around noon at the
McDonald's near the mall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wagon train will camp Sunday night at Heritage Park, 168th
Street and Pflumm Road in Olathe. &QL;
</P>

along for a day. A $25 fee pays for one day's ride, including
lunch. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Major studies reported Thursday show that bone-marrow
transplantation, a grueling procedure held out as a hope to many
women with advanced breast cancer, does not prolong their survival
over all. But the medical group that announced the findings
cautioned that it was still too soon to pass final judgment on the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients and doctors had hoped the studies would finally
determine whether it was worthwhile for women to undergo the
drastic and costly treatment, which involves extremely high doses
of chemotherapy. But the findings reported Thursday may instead
fuel the longstanding disagreement between the procedure's
advocates and its detractors, and do little to help women decide
whether to undertake the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   News of the research was made public in summaries of five
studies, posted on the Internet yesterday by the American Society
of Clinical Oncology, at www.asco.com. The studies, two from the
United States and three from overseas, involved more than 2,000
patients treated at many different medical centers. The summaries
of the research were part of an Internet posting of a program for
the society's meeting next month. Researchers said they were being
released before the meeting because of intense interest in the
studies.
</P>
<P>
   They will be reported in full and debated at the meeting and
until then, researchers cautioned, the findings should be
considered preliminary. They said numbers might change as data are
analyzed more fully, and the findings might be challenged by other
scientists once they see all the data.
</P>
<P>
   The studies included breast cancer patients who had a poor
prognosis because cancer had invaded 10 or more lymph nodes in the
underarm, or had spread even farther to organs or bones, a
condition known as metastatic disease.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the studies found no difference in survival between
patients who had high-dose chemotherapy with transplants, and those
who had lower doses of chemotherapy. A fifth study, from South
Africa, did find a benefit in patients with positive lymph nodes,
suggesting that the treatment might help some women. But the
oncology group issued a statement saying, ``it is not yet possible
to draw definitive conclusions about the role of high-dose
chemotherapy in breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen Lichter, president of the oncology society, said in a
telephone interview that the lack of conclusive findings thus far
suggests that if the procedure does eventually turn out to have a
benefit, it will be small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you see a positive study is encouraging,''
Lichter said. ``The fact that you see negative ones in the same
population says to me that the true difference is not going to be
enormous, or everybody would see it. This is not like penicillin
and pneumonia, where you can't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute,
agreed that the studies so far had not shown that that high-dose
therapy is better than standard treatment. But he and other
researchers noted that some of the findings might change as the
patients are studied longer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome Groopman, a cancer specialist at the Harvard Medical
School, said that despite the lack of benefit shown by most of the
studies, ``My own prejudice is that there will be a small subset of
patients who will benefit, with either a long-term remission with
good quality of life or maybe even a cure.'' But, he added, if such
patients exist, doctors do not know how to identify them ahead of
time and spare others the rigors of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The studies represent an effort to make sense of a procedure
that came into widespread practice without proof that it would
actually help breast cancer patients. The idea behind the treatment
is to try to wipe out the cancer by giving patients extremely high
doses of chemotherapy. But those drugs also poison the bone marrow,
which is home to the stem cells that produce the cells of the blood
and immune system. After high dose chemotherapy, a patient will die
unless the bone marrow is restored by transplants of bone marrow or
stem cells harvested from a donor or from the patient herself
before treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Doctors began offering bone marrow transplants as a last resort
to women with advanced breast cancer during the 1980s, after they
saw how well the treatment worked in people with leukemia and other
cancers affecting the blood and bone marrow. Early studies in
breast cancer looked promising, but lacked comparison groups, but
because they did not include comparison groups it was impossible to
say how the treatment compared to more conventional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, demand for the procedure grew, and many women
refused to enter comparison studies because they wanted
transplants. That reluctance, combined with insurance companies'
refusal to cover the treatment in studies (though they eventually
began paying for it otherwise) made it hard to enroll patients in
studies and delayed the work by several years, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' groups differed sharply in their reaction to the
studies released Thursday. The National Breast Cancer Coalition, in
Washington, urged researchers to shift their emphasis away from
transplants towards finding new treatments. In a telephone
interview, Fran Visco, president of the coalition, also criticized
the oncology group for not taking a stand against the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and very disappointed by ASCO's statement,''
Ms. Visco said. ``We don't need to add to the confusion. We
certainly don't need to encourage women to have unproven treatments
like this outside of clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   But another organization, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation, in Dallas, said, ``the results of these studies in no
way suggest that this matter is settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that the most definitive study was one
conducted in the United States involving 553 women with metastatic
disease. After three years, regardless of whether they had bone
marrow transplants or conventional chemotherapy, survival rates
were comparable, between 30 and 40 percent. In both groups, the
women also relapsed at about the same point, a median of nine
months after being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a clear benefit to transplant,'' said Dr. Edward
Stadtmauer, director of bone-marrow transplantation at the
University of Pennsylvania cancer center in Philadelphia, who
directed the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Stadtmauer and Lichter, the president of ASCO and radiation
oncologist at the University of Michigan, both said that the
procedure should be studied, in combination with other treatments,
in women with metastatic disease. Lichter said scientists were
``not even close'' to halting studies of the procedure in those
women.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller study of metastatic disease, in 61 women in France,
also showed no difference in survival. However, patients who
received transplants took longer to relapse, which meant that their
quality of life was better because they had more time free of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In women who did not have metastatic disease, but who had 10 or
more positive lymph nodes, the findings were less clear.
</P>
<P>
   An American study of 874 women has shown no difference in
survival between those who got transplants and those who received
doses of chemotherapy that were higher than normal but not high
enough to require a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, director of the Lauder Breast Center at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and an author
of the study, said, ``The ultimate survival was equal. There were
fewer deaths in the transplant group, but more deaths from the
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two results balanced each other, Norton said, resulting in
equal survival rates. But he cautioned that the study is still
going on, and that the patients should be followed for three more
years to determine whether whether transplant has any advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might turn out in the long run, another two or three years,
that transplant is a little better,'' Norton said. ``My guess is
that the difference will be in the 5 percent range. But we can't
draw conclusions yet. The data are being released now because the
public has a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study in the same type of patient, conducted in 525
women in Scandinavia, also showed no benefit from transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But a South African study of 154 women did show a benefit. Women
who got transplants lived longer and had fewer relapses than those
who did not: after more than five years of follow up, 17 percent
who received transplants had died, as compared to 35 percent in the
other group.
</P>
<P>
   Because the drugs and transplant methods used in the study
differed from those used in the United States, researchers said it
was unclear what relevance the findings had to American patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have circulated for weeks that the studies would be
negative, and that insurance companies would refuse to cover the
procedure, which costs $60,000 Thursday, down from $140,000 in
1990. But the oncology group said that insurers should not change
their policies based on the studies, and also urged them cover the
procedure when it is done as part of a research study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40,000 women a year who are dying of breast cancer,
and we must continue to try to help them,'' Stadtmauer said.

MARROW TRANSPLANTS LITTLE HELP IN BREAST CANCER, STUDIES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Initial reports from clinical trials of bone marrow transplants
for advanced breast cancer offer little evidence that they extend
life, but researchers say the findings reflect an inconclusive
``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitive answers may take at least three more years, the
researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging finding was that the gruelling and costly
therapy may give some women extra months or years before the
disease returns, even if there's no proof that they survive longer
than women on standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And, the scientists said, it is possible that this delay in
relapse of the cancer may, when the patients have been studied for
a longer period, translate into added life for some patients Even
if the transplants weren't shown to be very effective, at least so
far, cancer specialists said the findings would remove the pressure
some women now feel to undergo the rigorous treatment because they
really have no other choice, and would encourage franker
discussions between patients and doctors with more data on the
table.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which included over 2,000 women in the United
States, Scandinavia and South Africa, were released by the American
Society for Clinical Oncology, an organization of cancer physicians
and researchers. The reports will be officially presented at ASCO's
annual meeting in Atlanta next month, but ASCO posted them on the
World Wide Web (www.asco.org) Thursday because so much interest has
been focused on the controversial treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the results showed that standard therapy and
high-dose, bone-marrow-transplant therapy yield comparable outcomes
in advanced cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five studies whose preliminary findings were released
Thursday did, however, show a survival benefit for women getting
the transplants, but the trial involved a relatively small number
of patients. They were women being treated for primary tumors and
10 or more cancer-containing lymph nodes. Carried out at the
University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, it showed that only 17
percent of women on the high-dose chemotherapy had died after five
years, compared with 35 percent of those getting standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study, involving 738 U.S. women with tumors and
10 or more positive lymph nodes, high-dose treatment led to a 68
percent chance of being alive without breast cancer after three
years, compared to 64 percent for women who had ``intermediate''
chemo _ higher doses than standard but not so high as to require a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Women with metastatic breast cancer, who have the poorest
long-term outlook, were studied by the Philadelphia Bone Marrow
Transplant Group. A total of 199 women who had responded to initial
treatment with standard chemo were randomly assigned to receive
high-dose therapy and a transplant or conventional ``maintenance''
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The results after three years showed no difference in survival
or the time it took for their disease to begin worsening, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   A small French study found no significant difference in the
survival of women with metastatic breast cancer between the two
treatments, though the high-dose therapy patients had only a 51
percent relapse rate at three years compared to 79 percent in the
standard-dose patients.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth study, carried out among Scandinavian patients found
no overall benefit to high-dose chemotherapy compared with
conventional therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000 women who volunteered for the studies are only a small
fraction of an estimated 12,000 women have undergone the
transplants, choosing the painful and somewhat risky procedure
because they felt it gave them a chance at survival, even though
there was no data to support that belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypothesis going into these trials, our hope, was that the
more aggressive approach would prove clearly superior to standard
therapy,'' said Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer
Institute. ``But based upon these studies, high-dose therapy has
not yet been shown to be superior to lower-dose treatment.'' Even
if it proves equivalent, he said, the high-dose treatment would
have to demonstrate superiority, because it also entails greater
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Then NCI sponsored two of the clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Because the results are so new, they haven't yet been analyzed
thoroughly, and researchers said it's possible that the figures
could yield some circumstances or some women in whom the
transplants might be more beneficial than the average.
</P>
<P>
   The inconclusive findings make it all the more urgent for women
to enter clinical trials in which they would be randomly assigned
to standard treatment or high-dose chemotherapy, said research
officials. Up to now, most women have shunned the trials, out of
fear that they wouldn't be assigned to transplants, which they
believed or hoped would give them a better chance at survival. For
that reason, the trials have been plagued with slow enrollment, and
the results have been long in coming.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the data showed that women in both ``arms'' of the
trial _ those that received transplants and those who got only
chemotherapy _ fared significantly better than expected, perhaps
because they got better treatment while in the trials.

SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN EMERGING FINANCIAL MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were several new signs of healing Thursday in emerging
financial markets as the Korean Development Bank sold $1 billion of
bonds and Brazil indicated that it would soon be ready to return to
the capital markets to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Brazilians can consider asking foreign
investors to come back just three months after they suddenly
devalued their currency is a testament to the fact that hard-hit
financial markets can turn around quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While the Brazilians have not announced a specific bond issue,
they are expected to come to the market in the next several weeks.
Thursday, the government filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for permission to sell $3.75 billion in
dollar-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citigroup
and a leader in the debt reduction negotiations of the late 1980s,
said that he expected Brazil to sell bonds by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Development Bank's five-year notes were the first
sold by the state-owned bank since the end of 1997. They were also
the first issue to win back an investment-grade credit rating from
Standard &AMP; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service since the global
financial crisis spread to Korea at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters said the issue, rated at the bottom of the
investment-grade category, was in hot demand, with about 70 percent
of the global deal being bought by U.S. investors. The five-year
notes were priced to yield 7.302 percent, 225 basis points above
the yield on the five-year Treasury note. A basis point is one
hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Luddington, the global head of emerging-market
syndication at JP Morgan Securities, the lead underwriter with
Chase Securities, said the demand reflected the fact that some
Asian economies ``have made a pretty quick recovery.'' The South
Korean stock market is a top performer this year, he said, interest
rates are coming down and foreign investors are going back to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the success of the Korean deal, investors are
going back to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of the success of the Korean deal, Colombia jumped
in to sell $500 million of 10-year notes. They were priced to yield
10.121 percent, 495 basis points over the comparable Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In the Treasury market, prices were pushed lower as investors
sold to make room for heavy corporate issues, including a $4
billion deal from Conoco, the fifth-largest oil company that is
being spun off by the DuPont Co. The $4 billion is to be paid to
DuPont as part of the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond fell 8/32, to 96 2/32, while the
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.52 percent
from 5.50 percent on Wednesday. Traders said the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank's report that its regional manufacturing index
rose sharply in April also weighed on investors, who worry that the
Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates if the economy
does not slow down soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Conoco deal, which was led by Salomon Smith Barney and
Credit Suisse First Boston, was another indication that the rise in
oil prices this year has piqued new investor interest in the oil
sector. ``This is clearly a validation that the energy sector has
stabilized,'' Geoffrey Coley, the co-head of global capital markets
at Salomon, said. In addition, the yields on oil companies' bond
issues are still higher than on other comparably rated industrial
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Coley said there were $15 billion in total bids for the Conoco
issues, which included $1.35 billion in five-year notes, $750
million in 10-year notes and $1.9 billion in 30-year bonds. The
five-year notes were priced to yield 5.934 percent, 88 basis points
above five-year Treasuries; the 10-year notes at 6.35 percent, 120
basis points above 10-year Treasuries, and the 30-year bond at 6.95
percent, 134 basis points above 30-year Treasuries. &QL;

ANTHONY NEWLEY, FILM AND STAGE SHOWMAN, DIES AT 67  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Great Britain )  By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Newley, the versatile British entertainer who achieved
international stardom in 1961 with the musical ``Stop the World _ I
Want to Get Off,'' died on Wednesday at his home in Jensen Beach,
Fla. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his former wife, Dareth Newley Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   A latter-day British Al Jolson, Newley was one of the last major
entertainers to embody an extravagant heart-on-the-sleeve kind of
showmanship associated with British music hall performance. ``Stop
the World,'' for which he was the director, star and co-author
(with his longtime collaborator, Leslie Bricusse), was his greatest
showcase. After opening on Broadway in 1962, it ran for 555
performances.
</P>
<P>
   An allegory about acquiring fame and power but ending up
disillusioned, ``Stop the World'' was a tour de force for the star,
who portrayed a symbolic Everyman named Littlechap. The score gave
Newley two of his signature songs, the ballads ``What Kind of Fool
Am I? (a hit for Sammy Davis Jr.) and ``Once in a Lifetime.'' With
his sobbing bray of a voice and mimelike body language that some
compared to Marcel Marceau (although Newley never studied mime), he
embodied the tragic clown whose heart is broken when his dreams
turn to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after ``Stop the World'' opened in New York, Newley
returned to Broadway with the ``The Roar of the Greasepaint _ the
Smell of the Crowd,'' a similar, more grandiose allegory (again
written with Bricusse), which he also directed and starred in. The
show yielded another popular standard with the pleading ballad
``Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)'' (addressed to God in
the show), which became a hit for Tony Bennett and later for Dionne
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   With Bricusse, Newley also collaborated on the score for the
1971 movie ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,'' an ingenious
children's fantasy written by Roald Dahl and starring Gene Wilder,
that earned comparisons to ``The Wizard of Oz.'' From the score of
that movie came ``The Candy Man,'' Sammy Davis Jr.'s last and
biggest hit.
</P>
<P>
   Newley's other major hit song was the theme from the 1964 James
Bond movie, ``Goldfinger'' (popularized by Shirley Bassey), which
he wrote with Bricusse and the film's soundtrack composer, John
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 24, 1931, in Hackney, a working-class section of
London, the young Newley was evacuated to the British countryside
during the German bombing of London. For a time, he stayed with
George Pescud, a retired music hall performer whom he later
credited with inspiring his freedom of self-expression. After the
war, he studied acting and was discovered by Geoffrey de Barkus, a
British film director, who cast him in the title role of his movie,
``The Adventures of Dusty Baker.''
</P>
<P>
   He made several more adventure films, but it was his portrayal
of the Artful Dodger in David Lean's adaptation of ``Oliver Twist''
(1948) that brought him his first popular recognition. A series of
undistinguished films followed.
</P>
<P>
   While he was making movies, Newley became increasingly involved
with the theater. He appeared in a hit London revue, ``Cranks,''
which flopped when it came to New York. In 1959, he made his film
singing debut in ``Idols on Parade,'' playing a conscripted
rock-and-roll singer. He went on to record a string of minor
rock-and-roll hits that would exert a strong influence on David
Bowie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he teamed with Bricusse to write songs for a show the
pair described as ``a simple, lighthearted satirical life cycle of
the seven ages of man.'' The project, which evolved into ``Stop the
World,'' opened in London that July and was a huge hit despite
mixed reviews. When it opened in New York, critical response was
again mixed, but the show became a popular hit. ``The Roar of the
Greasepaint'' was not as successful, running 232 performances. When
it closed, Newley declared he was finished writing for the theater
and would concentrate on film.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was a co-star with Rex Harrison in the screen
musical ``Doctor Dolittle'' (with a score by Bricusse), an
expensive failure that nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox. Two
years later, his original screen musical, ``Can Hieronymus Merkin
Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness?,'' which he
wrote, directed, produced and starred in (opposite Joan Collins,
who was then his wife), was a legendary failure.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the United States in the 1970s, Newley spent the next
two decades working in nightclubs and appearing in occasional films
and on television. In 1983, he returned to the theater with his
original musical, ``Chaplin,'' a biography of the silent clown and
director that opened in Los Angeles to scathing reviews. A planned
Broadway opening was canceled after the production lost $4 million
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Newley's three marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his
mother and four children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he made a rare nightclub appearance in New York at
Rainbow and Stars, where the emotive force of his singing was
undiminished. Summing up the previous two decades, he remarked from
the stage, ``I went to Vegas for 22 years, married some absolutely
charming women and gave them all my money. That's why I'm here.''

PAKISTAN SENTENCES BHUTOTO FIVE YEARS FOR CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A Pakistani court Thursday convicted Benazir
Bhutto, who was twice removed as prime minister on corruption
charges, of having taken kickbacks while she was in office in the
mid-1990s. She was sentenced to five years in prison and barred
from holding political office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Bhutto, a Harvard-educated heir to one of Asia's
political dynasties, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, were found
guilty of accepting kickbacks from a Swiss goods inspection company
that was hired during her second stint as prime minister to combat
corruption in the collection of customs duties, Pakistan's largest
source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The court also sentenced Zardari, who is already jailed awaiting
trial on separate charges, to five years imprisonment, and fined
him and Ms. Bhutto $8.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's Accountability Bureau, which investigated the case,
reacted triumphantly. ``Benazir Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali
Zardari, have finally been proved world-class thieves,'' the bureau
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bhutto, who was in London Thursday, denied all the
charges and denounced the verdict as a politically motivated
attempt by her archrival, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to destroy
her. She said she would return to Pakistan next week to appeal the
case to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran the government to the best of my honest ability,'' Ms.
Bhutto told the BBC. ``And I did it for nothing but acknowledgment
and love.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Lahore High Court judges who convicted her in Rawalpindi
were serving on a special bench established to try corruption cases
quickly under the so-called Accountability Act that Sharif proposed
and Parliament adopted in 1997. Sharif subsequently appointed Sen.
Saif-ur-Rehman to head the anti-corruption Accountability Bureau,
which investigated the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, an industrialist who has alternated stints as prime
minister with Ms. Bhutto over the last decade, has himself faced
corruption charges, including allegations that he took millions of
dollars in unsecured loans from state-owned banks for his family's
steel concerns, and then defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ms. Bhutto's husband, Zardari, became popularly
known in Pakistan as ``Mr. 10 Percent'' for his role as an
intermediary in government deals. He amassed great wealth while his
wife was prime minister, buying lavish jewelry and a 355-acre
estate in Britain with what prosecutors say was his and his wife's
ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   He has been imprisoned since 1996 on charges of conspiring to
murder Ms. Bhutto's estranged brother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bhutto and Zardari were indicted six months ago on the
charges of accepting kickbacks from the Swiss company, Societe
Generale de Surveillance. The evidence used against them was
gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Ehtesab, or
Accountability Bureau. By Pakistani standards, their trial and
conviction took place with remarkable speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scheme of things contrived by the corrupt couple was so
systematic and highly intriguing that it made the job of the
Ehtesab Bureau very difficult,'' the bureau said in its statement.
``The couple set up a number of offshore companies. They put up
front men. The amount of commissions and kickbacks was channeled
through the offshore companies to the Swiss accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The government ostensibly hired the Swiss company to clean up
corruption in the collection of duties on imported goods. Since
only about 1 percent of Pakistanis are estimated to pay income
taxes, customs revenues are essential to running the government.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors contended that the company had won the contract
by promising to pay Zardari 6 percent of the fees it received as a
``commission.'' The kickbacks were then paid to Bomer Finance, an
offshore company that was owned by Zardari, and then deposited into
a Swiss account, prosecutors said. In August 1997, they said, a
diamond necklace was purchased from a London jeweler for $188,000
with a check drawn on the Swiss account and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the prosecutors argued, the Swiss company paid
Zardari $4.3 million under this arrangement.

 &HT;    OLD FRIENDS, PRIEST AND ATHEIST, DEBATE GOD BEFORE SCIENTISTS
 &HT;    Moving in (a) general news and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    With photo (s)
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In 1975, Steven Weinberg, then a professor of
physics at Harvard University, was at the home of fellow particle
physicist in London when he received shocking news.
</P>
<P>
   The English physicist, John Polkinghorne, announced that he was
leaving science to become an Anglican priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly fell off my chair,'' Weinberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg went on to win the Nobel Prize and to become a
professor of physics at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne became a priest and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met again Thursday at an American Association for
the Advancement of Science symposium about physics and religion and
debated whether the universe was designed by a creator for a
purpose or just happened.
</P>
<P>
   As they traded biting observations about their opposing beliefs,
they drew repeated laughter and applause among 325 scientists and
religious scholars from around the country who are attending the
three-day symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said he had become an atheist as a youngster because
the more he thought about religion, ``it just seemed increasingly
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said science describes the earth and the universe without
relying on miracles and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seek departures from this natural order,'' he said.
``We don't seek exceptions, miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was ``not impressed'' by recent talk that the
universe is too ``finely tuned'' to have just happened.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he attacked religion for not merely allowing, but
causing evil in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hebrew Bible presents us with a God who demands that we
sacrifice our children,'' he said. ``The Christian and Islamic God
is willing to send us to Hell if we don't worship him in just the
right way. My perception is that God, if he exists, is not
benevolent, but is selfish and cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that without religion there would still be evil people
doing evil things in the world and good people doing good things,
``but to have good people do evil things -- that takes religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne said he thought the ``most significant event known
to us since the Big Bang'' was the dawning of self awareness in
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In us, the universe became aware of itself,'' he said. ``We
are creatures, created in the image of the creator.''
</P>
<P>
   He said science could not explain morality or human love of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many windows onto reality. Science is not the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that religion can cause good people to do evil
things but added that ``it can cause bad people to do good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said he was in favor of a dialogue between science and
religion, ``I just don't want it to be a constructive dialogue.''
(CQ)
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought science has been making religion increasingly
unimportant to people and hopes it will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact, there is out there behind the structure of the
universe an objective meaning and an objective moral order, that
would be wonderful,'' Weinberg said, ``but if it isn't true, I
don't think we should kid ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne said many scientists are ''wary of religion because
they think it necessarily requires you to get up in the morning and
brush your teeth and believe six impossible things before
breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to commit intellectual suicide to be a
religious believer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, the two shook hands and parted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will I see you again?'' Weinberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you'll have to come to England,'' Polkinghorne replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do, what will you be this time? A movie star?'' Weinberg
asked.
</P>
<P>
   They both laughed and walked away, in opposite directions.

 &HT;    OLD FRIENDS, PRIEST AND ATHEIST, DEBATE GOD BEFORE SCIENTISTS
 &HT;    Moving in (a) general news and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    With photo (s)
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In 1975, Steven Weinberg, then a professor of
physics at Harvard University, was at the home of fellow particle
physicist in London when he received shocking news.
</P>
<P>
   The English physicist, John Polkinghorne, announced that he was
leaving science to become an Anglican priest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly fell off my chair,'' Weinberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg went on to win the Nobel Prize and to become a
professor of physics at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne became a priest and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth
II two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met again Thursday at an American Association for
the Advancement of Science symposium about physics and religion and
debated whether the universe was designed by a creator for a
purpose or just happened.
</P>
<P>
   As they traded biting observations about their opposing beliefs,
they drew repeated laughter and applause among 325 scientists and
religious scholars from around the country who are attending the
three-day symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said he had become an atheist as a youngster because
the more he thought about religion, ``it just seemed increasingly
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   He said science describes the earth and the universe without
relying on miracles and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't seek departures from this natural order,'' he said.
``We don't seek exceptions, miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was ``not impressed'' by recent talk that the
universe is too ``finely tuned'' to have just happened.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he attacked religion for not merely allowing, but
causing evil in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hebrew Bible presents us with a God who demands that we
sacrifice our children,'' he said. ``The Christian and Islamic God
is willing to send us to Hell if we don't worship him in just the
right way. My perception is that God, if he exists, is not
benevolent, but is selfish and cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that without religion there would still be evil people
doing evil things in the world and good people doing good things,
``but to have good people do evil things -- that takes religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne said he thought the ``most significant event known
to us since the Big Bang'' was the dawning of self awareness in
human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In us, the universe became aware of itself,'' he said. ``We
are creatures, created in the image of the creator.''
</P>
<P>
   He said science could not explain morality or human love of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many windows onto reality. Science is not the only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that religion can cause good people to do evil
things but added that ``it can cause bad people to do good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said he was in favor of a dialogue between science and
religion, ``I just don't want it to be a constructive dialogue.''
(CQ)
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought science has been making religion increasingly
unimportant to people and hopes it will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact, there is out there behind the structure of the
universe an objective meaning and an objective moral order, that
would be wonderful,'' Weinberg said, ``but if it isn't true, I
don't think we should kid ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Polkinghorne said many scientists are ''wary of religion because
they think it necessarily requires you to get up in the morning and
brush your teeth and believe six impossible things before
breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to commit intellectual suicide to be a
religious believer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, the two shook hands and parted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will I see you again?'' Weinberg asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you'll have to come to England,'' Polkinghorne replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do, what will you be this time? A movie star?'' Weinberg
asked.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    A family-friendly swamp
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, Ga. _ The late afternoon sunlight barely makes it through
the canopy of cypress, blackgum and bay. The path is draped in deep
shadow. Critters of some sort rustle in the brush, heard but
unseen. We spot a red-shouldered hawk perched on a branch just 20
feet away. He turns to stare at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this nature stuff,'' my 8-year-old son, Taylor, whispers,
``is scaring me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Okefenokee Swamp at dusk is, indeed, a spooky place. And,
for most folks, a swamp at any time of day is a bit scary. It's an
environment hostile to humans but ideal for reptiles, which
frighten most humans. It's a place that is intimidating, but also
beautiful and intriguing _ sort of like Xena the Warrior Princess.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Stephen C. Foster State Park provides a
family-friendly introduction to the Okefenokee Swamp, where you can
discover the wonders of the watery wilderness during the day and
retreat safely to high ground for the evening. The 80-acre state
park is surrounded by the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. The
park's nine cottages and 66 campsites are your base for exploring
the swamp, and the park's marina is your doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Your first venture into the Okefenokee should be aboard one of
the guided boat tours. Pontoon boats with interpretive rangers at
the helm cruise the swamp three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   You'll spot your first alligator before leaving the boat basin.
Stumpy, a male alligator so named because about 18 inches of his
tail was chomped off by a rival bull, tends to hang out near the
line of rental canoes. The combat that earned him his nickname has
turned him into a homebody, rangers say.
</P>
<P>
   Gators are the stars of the tour, especially with children, but
they have a large supporting cast. Depending on the season, and
your luck, you'll see great egrets, great blue herons, wood ducks,
wood storks and white ibises. All told, more than 220 species of
birds can be found in the swamp. At this time of year, many of them
are passing through as they migrate north.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost certain to spot turtles, and you may see some
snakes. There are 54 species of reptiles and 60 species of
amphibians in the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   Otters also swim in Billy's Lake, the largest open body of water
in the area at 4 1/2 miles long and up to 1,000 feet wide. There
are 41 species of mammals in the park, including white-tail deer,
black bear and raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   The park rangers provide a running commentary on the history of
the swamp, both natural and human. You'll learn about the
settlement of Billy's Island and how to identify never wets (a
water plant), blackgums and bay trees. You'll hear the Legend of
the Five Sisters and learn how small, floating islands called
``batteries'' are formed.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll also learn that ``there are about 170 different
spellings of `Okefenokee,' '' in the words of ranger Jackie Clay,
``and if you look at the signs in our park, we've spelled it about
six different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on land, you can walk more than a half-mile into the swamp
on an elevated boardwalk that's part of the park's nature trail.
</P>
<P>
   Just strolling through the campground can be a bit of an
adventure. An armadillo rooting in the ground between palmetto
bushes is an exciting discovery for a child who has never seen one.
Deer cut through the campsites on their way to the grazing provided
by the playground grass. Black bears have been seen ambling
through, looking for an unattended cooler. And you're likely to
encounter more larcenous raccoons that you'd care to.
</P>
<P>
   Real adventure, however, requires renting a boat. The park rents
canoes and johnboats equipped with 8-horsepower outboard motors.
You're allowed access to 25 miles of public day-use waterways, and
a motorboat is the best way to travel most of them. You can't
expect to cover much distance with a second-grader as a paddling
partner. The flat-bottom motorboats provide a little more stability
and security as well.
</P>
<P>
   We leave shortly after 8 a.m., outfitted with camera and cooler
and appropriately slathered with sunscreen. A quick two-mile trip
takes us to Billy's Island, where the ruins and rusted equipment of
an old logging camp can be seen. Then we reverse course a bit and
take a right, up a boat trail that takes us 12 miles deep into the
swamp.
</P>
<P>
   We slowly wind through cypress forests and open the throttle
through the wider parts of Minnie's Lake and Big Water Lake (which
isn't really that big). The spring morning is cool, and gator
sightings are infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   We stop for lunch at a shelter built on stilts overlooking Big
Water Lake. Motorboats aren't allowed much beyond this point, so we
head back after eating. The day has grown warmer and alligators
more visible. We spot more than a dozen on our trip back. In the
summer, hundreds can be seen along the boat trail and in Billy's
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   As we putt-putt along the shore of Billy's Lake, in no hurry to
return the boat, Taylor spots an alligator about 10 feet long, the
biggest we've seen so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we get closer?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of exploring, this swamp isn't so scary after
all.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Stephen C. Foster State Park is about six hours
southeast of Atlanta. Take I-75 south to Tifton, then U.S. 82 east
to Pearson and U.S. 441 south to Fargo. The park is about 18 miles
northeast of Fargo on Ga. 177. The turn to Ga. 177 is about a mile
south of Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rates: There is a $5 entry fee to get into the Okefenokee
National Wildlife Refuge; bring an exact amount to stuff into the
fee box. Cabin rental through May 31 is $71 per night
Sundays-Thursdays and $81 Fridays-Saturdays. Campsites with water,
electricity and cable are $16 for tent sites and $18 for
recreational vehicles, trailers and pop-up campers.
</P>
<P>
   Rental fees for motorboats range from $26 for four hours to $56
for 12 hours; canoe rentals are $6 for one hour, $11 for four hours
or $15 for eight hours. Bicycle rentals are $3.50 for one hour, $7
for four hours or $10 for eight hours. Reservations: 770-389-7275.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for boat tours are $8 for adults, $6 for children under 12;
free for children under 3.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Special events: Birding weekend, Thursday-Sunday; Reptiles of
the Swamp, June 10-13; Swampfest, Oct. 1-3. Information:
912-637-5274.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What to bring: Everything. The park is remote, so remote that
it's an hour and a half to the nearest McDonald's. The park's
headquarters has a general store with a limited supply of staples
such as ice, charcoal and marshmallows for campfire roasting. Some
supplies are available in Fargo. Be sure to bring plenty of
sunscreen and insect repellent. Binoculars are useful for spotting
birds and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearby attraction: The Okefenokee Swamp Park, a private park
at the northern entrance to the swamp, is located eight miles south
of Waycross off U.S. 1. The park features interpretive displays, a
boardwalk, observation tower and boat tours. Information:

 &HT;    The classic Bakini grows up
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The swimsuit that made waves last year with the
teenybopper set is back with a splash. And this time it's appealing
to adult women too.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ladies, the tankini _ the hot swimsuit that's part tank
top, part bikini bottom, combining the comfort of a one-piece with
the coolness of two _ is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the look of the season, particularly for the age group
between 20 and 35,'' said Chris Manning, buyer for misses' swimwear
and active wear at Rich's. ``That's all they're buying.''
</P>
<P>
   The tankini's appeal is its versatility. The suit comes in
styles that flatter most bodies, from juniors to misses.
</P>
<P>
   Tanks can be tube tops that stop under the bust, or they can
cover most of the midriff and stop above the navel. Others are so
long they give the illusion of a one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Some tops have underwire bras and wide straps to provide more
support, while others are unconstructed, with thin spaghetti
straps.
</P>
<P>
   The bikini bottoms, cut for full rear coverage, are the most
popular. But buyer can choose from short hot pants, particularly if
they have slim hips and thighs and want to look sporty, or they can
go for the French cut, raised high on the sides to lengthen the
appearance of the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the brief, a full-bottomed pant that combines
coverage with style.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only part of the tankini's appeal. Younger women like
it because they can wear it to a pool, on a boat or in a game of
beach volleyball without feeling that they're dressed too skimpily.
Older women like the way it covers while still revealing a little
skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-pieces are generally worn by people under 30,'' said
Debbie Coryell, manager of advertising and public relations at
Jantzen Inc. in Portland, Ore. ``When people hit 30 they start
gravitating toward one-pieces, for obvious reasons. This is an
opportunity for people who want to wear a two-piece but don't feel
comfortable in a bikini anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers sell the tankini as separates, making it
easier to fit those who wear one size on top and another on the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion experts predict that tankinis will become even more
popular next season, as manufacturers make more variations on the
original theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tankini business hasn't peaked,'' Manning said. ``It's
going uphill.''

   EVERGLADES-SUGAR (Clewiston, Fla.) _ The sugar industry is at
the center of a political struggle over a $7.8-billion project to
restore the watery wilderness of the Everglades, one of the most
threatened ecosystems in the world. The cane fields, former
marshland drained by a huge flood-control system for South Florida
50 years ago, stand like a plug between the Everglades and their
water source, Lake Okeechobee. For years, environmentalists have
labored to push back the fields. But the sugar industry has grown
up as part of a transformed South Florida landscape. As a result,
the battle over the Everglades and the water it needs to regain
health is also about economics and power, agribusiness jobs and
growing cities.

 &HT;    Bill by Georgia lawmaker would ban public-lands clearcutting
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has introduced another bill
in Congress to halt commercial logging in national forests _ her
second attempt in as many years to stop timber sales on public
land.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure introduced by McKinney (D-Ga.) and U.S. Rep.
Jim Leach (R-Iowa) last year did not make it out of committee. The
new legislation introduced this week has 46 co-sponsors and is
expected to get considerable more attention from legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forests provide outstanding recreational, educational,
scientific, commercial and spiritual opportunities to all
Americans,'' McKinney said. ``We must, as a nation, do everything
within our power to defend the integrity of the forests.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney and several environmental groups contend that logging _
and especially the practice of clearcutting _ severely damages the
forests, causing erosion and sedimentation, water pollution and
destruction of wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club was among several groups praising the bill.
``Our national forests are places where families canoe and hike,
where old friends fish and hunt,'' said Chuck McGrady, the club's
president. ``But it's not much fun hiking in a forest that's been
clearcut, canoeing in a stream clogged with silt or hunting in a
forest that's lost its wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said her bill, known as the National Forest Protection
and Restoration Act, will save money for the nation while
protecting the forests. A General Accounting Office report last
year said the nation lost about $2 billion between 1992 and 1997
through the subsidization of timber sales in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Not all environmental groups support the legislation. Several
groups say the no-commercial-logging concept is too radical for
most Americans. The issue threatens to divide environmentalists in
their 20-year-old effort to get the government to preserve more
wilderness areas within 155 national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies also lashed out at the legislation. ``We are,
of course, opposed to it,'' said Deborah Baker of the Southern
Timber Council in Atlanta, which represents several logging
companies. ``We believe there should be a balanced approach to
managing our national forests; this bill does not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, there are 30 federal forests covering 13 million
acres. Almost two-thirds of that acreage are open to logging.

RESEARCHER GROWS AND REUSES BLOOD VESSELS IN PIGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mass.)   By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using a container built to pulse like a heart and act like a
nurturing mother, a biomedical researcher has succeeded in growing
blood vessels from a few cells of an animal and using them in the
blood-vessel system of the same animal. Her achievement raises the
hope that scientists can grow human blood vessels to help treat
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura E. Niklason, an anesthesiologist and biomedical
engineer at Duke University, ran the experiment as a researcher at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The work was one of a
series of recent successes in a new field of medical science,
tissue engineering, in which more than 25 forms of tissue have been
grown in laboratories around the world _ from bone, to corneas, to
heart valves.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to grow replacements for diseased parts of the body
for which transplants or manufactured substitutes are unavailable
or rare. Only a few years ago, scientists believed that transplants
or artificial substitutes were all that could be used for such
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Niklason and others say much more testing lies ahead before
human blood vessels can be grown. But Dr. Joseph P. Vacanti, a
professor of surgery at the Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said the speed of the
recent progress coupled with the new advance by Dr. Niklason
created the possibility that ``human clinical trials could begin in
two to five years, unless significant new problems arise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Gardner, a surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania
Medical School and chairman of the American Heart Association's
surgery council, called the Niklason results ``really astounding,''
and said, ``If this works out, it will be a major development in
cardiovascular surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding where others had failed, Niklason built a mechanism,
called a bioreactor, to create vessels small enough in diameter to
work properly but without clotting. Vacanti said the trick lay in
creating an environment so favorable to the growth of the young
blood vessel cells _ one that pulsates with the rhythm of the
heart, delivers a constant supply of nutrients to the young cells
and imitates the conditions in which mature vessels will operate.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the journal Science, Niklason said she took
smooth muscle cells, which strengthen vessel walls, from the
arteries of pigs. She placed them in thin biodegradable plastic
tubes inside what she described in an interview as a pickle jar
with arms.
</P>
<P>
   Like wrappings of porous cloth, the tubes allow nutrients in
fluid contained in the pickle jar to seep in and feed the cells. A
pump sends more nutrients in through the arms of the jar and the
tubes, which stretch and contract as vessels of the body do when
blood is pushed through by a beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   After eight weeks, she coated the growing vessels with
endothelial pig cells to line the inside of the growing arteries;
these are needed to prevent clogging. The fully grown arteries were
then used in a trial to replace an artery in the same pigs from
which cells were initially taken. The arteries lasted through a
three-week trial without clotting, Niklason said. Narrow-diameter
arteries grown in previous studies without a pulsing bioreactor
clotted.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Langer, in whose laboratory Niklason did the
experiment and who was a co-author of the Science article, agreed
that the key to its success was the ``idea of using a bioreactor
that beats like a heart.''

 &HT;    Take cover in the sweet, sassy shrug
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, April 18.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, a fashion trend that you can shrug on instead of off.
</P>
<P>
   The shrug _ an abbreviated sweater _ is the latest cover-up to
attract the attention of fashion aficionados. Essentially, it's a
shawl with sleeves covering the shoulders and arms. But, unlike a
shawl or stole, the cropped shrug doesn't require constant
attention to keep it on your shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shrug is the new cardigan in a twinset. And it's sexy,''
declares Susan Forehand, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the snug-fitting garment is so small it looks
like something a 6-year-old would wear.
</P>
<P>
   Shrugs were first popular in the 1930s, worn over evening gowns.
In the '50s, they went to the office over dresses. Now designers
such as Donna Karan and Betsey Johnson have brought them back
again, for the office as well as after-five parties.
</P>
<P>
   Made out of everything from cotton knits and cashmeres to sheer
organdies and laces, they top strapless tubes, slip dresses,
camisoles and tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wearing a shrug is an easy alternative to going sleeveless,''
explains Beth Ann Taratoot, owner of Beth Ann Boutique on Irby
Avenue. ``It adds a layer yet doesn't cover up the dress or top
underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, by shrugging into a shrug, you can't give anyone
the cold shoulder anymore.

BUSH LEADS IN CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first big test of the nascent presidential
campaign, Texas Governor George W. Bush overpowered his Republican
rivals by bringing in $7.6 million in just 28 days, while Democrat
Bill Bradley showed surprising financial strength in his bid
against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley clearly has benefitted from the absence of other
challengers to Gore, and it may enable the former New Jersey
senator to make good on his vow to give the vice president a
serious run.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore tapped his years of fund-raising prowess to bring in
$8.9 million, Bradley, never known as a big financial draw, showed
strength by taking in $4.3 million, according to first-quarter
contribution reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley's success was augmented by a New York City
fund-raiser Thursday night that was expected to draw 1,200 donors
and bring in $2 million. Bradley should have enough cash to compete
at least through the early primaries and caucuses, and this year he
could raise even more than the $15 million to $20 million that he
originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first returns from the first primary, which is
the fund-raising primary,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director
for the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. ``Bush is
beginning to look like a juggernaut with the enormous amount of
money he raised in a short period of time, and Bradley's figure is
surprisingly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's success seemed to erase any doubt that the son of the
former president would soon switch from ``exploratory'' mode to
being a full-fledged candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first indication that there is real solid
support,'' Bush said Thursday. Bush also proved to be a careful
spender, with $6.7 million cash on hand and debts of only $16,333.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's closest financial rival was Senator John McCain of
Arizona, who received $3.8 million, but his total was inflated due
to a $2 million transfer from his Senate campaign. McCain spent $1
million, and has $534,402 in debts. Former Vice President Dan
Quayle took in $2.1 million, but he spent so much on fund-raising
that his debts were $175,000 greater than his cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, another much-publicized and undeclared
candidate, had far less success than Bush. Dole, who has never run
for political office before, raised $685,253 in 21 days. She spent
$108,210.
</P>
<P>
   Early, effective fund-raising is considered a key factor in
determining which candidates will do well in the primaries,
especially with next year's compressed schedule. But money is not
enough, as Bush knows from watching his fellow Texan, Republican
Senator Phil Gramm, who was a prolific fund-raiser in the 1996
campaign yet failed to make it to the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law required that the campaigns mail their quarterly
reports Thursday, but there was wide disparity in the release. Bush
immediately released the names of all 23,000 donors on his Internet
site, while some other candidates just mailed their reports to the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the highlights of reports issued Thursday by
various campaigns:
</P>
<P>
   --Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who financed most of his
1996 campaign, has contributed $694,000 of the $712,538 raised by
his campaign. Forbes's contributions are likely to skyrocket
because he has vowed to spend ``whatever it takes'' to win and has
declared he will reject federal matching funds, which means he
won't have to abide by a spending cap. (Bush is also considering
rejecting matching funds.)
</P>
<P>
   --Quayle appeared to have more donors than any other candidate
35,251. Quayle's average donation, however, was $58.47. He ended
the quarter with $500,000 in cash on hand, but he had debts of
$675,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander was known for his
early financial power at this stage of the last presidential
campaign, when he collected more than $4 million in the first
quarter of 1995. But he had a much less impressive showing this
time, bringing in just $748,773. Moreover, Alexander reported
having just $86,916 in cash on hand at the end of the quarter,
while he owes $212,405. Aides said the campaign intends to hold
most of its fund-raisers after May.
</P>
<P>
   --Gary Bauer, domestic adviser to former President Reagan,
raised $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, raised
$328,067, and he spent $257,000, much of it on fund-raising
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   --Representative John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, did not file a
financial report; aides said he remains in ``exploratory'' mode and
will file later.

DAVIS TO ASK FOR MEDIATION ON IMMIGRATION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Punting on the most politically fraught decision
of his fledgling administration, Gov. Gray Davis announced Thursday
that he would ask a federal appeals court to mediate the legal
fight over Proposition 187, the ballot measure to end government
services for illegal immigrants, in hopes of reaching a negotiated
settlement that would not rankle his Hispanic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for supporters and opponents of the measure said
they were not sure what compromise was possible, and they expressed
both disappointment and puzzlement at the governor's move.
</P>
<P>
   Davis faced a deadline next month on whether to appeal a federal
court decision last year that held the measure unconstitutional, or
whether to drop the matter. In keeping with his instinctively
cautious approach, the new governor chose a middle ground, keeping
the case alive in a way intended to find a low-key resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a piece of legislation, I would veto it,'' Davis
said in Sacramento. ``But it's not. It's an initiative, passed by
nearly 60 percent of the voters through a process specifically
designed to go over the heads of the Legislature and the governor.
While I believe that some of the provisions of Prop 187 are
unconstitutional, I'm a governor, not a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is complicated for Davis, a Democrat elected last fall
on a pledge to end divisive ``wedge-issue'' politics in his state.
He opposed the ballot measure, which was approved in 1994, but has
also vowed not to interfere with the will of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 187 has been blocked in the courts virtually since
its passage, after civil rights groups sued to overturn it, and
last year, Judge Mariana Pfaelzer of U.S. District Court here ruled
that it unconstitutionally usurped the federal government's
authority over immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, who had made the
measure a centerpiece of his bitter 1994 re-election campaign,
appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but final arguments
had yet to be filed when Wilson left office in January.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Davis' minority supporters urged him to drop the appeal
and be done with the case. But some of his advisers argued that the
state Constitution could be read as requiring him to continue a
legal defense of the initiative, at least until an appellate court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers feared that if Davis appealed and won, he would be
in the unenviable position of having affirmed a measure he opposed.
But they also worried that if he dropped the appeal, anti-immigrant
groups might sponsor a new initiative that could reignite the
issue, perhaps in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took note of both arguments in his comments on Thursday,
pointing out that since Proposition 187 was passed, President
Clinton's welfare overhaul of 1996 and a new federal immigration
law had essentially enshrined in federal law many of the provisions
of the original ballot measure, particularly those allowing the
denial of welfare and medical benefits to illegal immigrants,
leaving much of the measure moot.
</P>
<P>
   So Davis said he would ask the 9th Circuit's mediation service
to convene a panel in search of a settlement, adding: ``It is my
hope and belief that this well-established procedure will resolve
the dispute over Proposition 187 entirely, and avoid years of
costly litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the plaintiffs and proponents of the measure do not ``act
responsibly,'' Davis said, ``I will knock heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Saenz, a lawyer for the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, which is co-lead counsel in the case,
professed some confusion at the governor's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to decide what he's doing, from our perspective,''
Saenz said. ``We are prepared to listen to whatever the governor
proposes, and if that's through mediation, so be it. But we have
never had any discussions with the governor about this, and we
don't know what he's putting on the table. We believe strongly that
he should drop this entire appeal.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his statement, Davis seemed to envision the involvement of
the proponents of Proposition 187, who have been rebuffed in past
efforts to intervene in the case. On Thursday, a lawyer for the
Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, which represents the
measure's authors, also expressed puzzlement at Davis' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediation is worthwhile if there is an area for compromise,''
said the lawyer, John Findley. ``I don't know what the area for
compromise in this particular litigation would be. Either the
initiative is constitutional or it is not. I don't see that the
parties could compromise by agreeing that part of it is
constitutional and part of it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   But senior aides to the governor, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a range of options was possible. For example, these
officials said, the plaintiffs could agree to accept provisions of
Proposition 187 imposing criminal penalties for the manufacture,
sale and use of false documents to conceal a person's immigration
status _ provisions that the U.S. District Court let stand.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, supporters of the measure could concede that key
provisions have since been rendered moot by federal law. They could
also agree to accept the District Court's decision that a 1982
Supreme Court ruling that barred Texas from denying education to
illegal immigrants meant similar provisions in Proposition 187 were
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   But Saenz, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his side would
never accept the idea of inviting the proponents of 187, who have
never been parties to the suit, to a negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what he envisions,'' he said of Davis, ``that won't
happen. We will not agree to be involved in any formal process with
someone who is not a party to this case.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the state's senior Hispanic politicians, Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, reacted with measured disappointment to
Thursday's decision. He had urged that the governor drop the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed,'' said Villaraigosa's spokeswoman, Elena
Stern. ``It's not what he would have done. Going the mediation
route is better than a straight appeal, but he was disappointed,
and he expressed that to the governor.''

EXTRADITION CASE AGAINST PINOCHET WILL PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain gave an official go-ahead Thursday to
extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, dashing his
hopes of being freed to return to Chile and setting the stage for
months of legal maneuvering over the request by Spain to try him on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was letting the case proceed
despite a decision last month by the House of Lords that
drastically reduced the charges against the former Chilean
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Straw said the remaining allegations of torture and conspiracy
to torture satisfied the European Convention on Extradition and
imposed an obligation on Britain to permit the Spanish request to
go before British courts. A hearing was set for April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Barros of the Chilean Reconciliation Movement assailed
the decision as an act of ``outrageous political persecution'' and
said it showed ``contempt for Chilean sovereignty, for Chilean
democracy and for the Chilean courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, Reed Brody,
applauded the move as a significant victory, saying: ``Up until now
it's been about the law. But now it's about the crimes, and he's
going to have to answer the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, six months old, has transformed international law,
galvanized human rights and exile groups and stirred passionate old
antagonisms in Chile and other countries that have recent
experiences of dictatorial regimes. It has produced diplomatic
problems for Britain despite the government's insistence that
Pinochet's detention has been from the start a police and judicial
matter rather than a political one.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Thursday represents the second time that Straw has
permitted the extradition case to go forward. But he based his
first authorization, on Dec. 9, on the much broader case that
existed at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Law Lords, England's highest court, threw out all
but three of the 32 original charges of murder, torture and hostage
taking. The Law Lords reasoned that the only counts on which the
general could be arrested and held for extradition were three
dating from the period after Dec. 8, 1988, when the U.N. Torture
Convention took effect here and torture abroad became a crime
punishable in British courts.
</P>
<P>
   Straw, the top law-enforcement officer in England, said he based
his decision solely on the law and had not been swayed by any
``possible effects'' that keeping Pinochet under house arrest in
England might have on the stability of Chile's democracy or British
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy and detailed statement that appeared to anticipate
the High Court review that Pinochet's lawyers will almost certainly
seek, Straw justified his decision with specific legal precedents
and quotations from statute.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Spanish request was legally well founded and
properly drawn up, that the offenses were not ``of a political
character,'' that no statutes of limitations had run out and that
it would not be ``unjust or oppressive'' to expose the general to
the charges now.
</P>
<P>
   He turned aside arguments that the 83-year-old general was unfit
to stand trial but added, ``This question, among others, can be
re-examined in the light of any developments.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he based his decision on the three charges and did not
need to rely on the evidence of 46 additional cases from after 1988
that Baltasar Garzon, the judge in Madrid, Spain, who brought the
original complaint, had submitted since the Law Lords most recent
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Chilean government arguments that the general
should be tried in his home country, Straw said he had no
extradition request from Chile and added, ``There is no provision
of international law which excludes Spain's jurisdiction in this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Each new step in the extradition procedure is subject to
judicial review, and the possibility exists that the case will find
its way back to the House of Lords three additional times. Even
after all the appeals were exhausted, Straw would have to make a
final ruling before Pinochet could be taken to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Byers, an international lawyer and a fellow of Jesus
College, Oxford, estimated Thursday that the whole process could
last up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested last Oct. 16 in London and spent
succeeding months protesting the action on the basis that as a
former head of state he had sovereign immunity. That view was
upheld by the High Court on Oct. 28, but reversed, on appeal, by
the Law Lords on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The application from Garzon charged Pinochet with genocide,
murder, torture and kidnapping in connection with the death or
disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the years after he
seized power in a coup in 1973.

POLITICIANS SAY THEY WANT INCOME-TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran proposed Thursday to
trim the income-tax rate to 5.75 percent, a reduction that would
cut the average taxpayer's bill by $135 a year and reduce state
revenues by $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the move by the Mattapan Democrat, a fiscal conservative who
so far this year has been skeptical of a tax cut, did little to
ease the standoff with Governor Paul Cellucci, who has pushed hard
for a much deeper cut, to 5 percent, from the current 5.95 percent.
The Republican governor again vowed to wage a ballot campaign if
the Legislature did not make the full reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a negotiating mood,'' Cellucci declared.
</P>
<P>
   The development leaves Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham as
the only member of the Beacon Hill leadership troika opposed to a
sizable income tax cut. Reacting to Finneran's announcement, the
Chelsea Democrat said the only reduction likely to pass his chamber
was a $50 million property tax relief plan for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's dead on arrival, but it's highly doubtful
the Senate will do an income tax cut,'' Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a state surplus estimated at $250 million to $300
million, a tobacco settlement windfall of billions of dollars, and
Democratic openness to tax cuts, the budget debate could grow
rancorous in the weeks to come. Legislative leaders are
increasingly nervous about funding shortfalls for the Big Dig while
other roads and bridges need repair. And with dismal student and
teacher test scores making headlines, others on Beacon Hill want to
direct more money toward education.
</P>
<P>
   Some key players in the House were quietly annoyed that the
speaker offered a proposal that would reduce state coffers by more
than a quarter of a billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Haley, who has argued that
the budget proposed by the governor earlier this year is badly
underfunded, was unhappy with Finneran's decision, legislative
sources said. But the speaker overrode his budget chief's concerns,
arguing that with less money available, there would be less
pressure to spend in the new fiscal year, which begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to force us to make some difficult decisions,''
Haley admitted after Finneran's State House announcement.
</P>
<P>
   House liberals were also jolted by the news, charging it came
without any consultation by the speaker. Finneran, however,
insisted his proposal balanced spending needs with the realistic
desire for tax relief. But for Cellucci, Finneran's tax cut is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have one of the highest income tax rates of the big
industrial states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would cost the state $1.4 billion a year _
or $600 in relief for the average family _ when fully phased in
over three years. The income tax rate would drop to 5.6 percent
during the first year of his program, to 5.3 percent in the second,
before settling at 5 percent _ where it stood in 1989 when the
Legislature raised the rate to help ease the state's emerging
fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's plan would take effect Jan. 1, 2000, costing $130
million for half of that fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to vote on the proposal before the end of
the month.

 BUSH AND GORE ARE EARLY LEADERS IN PRESIDENTIAL FUND-RAISING
EFFORTS  (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first real measure of support for candidates
in the 2000 presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
reported on Thursday that he had amassed $7.6 million in
contributions in just 28 days, dwarfing what every other Republican
hopeful raised in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's total, collected without hosting a single fund-raising
event, solidified his position as the party's early favorite for a
contest in which early money is more important than ever because
the compressed primary schedule will leave almost no time for
fund-raising next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not scheduled any fund-raisers until after the Texas
legislative session ends on May 31, his supporters said on
Thursday. Most of the checks were sent in response to a letter
announcing the formation of his Presidential Exploratory Committee
in early March, committee leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the tremendous support from people across the
country for my exploratory effort,'' Bush said in a statement on
Thursday after his committee _ and the rest of the Republican and
Democratic candidates _ filed their quarterly campaign finance
reports with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   While the public is paying almost no attention to the campaign,
the candidates' first quarter fund-raising totals are scrutinized
by party leaders for the first tangible proof of a candidate's
ability to generate enthusiasm through raw dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the favorite for the Democratic
nomination, raised $8.9 million in the first quarter, a sum that
``exceeded even our own expectations,'' said Roger Salazar, a
spokesman for the Gore 2000 campaign. ``We're very pleased with the
amount raised.'' His only rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, raised $4.3. million.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive first quarter tallies of Gore and Bush make clear
already that the 2000 campaign is certain to be the most expensive
in history. Four years ago, it was assumed that a candidate needed
at least $20 million in the bank by Jan. 1, 1996, to be
competitive. This year, some fund-raisers say, candidates will need
at least $40 million by Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates are off to the races extremely fast in their
fund raising,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan campaign finance
research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolically, Makinson observed, the filing of these early
financial reports is the first presidential primary. ``If the
candidates can't wind up in the top tier of this first primary,
they know they are not going to get the media attention,'' he said.
``They know that money begets money. If you get off to a quick
start, it helps build momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The torrid pace of Bush's first month seemed to have hampered
the first-quarter efforts of other Republican candidates, notably
former Vice President Dan Quayle. Unlike Bush, Quayle spent the
last 15 days of March hosting big money fund-raisers all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle reported that his campaign raised $2 million in the first
quarter, but that amount fell short of the $3 million campaign
officials had predicted in February that he would raise by March
31.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, raised $700,000
in the first quarter. That amount fell far short of his total
raised during the first quarter in 1995 when he had raised $5.2
million, thanks in large part to a 25-city fund-raising tour.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Welch, Alexander's finance chairman, said that it was
ill-advised to read anything into contrasting the campaign's first
quarter this year with the tally four years ago. This time, Welch
explained, Alexander decided not to begin his fund-raising campaign
in earnest until May. Alexander's first big fund-raiser is
scheduled for May 4 in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who has shown up as a very distant second place
to Bush in many opinion polls, lowered expectations for her
first-quarter, saying she would begin a 10-city fund-raising tour
on April 27 with a dinner in Washington. Leaders of Mrs. Dole's
exploratory committee said that she was reporting $640,000 raised
during the first three weeks of her candidacy in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona's exploratory committee raised $1.7
million in the first quarter, while conservative Gary Bauer, the
former head of the Family Research Council, raised $1.4 million,
according to records filed with the FEC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising totals for Steve Forbes and Rep. John Kasich of
Ohio, were not available from the FEC on Thursday. Forbes spent $32
million of his own money in his 1996 bid. The television
commentator Patrick J. Buchanan raised $500,000 in the first
quarter, and Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire collected around
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fat war chest has already discouraged other prominent
Democrats, including Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Sen. Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska, from launching their own presidential bids.
</P>
<P>
   According to several Gore political advisers, an early
fund-raising show of strength was essential because leading
Democrats are concerned about the vice president's troubling poll
numbers (he has trailed both Mr. Bush and Mrs. Dole in recent
polls). The impressive $8.9 million raised by the Gore campaign
during the first three months of the year shows that the vice
president's base of support is still strong. If his fund raising
had faltered, other candidates besides Bradley would have been
sorely tempted to fight Gore for the Democratic nomination.

<P>
   Major studies reported Thursday show that bone-marrow
transplantation, a grueling procedure held out as a hope to many
women with advanced breast cancer, does not prolong their survival
over all. But the medical group that announced the findings
cautioned that it was still too soon to pass final judgment on the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients and doctors had hoped the studies would finally
determine whether it was worthwhile for women to undergo the
drastic and costly treatment, which involves extremely high doses
of chemotherapy. But the findings reported Thursday may instead
fuel the longstanding disagreement between the procedure's
advocates and its detractors, and do little to help women decide
whether to undertake the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   News of the research was made public in summaries of five
studies, posted on the Internet Thursday by the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, at www.asco.org. The studies, two from the
United States and three from overseas, involved more than 2,000
patients treated at many different medical centers. The summaries
of the research were part of an Internet posting of a program for
the society's meeting next month. Researchers said they were being
released before the meeting because of intense interest in the
studies.
</P>
<P>
   They will be reported in full and debated at the meeting and
until then, researchers cautioned, the findings should be
considered preliminary. They said numbers might change as data are
analyzed more fully, and the findings might be challenged by other
scientists once they see all the data.
</P>
<P>
   The studies included breast cancer patients who had a poor
prognosis because cancer had invaded 10 or more lymph nodes in the
underarm, or had spread even farther to organs or bones, a
condition known as metastatic disease.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the studies found no difference in survival between
patients who had high-dose chemotherapy with transplants, and those
who had lower doses of chemotherapy. A fifth study, from South
Africa, did find a benefit in patients with positive lymph nodes,
suggesting that the treatment might help some women. But the
oncology group issued a statement saying, ``it is not yet possible
to draw definitive conclusions about the role of high-dose
chemotherapy in breast cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen Lichter, president of the oncology society, said in a
telephone interview that the lack of conclusive findings thus far
suggests that if the procedure does eventually turn out to have a
benefit, it will be small.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you see a positive study is encouraging,''
Lichter said. ``The fact that you see negative ones in the same
population says to me that the true difference is not going to be
enormous, or everybody would see it. This is not like penicillin
and pneumonia, where you can't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer Institute,
agreed that the studies so far had not shown that that high-dose
therapy is better than standard treatment. But he and other
researchers noted that some of the findings might change as the
patients are studied longer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerome Groopman, a cancer specialist at the Harvard Medical
School, said that despite the lack of benefit shown by most of the
studies, ``My own prejudice is that there will be a small subset of
patients who will benefit, with either a long-term remission with
good quality of life or maybe even a cure.'' But, he added, if such
patients exist, doctors do not know how to identify them ahead of
time and spare others the rigors of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The studies represent an effort to make sense of a procedure
that came into widespread practice without proof that it would
actually help breast cancer patients. The idea behind the treatment
is to try to wipe out the cancer by giving patients extremely high
doses of chemotherapy. But those drugs also poison the bone marrow,
which is home to the stem cells that produce the cells of the blood
and immune system. After high dose chemotherapy, a patient will die
unless the bone marrow is restored by transplants of bone marrow or
stem cells harvested from a donor or from the patient herself
before treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Doctors began offering bone marrow transplants as a last resort
to women with advanced breast cancer during the 1980s, after they
saw how well the treatment worked in people with leukemia and other
cancers affecting the blood and bone marrow. Early studies in
breast cancer looked promising, but lacked comparison groups, but
because they did not include comparison groups it was impossible to
say how the treatment compared to more conventional chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, demand for the procedure grew, and many women
refused to enter comparison studies because they wanted
transplants. That reluctance, combined with insurance companies'
refusal to cover the treatment in studies (though they eventually
began paying for it otherwise) made it hard to enroll patients in
studies and delayed the work by several years, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' groups differed sharply in their reaction to the
studies released Thursday. The National Breast Cancer Coalition, in
Washington, urged researchers to shift their emphasis away from
transplants towards finding new treatments. In a telephone
interview, Fran Visco, president of the coalition, also criticized
the oncology group for not taking a stand against the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and very disappointed by ASCO's statement,''
Ms. Visco said. ``We don't need to add to the confusion. We
certainly don't need to encourage women to have unproven treatments
like this outside of clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   But another organization, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation, in Dallas, said, ``the results of these studies in no
way suggest that this matter is settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said that the most definitive study was one
conducted in the United States involving 553 women with metastatic
disease. After three years, regardless of whether they had bone
marrow transplants or conventional chemotherapy, survival rates
were comparable, between 30 and 40 percent. In both groups, the
women also relapsed at about the same point, a median of nine
months after being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a clear benefit to transplant,'' said Dr. Edward
Stadtmauer, director of bone-marrow transplantation at the
University of Pennsylvania cancer center in Philadelphia, who
directed the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Stadtmauer and Lichter, the president of ASCO and radiation
oncologist at the University of Michigan, both said that the
procedure should be studied, in combination with other treatments,
in women with metastatic disease. Lichter said scientists were
``not even close'' to halting studies of the procedure in those
women.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller study of metastatic disease, in 61 women in France,
also showed no difference in survival. However, patients who
received transplants took longer to relapse, which meant that their
quality of life was better because they had more time free of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In women who did not have metastatic disease, but who had 10 or
more positive lymph nodes, the findings were less clear.
</P>
<P>
   An American study of 874 women has shown no difference in
survival between those who got transplants and those who received
doses of chemotherapy that were higher than normal but not high
enough to require a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Norton, director of the Lauder Breast Center at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and an author
of the study, said, ``The ultimate survival was equal. There were
fewer deaths in the transplant group, but more deaths from the
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two results balanced each other, Norton said, resulting in
equal survival rates. But he cautioned that the study is still
going on, and that the patients should be followed for three more
years to determine whether whether transplant has any advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might turn out in the long run, another two or three years,
that transplant is a little better,'' Norton said. ``My guess is
that the difference will be in the 5 percent range. But we can't
draw conclusions yet. The data are being released now because the
public has a right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study in the same type of patient, conducted in 525
women in Scandinavia, also showed no benefit from transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But a South African study of 154 women did show a benefit. Women
who got transplants lived longer and had fewer relapses than those
who did not: after more than five years of follow up, 17 percent
who received transplants had died, as compared to 35 percent in the
other group.
</P>
<P>
   Because the drugs and transplant methods used in the study
differed from those used in the United States, researchers said it
was unclear what relevance the findings had to American patients.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have circulated for weeks that the studies would be
negative, and that insurance companies would refuse to cover the
procedure, which costs $60,000 Thursday, down from $140,000 in
1990. But the oncology group said that insurers should not change
their policies based on the studies, and also urged them cover the
procedure when it is done as part of a research study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40,000 women a year who are dying of breast cancer,
and we must continue to try to help them,'' Stadtmauer said.

ZESTY OLIVE SPREADS BECOME THE HOUSE SPECIALTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A short time after diners are seated at Padri
restaurant in Agoura Hills, a wonderful dish of salsina _ a mixture
of chopped tomatoes, black olives, fresh basil, lemon zest and a
little olive oil _ arrives at the table along with a basket of
rustic bread slices. At the Terrace il ristorante in the Tower at
the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City, diners are greeted with a
small container of fabulous-tasting olivio celestiale _ a
combination of chopped pimiento-stuffed olives, black olives,
garlic and Italian parsley with a little olive oil _ along with a
selection of potato dill and rye bread slices and woven soft
pretzels. Il Buco in Beverly Hills welcomes customers with a thick
black olive and olive oil dipping mixture and country bread slices
to take the edge off diners' hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Each restaurant has its own spread rendition _ and all are on
the house _ instead of oil or butter. Pile the mixture thick or
spread thin on assorted breads _ and you'll be in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Although many restaurants serve flavored or unflavored olive
oils and some offer balsamic vinegar in addition, it's these more
substantial appetizer-style offerings that are luring customers and
growing in popularity in restaurants and at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be different and serve hungry diners something to
eat right away while they are waiting,'' said Saverio Posarelli,
the chef and owner of Padri. He created his salsina and began
serving it on the spur of the moment one night after he ran out of
the usual black olive tapenade, which the restaurant served when it
opened a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a case of really ripe tomatoes and chopped them up (by
hand) with a little basil, oregano, kalamata olives, salt, cayenne
pepper and lemon zest _ and have served the resulting creation ever
since for lunch and dinner,'' he reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Now he makes the salsina every morning _ five gallons at a time
_ and stores it in the fridge until serving time. It will keep
refrigerated a couple of days if covered with olive oil. It's so
popular that customers can purchase it (on request) for $5 a pint
to enjoy at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrace in the Century Plaza Hotel and Tower was serving an
olive relish long before Michael Omo arrived a year and half ago as
chef de cuisine. He has altered it slightly to use a fruity and
nutty French-style extra virgin olive oil, different olives and
have a distinct bite that comes from chile flakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes first-time customers shy away from the condiment
because they have never seen it before, but once they try it, they
are pleasantly surprised and can't get enough of it,'' said Omo,
adding that it distinguishes the restaurant _ and complements the
Mediterranean cuisine and antipasto bar featured.
</P>
<P>
   Omo makes 50 gallons once, and sometimes twice a week, using a
meat grinder to keep the olives uniform size. When making it at
home in a food processor, pulse and stir the mixture at the same
time to end up with even-size olive pieces, advised Omo, and do not
overprocess. Due to customer demand, the restaurant offers an
8-ounce jar for $8 for diners to take home. Since the condiment is
fresh-packed, it must be kept refrigerated and should be used
within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Omo recommends using it as a spread on sub-type sandwiches (with
salami, prosciutto, roasted peppers and basil), in salads, with
pastas or mixed with mayonnaise as a dip for artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiacomino Drago, executive chef and partner at Il Buco,
developed the black olive dip that has been served at the
restaurant since it opened a year ago. ``Taste is what makes it so
appealing. It is very tasty on bread _ and people love it. It is
something different from the usual olive oil and balsamic served at
some restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's chef Franco De Dominicis makes it every two to
three days by pureeing Greek black olives with fresh garlic,
crushed red pepper and chopped fresh Italian parsley in a
commercial food processor and then mixing in extra virgin oil. If
you plan to make it at home, don't be tempted to process the oil
with the olives because you'll end up with an unappealing,
gray-looking mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The dip will keep refrigerated up to a week, but the restaurant
removes it an hour prior to serving to allow it to come to room
temperature. Drago notes that the dip is also good as a dressing on
salads or combined with pasta and melted mascarpone cheese or other
pasta mixtures. And it is so popular that he is thinking about
packaging and selling it commercially.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs believe that the spreads give customers extra value _
and encourage repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never consider taking the salsina off the menu,''
noted Posarelli, ``even though it is an extra expense. The money
comes back _ people remember things.''
</P>
<P>
   Drago contemplated discontinuing the dip because of the expense
(the ingredients are very costly), but reconsidered. It has become
a favorite with customers _ and a signature dish of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Some similar tapenades and spreads are available commercially in
specialty food stores and supermarkets, but they are pricey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we've included copycat recipe versions _ developed for
home cooks _ of spreads sampled at Padri, the Terrace, Il Buco and
a few other restaurants around the Southland, including Ca'del Sole
in Universal City, Fresco in Glendale and Romeo Cucina in Laguna
Beach. All go together in just minutes _ many with a little
assistance from the food processor. For best results, be sure to
use top-quality ingredients. Also tossed in is a recipe for
assorted marinated olives sampled at Olives restaurant in Las
Vegas. They're great and _ like the spreads _ grace each diners'
table.
</P>
<P>
   Present the creations with slices of country-style breads such
as rosemary, walnut, Italian peasant, sourdough and the like.
</P>
<P>
   All are versatile and delicious _ and you'll be hard pressed to
decide which one to make first. &UR;

BOEING ANNOUNCES LARGER-THAN-EXPECTED PROFIT AT COMMERCIAL AIRLINE
DIVISION  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mo., Wash.) (rk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. showed Thursday that it can build a lot of
airplanes and make money, too, something that many on Wall Street
had begun to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the country's
single largest exporter, reported a significant profit at its
troubled commercial airplane division for the first time in more
than a year, handily beating Wall Street's estimates for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which also makes fighter planes and missiles and
launches satellites into space, said it earned $469 million, or 50
cents a diluted share, on sales of $14.4 billion, compared with $50
million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $12.9 billion in the
quarter a year earlier. The consensus estimate of Wall Street
analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings, was 43 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing rose sharply Thursday, closing at $41.6875, up
$3.6875. They rose nearly as much on Wednesday _ $3.375 a share _
after unidentified Boeing officials leaked word of the quarter's
positive results to The Seattle Times. Deborah C. Hopkins, Boeing's
chief financial officer, strongly decried the leak Thursday, saying
that Boeing's legal team had begun a ``full-scale investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive quarter that Boeing's financial
results have exceeded expectations after $4 billion in unexpected
charges in 1997 and 1998. ``Everything I see says we are turning,''
said Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, who
came under fire from investors last year when the company's share
price sagged more than 30 percent. ``One of the things I have
learned is that it is going to take continuous pressure to keep the
boat turning. It's moving, but we have a long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the profit improvement during the quarter came from
Boeing's civil aviation business, which delivered 148 jets, up from
108 in the period a year earlier. Revenue for the commercial
airplane division, which accounts for more than 60 percent of
Boeing's sales, rose $1.7 billion, to $9.8 billion. Its operating
profit soared, to $382 million from $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   At 3.9 percent, the airplane division's profit margins were
above the paltry three-tenths of a percent in the quarter a year
earlier, but were still far below where Boeing and Wall Street
think they should be. Condit has said that his goal is a
double-digit operating profit on sales of commercial jets, though
the company's forecast is that annual operating margins at the
division will climb no higher than 3 percent this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins warned that profit margins for the division would
likely be weaker during the rest of the year because many of the
planes that Boeing will deliver were sold to airlines at steep
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to be true next year as well. Boeing plans to
deliver a record 620 airplanes this year; the number will fall to
480 in 2000. Future profits will depend on how successful the
company is at reducing costs.
</P>
<P>
   The number of employees at the commercial airplane division fell
to 108,000 from 118,000 during the quarter. The company now employs
219,000 people, down from 231,000 at the end of 1998. It plans to
reduce the number to between 200,000 and 210,000 by the end of the
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
noted that Boeing would also be hurt later in the year by a decline
in deliveries of 747s, the company's most profitable commercial
jet. In addition, the company raised profits during the quarter by
cutting its spending on research and development 26 percent, to
$361 million. It also received a favorable contract settlement in
its military division that added 3 cents a share to its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of costs and process changes ahead of
them,'' Rubel said. ``The key point here is that they have hit
bottom some time ago and have begun to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the well-publicized challenges on the commercial
side, Boeing is also seeking more orders for its F-15 fighter. Both
Israel and Greece are considering buying the jet. Condit said that
Boeing might have to slow down production at its factory in St.
Louis if it does not make more sales this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profit during the first quarter at Boeing's military
aircraft and missiles division, which makes the F-15 and the B-2
bomber, rose 28 percent, to $322 million, while revenue was flat at
$3 billion. Revenue at the space and communications group fell
slightly, to $1.5 billion, but operating profit grew to $61 million
from $44 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Wednesday, Condit spoke at a meeting of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/Push Coalition in Chicago and announced
that two African-American-owned investment firms had each been
given $200 million of Boeing pension fund assets to manage. That
brings to $2 billion the portion of Boeing's $20 billion in
actively managed funds that are invested with firms owned by
minorities or women.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has also been urging Boeing to hire more minority-owned
subcontractors and place more minorities on its board of directors.

GILLETTE FLAT, BUT RECOVERY SEEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- The ``rolling thunder'' of world financial crises kept
Gillette Co. earnings flat in the first quarter, but the world's
largest maker of razors and blades said Thursday the company is
poised for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market conditions abroad are improving, starting with several
Asian countries,'' Alfred M. Zeien, Gillette's retiring chairman,
said at the company's annual meeting Thursday. ``We expect further
progress in other international markets as the year unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Net income at the maker of Duracell batteries, Papermate pens,
Braun appliances, and other consumer goods rose to $269 million, or
24 cents a share, from $268 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette said April 5 it would earn about 24 cents, a penny less
than analysts estimated for the quarter, and that first-half profit
would be less than expected because of weak sales in Brazil and
slower-than-expected Braun sales worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which generates about two-thirds of its revenue
from outside the United States, has warned about earnings two of
the past three quarters because of slow international sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company, no matter how powerful, is immune from problems in
a big part of the world, or for that matter, in its own product
line from time to time,'' Fredric Russell, of Fredric E. Russell
Investment Management Co., which owns Gillette shares, told
Bloomberg News. ``To believe otherwise is not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette told analysts it expects to earn about 29 cents a share
in the second quarter and $1.36 for the year. Analysts said they
expect Gillette to earn 32 cents in the quarter and $1.37 for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, Zeien officially turned over leadership
of the company to Michael C. Hawley, Gillette's former president
and a 36-year veteran of the company. Hawley, 61, a Boston College
graduate, is one of the company's most experienced global managers,
having lived and worked on five continents.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien, 68, who helped launch the spectacularly successful Mach3
razor and engineered the acquisition of the Duracell battery
company, said some have questioned why he would step down while
Gillette's earnings are still flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Measure me not by what has been accomplished but by how much
the prospects for the future have been enhanced,'' he said. ``I'll
lose no sleep over my investments in Gillette in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Zeien will remain on Gillette's board after eight years at the
company's top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see you next year,'' he said. ``I'll be with you in the
audience.''

STRAWBERRY'S CAREER ON THE LINE AGAIN AMID LATEST CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trouble seems to follow Darryl Strawberry, no matter where he
goes. The Yankee outfielder has been charged with possession of
cocaine and soliciting a prostitute in Tampa, Fla., and if
convicted could see his turbulent career be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tampa police, Strawberry's latest incident involves
an offer of $50 for sex to a female undercover officer. He was
arrested Wednesday night arrest a few miles from the Yankees
training complex, and a police search turned 0.3 grams of powder
cocaine wrapped in a $20 bill. He was booked and then released on
$6,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   That Strawberry would even risk such an incident is a jolt to
those who followed his long career. He was only in Tampa to work
himself back into shape following colon cancer surgery last Oct. 3.
The Yankees had already agreed to pay him $2.5 million for this
season, and sources say team officials are upset by the news. The
police report said Strawberry was carrying about $1,159.10 in cash
at the time he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine possession is a third-degree felony with a maximum
penalty of five years in prison, according to Florida Assistant
State Attorney Pam Bondi. The maximum penalty for solicitation, a
misdemeanor, is 60 days in the county jail for a first offense.
After that, the maximum penalty is a year in the county jail, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry admitted talking with the undercover officer and
suggested that he was only kidding when he agreed to meet her
across the street near the intersection of Dale Mabry and Kennedy
Avenue, an area known for night clubs and strip joints. Instead,
according to a police statement, Strawerry told them his plan was
to get into his car and drive away. Police stopped the car almost
immediately and he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said he had been a victim of circumstance. He told
police that his wife's uncle, Rodney Simon, used the vehicle the
previous night and that it was possible he might have left the
folded $20 bill in the glove compartment where Strawberry found it
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Police Sgt. Marc J. Hamlin said Strawberry continually
apologized and was very remorseful for what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked several times if there was anything that we could do
to change this situation, because this was going to ruin his
career,'' Hamlin said. Strawberry still insists that the cocaine
did not belong to him and that he never intended to have sex with
the undercover officer, according to the police report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a waiting situation. I just want to wait until all
the facts come in,'' said general manager Brian Cashman, who said
the team had ``reached out'' to Strawberry but did not go into
details.
</P>
<P>
   Interim manager Don Zimmer said any decisions will be made by
owner George Steinbrenner, who made the decision to sign Strawberry
in June 1995. Steinbrenner is is Cleveland and could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a mistake,'' Zimmer said. ``This guy has done some
great things for this club in 2 1/2 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last weekend Strawberry was in New York to receive his
World Series ring. He was not expected to join the Yankees until he
completed chemotherapy and a stint with Triple A Columbus. After
the Yankees won the Series, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani praised
Strawberry ``for the comeback he's made as a baseball player and
the comeback he's making in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's track record includes a long list of problems with
substance abuse. In 1990, while playing with the New York Mets, he
entered the Smithers Center in New York for alcohol rehabilitation.
Major league baseball suspended him for 60 days in 1995 after he
tested positive for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Strawberry also ran afoul of tax laws. A federal court
ordered him to repay $350,000 in back taxes and sentenced him to
six months of home confinement, except for games. He rebounded
after signing with the Yankees in June 1995 and had remained drug
free, with regular testing by major league baseball. Strawberry had
his best season in seven years in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Yankees support Strawberry remains to be seen.
Because of complicated rules involving baseball's luxury tax, they
shifted him to a minor league roster during the offseason, fearing
he would not be healthy enough to play by opening day. Now it's
anybody's guess if he will return.

COURT DECIDES GIRL DESERVES NEW TRIAL IN TODDLER'S DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
 KILLER-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lacresha Murray, a 14-year-old girl confined for
three years after being convicted in the stomping death of a
toddler, was improperly interrogated by police and deserves a new
trial, an appellate court panel ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The court said juries in her two trials heard enough evidence to
convict her, but should not have been given the girl's
incriminating taped statement.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's conviction produced numerous protests and news media
investigations that supported Murray's claims of innocence in the
1996 death of 2-year-old Jayla Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Her defenders _ some saying Murray was a victim of prejudice
against African-Americans _ claimed she was convicted despite
insufficient evidence and misconduct by police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Travis County prosecutors said they are considering
trying her a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do justice for Jayla Belton,'' said prosecutor
Rosemary Lehmberg, adding that the victim's family would be
consulted before a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the youngest Texan ever charged with capital murder, was
convicted twice by juries. Though they acquitted Murray on the
capital murder charge, the first jury found her guilty of
criminally negligent homicide and injury to a child. Later, the
trial judge declared on his own motion that ``justice was not
served'' by the verdicts, in part because of ineffective counsel,
and ordered a second juvenile court trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the retrial, Murray was found guilty only of injury to a
child and was ordered into state custody for 25 years. She's
currently housed at a Texas Youth Commission facility at Corsicana,
but if her conviction were upheld, she could be transferred to
state prison upon reaching age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Murray may be required to remain in state custody
unless all charges are dropped, but Lehmberg said a hearing is
likely to be held to determine whether and where she will be
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors could challenge the 3rd Court of Appeals' ruling in
the Texas Supreme Court; they could accept the ruling and bring new
charges, or drop them altogether. Lehmberg said a decision could
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court held that the judge in her second trial should
not have allowed jurors to hear the taped statements Murray made to
police five days after the toddler's death, while she was being
housed at the Child Advocacy Center in Round Rock, an Austin
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who was adopted and raised by her grandparents, had been
removed from their home two days after the child's death from
multiple injuries. Testimony indicated the victim, who was baby-sat
by the grandparents and Murray's older sibling, had 30 bruises and
four broken ribs and died after being stomped so hard that her
liver was severed when it was compressed against the spine. A shoe
imprint left on the baby could have come from a shoe Murray wore
that day, experts claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the death, Murray was removed from her
grandparents' home to the Child Advocacy Center, ostensibly because
police feared she was in danger if left at home. But three days
later, as family members were interviewed, police turned their
attention to Murray as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A key question before the appeals court was whether Murray truly
was ``in custody'' at the shelter, which would have implied that
she had various constitutional protections during interrogation and
rights against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with two Austin police detectives, Murray
did not admit killing the child but said she may have dropped or
kicked her. The appeals court said the officers may have scared
Murray by telling her they had ``talked to everyone in (her) family
already and ... cleared everybody;'' that there was ``nobody left
except'' her as a suspect and they were ``not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not free to leave,'' the appellate opinion stated,
adding that Murray's ``protective shelter became a place of
isolation. ... The shelter neither notified (Murray's) grandparents
of the scheduled interview nor provided (her) with a guardian, a
parental representative or even an employee of the shelter for the
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling further stated that ``all adults present, including
the victim-services counselor, represented the interests of the
state, not (Murray).''
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, and taking into account U.S. Supreme
Court rulings that require extra care in considering a child's
self-incriminating statements, the Austin appeals court said
Murray's admissions were inadmissible _ even though she was given a
Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not, however, told that she was free to leave the
interview room or the children's shelter and she was never told she
could call her grandparents or any other friendly adult,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeal sought to have the conviction thrown out due to
insufficient evidence, but that complaint was not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support
the jury's finding that (Murray) intentionally and knowingly
inflicted injury upon Jayla that produced a substantial risk of
death,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   But some national media organizations that answered the Murray
family's pleas for further investigations concluded that the girl
was railroaded. Both CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' and New York Times
columnist Bob Herbert sided with Murray's defenders, who waged a
``Free Lecresha'' campaign at monthly meetings, marches and
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders contend the child was chronically abused by her
own family and died of injuries sustained before she arrived at the
Murrays' home for day care.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of Murray's case, it prompted numerous
pending bills in the Legislature to clarify rules governing police
interrogation of children.

PITINO `TAKEN ABACK' BY FANS' IMPATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Rick Pitino and Antoine Walker chatted Thursday about
the same things they talked about in a similar conversation last
week: losing, frustration, booing, staying positive, staying in
shape, staying with the program, staying with the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he still finds it incredible that fans would boo
Walker for missing a foul-line jumper -- which happened Wednesday
night against the Hawks -- which any player would have taken. He
said Walker's feelings were hurt. He did admit, however, that he
has been a bit surprised by the reaction of the fans, not those who
are just booing Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned something this year,'' Pitino said after a
practice at Healthpoint in Waltham. ``I never thought the fans
would be this impatient. I'm kind of taken aback by it, because it
was a lockout and we said all along that the third and fourth year
is when we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said he could understand fans booing Walker if Walker
were a ``seasoned, veteran, All-Star.'' (Walker this past summer
called himself a ``veteran All-Star'' in explaining why he didn't
come to a voluntary workout.) But, he said, his captain is anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy in the league in his third year
(who has) not played a game in the playoffs,'' Pitino said. ``He
may make a lot of money; that's the system. But he's still a young
basketball player with an awful lot to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, meanwhile, said he has no plans to go anywhere else,
play anywhere else, or be anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to lose a tough game,'' Walker said, referring
to Wednesday's 77-70 sobering defeat to the Hawks. ``It's another
thing to have the fans react the way they reacted (when) you know,
as an individual, you're working hard and trying to do whatever it
takes to help this team win and it feels like it's not appreciated
to a certain degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I basically said that maybe I'm not the player that
they want. Maybe they feel there's someone out there who can do
something to please them.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he feel that he got a lot off his chest after the Atlanta
game, where he talked about being uncomfortable, both in his new
role on the floor (Pitino didn't buy that spin) and in his
recurring role as human bulls-eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said what I had to say about the fans,'' Walker said. ``I
want to be a Celtic. I like the guys I play with. I enjoy playing
for coach. This has been a good place for me to be successful. But
you have to look at both sides. We're having a rough year. It
hasn't been a consistent year for me or for the team. . . . If I'm
not taking the shots they want, I guess it's all about what pleases
them instead of what happens with the team. Sometimes, it gets a
little bit out of control, when a person takes one shot and I guess
if it doesn't go in, or to their statisfaction, you choose to boo.
Obviously, you have to play to their standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker again said that players were still trying to figure out
their roles -- ``everyone's trying to find their role'' -- which
Pitino promptly shot down as ``frustration over a loss. That's all
it is.'' Walker also zeroed in on the coach in the matter of player
procurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get better,'' he said. ``We can't continue to win
and be a playoff team year in and year out bringing five, six new
guys in every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Pitino said he liked the deals that brought in
Tony Battie and Vitaly Potapenko, didn't like some others (he
didn't elaborate there) and said any moves would be determined by
the availability of players and the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do something, it has to better,'' he said. ``It can't
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walker went 3-for-12 against the Hawks. He has shot 33 percent
or worse from the field in nine games this season. Boston is 1-8 in
those games, the only win coming over Washington last week when
Walker was 5-of-16 . . . Pitino said Kenny Anderson, who is
sidelined by a partially torn right hamstring, should be back
before the end of the season. He also said he liked what he say
from newcomer Damon Jones in the rookie's first day of practice
with the team. . . Walter McCarty didn't practice and is iffy with
a groin strain. McCarty launched one of the season's major boulders
against Atlanta on Wednesday, a three-pointer which never had a
chance. ``We're on the bench,'' Pitino said, ``and we're saying,
`did somebody hit that? It's like Florida State. Wide left. Wide
right.'' . . . Ron Mercer has been a minutes monger in the last
several games, going 41 or more minutes in the last five games. In
the last three, he has gone 45, 46 and 46. He must have that
Havlicekian body because he never looks tired.

CLINTON SAYS ACCIDENTAL KILLING OF CIVILIANS REGRETTABLE BUT
INEVITABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton said Thursday that the
accidental bombing and killing of dozens of Albanian civilians
Wednesday was regrettable but an inevitable result of modern
warfare and would not undermine his resolve to use American
military might to end the years of Balkan atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is regrettable; it is also inevitable,'' the president
said of the bombing, adding that the unidentified NATO pilot who
dropped the bomb thought he was hitting a military convoy. Despite
such ``errors,'' he vowed to continue the bombing campaign until
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia stopped terrorizing and
killing ethnic Albanians and driving them en masse from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the requirement is that nothing like this can ever happen,
then we're saying it's OK with us if Milosevic displaces over a
million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon thousands of
them,'' he said in response to a question at a convention here of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   His purpose was to begin to outline the future of a post-war
Kosovo as part of modern Europe, but the question about the NATO
killing of civilians _ the third episode of accidental deaths to
which the western alliance has admitted since the March 24 start of
the war _ seemed to provoke a defensive reaction in the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a business of perfection,'' Clinton asserted,
beginning to bristle with indignation. ``It should be obvious to
everybody in the world that we are bending over backwards to hit
military targets, to hit security targets, even to hit a lot of
targets late at night where the losses in human life will be
minimized.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to insist that civilian deaths were a cost of war,
and of future credibility. ``If anyone thinks that this is a reason
for changing our mission,'' he said, ``then the United States will
never be able to bring military power to bear again, because there
is no such thing as flying airplanes this fast, dropping weapons
this powerful, dealing with an enemy this pervasive who is willing
to use people as human shields, and never have this sort of tragic
thing happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not detail exactly what intelligence reports
might suggest is happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian deaths dominated the day's news, but the president
was trying for the first time since the NATO bombing began to
describe his vision of where Kosovo should be headed. He called on
the western alliance to ``follow the example of the World War II
generation'' and first stand up to Serbian aggression, then help
rebuild the region. Involvement, he said, was not just a moral
imperative but a strategic imperative.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, he said, is over who will define the future of
this part of the world. ``Who will provide the model for how the
people who have emerged from Communism resolve their own legitimate
problems?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Kosovars understandably want independence but that
he thought this was not the best course. ``Kosovo lacks the
resources and infrastructure to be viable on its own,'' he said.
``Moreover, Yugoslavia's long-suffering neighbors fear that an
independent Kosovo would be unstable'' and that instability would
be contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Redrawing the Yugoslav borders based on ethnicity, as some have
proposed, is too complex, he said, and would only create more
problems. ``I believe the last thing we need in the Balkans is
greater Balkanization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution'' for the Balkan nations, he said, ``is not
the endless re-jiggering of their borders but greater integration
into a Europe in which sovereignty matters but in which borders are
becoming more and more open, and less important in a negative
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested the western alliance follow something like the
Marshall Plan after World War II for the Balkans _ ``help its
people build a region of multiethnic democracies, a community that
upholds standards of human rights, a community in which borders are
open to people in trade, where nations cooperate to make war
unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   And he argued that in the late 20th century, the United States
was not seeking territorial gains as it moved toward more
interventions in Haiti, Bosnia and Somalia. Instead, it sought
peace and security, he said, and in the case of Kosovo, embraced
concerns about what all of Europe would look like in 10 to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   The President is also resuming his activities as
fund-raiser-in-chief. Shortly after the Kosovo conflict began, he
canceled a fund-raising trip to California. But the administration
is anxious to show a president who is in control of his agenda and
has not been driven into a siege mentality by a difficult war with
unforeseen consequences. He heads from here to Detroit and Boston,
where he is to participate in fund-raising events.

EL-AMIN TO SERVE DAY OF SERVICE IN MARIJUANA CASE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The national championship trophy is still in Storrs. The parade
honoring the University of Connecticut men's basketball team will
still be held in Hartford Saturday. And Khalid El-Amin will be
there as well.
</P>
<P>
   All of that became official Thursday after the sophomore point
guard pleaded guilty to a conditional misdemeanor offense of
possession of a small amount of marijuana and received a reprimand
from a Hartford Community Court judge. El-Amin was sentenced to one
day of community service and ordered to speak to Hartford
schoolchildren about the dangers of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gross error of judgment,'' said El-Amin in a press
conference at UConn's Gampel Pavilion, the scene of so many more
happier events in his career with the Huskies. ``I have earned the
respect of this school and I want the chance to prove myself to all
the people who have supported me. I am very sorry for this
incident. It will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference ended a hectic and emotional day for
El-Amin, who was arrested in Hartford Tuesday after he ran a red
light. When police conducted a pat-down search, they uncovered a
dime bag of marijuna less than four ounces and placed El-Amin under
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Richard Hamilton, who was in the car with El-Amin, was
not charged.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of bargaining, El-Amin appeared Thursday before
Judge Raymond Norko, who offered a lecture as well as a sentence of
community service.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to El-Amin's statement of ``We shocked the world''
after the Huskies' 77-74 win over Duke for the national
championship, Norko told El-Amin, ``The epilogue to that is `I
disappointed the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is aware of who you are, where you are from, and
what you have done,'' Norko said.
</P>
<P>
   If El-Amin performs six hours of community service by next
Wednesday, Norko said, the charge will be expunged from his record.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, El-Amin returned to the UConn campus and held
a press conference, where he admitted his mistake and said it
wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   With his teammates and UConn coach Jim Calhoun in attendance,
El-Amin said he would be part of the parade in Hartford honoring
the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun said life would continue and El-Amin would be part of a
team that had two marvelous weeks, followed by a
less-than-marvelous week. Although he said he hadn't decided
whether to discipline El-Amin, Calhoun said the guard remains an
``asset to the program and to the university.''

FAKE WEB POSTING LEADS TO FRAUD CHARGE

<P>
   A 25-year-old computer engineer employed by Pairgain
Technologies Inc. was arrested Thursday in North Carolina and
charged with securities fraud in connection with the posting of a
fake announcement on the Internet last week about a takeover of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The swift tracing of the suspected origin of the Internet
posting, which sent Pairgain's stock up more than 30 percent in
heavy trading before the false takeover report was debunked,
demonstrates once again how difficult it is to venture into
cyberspace without leaving footprints.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Dale Hoke, who has worked at Pairgain's engineering
development operation in Raleigh, N.C., since January 1997, was
arrested at his home in Raleigh on Thursday morning on federal
securities-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   After an appearance before a federal magistrate in North
Carolina, he was released on a $50,000 unsecured bond. He agreed to
appear at a future date in court in Los Angeles, where the charges
were filed against him late Wednesday. Pairgain, a
telecommunications equipment maker, is based in Tustin, Calif.,
southeast of Los Angeles in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Currin, an attorney representing Hoke, declined to
comment on the veracity of the charges. ``Obviously these are very
serious allegations, and we're going to look very carefully at
them,'' Currin said. Hoke could not be reached. Securities fraud
carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $1 million
fine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal complaint, Hoke used an account at
Angelfire, a service that allows people to create their own pages
on the World Wide Web, to post a fake news article on April 7
reporting that Pairgain had agreed to be taken over by ECI Telecom
Ltd., an Israeli company.
</P>
<P>
   After posting the fake article, which was designed to look like
a page from the Web site of Bloomberg News, Hoke placed a message
on an investment bulletin board operated by Yahoo alerting other
investors to the ``news'' and providing an electronic link to the
Angelfire site.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint does not specifically contend that Hoke traded in
Pairgain stock on April 7, when the false article caused the
company's shares to soar as high as $11.125, up from $8.50 the
previous day. The shares closed that day at $9.375, up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles by Craig Shackleford, a special agent of the FBI, Hoke has
used online brokerage accounts at E(ASTERISK)Trade and Ameritrade
to buy and sell stocks, trading in Pairgain shares as recently as
January.
</P>
<P>
   The Angelfire and Yahoo accounts used by Hoke employed fake
identities, according to the affidavit. But investigators were able
to trace Hoke's activities via the Internet protocol addresses of
the computers used to create and post the Angelfire and Yahoo
messages, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Every computer linked to the Internet can be identified through
a unique code known as an Internet protocol address, which can be
used to trace the origin of a message or connection.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Hoke used computers at Pairgain, at his home
and at Accipiter Inc., a Raleigh, N.C., company where Hoke also
worked, to gain access to the Angelfire and Yahoo accounts and post
the Internet messages.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McBrayer, Pairgain's chief financial officer, said in an
interview that Hoke was ``a midlevel engineer'' in the Raleigh
facility, which employs about 70 people and is Pairgain's largest
operation outside Tustin. He has been suspended without pay,
McBrayer said.
</P>
<P>
   As a midlevel engineer, Hoke would have had ``a modest amount''
of Pairgain stock options, McBrayer said. But he said he was not
aware whether Hoke had exercised any options.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``To our knowledge, he is the only one involved'' in the fraud,
McBrayer said. Christopher Painter, an assistant U.S. attorney in
Los Angeles, said federal officials were still investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The case demonstrates that some Internet sites are subject to
abuse by people posing under false identities, in part because the
sites do little to police who is setting up accounts. The Angelfire
account used by Hoke, for example, was set up under the name ``News
Headlines,'' an unlikely name for an individual. An e-mail account
set up with Hotmail, a free e-mail provider, used the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The message posted on the Yahoo bulletin board supposedly came
from Stacey Lawson of Knoxville, Tenn., who in signing up for the
Yahoo account claimed to be a 32-year-old information technology
manager who liked tennis, dancing and water sports. In fact, the
complaint said, that, too, was Hoke.

 &HT;    Delta soars to quarterly profit gain
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines posted a 10.8 percent gain in
quarterly profits, aided by low fuel prices and a February pilot
sickout at American Airlines that forced cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta posted net income of $216 million, or $1.42
a share, for its third quarter ended in March, compared with $195
million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. Operating profit margin
rose to 10.2 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat First Call's consensus estimate of $1.29.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $3.5 billion from $3.39 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Delta told analysts it gained $35 million in extra revenue as a
result of flight cancellations at American. Delta, as the
second-biggest carrier at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
American's biggest hub, handled many stranded American fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Two industrywide fare increases during the winter _ the first
since 1997 _ also helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any which way you slice the numbers, it looks like Delta
outperformed the industry in the March quarter,'' said PaineWebber
analyst Sam Buttrick. ``That's true even if you exclude the
American windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major airlines will report in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chief Executive Leo Mullin called the results ``solid''
and cited service improvement initiatives as one reason the carrier
has maintained its ridership and profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has now refurbished the interiors of 93 percent of its
planes, a Mullin priority when he arrived in 1997. It also has
boosted its on-time standing and improved answering speed 44
percent on reservations lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made great strides in a short period of time, but we
recognize the need to do more,'' Mullin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent uptick in crude oil prices, low jet fuel prices
continued to lift Delta's bottom line. The carrier paid 48.5 cents
a gallon in the quarter, down from 53.17 cents a year earlier, for
a total of $316 million vs. $342 million in fuel costs. That
occurred despite slightly higher consumption.
</P>
<P>
   For the nine months ended March 31, Delta had profits of $737
million, or $4.80 a share, compared with $639 million, or $4.06 a
share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $10.75 billion, up from $10.38 billion.

 &HT;    Freaknik: On the `In' or `Out' list?
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Over the next three days, Atlanta will learn whether
Freaknik is still the place to be for black college students on
spring break, or if the rolling street party is slowly running out
of gas.
</P>
<P>
   The first trickle of Freaknik revelers usually can be seen
downtown on the Thursday before the three-day party. But there were
few partyers visible Thursday, though T-shirt vendors were waiting
for the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Freaknik has declined the past few years,
particularly as the event, formally known as Black College Spring
Break, has faced competition for students from beach towns such as
Daytona Beach, Fla., which had its Black College Reunion last
weekend, and Galveston, Texas, which is hosting Kappa Beach
Weekend, also beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   And though no one is certain how many people are coming for
Freaknik, preparations were being made for large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   All 1,500 sworn Atlanta police officers will be on duty working
12-hour shifts during the weekend. Barricades were set up by public
works crews Thursday along Peachtree Street downtown.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County police also plan to be out in force and announced
a ``zero tolerance'' policy for traffic infractions and other
violations that have marked past Freakniks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday is known as `shakedown day,''' said Atlanta police
Lt. Larry Gilbert, assistant commander of the Zone 5 precinct,
which comprises downtown and Midtown. ``It's the day when we ask
ourselves, 'Do we have everything in place? Do all the officers
have their assignments and are all the barricades up?'''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Ambassador Force will have all 51 of its pith-helmeted
employees on the streets, said Wayne Mock, the agency's public
safety manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to plan for a big crowd,'' Mock said. ``If you plan
for a small one and it goes big, then your program doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Force employees will use 15,000 garbage bags donated
by Home Depot to help clean up the streets, Mock said. They also
have direct radio communications with police and will help keep an
eye out for potential trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Brown, working at the African Pride cart in Underground
Atlanta, said she's sold Freaknik T-shirts over the past few days,
but none to college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they're too old or too young,'' Brown said of her
customers. Still, she expects people to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as much as previous years, because it's not as fun as it
was before, but there's people who haven't been yet and they're
curious about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William Nettles, 22, of Stone Mountain said Freaknik is no
longer entertaining, due to a heavy police presence and too much
control over traffic. He also said the event has been plagued by
troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the people who come from out of town who cause
problems, it's people who live here who don't know how to act,''
said Nettles, who attended Freakniks as a student. ``A few rowdy
people can ruin a good time for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The only college students on downtown streets Thursday were from
Georgia State University, and most people downtown live or work
there.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown resident Vince Avinger, 31, was walking his pug,
Jackie, in Woodruff Park. Avinger, a travel agent, said he planned
a trip to New York to avoid Freaknik traffic and noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from previous year's experience, I know it's going to be
a mess,'' he said.

 &HT;    Jackson promoting economic, ballot action
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson will begin a week-long
journey through Mississippi on Saturday to register voters and
promote improved economic security in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these last years we've seen tremendous growth and
prosperity for the wealthy, but in the middle class, there is a
lingering insecurity,'' Jackson said. ``The rural South has been
left behind in areas of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has run for president more than once, says he is
not planning to make a bid in the 2000 elections. Instead, he is
focusing on a campaign to empower the working class, a campaign the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. would have begun had he not been
assassinated in 1968. Beginning in Memphis at the Lorraine Motel,
where King was shot, Jackson will proceed to Mississippi and visit
towns all over the state, including Holly Springs, Jackson and
Philadelphia, where three civil rights workers were murdered in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in a telephone news conference, took some swipes at
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), saying that by
registering voters he would give Mississippians the chance to vote
for new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi has the No. 1 senator and is No. 1 in infant
mortality and No. 50 in public education,'' Jackson said. ``The
South remains the region of the richest soil and the poorest
people. Organizing workers is a key for uplifting the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did not talk about labor unions, although the South's
workers are much less likely to be in unions than workers from
other parts of the country. Instead he said the government should
create incentives for investments in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a bridge from Wall Street and Silicon Valley
to Appalachia and the Delta,'' he said. He plans to travel through
Appalachia as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his latest campaign is for blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment for whites and blacks in the South to
come together on a shared economic agenda,'' he said. ``They
couldn't come together on ending slavery, or ending segregation, or
the right to vote, but this is the moment.

 &HT;    Bill by Georgia lawmaker would ban public-lands clearcutting
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has introduced another bill
in Congress to halt commercial logging in national forests _ her
second attempt in as many years to stop timber sales on public
land.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure introduced by McKinney (D-Ga.) and U.S. Rep.
Jim Leach (R-Iowa) last year did not make it out of committee. The
new legislation introduced this week has 46 co-sponsors and is
expected to get considerable more attention from legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forests provide outstanding recreational, educational,
scientific, commercial and spiritual opportunities to all
Americans,'' McKinney said. ``We must, as a nation, do everything
within our power to defend the integrity of the forests.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney and several environmental groups contend that logging _
and especially the practice of clearcutting _ severely damages the
forests, causing erosion and sedimentation, water pollution and
destruction of wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club was among several groups praising the bill.
``Our national forests are places where families canoe and hike,
where old friends fish and hunt,'' said Chuck McGrady, the club's
president. ``But it's not much fun hiking in a forest that's been
clearcut, canoeing in a stream clogged with silt or hunting in a
forest that's lost its wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said her bill, known as the National Forest Protection
and Restoration Act, will save money for the nation while
protecting the forests. A General Accounting Office report last
year said the nation lost about $2 billion between 1992 and 1997
through the subsidization of timber sales in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Not all environmental groups support the legislation. Several
groups say the no-commercial-logging concept is too radical for
most Americans. The issue threatens to divide environmentalists in
their 20-year-old effort to get the government to preserve more
wilderness areas within 155 national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Timber companies also lashed out at the legislation. ``We are,
of course, opposed to it,'' said Deborah Baker of the Southern
Timber Council in Atlanta, which represents several logging
companies. ``We believe there should be a balanced approach to
managing our national forests; this bill does not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, there are 30 federal forests covering 13 million
acres. Almost two-thirds of that acreage are open to logging.

 &HT;    Vidalia arrest site stuns INS officials
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four juveniles were among 27 illegal aliens from
Mexico arrested in Vidalia this week in housing so squalid that
even veteran immigration officials were shocked. The illegal aliens
were among thousands of workers pouring into Georgia as this year's
harvest of famed Vidalia onions begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the boys was only 14,'' said Thomas Fischer, district
director of the Immigration and Nationalization Service in Atlanta.
``He and the others were waiting to go out into the onion fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said illegal labor contractors, called coyotes, smuggle
undocumented workers and children into the country and then exploit
them with low pay and wretched housing. They are no better than
slave traders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyotes are the lowest form of life in the United States,''
Fischer said. ``They profit from the movement of illegal workers
and treat them like slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Szafnicki, Fischer's head investigator, said conditions
were ``awful'' in the three Vidalia houses where the arrests took
place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was a part of the agency's ongoing investigation of
illegal labor in the onion fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of urine was so strong that I had to go out every 10
minutes for a breath of fresh air,'' he said. ``There were roaches
everywhere and exposed wiring. Exploitation like that is just
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The aliens will be deported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest of the Vidalia onion crop, worth up to $90 million,
has just begun and should be in full swing in about two weeks. An
estimated 4,000 to 5,000 temporary workers are needed for the six-
to eight-week-long harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, few Vidalia growers have hired temporary foreign
help through legal channels; instead, they use bilingual labor
contractors who frequently supply them with undocumented labor.
</P>
<P>
   But because of INS raids on the onion fields last year, which
caused thousands of legal and illegal workers to abandon the
harvest and leave onions rotting in the fields, many more farmers
are following federal hiring guidelines than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 1,000 employees this year are coming in under the
H2-A temporary agricultural program,'' Fischer said. ``Last year,
there were only 50, and the year before that, none.''
</P>

ANALYSIS: GOP SEIZES A TACTIC (AND ISSUE) FROM DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By tradition, it is the Democrats who speak of
protecting Social Security. But on Thursday the Republicans were
stealing their lines.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate, by a party-line vote of 54 to 44, gave final
approval on Thursday to a $1.7 trillion budget for the 2000 fiscal
year, Republicans took turns saying their spending plan, as Sen.
Larry Craig of Idaho put it, would ``safeguard the current Social
Security system for today's seniors and those who retire in the
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate was only the latest example of a trend on Capitol
Hill, in which legislating has become a kind of political chess
match with each party trying to counter the other. With a fierce
struggle under way for control of Congress in 2000, the two
political parties these days spend more time trying to pre-empt and
neutralize their rivals' most popular positions, than they do in
staking out their ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, Democrats raced to vote in favor of a missile
defense system, a Republican staple since former President Ronald
Reagan first envisioned it. The Democrats hoped their vote would
allow them to focus on domestic issues, where they have an edge.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans no longer speak of abolishing the Education
Department. Aware that the Democrats have an edge with the public
on that issue, they have changed direction and put forward their
own education bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should bring an anti-trust case,'' joked Stephen
Moore, a conservative economist who has been arguing that the
Republicans should be sharpening their differences with the
Democrats. ``They're basically colluding.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this kind of politics say that it shrinks public
policy choices and that is more about campaign tactics than about
legislating. ``The interest in positioning and getting a leg up in
the next election seems to predominate,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the
president of Democracy 21, a public policy group.
</P>
<P>
   By embracing Social Security, the Republicans are stealing a
page from President Clinton, who pioneered such tactics four years
ago. In the summer of 1995, Clinton surprised Republicans and many
members of his own party by saying he would support a balanced
budget.
</P>
<P>
   His stance, which at the time was a heresy for a Democrat,
deprived the Republicans of one of their most potent issues: fiscal
responsibility. It also narrowed the fiscal debate so that Clinton
and the Republicans were left battling not over whether to balance
the budget, but over how to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
   That was a fight the Democrats were able to win, by vowing to
protect education, the environment, Medicare and Medicaid. The
theme helped re-elect Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an age of government surpluses, it is the Republicans
who are trying to narrow the debate and shift it on to terrain they
consider more favorable to their party.
</P>
<P>
   Poll after poll has indicated that when it comes to Social
Security, the public trusts Democrats more than Republicans. Polls
also show that when the voters are asked how they want to use the
federal surplus, they prefer to have it dedicated to Social
Security or to debt relief rather than to tax-cutting. But
Republicans still consider tax cuts their issue.
</P>
<P>
   So to make tax cuts palatable, the Republicans have set out to
neutralize the Social Security issue. The budget they passed on
Thursday would wall off the $1.8 trillion in Social Security taxes
that the government will collect across the next decade so that the
money could be used only to reduce the national debt or else
overhaul the Social Security and Medicare systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, successive Congresses and administrations routinely
spent Social Security money and used it to mask the true size of
the federal deficit. And even now the Social Security funds account
for much of the federal surpluses projected for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican stand on Social Security has left the two parties
fighting not over how to use the entire budget surplus _ but only
over how to use the portion of the surplus that remains after
Social Security funds are walled off. And the Republicans are
betting that voters would like to see this money dedicated to tax
cuts, not other domestic programs. So their budget also offers tax
cuts, which begin modestly but grow to $800 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans say, `Don't grow government, give it back to the
taxpayers,''' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., who is chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived of Social Security as an issue, the Democrats have
rebounded by accusing Republicans of jeopardizing the Medicare
program in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy. ``There is
nothing to extend solvency for Medicare, in spite of the fact that
families and everyone else are going to be very dramatically
affected by it in the future'' Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the Democratic leader said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the talk in both parties of protecting Social
Security and protecting Medicare, the likelihood is that Congress
will overhaul neither program. The sound-alike rhetoric obscures
the reality that the parties have sharp differences on how to
approach the two retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
   Take the example of Social Security. Clinton and the Democrats
essentially want to maintain the current system, while allowing the
government to invest a portion of the Social Security reserve in
the stock market in order to bolster the reserve. The president
would also create a new IRA-like savings program outside the Social
Security system to help lower- and middle-income people save for
their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, to a greater or lesser degree, want to
transform Social Security from a public program into a private
program, with Americans holding their own private retirement
accounts and making their own decisions _ within reason _ on how to
invest their retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting the political parties to bridge those
differences any time soon.

 &HT;    Weather Channel president is named
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a move that has surprised cable TV executives
nationwide, the Weather Channel on Thursday named the industry's
chief lobbyist as its new president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Decker Anstrom, who has served as the National Cable TV
Association's president for the past five years, will take over the
Atlanta-based Weather Channel on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Anstrom's appointment comes less than two months after the
surprise resignation of the channel's longtime leader, executive
Michael J. Eckert, 52. Eckert, who helped found the channel and ran
it for 14 years, stepped down at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his resignation, Eckert said the channel's next
president should understand where industry technology is heading
and how to make money from it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Weather Channel decided against an experienced
programmer or businessman for its new leader in naming Anstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Anstrom is a well-respected figure within the cable TV industry.
``His thorough knowledge of our industry and its future direction,
as well as his skills in strategic planning, will be tremendous
assets to the Weather Channel,'' said John O. ``Dubby'' Wynne, the
channel's chairman and president of its owner, Landmark
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the industry were puzzled by Anstrom's
appointment. He has never run a channel and has spent most of his
career with the NCTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very bright guy with lots of industry contacts,'' said
Kent Gibbons, news editor of industry trade magazine Multichannel
News. ``But he's a policy guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstrom, visiting Atlanta on Thursday, said his appointment was
a personal challenge and a great opportunity. ``Yes, this is my
first time as a programmer but, from the perspective of the NCTA,
I'm certainly not unfamiliar with the issues facing the Weather
Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Anstrom said that his strengths in strategic planning
would serve the channel right now.
</P>
<P>
   Anstrom's appointment comes at an important time for the Weather
Channel. Its core business remains providing weather information 24
hours a day to some 72 million cable households. But that is
increasingly not enough. Others are attempting to do the same thing
_ and do it on the Internet as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to take this value network and migrate it
into the digital age,'' said Anstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark Communications is a privately held diversified media
company based in Norfolk, Va. Landmark doesn't release financial
results. But some industry consultants such as Kagan &AMP;
Associations, which has studied the channel, have said it is highly
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weather Channel still pretty much has the category of
weather to itself,'' said Gibbons.

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY CASH IS A CHARMING EVENING OF MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Cash appears in the last few minutes of TNT's tribute to
him and his enormous body of work Sunday, singing ``Folsom Prison
Blues'' and leading guest performers in a chorus of ``I Walk the
Line.'' But as the concert was being taped on April 6 at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, producers of the two-hour
special weren't even sure if the man in black could perform.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurological disorder whose
symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. His energy
sapped, he hadn't performed on a stage in more than a year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Cash found the strength to put the perfect finish on a
perfectly charming evening of music. Billed as an ``All-Star
Tribute to Johnny Cash,'' this second concert in TNT's ``Masters
Series'' emphasizes the broad appeal Cash's music has had for four
decades and millions of fans. Defying labels the way Cash has
always defied convention, the guest list spans the genres: Brooks &AMP;
Dunn, Mary Chapin Carpenter, June Carter Cash, Sheryl Crow, Bob
Dylan, the Fairfield Four, Emmylou Harris, Chris Isaak, Wyclef
Jean, Kris Kristofferson, Lyle Lovett, Dave Matthews, the
Mavericks, Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen, Marty Stuart, U2 and
Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted with great dignity by Jon Voight, the special is a
tasteful, uncluttered reminder of how poor we'd be in a Cash-less
society.

COURT DECIDES GIRL DESERVES NEW TRIAL IN TODDLER'S DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (fixes slug and girl's name in 22nd graph ) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lacresha Murray, a 14-year-old girl confined for
three years after being convicted in the stomping death of a
toddler, was improperly interrogated by police and deserves a new
trial, an appellate court panel ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The court said juries in her two trials heard enough evidence to
convict her, but should not have been given the girl's
incriminating taped statement.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's conviction produced numerous protests and news media
investigations that supported Murray's claims of innocence in the
1996 death of 2-year-old Jayla Belton.
</P>
<P>
   Her defenders _ some saying Murray was a victim of prejudice
against African-Americans _ claimed she was convicted despite
insufficient evidence and misconduct by police and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Travis County prosecutors said they are considering
trying her a third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do justice for Jayla Belton,'' said prosecutor
Rosemary Lehmberg, adding that the victim's family would be
consulted before a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the youngest Texan ever charged with capital murder, was
convicted twice by juries. Though they acquitted Murray on the
capital murder charge, the first jury found her guilty of
criminally negligent homicide and injury to a child. Later, the
trial judge declared on his own motion that ``justice was not
served'' by the verdicts, in part because of ineffective counsel,
and ordered a second juvenile court trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the retrial, Murray was found guilty only of injury to a
child and was ordered into state custody for 25 years. She's
currently housed at a Texas Youth Commission facility at Corsicana,
but if her conviction were upheld, she could be transferred to
state prison upon reaching age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Murray may be required to remain in state custody
unless all charges are dropped, but Lehmberg said a hearing is
likely to be held to determine whether and where she will be
detained.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors could challenge the 3rd Court of Appeals' ruling in
the Texas Supreme Court; they could accept the ruling and bring new
charges, or drop them altogether. Lehmberg said a decision could
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court held that the judge in her second trial should
not have allowed jurors to hear the taped statements Murray made to
police five days after the toddler's death, while she was being
housed at the Child Advocacy Center in Round Rock, an Austin
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who was adopted and raised by her grandparents, had been
removed from their home two days after the child's death from
multiple injuries. Testimony indicated the victim, who was baby-sat
by the grandparents and Murray's older sibling, had 30 bruises and
four broken ribs and died after being stomped so hard that her
liver was severed when it was compressed against the spine. A shoe
imprint left on the baby could have come from a shoe Murray wore
that day, experts claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the death, Murray was removed from her
grandparents' home to the Child Advocacy Center, ostensibly because
police feared she was in danger if left at home. But three days
later, as family members were interviewed, police turned their
attention to Murray as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A key question before the appeals court was whether Murray truly
was ``in custody'' at the shelter, which would have implied that
she had various constitutional protections during interrogation and
rights against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with two Austin police detectives, Murray
did not admit killing the child but said she may have dropped or
kicked her. The appeals court said the officers may have scared
Murray by telling her they had ``talked to everyone in (her) family
already and ... cleared everybody;'' that there was ``nobody left
except'' her as a suspect and they were ``not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not free to leave,'' the appellate opinion stated,
adding that Murray's ``protective shelter became a place of
isolation. ... The shelter neither notified (Murray's) grandparents
of the scheduled interview nor provided (her) with a guardian, a
parental representative or even an employee of the shelter for the
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling further stated that ``all adults present, including
the victim-services counselor, represented the interests of the
state, not (Murray).''
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, and taking into account U.S. Supreme
Court rulings that require extra care in considering a child's
self-incriminating statements, the Austin appeals court said
Murray's admissions were inadmissible _ even though she was given a
Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not, however, told that she was free to leave the
interview room or the children's shelter and she was never told she
could call her grandparents or any other friendly adult,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Her appeal sought to have the conviction thrown out due to
insufficient evidence, but that complaint was not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support
the jury's finding that (Murray) intentionally and knowingly
inflicted injury upon Jayla that produced a substantial risk of
death,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   But some national media organizations that answered the Murray
family's pleas for further investigations concluded that the girl
was railroaded. Both CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' and New York Times
columnist Bob Herbert sided with Murray's defenders, who waged a
``Free Lacresha'' campaign at monthly meetings, marches and
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders contend the child was chronically abused by her
own family and died of injuries sustained before she arrived at the
Murrays' home for day care.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome of Murray's case, it prompted numerous
pending bills in the Legislature to clarify rules governing police
interrogation of children.

   EVERGLADES-SUGAR (Clewiston, Fla.) _ The sugar industry is at
the center of a political struggle over a $7.8-billion project to
restore the watery wilderness of the Everglades, one of the most
threatened ecosystems in the world. The cane fields, former
marshland drained by a huge flood-control system for South Florida
50 years ago, stand like a plug between the Everglades and their
water source, Lake Okeechobee. For years, environmentalists have
labored to push back the fields. But the sugar industry has grown
up as part of a transformed South Florida landscape. As a result,
the battle over the Everglades and the water it needs to regain
health is also about economics and power, agribusiness jobs and
growing cities.

   KUKES, Albania _ A fierce roar split the sky and awakened her
from an uneasy sleep. Before Ymer Qela knew what was happening when
she heard an explosion and tried desperately to protect herself,
covering her head with her hands and folding herself into the cab
of the crowded tractor on which she had been riding since Serbian
troops emptied her village six hours before.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the tiny 54-year-old woman was swallowed by black
smoke. Her hands and head felt like they had been licked by fire.
She looked for her husband, Faze, but he was already dead. Her
18-year-old daughter, Valentina, had been hit in the head and back
by jagged pieces of shrapnel. Her son Nezdet, 15, was bleeding from
angry cuts on his head and face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to escape Kosovo, and save our lives,''
Mrs. Qela said, still numb and heavily bandaged a day after the
bombing of a column of refugees on tractors along the road from
Djakovica to Prizren in southwestern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer's wife, and two dozen other refugees who were forced
from their homes at gunpoint by Serbian officials and interviewed
in four different groups Thursday, all detailed a range of
atrocities that occurred before and after the bombing, early
Wednesday afternoon, of the Kosovar civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees spoke of being bombed as they formed a miles-long
convoy fleeing Kosovo toward Albania, but, with a welter of
conflicting accounts from NATO, Washington, Serbia, and the
refugees themselves, it was not clear by whom, Serbs or NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, all of them were still living in their
homes throughout Kosovo. One group that came across the border
Wednesday night described the terror of being rounded up by Serbian
authorities and forced to leave their homes in half an hour early
that day, only to come under attack again as they fled on the main
road toward Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Weary and empty-eyed refugees in two other groups composed
mostly of women who came across the border early Thursday afternoon
described being forced off their tractors and used as human shields
to protect Serbian police who feared they might be bombed.
</P>
<P>
   And another group from a northern city who were herded on buses
and forced to leave Kosovo said, as they entered Albania late this
afternoon, that Serbian police forced them to stand beside the
burning remains of the tractors while they were taunted with: ``You
wanted NATO, and this is what you got.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of details offered by the refugees confirm the
accounts given by NATO officials who have accepted responsibility
for bombing, calling it an accident, there are puzzling
inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some refugees said they saw two jets, not one. Some saw only
one, and described it as dark colored. Some said the attack
occurred near a bridge on the highway somewhere near the town of
Krushne e Medje, roughly halfway between Djakovica and Prizren.
Others said they were heading toward Djakovica when the bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   And some said the jet circled over the column at least twice,
swooped down low, dropped two bombs and then circled again,
dropping two more, the last hitting the lead tractor. This is not
the normal pattern a NATO attack jet would follow in a daylight
raid.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also points on which every one of the refugees
agreed. It occured about one o'clock in the afternoon. The first
bombs dropped did not hit anything. And they all said that while
armored vehicles occassionally passed the convoy, no tanks were
close enough to the column to have confused the tractors with
military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing near Kukes has been the scene of almost
unimagineable misery since Yugoslavian paramilitary units began
driving Albanians out of Kosovo, but few refugees have been so
hollowed out by the experience as those, like Mrs. Qela, who saw
their diaspora turn into yet another nightmare, perhaps caused by
the same people who had were to have been their saviour.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO tried to save us, so NATO can't bomb us,'' she said. ``It
was the Serbs who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   People all through the dangerously overcrowded refugee camps
around this city were saying the same thing. Those who were still
streaming over the border crossing from Kosovo into Albania
Thursday afternoon said over and over that NATO allies could not
have dropped bombs on civilians riding on tractors, killing and
wounding an as yet undertermined number of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Even after NATO commanders acknowledged that an American F-16
pilot had mistakenly sent a missle thundering into what he believed
was a military truck, there was disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe NATO could bomb us,'' said Ajmon Ademja, 62,
as the tractor-pulled cart she was sitting started to roll across
the border into Albania Thursday. Her face had been ripped by
shrapnel fragments and her ears were covered in blood. ``We could
see it very big in the sky. NATO planes fly very high. This one was
not high at all.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders confirmed the F-16 was flying at 15,000 feet and
would not have been visible from the ground, as many refugees said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories are all consistent in that people say the column
was hit by some kind of bomb or shell,'' said Kris Torgeson, a
press officer with Doctors Without Borders who interviewed refugees
as they arrived at a Kukes camp.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included Mrs. Qela's husband, a 52-year-old farmer from
the village of Batusha, near Djacovica. She did not know exactly
what happened to him because shortly after the bombing Serb
authorities ordered the refugees to continue down the road.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to leave her daughter Valentina behind, not knowing
if she was being taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Three other people on the same crowded tractor and cart died,
including the driver, Ferat Bajrami, 35. His cousin, Nifa Bajrami,
40, was not able to talk about his death. She was too sad, she
said, suffering too much from the shrapnel that had torn across her
face and head, too confused by the events of a long day that had
started at 7 a.m. when Serbian police knocked on the door of her
home in the village of Koshura, near Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had been more or less regular until they came and
told us we had a half hour to get ready to leave,'' she said. She
gathered her family and with friends from the village and all 15
squeezed aboard her cousin Ferat's tractor and cart.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs forced themalong a route that took them to the main
highway from Djakovica to Prizren. Theirs was the second tractor in
line. Many others joined them, so many that when she turned her
head, she could not see to the end of the column.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb appears to have hit on or very near to the first
tractor. The blinding explosion blasted the second tractor with
searing metal and knocked the wheels off the cart it was hauling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small pieces of metal fell on my face,'' she said. She had a
bandage on her forehead and blood still on her blouse. As she spoke
she pulled at the taut skin on her face, already lined with obvious
suffering and the marks of a pain that she had never thought
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left the bodies,'' she said.

KUKES, Albania: she said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cime Nuraj, 44, also had trouble talking about the neighbors who
had been left behind. ``We walked through the dead bodies and the
injured people who had arms and legs blown off,'' she said. She
also say at least one body that was decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nuraj said she had a good view of the bombing from the
tractor-pulled cart she rode in was three behind the lead tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 40 of us on the tractor and cart, all family
or neighbors,'' she said. ``We saw only one war plane and it was
flying very low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any markings but some people told us you must
leave the tractors, they're bombing civilians','' Mrs. Nuraj said.
``He circled the column of tractors twice before he dropped the
first two bombs,'' she said, recalling they fell in the soft sand
at the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then about two or three minutes later he made another circle
around the tractors and dropped two more bombs,'' Mrs. Nuraj said.
One fell in front of the lead tractor and the other, she said, hit
it directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the explosion. There was lots of black smoke but
no fire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a day, Mrs. Nuraj and her husband Rexher
had to abandon their belongings. They left behind the damaged
tractor, and took with them just one bag filled with clothes _ by
now was everything in the world they owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if they had killed us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nhevahire Kajtazi, 22, who arrived at the camp in Kukes late
Wednesday night, said her family's tractor was near the head of the
column when the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could say anything because we were very, very scared,''
she said. ``But we heard someone say `The Serbs are bombing us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kajtazi recalled that bombs fell first on one side of the
road, then on the other. ``Another bomb fell on an Albanian
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one bomb _ she thought it was the third _ hit the lead
tractor, which she estimated was about 300 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were hurt. We saw people who were headless,
people without legs, people who couldn't move and who were wounded
very badly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, she counted eight people killed, ``and many, many who
were wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the day Thursday, more than 2,800 refugees
crossed the border near here into Albania. Among them were a number
of people who also told of being bombarded. However, their version
of what happened was somewhat different from the story told by
those who arrived last night because they said it occured on the
road leading to Djacokica, rather than leading away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Bjeshke and Emine Zyberi, cousins from Madanaj, a small village
near Djacokica, arrived at around 3 Thursday afternoon, said that
they were on a tractor when a low flying, black, jet swooped over
the column and started dropping bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going toward Djackovica when they shelled the first
tractor,'' Bjeshke Zyberi said. ``A Serb policeman halted our
tractor and told us to enter a bombed out house near the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They forced about 300 people into the house and 10 policemen,
who obviously were using us as a shield,'' Emine Zyberi said.
``There were many wounded people so the Serb police brought
equipment to help people and told us that NATO did this.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, among the last refugees to arrive before sunset, was
Arsije Beqiri, 20, who had been forced out of her house in
Mitrovica in northern Kosovo early Thursday morning and put on a
bus for Albania with her family and many other people from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   When the bus arrived at Kruchen E Madje at about 3 this
afternoon, it stopped just after crossing a bridge, which was
located near a railway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serb police came on board and told us to get out of the bus
right away,'' Ms. Beqiri said. What she saw on the right side of
the road horrified her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a line of tractors, on fire, with six or seven
people still inside them,'' she said. It was unlikely that, a day
after the attack occurred, the tractor could still have been
burning unless someone had deliberatelyattempted to keep them lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb police shouted to us `Where is the NATO now?''' Ms.
Beqiri said. ```This is how they help you.'''

CHINA SAYS IT'S OFFICIAL: ZHU'S VISIT TO U.S. WAS A SUCCESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Officials and foreign policy experts here are calling
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's American visit a success.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders had considered postponing the trip because of
anger over the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and expectations of a
hostile political atmosphere in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But they decided to proceed, and then saw Zhu charm his way
across the United States, deflecting major debate on the most
divisive issues like human rights and Tibet. They saw American
business leaders flock to see Zhu and saw President Clinton, after
wavering, promise to reach agreement soon on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, called the
visit ``constructive and fruitful,'' a positive step toward deeper
Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   An academic expert on American politics, Jin Canrong, said,
``Our expectations were low, but the general feeling is that the
trip was successful.'' Jin is a researcher at the
government-sponsored Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of uncertainty over the outcome and in part
because of domestic politics, the state-controlled news coverage of
the trip was somewhat muted.
</P>
<P>
   The dance over China's effort to join the World Trade
Organization, including Zhu's concessions toward open markets and
Clinton's shifting responses, was not reported in detail. Instead,
even in the darkest early phase, the press here simply reported
that major progress had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   People's Daily, the direct mouthpiece of the ruling Communist
Party, carried a gushing commentary by a Chinese-American, Ghao
Haosheng, but has not yet issued its own editorial assessment of
the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who is in charge of economic policy and the operations of
the government, is ranked No. 3 in the party, after President Jiang
Zemin and Li Peng, the former prime minister and now head of the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking display of party control over the press,
throughout the last week Zhu's trip received second or third
billing behind activities of the other two top leaders, regardless
of the seeming relative importance of the events.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, Li simultaneously traveled through the Middle East
and South Asia, and in major newspapers as well as on the
television news, reports on his activities were invariably given
more prominence than Zhu's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese analysts said this did not indicate any threat to Zhu's
position but was a reminder that Zhu cannot upstage Jiang and that
Li remains a strong force. But all the top leaders are said to
agree on the desirability of good ties with the United States, seen
as vital to China's development goals.
</P>
<P>
   The praise for closer Chinese-American relations has coexisted
in the press with harsh denunciations of American and NATO policy
on Yugoslavia. In light of China's severe ethnic tensions in Tibet
and elsewhere, the attacks are regarded by officials here as a
terrible precedent for intervention in a sovereign country
suffering ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But when China's leaders decided that Zhu should proceed with
his visit, they also decided that the Kosovo issue should in effect
be kept in a separate compartment, said Jin, the America expert, as
China continued to seek overall cooperation with the United States.

STUDY PROBES HIGH RATE OF MULTIPLE BIRTHS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a finding with major public health implications for
mothers and infants, a study has found that much of Massachusetts'
increase in the birth of premature, underweight babies _ at risk
for everything from developmental delays to death _ is occurring
among older, college-educated women.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is apparently a result of Massachusetts having one of
the nation's highest rates of twin or triplet births. These infants
are often born prematurely to older women, many of whom use
infertility treatments. Many Massachusetts insurers are required to
offer generous coverage of such treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of having twins or other multiples who are of low
birthweight increases with a mother's age as well as with the use
of fertility drugs or assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, those at risk of having low-birthweight infants
have been low-income, less educated women ``who have poor nutrition
and smoke and don't have access to prenatal care,'' said Bruce B.
Cohen, director of research and epidemiology for the state
Department of Public Health and lead author of the study, released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``we've added a whole new group of women with
low-birthweight children who are older and better educated,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concerns raised by the study are questions about the
state's ability to handle the increased demand for speech therapy
and other early intervention services that prematurely born
children often require, say health officials and other specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the study found, Massachusetts women 35 and older with
four or more years of college gave birth to twins and other
multiples at a rate twice as high as that of younger women with
less education.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, before the widespread availability of fertility drugs
and assisted reproductive technology, the two groups of women had
essentially the same rate of multiple births, according to the
study, published in the current Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, between 1989 and 1996, the percentage of twin births
rose from 2.4 percent to 3.3 percent, while the percentage of
births involving triplets or higher-order multiples rose from 0.1
percent to 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without the increase in multiple births in Massachusetts in
those years, the state's rate of low-birthweight babies being born
would not have changed, according to a statistical analysis that
Cohen and his co-authors made. This, he said, proves that the
increase in babies born weighing 5.5 pounds or less was a result of
the rise in multiple births, and not of some other factor, such as
smoking during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   While increased access to prenatal care and smoking cessation
programs might reduce the rate of low-birthweight babies born to
women traditionally at risk, ``older women may need more education
on what the risk might be in bearing children at later ages, or in
using reproductive therapies,'' said Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director of
reproductive health for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, executive director of Resolve, a national
organization based in Massachusetts that advocates for more access
to infertility treatments, praised the study for highlighting the
risk of multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we find is that couples don't understand the
risks and consequences of multiple births. Some of them think, `Why
not just go through it once and have twins?','' Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the low birthweight rate has risen 12 percent since
a low of 6.5 percent in 1984, said Dr. DeWayne Pursley, an official
with the March of Dimes and chief of neonatology at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center. He noted that the use of fertility drugs
and reproductive technology by college-educated, white women has
likely been a major contributor to the increase.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, he continues to be concerned about black women,
who have low-birthweight babies at about twice the rate of white
women.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Jodi Abbott, director of maternal-fetal medicine at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the study highlights potential
problems in the state's policy of requiring many insurers to cover
infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge monetary investment the state has made, perhaps
unconsciously. The commitment to fertility treatments has to be
followed up with a commitment to good prenatal care and commitment
to these children after birth as well,'' said Abbott, who has
voiced concerns about state-funded early intervention programs
being unable to meet the growing need.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott also expressed concern about U.S. insurers' refusal to
cover home health services for at-risk pregnant women and
employers' unwillingness to pay for more time off for them _
factors which have helped reduce the low birthweight rate in some
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   In France, for example, such benefits helped reduce by half the
rate of twins being born very low birthweight _ weighing 3.3 pounds
or less _ from 10 percent to 5 percent, Abbott said. The US rate
remains at 10 percent, she said.

YUGOSLAVS DISPLAY HORRORS THEY SAY WERE CAUSED BY NATO

   ZRZE, Yugoslavia _ Along a seven-mile stretch of the
Djakovica-Prizren road in southwestern Kosovo, lined with the
burned-out houses of ethnic Albanians, about a dozen blackened
corpses lay Thursday for journalists to see.
</P>
<P>
   They were evidence, the Yugoslav authorities said here Thursday,
of a ``criminal NATO attack'' on a long column of ethnic Albanian
refugees in which, they said, 72 people died and several dozen more
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   NATO acknowledged striking a civilian vehicle north of Djakovica
and attacking convoys south of the town. It remained unclear,
therefore, whether the damage shown by the Yugoslavs was connected
to the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Along the road were four separate sites of devastation. Blasted
tractors and cars were surrounded by the detritus of sorrowful
lives, pushed and pulled from one spot to another by the vicious
civil war here, until the lives were ended by a sudden and
apparently mistaken attack from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   There were fragments of NATO munitions all over the stretch of
road, including a plate marked MK-82, identifying a large American
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav authorities and refugees made available to
reporters insisted that there were no police or military vehicles
or escorts with the refugees when the attack happened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is possible that the refugees were being
used to shield other movement by the security forces, since some
refugees said they had had a police escort at least part of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees said that they were traveling away from their homes
in Molic, close to the Albanian border, seeking safety _ and not
returning home, as the Yugoslav authorities insist.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs brought journalists to the scene by bus and then
said they would have to spend the night, saying it was unsafe to
return to Belgrade, the capital, because of terrorism in the area.
Except for carefully controlled trips like this one, the press has
been kept out of Kosovo since just after the airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   On the six-hour bus trip from Belgrade to this spot, some 13
miles from Prizren, there was a strong Yugoslav army presence, with
tanks and armor carefully hidden in the woods and overlooking the
road.
</P>
<P>
   There were also hundreds of burned-out houses, a few still
smoldering, their blackened concrete or brick walls still standing,
but their roofs and contents burned away.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the houses bore shell or tank holes, and some were
crushed, as if armor had rolled over them. A mosque near Djakovica
had also been destroyed, its tower lying broken on its cracking
roof.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has had to pull back from its assertion that it did not
strike a civilian column, and that the Yugoslav authorities had
instead fired on refugees in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths and injuries this time were to the ethnic Albanians
the NATO air war is intended to protect and to defend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a classic criminal assault of NATO aggression on
columns of displaced Albanians returning to their homes,'' Col.
Slobodan Stojanovic of the Yugoslav army said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes were nightmarish. A burned tractor and trailer still
held the charred bodies of the driver and his passengers, while in
other spots on the road, bodies had been blasted apart.
</P>
<P>
   One family had evidently been in the midst of eating. In what
remained of the trailer there were half-eaten chunks of bread and
grilled peppers. A razor lay near a can of hair spray on the road,
which was pitted with craters.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee who had been in the column, Jemaj Rama, 58, whose
brother and sister-in-law were killed and who has four other
relatives who were wounded, said: ``We were on the run long before
the bombs. It's a war here.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a NATO warplane flashed through the sky, and the
sounds of deep explosions echoed in Kosovo's snowcapped and
forbidding hills.

IRATE BLACKS DEMAND JUSTICE IN POLICE SHOOTING OF TEEN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ He was a football dreamer who crowded his
grandmother's endtable with trophies. He was a frustrated parolee,
whose legs seemed made to outrun police and who was no stranger to
the world of juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   But when a white police officer trained his gun on 14-year-old
Aquan Salmon in an empty fenced-in lot early Tuesday morning, his
family and friends say, only two things about him mattered: He was
a child. And he had no gun.
</P>
<P>
   The bones of his lanky back were turned to Hartford Police
Officer Robert Allen when he shot Aquan through the left shoulder
blade, killing him with a single bullet as he and three friends
fled from a white Cadillac after a police chase through Hartford's
North End.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the shooting remain murky, and the city has promised
a full investigation. Allen said he that he heard a gunshot before
he shot the teen-ager, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   But inside a struggling, urban community Thursday, outraged
residents vented their anger and demanded justice. A group of
marchers moved through the neighbornood where Aquan had been
living, a silver coffin held aloft, to a the site where he was shot
and where makeshift shrine of candles, stuffed animals and a golden
Buddha now covers the blood-stained ground.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, another group massed at the police
department's downtown headquarters, reminiscent of a similar
protest in New York after police there killed an unarmed African
immigrant outside his apartment. They called for sweeping change in
the training, recruiting and attitudes of the Hartford Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as officials bring in nationally renowned forensic
experts and mediators in an attempt to smooth raw emotions,
community leaders said the story of what happened to Aquan Salmon
is not simply about the actions of an individual officer. It is
about a deep well of mistrust and anger felt by the mostly black
and Latino residents of Hartford's North End toward a largely white
police force who many say do not know or represent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens have gotten tired of their children coming home in a
body bag or a casket,'' said Rev. James Fenner of Mount Olive
Church. ``This incident is simply the straw that broke the camel's
back. The community is ready to say now, Mr. Governor, Mr. police
officer, enough is enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference that at times verged on catharsis, black
and Latino activists cast the killing in a pattern of harrassment
and racial profiling that they said extends far beyond the borders
of their blighted neighborhood and even their state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national problem. It is happening in New York, its
happening in Chicago, its happening in California, and now it has
come home to Hartford,'' said Rev. Nora Wyatt, Jr., president of
the Greater Hartford African American Alliance. ``And you know
what? I hate to say it, but I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquan's shooting comes just days after four Hartford police
officers were charged by federal and state authorities with abusing
prostitutes and corruption. And it comes on the heels of a case in
New Milford, in which a white police officer faces charges of
murder for shooting a black during an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Even as leaders pleaded for peace and urged residents to resist
rushing to judgement, nearly every one said they could not imagine
a scenario that would justify a trained police officer shooting an
unarmed child who was fleeing from him.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began at about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, when police said
they received several reports of street robberies by four suspects
riding in a white Cadillac, including a 49-year-old black woman and
North End resident who reported being assaulted with a pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Allen, who was on duty and in a marked cruiser,
spotted the Cadillac and began chasing them. The suspects led him
into an empty lot on Enfield Street, where they scattered. The
other three suspects, all juveniles, are now in custody, according
to Hartford Deputy Police Chief James Berry.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Allen said that he heard a shot before he
fired at Aquan. But so far, investigators have yet to find any
evidence of other gunfire other than the bullet that killed Aquan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you shoot somebody in the back and then suggest they
were trying to pull a gun on you?'' asked Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   As Wyatt and others planned daily vigils and a massive rally to
coincide with Saturday's citywide parade for the NCAA championship
UCON Huskies, weary family members made plans for a funeral on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not a dangerous kid. This is not justice,'' said
Aquan's grandmother, 70-year-old Norma Watts, originally from
Jamaica. Surrounded by the artwork, trophies and Lego creations of
her grandson, she said, ``Look at how people take care of their
dogs ad cats and pets in this country. And this is how they kill my
grandson?''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Watts saw her grandson was two weeks ago, before
he ran away from home, violating the probation he was under for a
previous incident. But friends who mourned him Thursday said that
though he left his grandmother's security for the risks of the
street, he would never venture too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right before it happened, I saw him buying a toy gun in a
store, and I told him not to buy it because someone would shoot him
down for real,'' said Tamara Thomas, 19, one of many who said
police have made them too afraid to walk outside alone after dark.
``He laughed at me. He gave me a hug and said 'I'm going to stay
out of trouble.' He was just a baby, you know? He hadn't even lived
yet.''

<P>
   Why is it so difficult for professional money managers to beat
the market these days? And why does it seem to be getting tougher
all the time?
</P>
<P>
   These are questions that investors have asked recently, with
increasing distress, as they compared returns generated by their
mutual funds or money managers with those of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   And the benchmark that has been so maddeningly unbeatable is the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which tracks the performance of
500 of the United States' top companies in the nation's dominant
industries. It is run by Standard &AMP; Poor's, an investment
information services company owned by McGraw Hill Cos.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12 months ended Jan. 31, for example, almost 70 percent
of stock mutual funds underperformed the S&AMP;P 500. According to
Joseph Mezrich, head of the quantitative strategy group at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, fund performance has deteriorated steadily
since 1993, when almost two out of three funds actually beat the
index.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the failure may be simply that the membership of
the S&AMP;P 500 itself has become a more exclusive club. While other
factors are also at work, James Paulsen, chief investment officer
of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, makes an intriguing
case that the S&AMP;P 500 may be getting harder to beat for active
managers, in large part because of how its makeup has changed in
recent years. As the index has transformed itself _ by accident and
by design _ it has left many managers behind.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 is the benchmark used by 97 percent of U.S. money
managers and pension-plan sponsors. In addition, over $600 billion
in investors' money is invested simply to mirror the performance of
the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen's research shows that since 1994 the S&AMP;P 500 has become
dominated by what he calls new-economy stocks, those in health
care, technology, telecommunications, financial services and
consumer services companies. While such companies made up roughly
60 percent of the index in 1994, they made up almost three-quarters
of it at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, what Paulsen calls old-economy stocks _ those
in energy, transportation, utilities, industrials and basic
materials _ make up far less of the index than they did in 1994.
Companies in these industries accounted for 16 percent of the index
recently, down from almost 30 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Paulsen says, is a shift in the S&AMP;P 500 away from
stocks forged in the industrial era and into companies created by
the technology revolution. ``These trends are due not only to
performance differences in recent years but also to a change in the
composition of the S&AMP;P names,'' Paulsen said. ``Most of the names
being eliminated from the index are old-economy names; those being
added are new-economy names.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for instance, S&AMP;P made a record 48 changes to the 500
stocks in the index, up from 30 changes in 1997. Additions included
technology companies like Gateway, America Online and Compuware, a
software maker. Among those deleted from the index were
Pennzoil-Quaker State; Safety-Kleen, a transporter of hazardous
waste materials, and Charming Shoppes, a women's apparel retailer.
</P>
<P>
   This shift is even more striking when viewed against two sister
indexes, the S&AMP;P Midcap 400 index and the S&AMP;P Smallcap 600 index.
According to Paulsen, the share of ``new-economy'' stocks in the
Midcap index is only marginally higher now _ 56 percent _ than in
1994, when it was 51 percent. And the Smallcap index has not
increased its exposure to new-age companies at all.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, old-economy stocks have declined somewhat in both
indexes, but not nearly as significantly as their drop in the S&AMP;P
500. Roughly 26 percent of the Midcap index's value lies in
industrial-age stocks, down from 33 percent in 1994. The Smallcap
index has 20 percent exposure in these stocks, down from 23 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large-cap indices are moving faster toward the tech
revolution,'' Paulsen said. ``Most of our small companies are doing
more of the industrial pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Few investors realize how much indexes change from year to year.
Their makeups shift for two reasons: the performance of the stocks
that are in an index and the additions and deletions made to the
index by its administrators.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know which factor is the bigger contributor
to the S&AMP;P 500's transformation. Because it is an index weighted by
market capitalization of its stocks rather than an equal
distribution of companies, rising stocks inherently gain greater
weight.
</P>
<P>
   And given that the S&AMP;P 500 has had such a tremendous run in
recent years _ up 170 percent from the beginning of 1995 to the end
of 1998 _ a feedback effect propels more investors into it or the
stocks that have been most responsible for its returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average is weighted slightly
differently, by the price of each of the 30 companies in it. The
more the higher-priced stocks move, the greater the impact on the
average. While the Dow had lagged behind for a couple of years, in
recent weeks the industrial average has risen faster than the S&AMP;P.
The Dow is up 13.96 percent for the year vs. the S&AMP;P 500's 7.62
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its market capitalization weighting, therefore, the
S&AMP;P is an index that day by day owns more and more of the stock
market's stars and fewer of its duds. Recently, while the stars
have been few, they have been white-hot.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, points
out that just five stocks _ Microsoft, America Online, Citigroup,
MCI Worldcom and American International Group _ accounted for 52.7
percent of the performance of the S&AMP;P 500 in the first quarter. In
all of 1998, 15 stocks accounted for such a performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even more astounding, in the first quarter the top 18 stocks
accounted for 100 percent of the S&AMP;P's 5 percent rise. That means
the remaining 482 stocks added nothing to the index's return. Sixty
percent of the stocks in the 500 underperformed the index's 5
percent return in the first quarter, while 55 percent lost ground
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   But performance is not the only thing that changes an index.
These indexes are managed actively by their administrators.
Companies are dropped from the S&AMP;P 500, for example, as they are
acquired, if they encounter financial problems or when the Standard
&AMP; Poor's index committee decides that they are no longer
representative of the overall stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This committee of nine decides which companies are to replace
those that are removed. They are much more likely to add a hot
company to the index than one that has been cold of late.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a certain amount of momentum associated with
companies going into the 500,'' said Elliot Shurgin, vice president
for index products and services at Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``Typically
we'll look at the universe of companies not in the 500 and rank
them in terms of size. What tends to happen is companies going
through rapid growth phases become large enough in terms of market
cap _ assuming they satisfy liquidity requirements _ to get into
the index.''
</P>
<P>
   The divergence of new economy and old in the S&AMP;P 500 may be
another way of explaining why fund managers who focus on value have
done so poorly in recent years. As valuations of technology,
financial services and health-care stocks have been driven well
into the stratosphere, value stocks are more likely to be rooted in
the old economy, bricks and mortar and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual investor is out there buying recognizable
names,'' Paulsen said. ``In essence he is going toward the
new-economy winners faster than a manager might.''
</P>
<P>
   As value stocks lag, of course, their market capitalizations
dwindle. This has its own feedback effect, making them less
attractive to institutional investors who require ease in entering
and exiting stocks in large trades.
</P>
<P>
   Mezrich of Morgan Stanley has his own theory to explain why
money managers find it nearly impossible to beat the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   It has two elements: Money managers do not typically weight
their holdings based on market capitalization, as an index does,
and therefore are unable to mirror the index's performance; and
even large-capitalization fund managers are likely to have larger
holdings of slightly smaller-capitalization stocks than the S&AMP;P
index holds. This means that even those managers who have been
investing in large-company stocks recently have been tarred by the
investor bias against smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an active manager, you're going to pick stocks that
are smaller than the average capitalization in the index,'' Mezrich
said. ``And if you own them in an equal weighting relative to the
S&AMP;P, you would have a small-cap bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it is no surprise that investors are dumping
their managers in droves and retreating to automatic pilot _ funds
that mimic the returns of a big-capitalization stock index. In the
first quarter of 1999, according to AMG Data Services, 73 percent
of the $24 billion that Americans put into equity mutual funds
flowed into index funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the S&AMP;P 500's broad outperformance of money managers
will not last forever. And in recent days, leaders in the index,
stocks such as General Electric, Citigroup, Pfizer and America
Online have grown weak while old-industry stocks such as
Caterpillar, Alcoa, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing have
rallied. Still, it might take quite a market jolt to move fund
managers ahead of the index again.

WANTED BY WENDY'S: YOUNG DUDES WITH ATTITUDES TO ACHIEVE BURGER
BLISS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendy's International Inc. is embarking on an ambitious effort
that stops just short of replacing its pigtailed little girl mascot
with a photograph of Pamela Anderson Lee downloaded from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The humorous campaign is aimed at men ages 18 to 34, the
quintessential fast feeders who make up the largest segment of the
fast-food market and whose fickle tastes and mercurial behavior are
continuously under scrutiny by the hamburger giants _ Wendy's,
McDonald's and the Burger King unit of Diageo PLC _ and other
quick-service chains.
</P>
<P>
   One chain, the Carl's Jr. unit of CKE Restaurants, has aimed
advertising at younger men since 1995 by promising them messy,
drippy burgers in a tongue-in-cheek campaign by Mendelsohn/Zien in
Los Angeles. Another, the Taco Bell division of Tricon Global
Restaurants, has encouraged their propensity to buy in bulk with
larger menu items and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative by Wendy's longtime agency, Bates USA in New
York, carries the theme ``It's hamburger bliss,'' referring to
``classic'' or core products like single- and double-patty burgers
as well as the return of an oversize sandwich called the Classic
Triple. Hey, if Gillette can introduce a razor with three blades,
why can't Wendy's bring back a triple-decker burger?
</P>
<P>
   The new television commercials and print advertisements take a
hipper, edgier tone than ads aimed at other consumers, which will
continue to run along with the new campaign. There are headlines
such as ``Are we not men?'' and plots celebrating young dudes with
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is indicative of steps being taken in the
increasingly competitive fast-food field as advertisers frantically
strive to stimulate demand and to lure customers from one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very viable burger market out there,'' said Ron
Paul, president at Technomic Inc. in Chicago, a restaurant industry
consulting company. ``A traditional fast-food eater is not going to
have tacos for five lunches in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And just as we're back to drinking martinis,'' he added,
``we're back to eating burgers, staples like Big Macs and Quarter
Pounders.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade after R. David Thomas founded Wendy's in
1969, the classic burgers were the chain's mainstays, promoted with
ads promising to serve them ``hot 'n juicy.'' But in recent years,
to differentiate itself, Wendy's has concentrated on fare for
somewhat older consumers, particularly women, who prefer products
like chicken sandwiches, stuffed pitas and salads.
</P>
<P>
   That led to fewer campaigns aimed at burger-loving customers as
Wendy's husbanded its national ad budget, estimated at $90 million
to $100 million last year. But now Wendy's can spend more, and on
more varied menu items, because of a deal made in August with a
principal supplier, the Coca-Cola Co. Wendy's is getting a lot more
money from Coca-Cola _ helping pay for an increase in the national
ad budget, to $100 million to $120 million _ in exchange for
serving only Coca-Cola soft drinks for the next 10 years at its
American restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the support of our Coca-Cola alliance, we've some added
marketing power that enables us to do things we haven't done in the
past,'' said Donald F. Calhoon, senior vice president for marketing
at Wendy's in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear to us we had probably not done as much
targeted efforts against the younger adult male, who is an
important customer to Wendy's,'' he added. ``This reconfirms again
for us the importance of still having to deliver on the
fundamentals of this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the campaign was derived from consumers in focus
groups who described their visions of ``hamburger bliss'' to
executives from offices of Bates USA, part of the Bates Worldwide
unit of Cordiant Communications Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamburgers are the foundation of the Wendy's brand position,''
said Gary Steele, executive vice president and worldwide account
director on the Wendy's account at Bates USA. ``We were looking for
a way to insinuate ourselves into the lives of our customers by
listening to them talk about hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the genial Thomas appears in the new campaign, as he does
in the chain's mainstream pitches, his role is more as an observer,
a kibitzer, much the way a father chuckles ruefully at a
mischievous son. In one commercial, in which a young man forgoes a
date for a Wendy's Classic Double with Cheese, Thomas turns up at
the drive-through window declaring, ``I'd have made the same
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers ``like Dave for what he is,'' said Paul Basile,
executive vice president and group creative director at Bates USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dave were suddenly wearing a hat backward or wearing
black,'' he added, ``if we said, `Look at Dave, he's cool because
you're cool,' it would be stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The appearances by Thomas are also meant to appeal to older
consumers who may happen to see the new campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want those customers saying, `You know what, they
don't want me anymore,''' said Jim McKennan, who is also executive
vice president and group creative director at Bates USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our basic strategy,'' he added, laughing, ``which
is to be nice to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will appear on TV shows watched by younger men on
networks like ESPN, Fox, MTV and USA, as well as in magazines they
read like Hot Rod, Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and Vibe.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign may be making only one misstep: a print ad with the
vaguely menacing headline, ``This is a burger town, pretty boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Who you calling pretty boy, burger belly?

POLAROID SAYS OPERATIONS LOSS IS IS EASING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling Polaroid Corp. continued to lose money in the first
quarter, but the results reported Thursday revealed early signs
that the company's turnaround plan may be succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneer of instant photography said the loss from operations
was $15.1 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$17.4 million, or 39 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues, which
have fallen for 11 consecutive quarters, were down 3 percent to
$379 million in the first three months of 1999, compared to $390.6
million in the comparable period last year. When one-time items are
added, the quarterly net loss rose to $30.8 million or 70 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid, which said its first quarter is traditionally its
weakest financially, said the sales decline was due to camera and
film inventory adjustments in Europe and lower sales in Russia.
Those problems could not overcome growth in Japan, where sales of
new camera and film products that have yet to reach the US market
are very strong, according to Polroid officials.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid recently introduced a single-use disposable camera
called PopShots, and is preparing to launch a pocket-sized camera
and a new low-end camera system, called JoyCam, later this year.
PopShots, along with higher sales in its core instant photography
business, helped boost US sales 9 percent, the Cambridge, Mass.
company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we focus on revitalizing core business profitabily, we're
gratified to see strong leading indicators for growth from our new
products,'' said Gary DiCamillo, Polaroid chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that Polaroid's success in Japan will
boost US business enough to significantly increase Polaroid's
annual revenue, which has hovered in the $2 billion range for most
of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have stemmed the erosion and even gotten themselves
on a slight growth path,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst at
Prudential Securities. ``It's too early to tell if it's
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Wall Street analysts said the extensive corporate
downsizing that has led to nearly 3,000 job cuts and plant closings
since DiCamillo took over Polaroid in December 1995, should bring
the first glimmer of profits by year end. The company also plans to
sell four business lines including sunglasses, graphic arts,
holography, and glare-reducing polarizers, in an effort to return
to profitability. The company last turned an annual profit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's stock fell 3/16 Thursday to close at 20 15/16 _ less
than half the stock price when DiCamillo took over the company.

BANKBOSTON REPORTS 6.3 PERCENT DROP IN FIRST-QUARTER NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- BankBoston Corp. said Thursday that first-quarter
profits fell 6.3 percent due to acquisition costs and decreased
income from venture-capital operations.
</P>
<P>
   The results, which beat analysts' expectations by 2 cents a
share, saw the Boston-based company earn net income of $223
million, or 75 cents a share, compared to $238 million, or 79
cents, in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston agreed last month to be acquired by Fleet Financial
Group Inc. in a $15 billion deal that will create the nation's
eighth largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have in the past faulted BankBoston for
volatile earnings. Last quarter's results, while an improvement on
previous periods, were no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues were $1.23 billion, up 19 percent from $1.03 billion a
year earlier. But expenses grew 22 percent, to $806 million.
BankBoston attributed the rise in costs to compensation paid to
executives of Robertson Stephens Inc., the San Francisco bank it
agreed to buy for $800 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston also saw lower numbers at its venture-capital arm,
where profits fell 18 percent to $34 million on a slowdown in
business.
</P>
<P>
   Results from Latin American operations, which accounts for
nearly one-quarter of the bank's total income, improved. Earnings
rose 40 percent in Brazil, to $30 million, and 25 percent in
Argentina, to $20 million. Latin America will account for 8 percent
of profits at the combined bank _ a level analysts have said they
are more comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   Trading profits and commissions grew 15 percent to $39 million
and foreign exchange profits rose 61 percent to $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's stock rose 1 9/16 to close at 51 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

COMMENTARY: OUR BUDDY BORIS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last week the West got a lesson in why we can't live
with Boris Yeltsin and why we dare not live without him.
</P>
<P>
   Can't live without him, you ask? Why? Well, it is often remarked
that the fate of Western world economies depends on the health of
two men, Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan. That is a wild
overstatement. But as long as we're overstating, I would add
another name: Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, the headlines last week were that Yeltsin was
retargeting Russian missiles at the West, because of NATO's
bombardment of Serbia; the Duma passed a resolution calling for
arms to be shipped to Serbia; and there was even talk of World War
III. But when you looked closer at what Yeltsin was actually doing,
you could see that he was putting out all sorts of smoke _ to
satisfy the anti-U.S. hotheads in the Russian Duma _ precisely so
he wouldn't have to use any fire.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever aid the Russians were sending to Kosovo seemed to be
going via the Arctic Circle. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov also
used his Bolshevik credentials to keep Russia's nationalists and
Communists in line, and prevent the relationship with Washington
from spinning totally out of control. Trust me, the Dow would not
be at 10,000 for long if the Russians were opposing NATO in
Yugoslavia with more than just hot air. War in Kosovo is one thing,
war in Europe is another.
</P>
<P>
   This is why even a half-dead, stone-cold-drunk Boris Yeltsin is
still an enormous asset for the U.S. No other Russian leader today
is as big a bear and as clever a fox as old Boris. We are going to
miss this guy. Indeed, we will one day look back and ask, how did
the U.S. use the Yeltsin years?
</P>
<P>
   Not very wisely. The Clintonites used the Yeltsin years to cram
NATO expansion down Russia's throat, rather than to really bring
Russia into Europe. These will be remembered as the years the
locusts ate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, though, Yeltsin will also have to shoulder blame. He has
so mismanaged economic reform in Russia _ with plenty of help from
the Duma _ that Russia is now busted, corrupted and utterly
irrelevant to the world economy. All this talk that the Russians
are supporting the Serbs against the U.S. out of pan-Slavic loyalty
is nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, particularly the elites, are supporting the Serbs
out of frustration at how weak Russia is today, and out of
frustration that NATO has decided that it will determine the future
of Europe _ without Russia. (It is not surprising that the Russians
chafe at the fact that Iceland, a NATO member, has a bigger say in
Europe's future than they do.)
</P>
<P>
   Because Yeltsin has not provided the leadership that Russia
needs on the domestic side to rebuild the country's economic base
and instill some self-confidence, Russians are now looking for
dignity in all the wrong places. Russian elites are courageously
maintaining a liberal democracy at home and running a Soviet-like
foreign policy abroad. What is the meaning of Russian democracy
when in foreign policy Russia is supporting two of the most evil
characters on the world stage _ Saddam Hussein and Slobodan
Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Russians don't understand,'' said Thomas Graham, a
former U.S. diplomat in Moscow, now at the Carnegie Endowment, ``is
that both Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic are actually using
them. They are being manipulated by two two-bit dictators.'' Both
Saddam and Slobodan, notes Graham, play on Russia's resentment of
its weakness in order to maneuver Russia against America in the
Gulf and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This is a losing strategy for Russia. Sure, even a thriving
democratic Russia will have different geopolitical interests than
America. Look at France. But as much as the French like to assert
their independence and tweak the U.S., in the crunch they
understand that if they are part of the democratic West they must
stand against Saddam and Slobodan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians need to understand that their influence on the
world stage can only come from their acting as real mediators _ not
as the lawyers and advocates for thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Russia will not have the self-confidence to do that, though,
until it tackles its domestic problems. Until then, we will thank
our lucky stars that Yeltsin is there to sit on the worst instincts
in Russia, and keep the lid from coming off. But we will curse our
bad luck that he is not a stronger visionary _ able to produce a
Russia that feels confident enough to have both a democratic
domestic policy and democratic foreign policy.

JAIL TERM DOES NOT DETER AN ISRAELI SEEKING VOTES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Can a key Israeli powerbroker still make and break
governments from a jail cell?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question here Thursday after a court sentenced
Aryeh Deri, a close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to a
four-year prison term for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel found Deri, the 40-year-old leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, guilty of a ``dishonorable'' crime.
Under Israeli law, that prevents him from serving as a government
minister for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But he can still run for Parliament as the head of Shas, the
third-largest party in Israel. He can still negotiate his party's
place in a coalition government after the election on May 17, if
the government is willing to make deals with a convicted felon.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely he can still count on having a pack of journalists
document his every move, just as they trailed him to the Jerusalem
courthouse Thursday, narrating every stop and start of his car,
which got trapped in heavy traffic behind the Jerusalem Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact Deri, who had faced a maximum sentence of 21 years, is
not in imminent danger of being whisked off to prison. He said he
would appeal to the Supreme Court, and if he does, the lower court
has agreed to suspend his sentence until the appeal is decided. In
most cases, that takes about 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of his party is inextricably linked to his own, and
the future of Shas has reverberations for the entire political
system. It is unclear whether Deri's conviction will strengthen or
weaken Shas. But simply losing or gaining a seat in Parliament _
the party has 10 of the 120 seats _ changes its status as a
coalition partner in any future government.
</P>
<P>
   Shas is not bound to Netanyahu's Likud Party; leaders of smaller
parties tend to look out for their own interests and are willing to
hook up with Labor governments, too.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 9 years, 147 witnesses and 41,000 pages of transcript
after the case began, a Jerusalem District Court convicted Deri of
bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The charges stemmed from his
tenure as Interior Minister and as Director General of the Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Deri, who represents a working-class Sephardic constituency, was
convicted of accepting $155,000 in bribes for steering millions of
dollars in public funds to a yeshiva whose directors paid him off.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters wept outside the courthouse Thursday. Like him,
they believe that Deri has been railroaded by a legal system biased
against him _ and them _ because he is Moroccan-born and
religiously observant. The Shas ideology trades on the perception
that its supporters are not only the underclass but also the
victims of the Ashkenazic, European elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear effort here to stop this new movement,'' Deri
told his supporters. ``But you know our slogan: `The more they
oppress us, they more we thrive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is a line adapted from the Bible about the Israelites who
suffer at the hands of an Egyptian tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Yaakov Tzemah, who led the court panel, is both Sephardic
and religious himself. In meting out the sentence, the judge also
quoted from the Bible, from a warning in Deuteronomy to ``judges
and officers'' not to accept gifts, ``for a gift doth blind the
eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking bribes was part of his life values,'' the judge said of
Deri.
</P>
<P>
   Deri, who arrived at the courthouse after visiting his party's
spiritual adviser, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, at the hospital, called the
verdict a trial from God. He also labeled it a ``terrible character
assassination'' intended to weaken him politically before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is not willing to buy that they're dealing here
with public enemy No. 1,'' he said, ``that you need to lock him up
right away and not let him run the elections. Anyone who sees that
knows what to think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the sentence, Netanyahu said that court rulings
must be accepted, but he expressed sympathy for Deri and added that
the right of appeal must be honored, too.
</P>
<P>
   Deri faces additional charges from another corruption indictment
last week accusing him of funneling government money to his party's
favorite projects.

US SAYS BOMBS MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH TO RID KOSOVO OF SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Painting a sobering picture of the war in
Yugoslavia, US officials Thursday acknowledged that allied pilots
killed Kosovar civilians, warned that the fighting could go on for
months, and said bombing alone might not kick the Serbs out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives in Brussels released a tape recording of an
unidentified US pilot who said he bombed a convoy _ which turned
out to include dozens of civilians _ because he believed it was
made up of Serb forces that had been burning villages around the
city of Djakovica, near the Kosovo-Albania border.
</P>
<P>
   US and NATO officials vowed the incident would not slow the air
campaign against Yugoslavia, which President Clinton said Thursday
would continue ``as long as necessary to obtain our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   But in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
acknowledged that the air war might fail to achieve the prime
objective of compelling Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic to pull
his troops out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And Defense Secretary William Cohen told the committee the
conflict could stretch into the summer and deaths of US personnel
are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and one of the most
outspoken advocates of sending in ground troops, asked Shelton if
he had advised President Clinton that ``air campaigns alone have
never decisively affected any war.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, choosing his words carefully, replied: ``I did point
out that the military option that we were looking at _ the air
campaign _ could carry out the military mission, but that that
might not lead you to what was the desired outcome of the
diplomacy, a political settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   With bombing alone, the general continued, ``we could continue
to degrade his capabilities,'' but Milosevic might decide not to
negotiate or withdraw his troops anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point that has been made by many outside critics of
Clinton's policy, but this was the first time an officer as senior
as Shelton had agreed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shelton and Cohen both dismissed the idea of
stepping up the conflict to a ground war, saying the NATO allies
refuse even to consider the option.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton revealed that the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
political body, specifically instructed Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's
military commander, ``not to commence planning'' for a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Shelton said, even making preparations for
a possible ground war ``would fracture the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen amplified the point: ``We've tried to keep it confined to
an air campaign operation because there has been concern on the
part of all NATO allies about the potential for much greater
casualties and a much greater involvement into the internal affairs
of Serbia by putting in a land force. So we intend to continue the
campaign by air.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing these twin revelations _ that bombing alone might not
work, in a politically meaningful way, and that a ground war is
politically impractical _ McCain responded: ``It seems to me that
there continues to be a mismatch in what you call the military
objective, which is to break the capability of the Serbian
military...and the political mission, which is to remove the Serbs
from Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelon replied: ``I would just say...that we have a very clearly
defined military objective...with the air campaign... We do need to
give it more time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other major developments on the 23d day of the air campaign:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands of refugees flooded into Macedonia and Albania,
forcing relief officials to again shift their focus from the plight
of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to the problems the refugees pose to
those nations. ``If we don't manage this well, Milosevic will win
the day,'' said J. Brian Atwood, the top US relief official. He
said plans to move refugees to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
in Cuba, may be reactivated.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO confirmed warplanes struck military barracks, bridges,
and state-television transmitters throughout Serbia Wednesday
night. Thursday, targets in Yugoslavia's smaller republic,
Montenegro, were hit, and new NATO attacks also were reported in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ International officials in Bosnia ordered a pro-Serb
television station to stop broadcasting, alleging that its coverage
of the Kosovo crisis was inflammatory and inaccurate. The order was
made after station Kanal S ignored warnings to stop its allegedly
biased reporting on NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   _ While not denying that NATO bombings caused civilian
casualties, Pentagon sources suggested some of the scenes of
suffering released by Yugoslavian authorities actually showed
carnage caused by their own planes in a different location in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors in San Francisco, attempted to explain the conflict and the
reasons for US involvement.
</P>
<P>
   He began with an indictment of Milosevic, but then shifted to
the evolution of the US role in the world order during the 20th
century, making the case that the current conflict is ``a great
battle between the forces of integration and disintegration, the
forces of globalism versus tribalism....
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is a very small place on a very large faultline,'' he
said. The nations around it _ Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia, Bulgaria,
and Romania all are ``struggling to realize the vision of
multiethnic democracy that Mr. Milosevic is struggling to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session following the speech,
Clinton reacted sharply when asked whether public support for the
conflict could be maintained when the front pages of American
newspapers begin showing the bodies of civilians killed by NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is... inevitable in a conflict of this kind, with planes
traveling at high speeds doing their best to fulfill their
mission'' that such things will happen, Clinton said. ``If the
requirement is that nothing like this can ever happen, then we're
saying it's OK with us if Mr. Milosevic displaces over a million
Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon thousands of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks this is a reason for changing our mission,''
he said, ``then the United States will never be able to bring
military power to bear again.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with statements made by Clinton that the United States
should support the economic development of the Balkans and their
integration into Europe, Atwood said economic assistance funds will
be included in the request for emergency funds that the
administration is about to send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic situation there is very bleak,'' Atwood said.
``Macedonia did a lot of trade with Yugoslavia and that has been
cut off. Romania and Bulgaria are suffering too.''

GM AND FORD POST INCREASED EARNINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Sweden)   By KEITH BRADSHER

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Cashing in on very strong sales of high-profit sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks in the United States, the
General Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. posted increases in
operating earnings during the first quarter that were even larger
than financial analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Americans bought a record 16.9 million cars and trucks in the
first quarter, and that meant both companies' factories in the
United States were struggling to keep pace, while the need for
rebates and other discounts dwindled. The auto makers' car loan
divisions and European subsidiaries made more modest profits, while
they lost money in Latin America and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   GM earned $2.06 billion in the first quarter, up 28.6 percent
from the period a year earlier, while fully diluted earnings a
share were $3.04, up from $2.27 in the first quarter of 1998.
Analysts had been forecasting earnings of $2.89 a share, according
to the First Call Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Revenue at Detroit-based GM rose 6 percent, to $42.44 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., earned $1.98 billion in
the first quarter, or $1.60 a diluted share, also beating the
consensus forecast of $1.39. In the first quarter of 1998, Ford
reported earnings of $17.65 billion, 88.8 percent higher than its
current earnings, because it took a one-time, noncash accounting
gain of $15.96 billion when it spun off a consumer finance unit,
the Associates First Capital Corp.. But Ford's operating earnings
rose 20 percent, to $1.81 billion, or $1.46 a diluted share, from
$1.51 billion, or $1.22 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said its first-quarter revenue rose 3.6 percent, to $37.89
billion from $36.58 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that GM's profits might be as high as
$3.20 a share, so its stock fell Thursday, dropping $3.1875, to
$86.5625. Shares of Ford rose 6.25 cents, to $62.8125.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer, said in an
interview Thursday that GM would try to build up its cash reserves
in the second quarter in preparation for the expiration in
September of the auto maker's three-year national contract with the
United Automobile Workers union. GM will slow the pace of its
pension contributions, its retiree benefits program contribution
and its $4 billion share buyback program, with the goal of
deferring part of the burden of all these programs until late this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to go into the summer with a strong cash
position and rear-load all of those programs _ it happens to be a
contract year,'' he said. GM could face another strike either
because of its planned spinoff next month of the rest of its auto
parts operations, Delphi Automotive Systems, or because of the
expiration in September of its three-year national contract with
the United Automobile Workers union.
</P>
<P>
   GM temporarily suspended its share buyback program last summer
during a two-month strike that cost it $2 billion in after-tax
profits.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford are the world's two largest companies in terms of
sales, but the geographic distribution of their profits in the
first quarter made them look like homebodies at heart. North
American operations produced 93.2 percent of GM's worldwide
automotive profits, and accounted for all of Ford's automotive
operating profits.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the
highly cyclical companies were benefiting from the strength of the
American economy. Ford in particular gained from the steady shift
by millions of Americans away from cars and toward pickup trucks
and particularly sport utility vehicles, both of which carry much
larger profit margins than cars. GM benefited too but not as much
because its factories could not keep up with demand _ its share of
the market for light trucks, a category that also includes
minivans, fell to 26.5 percent in the first quarter, down from 29.9
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GM's share of the car market climbed to 31.1
percent from 30.5 percent in the first quarter of 1998. Ford's
share of the car and light truck markets was little changed.
</P>
<P>
   But John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, said that
Ford was not just relying on sales of large sport utility vehicles
for its profits, saying that some car models make money too.
``We're not under some false assumption that we make all our money
on SUV's and everything else is a loss, that's not the case,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts believe that Ford also makes money on its
large Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans, as well
as some of its luxury cars, while losing money or breaking even on
small and midsized cars. Ford does not release profits by model.
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable speculation in the auto industry
that Ford might spin off its auto parts division, Visteon
Automotive Systems, in response to GM's spin off of its parts
operations. Devine said that Ford was still working on assembling
the right combination of technology, people and low costs at
Visteon, but added that the GM spinoff would increase the level of
competition for auto parts contracts from other auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a competitive risk at Visteon, it's one we worry
about,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's national contract with the UAW is also scheduled to
expire in September, but Devine said that it was too early to talk
about labor issues. Ford is not expected to face a strike because
it has good relations with the UAW and there was little in
Thursday's release from Ford to suggest that the company was
hoarding cash.
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter Ford acquired A.B. Volvo's car
division, and in March paid the first $3 billion of the roughly
$6.5 billion price; another $1.8 billion is due this month and the
rest, the exact amount of which will depend on the value of the
Swedish kroner, is due in two years, Devine said, revealing these
purchase details for the first time. Sales and profits from Volvo
cars will start to be included in Ford's figures in the second
quarter, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also agreed earlier this week to acquire a British auto
service company, Kwik-Fit, for about $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GM had no one-time gains or losses in the first quarter, while
Ford reported a $165 million one-time gain from the sale of its
stake in an automotive joint venture in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion and fire that killed six people earlier this year
at Ford's largest factory complex, and caused brief production
slowdowns at 10 of Ford's 20 North American assembly plants because
of auto parts shortages, produced a loss after insurance of less
than $100 million, Ford said.

WITH A FIELD REDUCED TO ONE ARMY FAVORITE, ALGERIANS VOTE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Switzerland)  By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS _ Algeria went ahead Thursday with a presidential
election that seemed to mock the democratic process that the
military rulers had promised, with a sole active candidate, favored
by the army, nearly deserted polling places in many urban areas and
a political outlook that appeared bleaker than when the election
was called last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of six of the seven presidential candidates on
Wednesday, less than 24 hours before the voting, guaranteed the
victory of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a 62-year-old former foreign
minister. He returned to Algeria in February after living for
nearly 20 years in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The result set the stage for a new round of political tension
for Algeria, which has only recently begun to return to a semblance
of normality after a seven-year war that began when the generals
canceled an election in 1992 that was on the verge of being won by
militant Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
   With those groups excluded from competing in the presidential
election, the generals who have held real power for nearly four
decades had hoped to unite the majority of Algerians behind a new
civilian president, but their plans appeared to collapse with the
sudden withdrawal of all the candidates except Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates who withdrew, several of whom had close ties to
previous military governments, asserted that persistent electoral
fraud by the generals had guaranteed Bouteflika's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   They said election officials had padded voter lists and printed
extra ballots to inflate Bouteflika's vote. In addition, they said,
election officials had refused to allow advance inspections by
candidates' representatives of ballot boxes used by two million
``special'' voters who began casting ballots earlier this week,
among them large numbers of soldiers and policemen who voted in
barracks and nomads who voted in the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   A new dispute developed Thursday over the size of the overall
voter turnout, which became a test of political strength after the
candidates' withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates who withdrew _ two former prime ministers,
Mouloud Hamrouche and Mokhdad Sifi; two moderate Islamist
candidates, Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi and Abdellah Djaballah; a former
presidential aide, Youcef El-Khatib, and a veteran opposition
figure, Hocine Ait Ahmed _ had appealed to the 17.5 million
eligible voters to boycott the election. The departing President,
Liamine Zeroual, a retired general whose sudden resignation last
September precipitated the election, called for a large turnout as
a show of repudiation for candidates who pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   In Algiers, home to two million of Algeria's 30 million people,
Western reporters witnessed what appeared to be a dismally low
turnout, below 20 percent in several polling stations in the city
center. But at nightfall, the official election commission said
that the national turnout at 3 p.m., five hours before the polls
closed, was 36.5 percent, a figure that suggested that the final
turnout could approach the 45.8 percent recorded in the 1995
election won by Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several of the candidates who withdrew cried foul,
saying the turnout had been inflated to create the impression that
Algerians had sided with Zeroual _ and, in effect, with Bouteflika
_ by turning out in significant numbers for an election with a
predetermined result.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Algiers as the voting proceeded appeared to be one
of widespread demoralization, in sharp contrast to the hopeful
spirit in the city only a month ago, when the start of the election
campaign was accompanied by a widespread sense that years of
dictatorial rule might finally be drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   With shops closed for the day, the city's streets were virtually
empty. Among the few people in the streets, there was a reluctance
to comment on the political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point?'' one old man said, declining to give his
name. ``We're back to where we started _ one party, one candidate,
no democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   At two polling stations in the city center, a handful of voters
offered an opposing view. A 22-year-old veterinary student said he
had voted for Bouteflika, but without much hope that he would be an
agent of political change. The student said he had voted in protest
against the candidates who withdrew, who had torpedoed popular
hopes for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why campaign for weeks, then pull out out the last moment,
just when you sense you're going to lose?'' he said. ``Those people
have let Algerians down.''
</P>
<P>
   As the voting began, Bouteflika was quoted by Agence
France-Presse as saying he would not accept the presidency unless
there was a large turnout and a majority vote for his candidacy.
But after the election commission announced figures for the
turnout, there seemed little doubt that his conditions would be
met.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the withdrawal of the other candidates, their names
remained on the ballot papers; but two dozen voters approached by a
reporter all said they had voted for Bouteflika, a pattern that
suggested he would have little difficulty gaining a majority.

NATO APOLOGIZES FOR BOMBING CONVOY OF REFUGEES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO officials acknowledged Thursday that a bomb
dropped from one its aircraft hit a convoy of refugees in Kosovo,
killing civilians and resulting in a gruesome spectacle widely
played on Serb television.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and U.S. officials profusely apologized, President
Clinton stressed that it would not stop the bombing campaign
intended to deter Serb troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to newspaper editors in San Francisco, Clinton called
the attack ``regrettable'' but he added ``you cannot have this kind
of conflict without some errors like this occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   And the president asserted, ``if anyone thinks that this is a
reason for changing our mission, then the United States will never
be able to bring military power to bear again, because there is no
such thing as flying airplanes this fast, dropping weapons this
powerful, dealing with an enemy this pervasive, who is willing to
use people as human shields, and never have this sort of tragic
thing happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The president told the editors that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic was ultimately to blame for the casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the scales are weighed, it will be obvious that this is a
result of Mr. Milosevic's policies. If he doesn't want this to
happen he ought to get out of Kosovo, let the Kosovars come home,
and let people come in there who can protect them,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, was even
more blunt in assessing the significance of the bombing error in
the overall military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are going to happen. I think we have to have a
sober, serious, conscientiousness but not hysterical attitude about
these things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, which occurred Wednesday, caused confusion and
fingerpointing when it was initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials originally speculated that Yugoslav forces may
have targeted the convoy, either from the ground or the air.
</P>
<P>
   Serb television estimated that 75 persons died and more than two
dozen were injured by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials could not confirm those figures but conceded
their aircraft hit the civilians, mistaking the convoy for military
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NATO bomb destroyed the lead vehicle, which we now believe
to have been a civilian vehicle,'' said Gen. Giuseppe Marani, NATO
military spokesman. ``When you are conducting an air campaign,
despite everything you can do, despite how strict the rules you're
applying, mistakes can happen. And the number of mistakes is
proportional to the volume of the air operation, and the
difficulties that are encountered in that theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense
Secretary William Cohen also conceded the NATO pilot had hit the
wrong target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there is a loss of innocent life, of civilians being
killed during the course of combat, it is regrettable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Serb leader is responsible for putting the
Kosovar refugees in such a dangerous predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him (Milosevic) to talk about atrocities when an error
occurred on the part of someone trying to carry out a mission to
save their lives I think is one of the most grotesque statements
that I could conceive of,'' Cohen told the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their strong words for Milosevic NATO officials were
clearly taken aback by the mistaken bombing that has allowed the
Serbs to paint them as responsible for killing refugees.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second incident where NATO bombers struck civilians
in Yugoslavia. Earlier a NATO aircraft, targeting a bridge,
accidentally hit a passenger train about to cross the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's morning briefing in Brussels, Belgium, officials
stressed that the pilot was targeting an area in western Kosovo
that had been a hub of activity for Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where the Yugoslav special police forces, the
MUP, had been conducting `ethnic cleansing' operations in recent
days,'' said Gen. Marani.
</P>
<P>
   Marani said the route in question, the road between Prizren and
Djakovica, is an important resupply and reinforcement route for the
Yugoslav army and the special police.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the intent of the mission, NATO officials played
for reporters a tape of the pilot's detailed account of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, whose name was not released, was flying an F-16 at an
altitude of 15,000 feet above several villages he described as on
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I moved up to the north, I found the first village that had
been set on fire. It looked like it had been burning for quite a
long time and was about to burn out,'' he said. ``Then as I move
farther south I see the next village south on fire, fresher fire,
still burning vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot then said he spotted a convoy of three dark green
trucks moving from a freshly burning house. The pilot said he
became convinced the trucks were moving to the next house to set it
on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make several passes over these vehicles to ensure that they
are, in fact, military vehicles. I roll in on two passes to get a
close look, both with my eyeballs and with my targeting pod, IR
picture ... '' he said. ``I make a decision at that point that
these are the people responsible for burning down the villages that
I've seen so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said he then acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I roll in, put my system on the lead vehicle, and execute a
laser-guided bomb attack on that vehicle, destroying the lead
vehicle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping the bomb, the pilot said he realized he was
running low on fuel and had to leave the area. On his way out the
pilot radioed the aircraft that was coming to replace him and
informed him of the convoy.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot said that as he was leaving the area the other
aircraft also dropped a bomb on the convoy.

JUDGE FINES PILOTS' UNION AN UNPRECEDENTED $46 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge fined the American Airlines' pilots union nearly
$46 million Thursday for defying his order to return to work in
February after hundreds of pilots called in sick in a dispute that
forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my oath requires me to do makes me sick to my stomach
because a lot of decent men and woman pilots are going to be hurt
by this,'' Judge Joe Kendall of U.S. District Court in Dallas said
as he delivered his decision, which amounted to one of the largest
fines ever made against a union.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,200
pilots, has the right to appeal the decision. Richard Lavoy, its
president, who was also held personally liable in the case, did not
say whether the union would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed in the judge's decision,'' he
said outside the courthouse. ``We will do what we have to do to
protect our members. We will examine all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the judgment would effectively wipe out the union,
which has an estimated $38 million in assets, Lavoy said, ``We are
a long, long way from that.''
</P>
<P>
   The award to American is the latest chapter in a bitter dispute
that crippled the country's second-largest airline this winter. The
sickout, which began on Feb. 6 and lasted about 10 days, resulted
in the cancellation of more than 6,600 flights and inconvenienced
more than 600,000 passengers, including many who were traveling
over the busy Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on the purchase in December of Reno Air, a
small airline that flies mostly in the West, by AMR Corp., the
parent of American. The pilots said that the purchase violated
their contract and worried that AMR would use Reno as a way to
transfer American flying to lower-paid pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had no intention of creating an ``airline
within an airline'' and promised that it would merge Reno into the
American network, though it said that the process would take as
long as 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But for many American pilots the Reno purchase was the last
straw after years of acrimonious relations with management. Union
leaders maintain that the sickout was a spontaneous protest that
spread quickly after a few dozen pilots called in sick in protest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company said that it was orchestrated by the union
leadership. ``We don't take any pleasure in all this,'' said Chris
Chiames, an AMR spokesman. ``We have been searching for labor peace
with all of our labor groups in recent years. It is a shame that
the APA is dominated by a leadership that is only interested in
confrontation and that they led their members into an illegal job
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides held several meetings with a federal mediator over
the last month to try to resolve the dispute. The two sides have
agreed not to comment on those talks.
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 10 at
the company's request, the number of pilots on the sick list rose
even higher. The next day, Kendall found the union, Lavoy and Brian
Mayhew, the union's vice president, in contempt and ordered the
union to place $10 million in escrow. LaVoy placed $10,000 with the
court and Mayhew remitted $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered a hearing, which began on Monday and concluded
Thursday, to determine the size of the damages that the union
should pay. American said that the entire 10-day sickout cost it
between $200 million and $225 million. But it said that cost of the
disruption after the judge ordered the pilots back to work amounted
to nearly $58 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the pilots called two expert witnesses who argued
that only 233 pilots called in sick after the contempt citation and
estimated that the damage to American was between $1.4 million and
$4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall sided with American and grew short with the union's
witnesses. ``American Airlines is not going to want to go to the
public and the stockholders and talk about taking that kind of hit
without it being true,'' he said at one point, referring to the
airline's damage estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he had strongly criticized the union leadership for
badly serving its members.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he determined the $46 million assessment by
taking American's $58 million estimate and discounting it 6
percent, which was the airlines estimate of its percentage of
error. He then deducted an additional 5 percent for travelers who
simply chose not to buy American tickets during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Juravich, director of the Labor Center at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, said that the fine was among the largest
ever levied against an American union. ``This fine is really
unprecedented in American labor history and represents a level of
accountability for unions that's never really been applied.'' A $52
million fine imposed against the United Mineworkers Union in
connection with a coal strike was vacated by the Supreme Court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the damages were announced, many pilots were worried
that the judge might try to wipe out the union. Some pilots have
been openly discussing joining the Air Line Pilots Association, a
much larger national union that is a member of the AFL-CIO and has
more clout in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, pilots said that if the company tried to destroy
the union, it would make the next round of contract negotiations
that much more difficult.

 &HT;    FCC orders phone bills to be simpler
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Federal regulators ordered Thursday that
phone companies simplify their bills to make it easier for
customers to understand, and BellSouth has plans already under way
on how to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission approved a plan, also
supported by the Clinton administration, that requires companies to
flag new charges and providers, give clear explanations of what
each charge is and how to contest it if need be.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth said it considers its bill easy to understand already,
but will roll out a further simplified one in December or January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crisper, cleaner, more succinct,'' said BellSouth
spokesman Joe Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable changes will be on the first page,
where BellSouth will list all companies with charges on the bill
and their respective amounts. That includes BellSouth services such
as cellular and Internet access, as well as services from companies
such as AT&AMP;T or MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the paper size will be bigger, nearly 8 by 10 inches, and
the text and graphics clearer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth also plans to use the new format as a marketing tool.
It might advertise services, such as Caller ID or Internet access,
on the left-hand column of the bill, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC passed the plan in response to billing problems that
have been rampant since telephone deregulation in 1996. The
commission receives thousands of consumer complaints each year
about cramming, the addition of bogus charges onto bills, and
slamming, the unauthorized change of a service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The plan approved Thursday is not the first time the commission
has weighed in on simplified billing. Almost a year ago, it adopted
guidelines for protecting customers from cramming and slamming.

 &HT;    Coke cuts prices in Russia, Brazil
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. is reducing prices in two troubled
overseas markets to try to stimulate consumer demand and hold on to
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Brazil and Russia say the Atlanta-based beverage
company and its bottlers are cutting some retail prices by about 15
percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are short-term, six-to-nine-month initiatives,'' Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter analyst Andrew Conway said Thursday. ``They're
not permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   During tough economic times, analysts said, locally produced
soft drinks gain market share on Coca-Cola in some countries
because they are considerably cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we take a long-term approach to building our business
for the future, we can also adjust our short-term tactical
approaches in certain markets, considering economic conditions,''
said Coca-Cola spokesman Mark Preisinger. ``One such approach could
be lower pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, Conway said, there was a 40 percent to 50 percent
price gap between Coca-Cola's brands and those that are locally
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola is reducing prices in that key market, he said, ``to
narrow the gap and stem the growth of local flavors. ... They're
cutting prices and reallocating advertising spending from national
TV and radio to less expensive local ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil accounts for about 25 percent of the company's Latin
American sales, Conway said. He is predicting double-digit declines
in sales volume in Brazil in the first half of the year, with a
``gentle recovery'' in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are tough in Brazil,'' added Deutsche Bank analyst Scott
Wilkins. ``The independent soft drinks have captured about 30
percent to 40 percent of the market there. ... The only way to
compete is on price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian newspaper Gazeta Mercantil reported that the price
of a regular bottle of Coca-Cola was cut by nearly 17 percent. Over
the past year, Coca-Cola has seen its market share there drop to 48
percent, from 54.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins said one of the key Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil has
reduced average prices by about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Colombia and Venezuela also are facing rough economic
times, Wilkins said, the local brands there have not captured the
market share that they have in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Moscow Times reported Coca-Cola will cut retail
prices on half-liter bottles _ its most popular product _ by 20
percent in the Moscow area because its products are more expensive
than those of local competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not surprising,'' Wilkins said. ``This is clearly a
reaction to the dire economic situation in the Moscow area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears obvious that the economic environment in some
markets _ Brazil, Russia, Japan and Germany being the best examples
_ continue to be challenging,'' Prudential Securities analyst
George Thompson wrote in a recent research report. ``Management
continues to take steps to make the product more affordable to
consumers in these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include promoting smaller packages and increasing
the number of returnable bottles, Thompson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, by contrast, prices have been rising
recently as Coca-Cola and its bottlers try to boost earnings here.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have already factored in these moves when
estimating Coca-Cola's earnings for the upcoming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Coca-Cola is scheduled to report its first-quarter
earnings, with the consensus estimate among analysts at 29 cents a
share. That would be down from 34 cents a share in the year-ago
period.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Thursday at $64.25, up 81 1/4 cents.

 &HT;    Delta defers 777 order
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just three weeks after getting its first Boeing 777
amid much corporate fanfare, Delta Air Lines is scrapping some
orders for the new planes, blaming a lack of progress in pilot pay
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier Thursday said it indefinitely deferred orders for
four 777s scheduled for delivery early next year and asked Boeing
for smaller 767s instead.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it feared having to ground the model later this year
if it can't break a stalemate with its pilots union over pay rates
for the plane.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chief Executive Leo Mullin said he is ``very
concerned'' about Delta's ability to take delivery of five more
777s this year, though the orders remain on track for now.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots union said the airline's announcement was premature
and ``confrontational,'' noting pay talks are in the early stages.
Some analysts wondered if concerns of overcapacity on international
routes also prodded Delta's move.
</P>
<P>
   The matter signals continued rocky relations between the pilot
union and Delta management, which have forced other strategic
flipflops. Last year, Delta announced a seat-selling alliance with
United Airlines, only to scuttle it when union approval couldn't be
secured.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes increase this fall when Delta and the Air Line Pilots
Association enter new contract talks. Following a strike at
Northwest last year and a hugely disruptive sickout at American
this winter, events at Delta will be closely watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have been focused on American's labor problems this
year,'' said PaineWebber analyst Sam Buttrick, ``but Delta's on
deck.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the issue is a $108 million jumbo jet Mullin has dubbed
the ``queen'' of Delta's international fleet. Delta got its first
two 777s in late March and had orders for 11 more before Thursday's
cutback.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and ALPA, which must negotiate pay rates for new airplane
types, began 777 talks in February but remain ``far apart,'' the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   If a pay agreement isn't in place within six months of when
Delta starts using a new model, the union can refuse to fly it. The
first 777 goes into service May 1, so a deal must be in place by
Nov. 1 to avoid that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the airline contends it needs a deal by August, so it
can confidently add the 777s to its winter schedules. Delta said
the negotiating stalemate and the time needed to ratify any deal
left little hope of having a deal by then. Boeing required a
decision this week on the four orders that were deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, in a memo to Delta's 9,000 pilots, said ALPA has ``made
it very clear'' it will refuse to fly the 777s in November without
an agreement. He termed the risk of having a grounded fleet
``intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   A union spokeswoman questioned Delta's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to us they're trying to get some negotiating
leverage out of a business decision that would have taken place
anyway,'' ALPA spokeswoman Karen McGuffey said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's initial offer would pay a senior 777 captain $236.36 an
hour, or $212,724 a year, before overtime or other add-ons. That's
4 percent above the highest pay rate at carriers already using the
777. ALPA's opening demand was for $346.44 an hour, or $311,796 a
year. Neither side has budged in talks so far.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it ``will not put into commercial service any
aircraft that does not produce an adequate financial return,''
citing pilot pay costs as a factor in that equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's primarily a pilot and customer service issue, but
clearly the prospect of excess capacity over the Atlantic made the
decision easier,'' said Buttrick, who forecasts a 6 percent
trans-Atlantic capacity increase in the first half of 1999 and an
11 percent jump in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin acknowleged the risk of overcapacity in his memo but
added the airline would not have deferred any 777 orders if a pilot
agreement was assured.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract talks this fall will affect pay rates for all
aircraft and a range of work issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Delta announced its 777 cutbacks, union leaders met
Thursday to discuss one such issue _ the airline's increasing
integration of regional affiliate flights into its own schedules.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Delta has announced it will supplant some
of its own flights in the Southeast with service by just-acquired
subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines. Also, affiliate Comair is
adding a flight on Delta's Northeast shuttle operation.
</P>
<P>
   While such moves aren't new, ALPA fears Delta is effectively
outsourcing short-range flying to lower-paid crews, and it's
expected to demand tighter restrictions in the next contract.

 &HT;    Videoconferencing company VCON to move its headquarters to
Austin
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ VCON Inc., a videoconferencing company based in
Israel, is moving its U.S. headquarters from Dallas to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   VCON joins two other videoconferencing companies, VTEL Corp.,
headquartered in Austin, and Polycom Inc., which has operations
here.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it is making the move because it is focusing
its development around the Internet, and Austin has people with
Internet skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin has a high-tech skills base that is focused on
Internet-related technology, software and networking,'' said Gordon
Daugherty, VCON's senior vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   That VTEL and Polycom also provide a base of skilled talent pool
didn't hurt in making the decision, Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is becoming the capital of videoconferencing,'' said
Dave Karson, a research analyst with Black and Co. in Portland,
Ore. ``It makes sense for VCON to be where the talent is.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin's base of videoconferencing began with the founding of
VTEL in 1985. Polycom, based in San Jose, Calif., came to Austin in
1997 when it bought ViaVideo Communications, a company started by
former VTEL employees. VCON also has VTEL ties.
</P>
<P>
   The president of VCON's U.S. operations, Bob Romano, was
formerly vice president and general manager of two of VTEL's
product divisions. Daugherty was senior marketing director for
VTEL's personal and workgroup systems.
</P>
<P>
   VCON's videoconferencing systems are used by customers including
the U.S. Air Force and Army, the University of South Florida Health
Science Center, and a number of school districts and governments.
</P>
<P>
   VCON has 17 employees in Austin and expects to grow to 25 this
year. Its offices, in North Austin, will handle sales, marketing,
finance and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   During fiscal 1998, VCON lost $6.6 million, including a $1
million one-time writeoff, on revenues $17.1 million.

 &HT;    NATO ADMITS CONVOY BOMBING, CLINTON CALLS DEADLY INCIDENT
'REGRETTABLE,' BUT 'INEVITABLE'

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that NATO's
inadvertent bombing of a civilian convoy in Kosovo was an
``inevitable'' accident in an air campaign targeting Serbian troops
that attack civilians then use them as ``human shields.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Wednesday's accident -- the second lethal NATO strike
on civilians this week -- ``regrettable,'' but insisted that allied
pilots are ``bending over backwards,'' to avoid civilian casualties
and would not diminish their air war against Serb military forces
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like
this occurring,'' Clinton said, speaking at a convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to tell you, if anyone thinks that this is a reason
for changing our mission, then the United States will never be able
to bring military power to bear again,'' Clinton said, ``because
there is no such thing as flying airplanes this fast, dropping
weapons this powerful, dealing with an enemy this pervasive, who is
willing to use people as human shields, and never have this sort of
tragic thing happen. It cannot be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic
denounced that civilian killings at the nadir of a campaign his
government has regarded from the outset as an unjustified attack on
a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst picture of a humanitarian catastrophe
brought on by the NATO bombings,'' Vujovic told the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of Defense William Cohen warned the
Senate Armed Services Committee that NATO casualties are
``probable,'' advising the panel that the air war against
Yugoslavia could continue for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his opposition to independence for Kosovo,
saying it should remain a province in Serbia, one of two states
remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need in the Balkans in more balkanization,''
said Clinton. ``The real question today is not whether Kosovo will
be part of Serbia. The real question is whether Kosovo and Serbia
and the other states of the region will be part of the new
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration spent much of the day, however, focused on
trying to prevent Wednesday's civilian deaths from eroding public
support for the NATO air campaign, now in its fourth week raining
bombs down all over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen situations in which Serbian forces in Kosovo have
used civilians to protect their military resources, assets and
movements, there's no question about that,'' Clinton's National
Security Adviser Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger told reporters
traveling with the president in San Francisco. ``Under these
circumstances, it is inevitable that there are going to be
incidents like this.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said a pilot dropped a laser-guided
bomb from an F-16 onto a civilian vehicle that the pilot mistook
for a troop transport truck. NATO did not release the name or
nationality of the pilot and would not estimate the civilian toll
in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported from Belgrade that 69 were killed
at the scene in southwest Kosovo, two more died in a nearby
hospital and 41 others were treated there for wounds, according to
local officials and healthcare workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO pilots continued their strikes unabated
throughout the night Thursday and into Friday morning, striking at
Serb air defenses, fuel storage facilities, command and control
systems and other military targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a loss of momentum,'' NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO deeply regrets the loss of life,'' from the accident,
Shea said, but ``one tragic accident cannot, and will not,
undermine our conviction that our cause is a just one to end human
suffering and to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO released a dramatic tape of the F-16 pilot's version of
Wednesday's attack -- one of dozens of strikes U.S. and allied
pilots conducted that day.
</P>
<P>
   At around 3:30 p.m. (local time), the pilot, who sounded like an
American, said he was flying in the vicinity of Dakovica in
southwest Kosovo and saw three area villages aflame.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian troops and police forces have burned more than 100
villages and towns across Kosovo over the past three weeks as part
of a larger campaign to run ethnic Albanians away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces have been trying in recent days to focus their
attacks directly on those forces responsible for the repression.
</P>
<P>
   Near a fourth area he judged to have been recently set afire,
the pilot spotted what he described as ``three uniformly-shaped
dark green vehicles,'' that looked to him like large troop
transport trucks moving along a dirt road flanked with burning
homes just north of Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to a stop at the next house down the road, and I'm
convinced now that's the VJ and the MUP forces,'' the pilot
recalled, using the abbreviations for Yugoslav army and special
police, ``and they're preparing to set this next house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was flying at roughly 15,000 feet -- nearly three
miles high -- said he made several passes over the area, at one
point tipping his airplane so that he could look directly at the
column of vehicles. He said both his visual sighting and the
indications from his instruments -- including infrared sensors --
led him to conclude that he was looking at a group of military
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about 25 minutes into building the whole picture of
the destruction that is flowing from north to south into the town
of Dakovica, and I make a decision at that point that these are the
people responsible for burning down the villages that I've seen so
far,'' the pilot said. ``I roll in, put my (targeting) system on
the lead vehicle, and execute a laser-guided bomb attack on that
vehicle, destroying the lead vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said there were military trucks nearby, some of
which were later attacked by a separate NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's attack came two days after another NATO jet
inadvertently bombed a passenger train, killing at least 10 people
and injuring 16. NATO officials said that jet dropped two bombs on
a bridge over the Juzna Morava river in Serbia, just north of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Clinton said, the blame for the civilian deaths lies
with Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
whose troops have rampaged across Kosovo killing ethnic Albanians,
burning their villages to the ground and forcing more than one
million of them to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the requirement is that nothing like this can ever happen,
then we're saying it's okay with us if Mr. Milosevic displaces over
a million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon thousands of
them,'' said Clinton. `` I believe when the scales are weighed, it
will be obvious that this is a result of Mr. Milosevic's
policies.''

local officials and healthcare workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO pilots continued their strikes unabated
throughout the night Thursday and into Friday morning, striking at
Serb air defenses, fuel storage facilities, command and control
systems and other military targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a loss of momentum,'' NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO deeply regrets the loss of life,'' from the accident,
Shea said, but ``one tragic accident cannot, and will not,
undermine our conviction that our cause is a just one to end human
suffering and to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO released a dramatic tape of the F-16 pilot's version of
Wednesday's attack -- one of dozens of strikes U.S. and allied
pilots conducted that day.
</P>
<P>
   At around 3:30 p.m. (local time), the pilot, who sounded like an
American, said he was flying in the vicinity of Dakovica in
southwest Kosovo and saw three area villages aflame.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian troops and police forces have burned more than 100
villages and towns across Kosovo over the past three weeks as part
of a larger campaign to run ethnic Albanians away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces have been trying in recent days to focus their
attacks directly on those forces responsible for the repression.
</P>
<P>
   Near a fourth area he judged to have been recently set afire,
the pilot spotted what he described as ``three uniformly-shaped
dark green vehicles,'' that looked to him like large troop
transport trucks moving along a dirt road flanked with burning
homes just north of Dakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to a stop at the next house down the road, and I'm
convinced now that's the VJ and the MUP forces,'' the pilot
recalled, using the abbreviations for Yugoslav army and special
police, ``and they're preparing to set this next house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was flying at roughly 15,000 feet -- nearly three
miles high -- said he made several passes over the area, at one
point tipping his airplane so that he could look directly at the
column of vehicles. He said both his visual sighting and the
indications from his instruments -- including infrared sensors --
led him to conclude that he was looking at a group of military
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about 25 minutes into building the whole picture of
the destruction that is flowing from north to south into the town
of Dakovica, and I make a decision at that point that these are the
people responsible for burning down the villages that I've seen so
far,'' the pilot said. ``I roll in, put my (targeting) system on
the lead vehicle, and execute a laser-guided bomb attack on that
vehicle, destroying the lead vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said there were military trucks nearby, some of
which were later attacked by a separate NATO jet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's attack came two days after another NATO jet
inadvertently bombed a passenger train, killing at least 10 people
and injuring 16. NATO officials said that jet dropped two bombs on
a bridge over the Juzna Morava river in Serbia, just north of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Clinton said, the blame for the civilian deaths lies
with Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
whose troops have rampaged across Kosovo killing ethnic Albanians,
burning their villages to the ground and forcing more than one
million of them to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the requirement is that nothing like this can ever happen,
then we're saying it's okay with us if Mr. Milosevic displaces over
a million Kosovars, kills and rapes thousands upon thousands of
them,'' said Clinton. `` I believe when the scales are weighed, it
will be obvious that this is a result of Mr. Milosevic's
policies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO acknowledged Thursday that an allied
warplane had mistakenly bombed a civilian vehicle in southern
Kosovo on Wednesday while trying to stop Serb forces from attacking
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the episode as an unfortunate but understandable
accident of war, NATO officials took the unusual step of
broadcasting a taped interview with the American pilot of an F-16
that participated in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In calm tones, the pilot described circling over villages set
aflame by Serb troops before directing a laser-guided bomb at what
he believed was a military truck. He then left the scene and
another patrol continued the attack. The end result, according to
NATO, was that a civilian vehicle was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it had no information on the number of civilian
casualties. Yugoslav authorities, who took Western correspondents
to see what they said were victims of the NATO attack, said more
than 70 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark retracted his claim that
it was Serb forces who had done the damage, allied officials said
that Yugoslav military and paramilitary units had put hundreds of
thousands of ethnic Albanians at risk by forcing them from their
homes and by attacking them.
</P>
<P>
   Though NATO acknowledged striking a civilian vehicle, the time
and location it gave still differed from the reports of the
Pentagon, refugees reaching Albania and reporters taken to the
scene. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   While the American pilot spoke of an attack north of Djakovica,
for example, the reporters were taken to an area south of the town,
and refugees also spoke of being attacked on the road south of
Djakovica. NATO acknowledged that it had also launched attacks
south of the town, but made no reference to any erroneous strikes
there.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it would not put new restrictions on its attacks
against Serb forces in Kosovo. Allies officials said it was
unrealistic to think that civilian casualties could be excluded in
an intense bombardment designed to force the Yugoslav military and
paramilitary units out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fate of the hundreds of thousands of displaced
Albanians has become an emotional debating point for both sides,
especially since NATO has cast itself as the potential savior of
the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   With its account Thursday, NATO was trying to maintain its own
credibility by owning up to a mistake while deflating Belgrade's
repeated allegations that the alliance was wantonly bombing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO confirms, from its preliminary investigation, that it
appears that one of its aircraft mistakenly dropped a bomb on a
civilian vehicle in a convoy yesterday,'' said NATO's military
spokesman, Italian Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani. ``Serb police or
military vehicles may have been in or around the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has charged that at least 70 civilians were killed
Wednesday in NATO raids on Kosovo. NATO says it has no way of
knowing the number of those that might have been killed or wounded
by its attack, but formally apologized for the civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in southern Kosovo vividly illustrates what
military historians call ``the fog of war.'' Information about the
conflict is a confusing welter of reports based on NATO briefings
and reconnaissance photos, e-mails accounts from Kosovo Liberation
Army partisans inside Kosovo, the testimony of refugees fleeing
across the Albanian and Macedonian border and the Serb-controlled
press. Many of the on-the-scene accounts by journalists are based
on trips to the region organized by authorities in Belgrade.

BRUSSELS: in Belgrade.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its effort to present an authoritative account of Wednesday's
episode, NATO spokesman took the highly unusual step of playing a
taped interview with one of the pilots for hundreds of reporters
here. The identity of the pilot, an American who flew one of the
F-16s, was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot and his wingmen were patroling in southern Kosovo.
near the highway that runs from Prizren to Djakovica. NATO
officials say that road is an important supply route for the
Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1 p.m. local time, the pilot observed a flood of
refugees near Djakovica, quickly concluding they had fled because
Serb forces had set their villages on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the picture that I'm building now in the southwestern part
of Kosovo is that MUP and VJ forces are methodically working
themselves from the north to the south through villages, setting
them ablaze, and forcing all the Kosovar Albanians out of those
villages,'' the pilot said, using the acronyms for the Yugoslav
Interior Ministry and Military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot saw three dark green vehicles near one village and
assumed they were military trucks. But he was flying at 15,000
feet, a precaution established by NATO planners to avoid
anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see three uniformly-shaped, dark green vehicles, look like
a deuce-and-a-half troop-carrying vehicles,'' the pilot said. ``I'm
convinced now that's the VJ and MUP forces working their way down
towards Djakovica and the refugees, and they're preparing to set
this next house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot circled around twice to get a better look visually and
with the help of a special infrared targeting device that creates
images from the heat of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I roll in on two passes to get a close look, both with my
eyeballs and with my targeting pod,'' the pilot says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I make a decision at that point that these are the people
responsible for burning down the villages that I've seen so far,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot directed a laser-guided bomb at one of the vehicles,
destroying it. He did not attack the rest because his wingman was
running low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The planes flew away but reported the situation to flying air
controllers and battle management planes. That information was, in
turn, passed on to a new patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The new patrol saw three large trucks in a housing area which
was near to where the first F-16 had stuck. It attacked all three
of the trucks, Marani said. Taped interviews with those pilots were
not released by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   After the Serbs charged NATO had attacked civilians, NATO
confirmed that a civilian vehicle had been destroyed in the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of confusing allegations, counter-charges and
fragmentary reports, however, there were still a host of vexing
questions, including whether the site of NATO's mistake is the same
place that figures in the original Serb charges of civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said Thursday that the incident occurred north of
Djakovica, on the road between Djakovica and Decane. Serb
authorities, however, appeared to have taken some reporters to
sites south of Djakovica, including Bistrazin. It is the sites
south of Djakovica, which also seem to have been featured in Serb
videos and television reports.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serb take reporters to a location where they themselves
caused the casualties and damage? Or will NATO release still more
data on civilian casualities that it might have cause in attacks on
convoys south of Djakovica on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon acknowledged that there was at least one
strike on a convoy on Wednesday south of Djakovica. Indeed, the
Pentagon seemed to have that attack in mind when it briefed
reporters on the incident Wednesday evening. NATO said Thursday
that its investigation is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's accounts shows how difficult it is to limit civilian
casualities, even in an age of high-precision weaponry and
high-technology reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed the dominant view within the
alliance Thursday when he said that civilians casualties were
unavoidable in a conflict in which high-speed jets dropped powerful
bombs on Serb armor that was situated near fleeing refugees.
Avoiding all civilian casualties, he said, would be tantamount to
shutting down the military campaign to create an autonomous Kosovo
for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of NATO's inquiry, Jamie Shea, the NATO
spokesman, insisted that the alliance would continue to press the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a loss of momentum,'' he said. ``We
will continue to take every conceivable precaution that we possibly
can in this area. But obviously, again, I am not going to pretend
for one minute that we can eliminate the risks involved,
particularly in trying to strike at the tanks and the artillery, in
the field.''

SUGAR INDUSTRY EMERGES AS KEY PLAYER IN EFFORT TO RESTORE
EVERGLADES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ Alex Thompson wheeled his giant harvester
around, lined it up to mow a strip of scorched sugar cane and, over
the engine noise, allowed as how he had heard just about enough
from environmentalists who blame the sugar industry for the slow
erosion of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The air was heavy with the smell of singed sucrose. All around,
cane fields stretched to the horizon. White egrets and herons, two
of the precious bird species that are disappearing from the swamps
to the south, followed Thompson's machine in a furious flock,
scavenging insects stirred up by the cutting. They seemed pathetic,
like one-time royalty reduced to begging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all talk about it a lot, and a lot of us think the whole
thing's been blowed up,'' said Thompson, who has nine children and
a fifth-grade education and makes $9.25 an hour. ``There are a lot
of things that's been laid on the farmer that ain't the farmer's
fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry that employs Thompson and 16,000 other farm workers
is at the center of a political struggle over a $7.8 billion
project to restore the watery wilderness of the Everglades, one of
the most threatened ecosystems in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan made public last week after two years of study, the
Army Corps of Engineers intends to improve the flow of fresh water
to the Everglades by removing barriers like dikes and canals and by
building reservoirs to save rainwater that is pumped out to sea in
the wet season to prevent flooding. The plan will go to Congress
for its approval in July.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest barrier remains the cane fields, former
marshlands drained by a huge flood-control project for South
Florida 50 years ago, which stand between the Everglades and their
historic water source, Lake Okeechobee. And after a decade of
resisting government efforts to make them pay for an expensive plan
to combat water pollution from their fields, the state's
politically powerful sugar growers have emerged relatively
unscathed by the restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to support anything we could survive,'' said
Robert Buker, a vice president of the U.S. Sugar Corp., which with
the region's other dominant grower, Florida Crystals Corp., pumped
more than $2 million into federal campaigns for both major parties
over the last three elections. ``We just want to be left alone as
much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, environmentalists have labored to push back the
fields. But the sugar industry is part of a transformed South
Florida landscape, as much as the condos and cul-de-sacs of its 6
million people. As a result, the battle over the Everglades and the
water it needs to regain health is also a fight about economics and
power, agribusiness and growing cities.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the most influential interests in the state have
faced off, the sugar industry has skillfully repulsed efforts to
return more of their fields to marshland or convert them into a
giant reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sugar companies not only survived the just-concluded
battle over the Everglades restoration plan, but guaranteed their
future water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration plan goes to Congress for approval in July, and
the government engineers and ecologists who designed it say it is
the most ambitious attempt in history to restore a natural system.
But it is also a gargantuan public works project to provide enough
water for 6 million more people in South Florida and to keep
lowland farmers in business for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no other group has more at stake than the companies that
grow about a fifth of the nation's sugar on half a million acres of
fertile muck-soil south of Lake Okeechobee. Environmentalists want
to take more than 150,000 of those acres for a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Driving up Highway 27 from Miami to Lake Okeechobee, it is hard
to believe that the fields of cane stretching to the horizon were
once part of the Everglades. A hundred years ago, in wet seasons,
the lake would fill and water would flood the wide sawgrass
flatlands to the south in a shallow sheet that nourished the
Everglades marshes as it flowed gently to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Now the table-top landscape is a patchwork of vegetable farms
and cane fields. Here and there a wall of fire marches across the
fields, where workers are burning the leaves off the plant before
cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing has so fundamentally altered the natural flow of
water to the Everglades as this 750,000-acre block of farms and
sugar plantations, ecologists say. The farms forever severed the
Everglades from Lake Okeechobee and stopped the shallow sheet-flow
of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``South of the lake, you basically have a plug,'' said Roderick
Tirrell, of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The change began in the 1920s and 30s, when the state diked the
lake and tried to drain the Everglades to create farmland. But the
canals failed to stop flooding in wet seasons, and in 1947
back-to-back hurricanes flooded most of south Florida, killing
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, under orders from Congress, the Army Corps of Engineers
began draining 750,000 acres south of the lake with a web of
levees, canals and pumping stations. It built a mammoth levee along
the east coast to protect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and other cities
from floodwaters.

BUSH'S TAX TAB: $3.77 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday he and
his wife, Laura, have paid $3.77 million in federal income taxes on
an estimated 1998 income of $18.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamt I'd write a check that big. Of course, I never
dreamt I'd make that much money, either,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes had prepaid about $97,000 on their taxes. So Thursday
they sent the IRS a check for $3.675 million.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated tax return marks a dramatic increase over Bush's
1997 income, when he paid $77,084 in taxes on $258,375 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Bush sold his interest in the Texas Rangers
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's original $600,000 investment in the team in 1989 was
turned into at least $14.9 million when the team was sold last
June. At the time there were estimates that Bush would receive as
much as $2 million more once the closing on the team was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been among a group that bought 84 percent of the Texas
Rangers in 1989 for $86 million. The team was sold to Dallas
financier Tom Hicks for $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The team's complex financial arrangements gave Bush a payout
bonus that was disproportionate to his original investment because
he helped put the deal together and served as the team's general
partner from 1989 until he became governor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's taxable income for last year included the $88,008 he
earned as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said she did not know how much of
the rest of Bush's income came from the Rangers sale or earnings
from his blind trust.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush earned a total of $17 million from the Rangers sale,
then the blind trust's earnings would have been more than $1
million more in 1998 than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's accountant has applied for an extension in
filing his income tax returns to gather more information on his
individual investments.

 CLEWISTON, Fla.: from floodwaters.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These measures proved to be wonderful for the sugar growers and
other farmers, who began producing bumper crops in the fertile muck
left behind. But the artificial system turned out to be a
slow-moving disaster for the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The natural flows and rhythms of water were altered, drying out
some marshes at critical times and flooding others when they should
have been dry. In the wet season, 85 percent of the water falling
on South Florida was pumped out to sea as runoff, just to keep the
farms and cities from flooding. In the dry season, the farmers and
cities were served first, and the Everglades dried out.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the runoff from the sugar fields was high in phosphorus,
a nutrient. The Everglades water is remarkably pure water. On the
edge of the agricultural area, cattails, which thrive on
phosphorus, began to overtake the native sawgrass on thousands of
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the restoration project is to capture the water
that is pumped out to sea in an elaborate system of reservoirs,
then pump the water into the Everglades at the right times,
mimicking nature's old pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to replicate the functions that we lost,'' said
Stuart Appelbaum, the Army Corps of Engineers' lead engineer on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the plan was co-opted by the sugar companies and
urban interests during its two-year gestation and is weighted too
far toward protecting the sugar companies and providing water for
cities.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of this, the critics say, is the government's
decision to take only 60,000 acres of sugar cane land out of
production to create reservoirs in the agricultural region, rather
than the 150,000 to 200,000 acres some environmental groups wanted.
And the growers will not lose land; they are being compensated with
acreage the federal government bought from a willing seller.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists have long argued that the cheapest and
easiest way to save the Everglades would be to buy more sugar farms
and turn them into a large reservoir that would mimic the lake's
old function.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on the other side of this who will say no
matter what the answer is, take more sugar land out of
production,'' Buker, of U.S. Sugar, said. ``Their real goal is to
punish us.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the idea has proved politically
impossible, not only because of the hue and cry over the loss of
agricultural jobs, but because of the sugar companies' influence in
Tallahassee and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building a large reservoir in the sugar lands, the
Corps of Engineers is relying on expensive underground storage
systems for water around the lake and the creation of a large
reservoir on land yet to be chosen north of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the early development of the plan is that the
environmental groups wanted to take more land out of the
agricultural area, but the corps was heavily lobbied by the sugar
industry to look for alternatives,'' Charles Lee, a lobbyist for
the Florida Audubon Society, said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar executives do not deny that they lobbied hard. But they
say the decision to create a smaller reservoir is supported by
science. A larger one, they say, would lose more water to
evaporation than would be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of government agencies have looked at this and they have
all been gravitating toward a smaller reservoir,'' said Jorge
Dominicis, a vice president of Florida Crystals, which with U.S.
Sugar dominates the cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers and ecologists who put together the plan deny that
the sugar industry was given special treatment. ``Our answers are
technically driven,'' Appelbaum, of the Army Corps of Engineers,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Davis, an ecologist for the South Florida Water
Management District who worked on the plan, said: ``There was no
plot, no policy effort to direct policy to favor anyone in this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugar executives point out that environmentalists and urban
interests were also at the table lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think sugar's the issue any more,'' Dominicis, of
Florida Crystals, said. ``I think we are all pretty comfortable
that we will be there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people working for the sugar corporations regard themselves
as victims of changing attitudes. When Napolean Bonaparte Broward
won the race for governor in 1907, he ran on a promise to drain the
swamps in South Florida and reclaim it for farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it reclaiming,'' Buker said. ``Now it's
restoration. They were reclaiming swampland, and now we are
restoring a delicate ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 200 family farms are in the district, but more than 80
percent of the sugar is produced by two large companies. The older
company, U.S. Sugar, is owned by its employees and two charities
controlled by the C.S. Mott family in Flint, Mich. It has operated
farms here since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The second, Florida Crystals Corp., is owned by Jose Pepe and
Alfonso Fanjul, the scions of a Cuban sugar magnate who fled the
island after Fidel Castro took over. The Fanjuls rebuilt their
sugar business in South Florida in the 1960s and now control
several sugar companies in Florida and the Dominican Republic under
a corporate umbrella, Flo-Sun Inc.

<P>
   Both companies give heavily to political campaigns on all levels
and to both major parties, having a vital interest in maintaining
federal support programs for sugar prices. During the 1996
presidential race, Jose Pepe Fanjul served on Bob Dole's finance
committee, while Florida Crystals employees and Alfonso Fanjul
raised money for the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very powerful,'' said Rep. Daniel Miller, R-Fla., who
has failed three times to overhaul the federal sugar program.
``Sugar's goal is basically to get the program going to keep up the
high price of sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last three election cycles, the Fanjul family pumped
more than $575,500 into campaigns for federal offices and their
sugar companies donated at least $843,000 directly to national
committees for both major parties, according to Federal Election
Commission records analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics,
a Washington group that tracks the influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, U.S. Sugar Corp. donated at least $584,000
to national party committees while its employees gave $276,000 to
federal candidates, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   The Fanjuls' contacts extend to the White House. In February
1996, for instance, President Clinton interrupted a meeting with
Monica Lewinsky to accept a call from Alfonso Fanjul, according to
White House records made public in the investigation by Kenneth
Starr, the independent counsel. The two later spoke for more than
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the companies were so powerful that
Florida agencies turned a blind eye to the phosphorus pollution
problem for decades. Then in the late 1980s, the federal government
sued Florida, charging state officials with allowing the cane
growers to pollute the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the cane growers have fought a successful political
retreat, scrapping every step of the way to slow attempts to take
fields out of production and to avoid paying for the full cost of
cleaning up the phosphorous, environmentalists say.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists' wariness of the sugar companies is
understandable. Sugar executives have outmaneuvered them several
times in the last decade, several said.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Lawton Chiles settled the federal lawsuit in 1991, for
example, he promised federal authorities that Florida would clean
the pollution from the farms. But the sugar companies mounted a
blizzard of legal challenges that threatened to delay the cleanup
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton was elected president in 1992, the new
administration quickly reached a new agreement with the state and
the sugar industry. It limited the amount the sugar companies would
pay to about a fourth of the total cleanup cost.
</P>
<P>
   The administration defended the decision as the only way to get
on with the cleanup. But at a news conference in Washington
announcing the deal, Alfonso Fanjul left little doubt that the
sugar industry believed its support for the Democratic Party and
Clinton had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In November 1992, Americans cast a vote for change,'' Fanjul
said. ``Today the Clinton administration delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, the industry's lobbyists defeated a
state ballot initiative that would have made the industry pay a
penny-a-pound tax on sugar to finance the entire $700 million cost
of the cleanup, the construction of buffer marshes of cattails to
cleanse phosphorus from the water coming off cane fields. The
industry spent an estimated $25 million on television
advertisements to sway voters. In the end, the growers are to pay
about $230 million of the cost and Florida taxpayers the rest.
</P>
<P>
   And once Congress set in motion the current plan for the
Everglades in 1996, the sugar growers protected their interests at
every step of the protracted negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the sugar companies style themselves as model
environmental citizens. Under the agreement reached with the
Clinton administration, they point out, they have halved the amount
of phosphorus coming off their lands through simple management
practices, like dredging canals every year and fertilizing furrows
instead of entire fields.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that they have an enormously difficult problem,
scientists say. The water flowing into their farms from Lake
Okeechobee is high in phosphorus to begin with, because of other
farming operations north of the lake. Even rainwater has a higher
level of phosphorus than the 10 parts per million the government
wants to see flowing into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the only people in the country who have to clean water
cleaner than the water that falls on us,'' Buker of U.S. Sugar
said.

THREE ARE KILLED IN SALT LAKE CITY SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A gunman on Thursday invaded a genealogical
library at the heart of the Mormon Church _ Temple Square _ and
then killed two people, wounded four more and died after a gun
battle with police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake Police Chief Ruben Ortega said Thursday night that the
man, Sergei Babarrin, 70, lived locally and had a prior criminal
record. Ortega also said that Babarrin, who used a 22-caliber
handgun, had schizophrenia and had not been taking his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Babarrin had been arrested four years ago after
a fight in a church-owned business here. At the time he was
carrying a 22-caliber pistol, but he was never charged with a
weapons offense.
</P>
<P>
   The police were investigating a report that minutes before the
shooting Thursday morning, Babarrin appeared at a Church-owned
television station and demanded to go on the air with complaints
about the Mormon Church, which is formally called the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Tamar Orr, an employee of KSL-TV, said that after the
altercation at the station reception area, a man matching the
description of the gunman asked for directions to the Family
History Library, which is three blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who appeared to be in his late 50s, was bearded, wore
disheveled clothes, and drove a rented yellow moving truck.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the police evacuated much of downtown Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   With the city hosting an annual genealogical conference this
week, 2,700 people filled the five-story building, the world's
largest genealogical library, at 10:30 Thursday morning, when the
gray-bearded gunman walked in.
</P>
<P>
   He walked up to a woman sitting at the front desk and shot her
in the head, according to witnesses interviewed by The Deseret
News, this city's church-owned newspaper. Firing and reloading from
a handgun, he shot another woman in the head, and a third victim in
the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   A 62-year-old security guard, Donald Thomas, and an unidentified
female library patron were killed in the attack, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   The police identified the man wounded in the shoulder as
45-year-old Chris Webb, and two others wounded as 80-year-old
Nellie Leighton and 71-year-old Theda Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming from the lunch room, popping his little gun,''
Adair Harding, a visitor from Provo told the newspaper. ``He just
had his hand out. It wasn't real loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Franz, a visitor from Sandy, said: ``It was after about
four or five of those that somebody yelled out, `Get under the
table.' A man's voice then told us to pull the chairs down over
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos, 17 panicked library patrons barricaded themselves
for two hours on the library's second floor. The gun battle also
trapped a group of 95 fourth-grade students who were on a field
trip to the library. The students were outside the library and
their teachers called the police and their principal on a cellular
telephone. The group escaped without harm.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting continued for as long as an hour after the first
police officers arrived, the police said. The gunman fired from the
building while a police SWAT team shot at him from outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the exchange of shots, a Salt Lake City police officer
suffered a minor gunshot wound. The attacker died of his wounds in
an ambulance, the police said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The police did not identify the wounded officer.
</P>
<P>
   One of Utah's top 10 tourist attractions, the library stands
across from Temple Square, site of the Salt Lake Temple and
Tabernacle of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   The library has more than 2 million rolls of microfilm copies of
census and other records from more than 100 countries. The church
collects the records for what it calls the baptism of the dead.
Mormons believe that such baptisms give the dead the opportunity to
join the church in the afterlife.

SPORTS COLUMN: STEINBRENNER OWES NOTHING TO STRAWBERRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone rang at 8 in the morning, a little early for anything
but trouble. It was the news that Darryl Strawberry had been picked
up for solicitation and possession of cocaine _ the other shoe
dropping. When it comes to dropped shoes, Darryl Strawberry is a
veritable centipede.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether George Steinbrenner should help
Darryl one more time, show sympathy for Strawberry because of his
mixed prognosis following surgery for colon cancer last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Steinbrenner does for Strawberry now, it will be an act
of pure kindness. He owes Darryl nothing, nothing at all. The man
did not seem to understand how kind George has been.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry has said he can explain it all, that he was just
stopping to chat with the woman, and that somebody else may have
left the cocaine slipped inside a $20 bill. He may slip through the
charges of soliciting a female undercover police officer for
prostitution and carrying a modest amount of cocaine in his wallet
Wednesday night, but baseball could still judge that he has
violated the terms of his contract, as a past offender.
</P>
<P>
   He has had tax problems. He has had domestic problems. He has
had concealed-weapon problems. He has had drug problems. It may be
time for Strawberry to face his problems outside the familiar
cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball could very well rule that the Yankees do not have to
pay Strawberry the generous $2.5 million that Steinbrenner agreed
to pay him this season, after the crushing blow of cancer. My guess
is that Steinbrenner will pay Darryl the money, but Steinbrenner
would be well within his rights to ask Darryl for a forwarding
address for the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner rescued Strawberry from the discard heap in 1995,
and warned that he would be Darryl's worst nightmare if he
backslid. At the time, there was reason to wonder whether the
Yankees were the best place for outpatient employment for a
recovering addict, given Steinbrenner's manipulation of the addled
Billy Martin.
</P>
<P>
   However, Strawberry was the perfect teammate right through last
season, and he stayed clean, and then he got sick. They say
addiction is a disease of the feelings, and now he had to deal with
fears that would be normal after such a heavy diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Some addicts recite their daily intention to stay clean or
sober. Many of them slip into a dangerous state known in the
treatment centers as ``stinking thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Darryl came to spring training this year, his head was not
screwed on right. He wandered around in grandiosity, insisting he
would be ready to start the season. At other times, he seemed to be
feeling sorry for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about his chemotherapy treatments in late March,
Strawberry said, ``Some days have been very moody.'' He said he
talked to nurses and learned that bad moods could be part of the
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that you have a stressful job to go to,'' he
said. ``Most people go home to sleep, but I've got to come out here
and hit baseballs and run around in the sun, things I'm not really
supposed to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees prepared to start the season, Darryl did not seem
part of the clubhouse banter, as he always had been. He reverted to
his old distant gaze. He was sliding away. A few perceptive people
around the clubhouse wondered if it was the chemo, or the fears of
illness, or just the normal baseball insecurity of an aging
outfielder with bad legs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than show gratefulness for the contract and the chance to
work, Strawberry put pressure on the Yankees to take him north. And
maybe when he saw the team bus heading for the Tampa airport,
Darryl gave in to feelings of emptiness. He was working out on his
own, away from his wife and four children, away from the daily
structure of the Yankee clubhouse. He was vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Yankees owe him more supervision? In the past,
Steinbrenner had assigned Arthur Richman, the valued eminence
grise, to hang with Strawberry during a trip to the farm system.
This time Darryl was on his own. But then again, he is 37 years
old. When does the babysitting end?
</P>
<P>
   It ends here. The Yankees went a long way with Darryl
Strawberry, but this is between him and his lawyer, between him and
a judge, between him and the commissioner's office and _ most
touching of all _ between him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball shouldn't matter that much anymore. Darryl might have a
few booming home runs left, but the important thing is that he
somehow not drop any more shoes.

   RADUSA, Macedonia _ Over 3,000 new refugees fleeing from Kosovo
crossed into Macedonia Thursday, but ominous reports emerged from
refugees that Yugoslav forces had ordered a train and two busses
filled with ethnic Albanians back into the war-ravaged province
just after they arrived within easy walking distance of the
Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   The report of Yugoslav forces once again barring Albanians from
fleeing Kosovo could not be confirmed and comes after three days of
allowing refugees to freely cross the border here. But the prospect
of tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians being trapped inside
Kosovo heightened fears among aid officials and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees arriving here say that Yugoslav forces have been
systematically attacking villages in southeastern Kosovo over the
last 10 days in an apparent effort to expel tens of thousand of
ethnic Albanians from the area. Western diplomats who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Thursday that they have received
reports from inside Kosovo that as many as 30,000 people are on the
move and headed toward the border here.
</P>
<P>
   If true, this could mean that Yugoslav forces are herding
thousands of Kosovo Albanians across the southeastern part of the
province like pawns, some toward the border, some away from it.
Robyn Groves, a spokeswoman for the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees, said that the mistreatment of civilians should be halted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gravely concerned about the continuation of the
expulsions,'' she said. ``At the same time, we are gravely
concerned that people in large numbers are trying to reach the
border and are not successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials have warned that the estimated 500,000 ethnic
Albanians still inside Kosovo are running low on food and could
fall victim to starvation and disease after eluding attack by the
Serbs. And refugees here have said the shifting status at the
border has created an emotional roller-coaster, with reports it is
open raising hopes that people inside Kosovo can flee, and reports
it is sealed heightening already intense suspicions of Serbian
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Groves said that refugees arriving here Thursday reported
seeing a 9- to 12-car train full of fleeing ethnic Albanians
entering the border town of General Jankovic. But before any of the
ethnic Albanians were allowed off the train, it went into reverse
and headed north, back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees also reported that two busses of refugees were also
sent back into Kosovo before the passengers could exit. U.N.
officials said they could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees also poured through Macedonia's two other border
crossings with Yugoslavia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeast, Macedonian police permitted a group of 3,000
ethnic Albanians who had waited for more than a day in the no-man's
land between Macedonia and Serbia to cross into Macedonia, U.N.
officials said. Macedonian officials do not recognize the area,
near the town of Lojane, as an official border post, but have
grudgingly allowed ethnic Albanians to enter there.
</P>
<P>
   In the northwest, 600 ethnic Albanians crossed into Macedonia at
the town of Jaznice, Ms. Groves said. And those refugees reported
seeing another 3,000 civilians headed for Macedonia on the road
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of a major new wave of refugees prompted the
Macedonian government to reissue its call for foreign nations,
including the United States, to shelter more Kosovo refugees.
Emilija Geleva, an aide to Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski,
warned that Macedonia could not cope with another massive influx of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more people arrive, the airlift should continue more
intensively,'' Ms. Geleva said, ``and other countries should accept
more refugees.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The large and small tragedies of the exodus from Kosovo unfolded
amid the increasingly chaotic influx of refugees. About 400 people
who traveled by train from the town of Urosevac to the border and
were not turned back by Yugoslav forces were abruptly bused by the
Macedonians to a remote refugee camp here.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they expected the refugees to have been brought
to the sprawling NATO-built Brazda refugee camp, where tents and
food were waiting for them. But instead, Macedonian police led the
column of five buses to this small tent city on a barren hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Audil Mehdiu, an official with the Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs, which runs the camp, said he had been told that some
refugees would be coming there, but not when. After the buses
arrived here Thursday afternoon, he and several refugees who help
run the camp scrambled to find enough tents and food for the new
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Disorder erupted. Hundreds of camp residents crowded around each
bus as it arrived, shouting for news of relatives still in Kosovo.
As babies shrieked, elderly people who left the sweltering busses
sat down exhausted, appearing both bewildered and saddened by their
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees burst into tears of joy on seeing a friend they
had feared dead. Others cried openly when they could find no one
they knew. Valbona Ahmeti began weeping after hearing that her
sister-in-law and nephew, who left their home in Kosovo for
Macedonia two weeks ago, had never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left with my brother two weeks ago, but got separated
from him,'' she said between sobs. ``I would give anything to see
them. I thought they were here.''

 Geeks Rule in Job Hunt
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
College students graduating in fields such as computer science and
business are finding a great job market for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's market is not quite as hot as last year's
sizzler, career placement advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, students in less-marketable fields such as English
are likely to end up with significantly lower salaries _ and fewer
offers _ than their techie peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, a lot of employers were so hungry that even liberal
arts majors were getting multiple offers, but that's not as much
the case this year,'' said Camille Luckenbaugh of the National
Association of Colleges and Employers, which gathers data on job
offers to college grads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot fields are computer science, health care, medicine,
finance, media and entertainment, and for-profit education,'' said
Jessie Woolley, president of undergraduate recruiting for Kaplan
Professional Career Services.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at a low 4.4 percent nationally and 2.5
percent in San Francisco, companies are continuing to scramble to
hire top-notch workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficiaries of that scramble include many of the estimated 1.1
million U.S. college and business school graduates entering the
full-time workforce this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Take Zakiyyah Langford. A 21-year-old &LR;   &LR; computer science major
at Stanford, she received five job offers ranging from $44,000 to
$50,000 this winter before settling on a technical position with
Merrill Lynch. In addition, the companies all offered her signing
bonuses of $2,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anyone in computer science complaining about
the job market,'' Langford said.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Dan Chun, 21, an economics major at the University of
California at Berkeley. Chun has felt secure enough in his job
prospects to turn down several offers that paid as much as $32,500
but weren't exactly what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying not to rush into things,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of opportunity out there. It's a matter of being patient. My ideal
job would be an equity analyst who evaluates companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong job market isn't limited to top-tier universities
like Berkeley and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   At California State University at Hayward, accounting majors are
choosing from multiple job offers ranging from $30,000 to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer science students are also doing very well,'' said
Sharron O'Connor, coordinator of campus recruiting at CSU Hayward.
``I've seen companies like Bank of America offering $40,000 and
high-tech companies offering $50,000. I was stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   But few liberal arts grads _ no matter what college they go to _
are garnering salaries comparable to students with computer or
financial skills.
</P>
<P>
   A national NACE survey released this week concluded that English
majors are being offered an average of $28,272, and psychology
majors are being offered an average of $26,955. That's much less
than the average of $46,562 for computer science majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What English majors have to do is realize there's a short-term
and a long-term game,'' advised Woolley. ``In the short term,
engineering majors get better compensation. But in the long term,
companies are looking for people who can manage other people, which
means they're looking for people with good analytical, presentation
and motivation skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Recruiting
</P>
<P>
   College career advisers noted one big new development in
1998-99: Students and companies use the Internet more than ever as
part of recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   UC Berkeley has a system that allows students to post their
resumes on the career center's Web page and then e-mail their
resumes to individual employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's convenient: You just push a button and e-mail it
to them,'' said Chun, the economics major.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also had a similar impact at San Francisco
State University, where about 50 firms conducted on-campus
interviews this year _ down from the 100 to 200 in past years.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that fewer firms were recruiting students: It was that
many used the Internet for their initial search and screening. Then
they asked their chosen candidates to come for an interview at the
company's site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools like Berkeley, Stanford and Harvard will probably
always have on-campus recruiting,'' said Bob Barzan, manager of
employer relations at S.F. State's career office. ``But second-tier
schools like S.F. State are getting much more into `virtual
recruiting.' Eventually, it will all be on the Web, and students
will go off campus to do their interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Startup Allure
</P>
<P>
   What are new grads looking for in a job in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Salary is important, of course. But _ well aware that they're
not going to stay at one job or one company for life _ many members
of the class of '98 say their priority is a job that builds their
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Langford, for instance, chose Merrill Lynch over other blue-chip
firms such as AT&AMP;T, IBM and American Express because of its
training program.
</P>
<P>
   The company will train Langford for two months in how the
securities industry works, then for four months in its own
technology systems. After that it, will rotate her through four
different positions over two years, including a six-month rotation
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for an employer who will help them develop
a portfolio of skills, since they don't see themselves staying at
that first job for many years,'' said Tom Devlin, director of the
career center at UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs at startups are the goal of a growing number of students,
especially at schools like Stanford with close ties to Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, engineering students even organized a job fair
solely focused on startup firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of students avoiding big companies like
Hewlett-Packard because they're looking for the excitement of a
startup,'' said Lance Choy, assistant director of Stanford's career
development center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be the next Jerry Yang,'' agreed Stanford
sophomore Tim Choi, referring to the founder of Yahoo. ``For me,
it's not so much the money but the excitement _ feeling like you're
part of a team, making a contribution to the development of
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all students, of course, are as focused as Choi or Langford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just completely lost, and I'm graduating in May,'' said
Adel Nadji, an English major at UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   And some are focused _ but not on making money or launching
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Ciel Yogis, another Berkeley English major, plans to look for
part-time work that will allow her to continue tutoring high school
students in poetry. ``I know I'm sacrificing big bucks to do what I
love,'' she said.

 Phone Bills Get Easier to Read
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Reading your phone bill is about to get a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission passed rules yesterday
that will make phone bills simpler and clearer for consumers to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, the FCC receives more than 10,000 calls from
customers with questions about their phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies will now be required to list _ in plain English
_ exactly what customers are being billed for.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are intended to help consumers understand their bills
and protect them from two troubling trends _ ``slamming'' and
``cramming.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 consumers contacted the FCC last year with
complaints about ``slamming'' _ the unauthorized switching of a
person's long-distance carrier. The agency also received calls
about companies that ``cram'' unauthorized charges onto a person's
phone bill and hide them with confusing language.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard, who has said even he has trouble
understanding his phone bills, said the ``truth-in-billing''
requirements will help customers root through the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, phone companies will be required to indicate
when a new service provider _ such as a long-distance carrier _
appears on a customer's bill. Flagging new companies is intended to
help customers realize when they've been slammed.
</P>
<P>
   The bills must also include a brief description of each charge _
from explanations of a monthly access fee to descriptions of
call-waiting and voice-mail charges.
</P>
<P>
   Names of all service providers must also be clearly listed on
the bills, along with a way to contact each one.
</P>
<P>
   The rules apply only to local and long-distance carriers.
Wireless companies are exempt from the rules for now, but the FCC
said it may take another look at wireless in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The changes could take effect in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said customers will benefit from the FCC's
action, especially as competition in the phone market continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an inordinate amount of confusion regarding phone
bills and this is a step in the right direction,'' said Kelly Boyd,
senior telecommunications analyst with the Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, the consumer arm of the state Public Utilities
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said the rules, combined with steps the California
Legislature has recently taken to curb phone fraud, will help
customers understand what they're paying for each month.
</P>
<P>
   But in order for the rules to have any effect, customers must do
one thing, she said. ``People are going to have to start reading
their phone bills.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Corp., the parent company of Pacific Bell,
said it has already made significant changes to make its bills
easier to read but will follow the FCC's ruling and make them even
more ``customer-friendly.''

 Column: Needs of the Many vs. the Few
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By Ilana DeBare &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I'm a new manager who last month hired an assistant for
clerical support. When she reported to work, she had a canine
companion dog with her and indicated it was medically necessary.
Since then, I've been dealing with complaints from other employees
about allergic reactions to dog hair. One employee is even on
Ventolin (an asthma drug) because of dog-induced symptoms, and her
physician has requested that she work in a dog-free environment.
What should I do? I don't know which is worse, the prospect of
workers' compensation claims by the allergic employees or a
possible Americans With Disabilities Act violation suit by the
employee with the dog.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Believe it or not, you're not the first manager
who has been in a situation like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has happened before, not only involving workers with dog
allergies but workers with dog phobias,'' said Erica Jones,
executive director of the Pacific Disability &AMP; Business Technical
Assistance Center, a nonprofit group that helps companies figure
out how to accommodate disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act requires companies to
provide a ``reasonable accommodation'' to help disabled employees
do their job. But ``reasonable'' doesn't include making other
workers ill.
</P>
<P>
   Brainstorm with your assistant about alternative ways to meet
her needs. Talk to the allergic employees about their needs too.
You should also consult with your company's human resources
department or with a lawyer who has handled ADA issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some possibilities to consider:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Does she need to keep the dog with her all day in the office, &LR; 
 &UR; or just coming and going to work?  &LR; Perhaps the dog could be kept in
a kennel area elsewhere in the building for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Could your assistant work in an office with a door that &LR; 
 &UR; closes?  &LR; Keeping the dog in her office could minimize the spread of
allergens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Would providing small air purifiers on employees' desks help &LR; 
 &UR; with their allergies?  &LR; Might it help to move their desks _ say,
putting them near a window that opens or near a duct that
circulates fresh air?
</P>
<P>
   ``What has worked in other cases is isolating the person with
the dog in one area, so it can't wander all around the office,''
said Jones. ``No one with an allergy should be required to enter
the area where the dog is kept.''
</P>
<P>
   If you truly can't come up with a solution to the allergy
problems, you may have to dismiss the employee with the dog. Be
sure you've consulted a lawyer before you do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ADA requires you to provide accommodations, but not if
they create an undue hardship like interfering with your ability to
provide a safe workplace for other employees,'' said David Durham,
an attorney with Littler Mendelson who represents employers.
</P>
<P>
   Want help coming up with creative ways to accommodate an
employee's disability? Contact the Pacific DBTAC or its sister
organizations in other parts of the country at (800) 949-4232 or
 &LR; www.adata.org/dbtac.htm.  &LR; Or contact the federally funded Job
Accommodation Network at (800) 526-7234 or at
 &LR; janweb.icdi.wvu.edu. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Sour Ending
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Q: I was working for a small business with only three people
on staff _ the owner, myself and one other employee. After about a
month, the owner decided to let the two of us go due to lack of
sales. He said he'd give us severance but would have to work out
the numbers. In the end, though, he gave us only two days' notice
and no severance pay. Is this legal? We were doing a good job and
deserve better treatment than this.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: Your layoff was no doubt frustrating and painful, but it
was also completely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are considered ``at will'' employees, which means
their company can terminate them at any time for any reason (as
long as it isn't done on a discriminatory basis).
</P>
<P>
   Companies aren't required to provide any kind of severance pay
to at-will employees who are laid off. Many large firms do so
voluntarily, but small ones like yours often can't afford it. And
with only a month on the job, you wouldn't have qualified for much
of a severance package at even the biggest company.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet is to focus on the future _ conduct an active job
hunt and stay on good terms with your former boss. A glowing
reference from him may help you more in the long run than a $500
severance check.
</P>
<P>
   800 Resumes Later ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: I graduated last year with a bachelor's in engineering. Since
then I have sent out over 800 resumes but have not had a single
interview. I've tried about three dozen recruiters, newspapers and
home pages. I've had my resume written by a professional. And I
frequently use 36 different job search and job-related sites on the
Internet. I don't know what to do anymore. Got any advice?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Something is definitely wrong with this picture _ and
with this job search strategy. There's no way anyone should need to
send out 800 resumes to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like you've been focusing on the quantity of your
contacts rather than the quality. Stop mailing out resumes blindly
to any entity with an ``Inc.'' or a ``Corp.'' after its name.
Instead, you should:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Find an experienced career coach or counselor to help you &LR; 
 &UR; assess your goals.  &LR; Make sure you apply for jobs that are
appropriate to your level of experience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Rehearse how you present yourself to potential employers.  &LR; Get
friends to critique your approach. Companies want workers with good
``people skills'' as well as technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Research companies before you apply, and only apply to ones &LR; 
 &UR; that seem to be a good fit.  &LR; Your cover letters should convey your
understanding of the company's business and explain how your
specific skills and background would meet its needs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Make personal contacts.  &LR; Despite the glamour of the Internet,
millions of people still get jobs the old-fashioned way _ word of
mouth. So talk to family friends and former teachers. Talk to
fellow grads who now have jobs. Check with your college's career
office for names of older alumni in your field, and talk to them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Ask all of these contacts for advice on getting your foot in the
door. Ask them to call you if they hear of job opportunities. Write
them thank-you notes. And touch base with them periodically. One
real, live lead from a human being could end up being worth a
hundred blindly strewn resumes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Send your work and career questions to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San
Francisco Chronicle, 901 Mission St., San Francisco 94103. Or send

FLEET BESEIGED WITH OFFERS TO BUY BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- From Lilliputian savings and loans to Brobdingnagian
national banks, a crush of financial institutions is clamoring to
acquire the branches that Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston
Corp. will sell as a condition of their planned merger.
</P>
<P>
   But despite exhortations from politicians and activists that
small local players be allowed to purchase the assets, regulators
overseeing the process are likely to insist that only larger
buyers, based outside the region, be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston will ultimately select the winning bidders.
But the US Justice Department and the Federal Reserve Board will
set the terms of the auction by determining how big a bank must be
in order to make an offer in what amounts to the largest US bank
divestiture in US history.
</P>
<P>
   While the divestiture process is cloaked in secrecy, recent
conversations with nearly a dozen banking industry lawyers,
consultants, investment bankers, and antitrust analysts all point
to regulators requiring at least one big competitor being brought
into New England _ a first for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't say it publicly, but the regulators take the view
that a large, out-of-region institution should be allowed to come
in and buy all the assets,'' said a bank executive close to
Fleet-BankBoston's divestiture plans.
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrew Hodgkin, a lawyer at Brown, Rudnick, Freed &AMP;
Gesmer: ``Federal regulators feel that they need to attract a large
bank acquirer to compete with Fleet-BankBoston.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston's $15 billion deal is the first significant
``in-market'' merger, or combination of two banks in the same
geographic marketplace, in several years. Moreover, it is the first
time a major banking market _ in this case, New England, the
nation's 6th largest _ will be reduced to one dominant player.
</P>
<P>
   With Fleet and BankBoston soon to be the nation's eighth-largest
bank, with $178 billion in assets before divestiture, New England's
other players may not be large enough serve as the big new
competitor that regulators will likely require.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Financial Group Inc. _ now the area's third-largest
bank, but only one-tenth the size of the combined Fleet-BankBoston
_ serves depositors more than businesses, and may not qualify as
the right kind of competitor. While a strong corporate lender, UST
Corp., fourth in size, would still not be a big player even after
buying all the branches to be divested. That in theory leaves one
type of bidder for the Fleet and BankBoston outlets: bigger banks,
with at least $50 billion or so in assets, from other regions.
``Justice has a strong preference for big, national players as
bidders,'' said a New York investment banker, adding that the
agency wanted a single large financial institution to buy the
entire Massachusetts lot.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston propose to sell 200 Fleet branches in
Massachusetts, more than 30 BankBoston branches in Connecticut, and
nearly 45 in Rhode Island, all to meet antitrust rules designed to
ensure that no one bank dominates a market. In Massachusetts, the
combined Fleet-BankBoston has 40 percent of deposits before
divestiture, 10 percent above allowed levels.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies want to sell the outlets, which hold $13.6
billion in assets, in three lots, each by state.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston won't discuss buyers, while regulators
rarely discuss their views at all. ``Because of the sheer size of
the divestiture, there will de facto be competition in the
marketplace and consumers will continue to have choices,'' Fleet
spokesman James Mahoney said, declining to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, the Justice Department is polling smaller
banks and businesses for their views on how the merger will affect
them, while the Fed is studying market concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Once regulators decide how big a bank must be in terms of
assets, deposits, and commercial lending practices in order to bid
for the branches, Fleet and BankBoston can sell to whomever they
wish _ presumably the highest bidder. The two banks bounced their
divestiture plans off regulators in Washington before announcing
their blockbuster deal last month. Regulators will formally
consider the combined bank's divestiture plan in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Fleet and BankBoston are preparing to entertain
bidders. Sources close to the process _ for which bidding will open
next month, with a sale to be finalized in June _ said several big
banks, including BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank, have already
expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   That is likely to upset state politicians and activists. From
eight Massachusetts congressmen to Governor Paul Cellucci to
affordable lending activists, local officials have said smaller
area players, not out-of-region giants, can compete best with the
new behemoth because they know the market better.
</P>
<P>
   Interest from bigger banks is also likely to roil smaller fry,
including Bank of Rhode Island _ which wants to buy the Rhode
Island branches _ and People's Heritage Financial Group Inc. in
Portland, Maine, which covets some of the branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller bankers are all hoping and praying it will be
split up into chunks,'' said Joel Shamon, who heads the banking
practice of Arthur Anderson, the accounting, auditing, and
consulting firm. ``But it's probably just not going to happen.'' In
the past, bank divestitures have produced varying results.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two rounds in New England, the banks allowed by
regulators to bid for branches were all area players but ranged in
scale from puny to mid-sized. When Fleet bought Shawmut National
Corp. in 1995, a deal that produced the third-biggest branch
divestiture ever, the outlets were sold to small local players or
spun off as new, tiny banks. Regulators did not require a big
company to buy the Shawmut branches because BankBoston was still
around as an independent competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Things were different a year later, when Bank of Boston acquired
BayBanks Inc. For that divestiture, regulators wanted a big
competitor to the newly bulked-up Fleet. Overlapping outlets were
sold in one lot not to community banks but to UST, which qualified
on the strength of its commercial lending practice.
</P>
<P>
   In other major in-market combinations across the country,
branches have gone to small banks as well as bigger players.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are less preoccupied with consumers having convenient
branches and automated teller machines and more concerned with
where small and mid-size businesses will go for commercial loans.
Bank lawyers say small banks lack the sophisticated lending
products businesses need.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever buys the Fleet and BankBoston branches and deposits will
still be only one-tenth the size of the combined Fleet-BankBoston
in New England. The region exemplifies a consolidating industry
that is leaving a handful of megabanks at one end and legions of
community banks at the other.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, of course, banks angling for the branches may be
eyeing Fleet-BankBoston itself as an acquisition target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the view that eventually somebody like BankAmerica is
going to come into the region,'' said a BankBoston executive. ``In
that sense, it doesn't really matter who we sell to.''

INS TO MAKE HOUSTON A HUB FOR DETAINEES 
 

</HEADLINE>
 PLAN-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JO ANN ZUNIGA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service plans to
make Houston a hub city for deporting Latin American and Caribbean
detainees, and Chicago a hub for Europeans, Asians and Africans,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But immigrant advocates say the plan, designed for cost
efficiency, could affect people's due-process rights and separate
immigrants farther from their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most immigrants are detained in the cities where they
arrived or live. About 4,300 are currently in detention in the INS'
18-state central region _ stretching from Texas to New Mexico to
Wisconsin and the Dakotas. About $80 million a year is spent on
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and surrounding counties have about 867 detainees facing
deportation, most of them in the Corrections Corporation of America
facility near Bush Intercontinental Airport. The rest are in nearby
county jails.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the detained immigrants, both undocumented
and permanent legal residents, have criminal records, including
convictions for driving while intoxicated and nonviolent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest are illegal immigrants arrested at their
workplaces or are seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the ``Central Region's Hub Site Detention and
Removals Plan'' has a tentative start date of May 1, but district
director INS Richard Cravener in Houston said it may be delayed to
gather public input.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that we need to be as efficient as we can be. And
we agree it is beneficial for all to reduce time waiting in jail,''
Cravener said.
</P>
<P>
   The hub plan, first proposed eight weeks ago by the Houston
district, says deportation time and effort would be reduced because
both Houston and Chicago are served by international airlines and
have foreign consulates, unlike Omaha, Kansas City, St. Paul and
other cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Regional INS spokeswoman Mariela Melero in Dallas said five of
the region's hub cities will be in Texas _ Houston, San Antonio,
Dallas, El Paso and Harlingen, Texas _ and two others will be in
Chicago and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Melero said immigrants are detained from three to six months,
but more difficult cases of asylum or continuing appeals can take
up to two years. It is less expensive to house detainees in INS
facilities than in jails, which charge $50 to $70 per day per
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   But critics question whether there will be any savings, saying
that in all likelihood, more jail space will be needed in the hub
cities.
</P>
<P>
   They also raised legal considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an immigrant has an attorney in one city and is sent to
another city, it would interrupt legal representation of their
case, said Maria Jimenez, Houston director of the American Friends
Service Committee.
</P>

 &HT;    American casualties `probable'
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior defense officials Thursday began preparing
the American public for the prospect of U.S. deaths in the war in
Kosovo, telling a congressional panel that American casualties were
no longer merely possible but ``probable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that we could carry out this kind of a mission in
this circumstance with only the possibility of casualties would be
misleading,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Armed
Services Committee. ``It's probabilities, and we ought to expect
that, anticipate it and nonetheless persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, joined by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Hugh Shelton, expressed regret over the NATO bombing Wednesday that
killed dozens of civilians traveling in a convoy through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen released few new details about the incident, but said the
NATO pilot who fired the missile was under ground attack from
surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``An error did in fact occur, but it was under extraordinary
circumstances,'' Cohen said. ``You've got pilots who are traveling
at four or five hundred (miles per hour), or perhaps even in excess
of the speed of sound, having to make split-second
determinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meantime, also appeared
before Congress on Thursday and defended NATO's actions in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   She told the House Appropriations Committee's foreign operations
subcommittee that NATO's bombing will ``break the back'' of
Serbia's military in the region and create a new balance of power
between the KLA and the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also said the flood of refugees and their brutal
treatment have steeled NATO against Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions, far from destroying his opposition, are
galvanizing its strength and determination,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton, during their three hours of testimony in the
Senate and during an afternoon appearance before the House Armed
Services Committee, faced sometimes sharp questions from lawmakers
over the potential use of U.S. ground troops in Kosovo, the cost of
the mission and its impact on American readiness around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner (R-Va.) and
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who have been critical of the U.S.
refusal to at least consider ground troops, told Cohen that taking
ground troops out of the military formula played into Milosevic's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the United States had no choice because other NATO
allies would not have supported any military action against Serbia
that included ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have seen something comparable to ... `No Exit,'
where the NATO members would have debated endlessly in a dangling
conversation, never taking any action, while the extermination
policy was taking place on an installment basis on the part of
Milosevic,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said any effort to revive the ground troop debate within
NATO could fracture the alliance and divert attention from the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Cohen suggested that the air strikes could
weaken Milosevic to the point where resistance forces in Kosovo
could wage war against him and help bring him back to the
negotiating table. Cohen rejected a suggestion from Sen. Joseph
Lieberman (D-Conn.) that the United States seek to arm the
resistance effort.
</P>
<P>
   Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma called the NATO campaign ``a
war that we should not be in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do everything I can to stop us from getting into a
protracted war,'' Inhofe said. ``This is a civil war that's been
going on in that sovereign nation for many, many years. We're
talking about centuries. And there are some bad guys on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) told Shelton and Cohen that he did not
believe the conflict in Kosovo is a threat to American national
security, and he compared the bombing campaign to the strategy in
Vietnam, where he was wounded as an Army captain 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the tragedies of Vietnam was that it was no win and no
exit,'' Cleland said. ``We can't make Kosovo the 51st state.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland also repeated his opposition to the use of ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need an open-ended, ill-defined commitment of
American ground forces in the Balkans,'' he said. ``I know what it
means to be a troop out there committed in behalf of this country
and have this country divided,'' he said. ``It is not fun. It is
not what we want to repeat.

 Column: Heavy Metal Guys, the Cyclicals, Get Their Moment in
the  Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Let's hear it for the smokestack stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm basically a Rust Belt guy at heart. And while I know most of
you have silicon running in your veins, please indulge me this
brief shining moment for the heavy metal guys, the ``cyclicals.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the group of stocks that are connected at the hip with
economic data and commodity prices. Which means, regardless of how
well or poorly management run their businesses, external factors
such as global economic crises, currency fluctuations and energy
prices often play a controlling hand in determining their fates.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, it wasn't American Express, IBM and Wal-Mart that
carried the day for the Dow Jones industrial average _ which closed
up about 0.5 percent at 10,463. Instead it was economically
sensitive stalwarts like Boeing, Caterpillar, B.F. Goodrich and
DuPont that awoke from their slumber.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the makers of planes, bulldozers, tires and Teflon
were the markets' engines yesterday. Meantime, Internet stocks took
it on their virtual chins as the Nasdaq recovered to close up 0.6
percent to 2,522 after an unusually ugly showing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers seemed to be taking some tech and drug profits off
the table and began shifting them into cheaper stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific that the market is starting to recognize
some of these undervalued stocks,'' says Bill Vlahos, a San
Francisco money manager with about $70 million under management.
</P>
<P>
   So what triggered the shift?
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last couple of weeks, there has been some evidence
to the effect that the whole Asian economic crisis has bottomed,''
says Carson Levit, a portfolio manager for Dresdner RCM Global
Investors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of widely held technology and health care
stocks have been hot, carrying the bulk of the load because ``they
were not as affected by the global economic crisis as some other
industries,'' Levit says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of those shares have grown so expensive that their
sales projections and other forward-looking measurements of
potential growth can't possibly maintain a pace that justify their
hefty price, says Luke Mazur, chief investment officer for Highmark
Capital Management in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, investors are looking to plunk down some cash in sectors
that have been inhaling exhaust during the past 18 months or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see some strength in manufacturing.
There are some initial signs that Southeast Asia's economy is
moving sideways, (which is better than) going down,'' Mazur says.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Boeing should be a beneficiary of an economic
rebound in Asia, which has buoyed investor optimism. The Seattle
aircraft-maker saw its stock soar about 20 percent this week,
lifting almost 4 points yesterday to $41.69 on first quarter
earnings that beat Wall Street's estimate by 8 cents per share.
What's more, Boeing's earnings per share of 50 cents was a ninefold
improvement compared to the same quarter a year ago
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Boeing's stellar financial performance was propelled
by the fact that it is making planes faster and better. But it
probably won't feel the actual benefits of any improvement in Asia,
where it sells about a third of its jets, until 2001 because of the
long lead time involved in building commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, which is the world's largest maker of construction
equipment, saw its shares jump as economic news from Brazil, which
is a key export market, began to brighten. Shares of the Peoria,
Ill., heavy-equipment-maker also may have been boosted by positive
expectations for its quarterly earnings, which are slated for
release today.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of the millions of jobs being created by the
technology revolution in Santa Clara county, how can you not root
for heavy hitters like Boeing and Caterpillar?
</P>
<P>
   These are truly international companies that create thousands of
well-paying, domestic jobs for skilled workers toiling in huge
factories that make stuff _ massive stuff. Cat, for example,
assembles mining trucks that are so huge they must be shipped in
pieces overseas to strip mines in South America, where they are
assembled on the dusty floors of cavernous mineral pits.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing, for its part, can't exactly ship its product via
Federal Express _ in fact, Boeing sells its products to Federal
Express. The company parks its excess inventory in the middle of
the desert before being flown overseas to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but that's a heck of a lot more complicated and
impressive than Yahoo launching a Web site in Germany. The
cyclicals work so much harder for their sometimes-elusive earnings
than software firms or banks. And yet, even when they are at the
top of their game, these export-driven stocks can get slammed by
unforeseen economic bombshells or surprise hikes in the value of
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, cyclicals aren't for everyone because they
eventually get whacked. Hence, the root of their moniker (cycle).
They aren't ``buy-and-holds'' like Coke or Cisco and should be left
to the pros who can deftly time their moves in and out of such
stocks, Mazur says.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric is a ``secular'' stock one might hang on to.
But General Motors is a cyclical stock that ultimately ebbs and
flows with economic fundamentals, like unemployment and fuel
prices. Still, for now, it is refreshing to see this phenomenal
bull market being pushed higher by a group of Dow blue chips that
reminds us why they call it ``the industrial average.''

REGULATORS DEBATE `LOCAL' INTERNET CALL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Every day thousands of consumers across Massachusetts
dial a local phone number to gain access to the Internet. Now state
regulators are trying to decide whether those calls are really
local and who should pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is amazingly complex and the stakes incredibly high,
with some parties to the dispute warning of an Internet meltdown
and others dismissing it all as a scam perpretrated by a handful of
opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   If the regulators decide Internet connections should continue to
be considered local calls, Bell Atlantic says it will have to raise
local phone rates to all customers, not just Internet users, to
cover $150 million in annual fees it will have to pay to other
local phone companies in the state handling the Internet calls.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, if the state says Internet connections are
long-distance calls, Bell Atlantic will be spared these fees, but
then the other local phone companies say they will be forced to
charge Internet service providers more.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around the definition of a local phone call
and how the costs of transporting that call should be distributed.
Most people think Bell Atlantic is the state's only local phone
company, but actually there are hundreds of them, big and tiny,
competing primarily for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   When a Bell Atlantic customer makes a local phone call to a
customer of a different local phone company, contracts between the
two companies require Bell Atlantic to charge its customer for the
call and then compensate the other phone company for completing it.
</P>
<P>
   But when the other phone company takes the call and routes it to
an Internet service provider that connects the caller to the
Internet and anywhere in the world, is it still a local phone call?
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic says that under current regulation it will have to
pay out at least $150 million this year in local connection fees to
``make-believe local phone companies'' that complete what it
believes are really long-distance calls to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unless state regulators halt the so-called reciprocal
compensation fees, Bell Atlantic says it will have to sharply boost
its rates, the equivalent of $2.80 a month per phone line, enough
to wipe out five years of rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The companies handling the calls going out on the Internet fire
back that Bell Atlantic is trying to walk away from contractual
commitments and drive them out of business. They warn that the cost
of Internet access will skyrocket if Bell Atlantic prevails because
they will have to pass on higher costs to Internet service
providers. They in turn would likely pass them on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the current system is overturned,'' warns Katherine P.
White, an AT&AMP;T vice president, ``we will deep-six this national
resource we call the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are huge for everybody involved,'' said Paul
Vasington, a commissioner at the state Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, which is expected to rule on the
matter in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy
ruled the Internet connections are local calls and required Bell
Atlantic to pay the compensation fees, which average about a penny
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   In February, however, the Federal Communications Commission
ruled the calls were long distance but left it up to individual
states to decide whether the current compensation arrangement
should be altered. The FCC said it intended to work out a new
compensation arrangement sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to pay out the reciprocal compensation
fees, Bell Atlantic is placing the money in escrow pending the
DTE's decision. For some of Bell Atlantic's competitors, the loss
of revenue is already taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Koch, president of RNK Telecom Inc. of Stoughton,
said he laid off 16 of his 21 employees last month, but has since
rehired four. He said Bell Atlantic currently owes his company
about $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gangi, president of Global NAPs in Quincy, handles phone
traffic from about 1 million people in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire seeking access to the Internet. He said he receives about
$1 million a month from Bell Atlantic for handling those calls.
</P>
<P>
   If he is ultimately denied that revenue, Gangi said he will be
forced to dramatically increase the fees he charges Internet
service providers. He said those fee increases will get passed
along to Internet customers in the form of much higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Gangi started out as an Internet service provider himself. He
said he reluctantly got into the phone business because Bell
Atlantic was doing such a poor job of servicing him. He said he has
invested millions of dollars in his business on the assumption of
receiving the reciprocal compensation fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic has more lawyers than I have employees,'' he
said. ``They knew what they were getting themselves into. They
thought the traffic was going to go their way. They got hoisted on
their own petard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Mudge, a Bell Atlantic vice president, said companies
like Global NAPs have set up businesses relying on the revenues
from what he called a regulatory loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rolled the dice that this would be ruled local traffic.
They guessed wrong,'' he said. ``The Internet will survive without
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge dismissed the fears that the price of Internet access will
soar if the reciprocal compensation fees are ended for Internet
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only consumer threat here is that the consumers in
Massachusetts could get caught footing the bill while a handful of
make-believe local phone companies get rich,'' he said.

TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY CASH IS A CHARMING EVENING OF MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Cash appears in the last few minutes of TNT's tribute to
him and his enormous body of work Sunday, singing ``Folsom Prison
Blues'' and leading guest performers in a chorus of ``I Walk the
Line.'' But as the concert was being taped on April 6 at the
Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City, producers of the two-hour
special weren't even sure if the man in black could perform.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has Shy-Drager syndrome, a neurological disorder whose
symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. His energy
sapped, he hadn't performed on a stage in more than a year and a
half.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Cash found the strength to put the perfect finish on a
perfectly charming evening of music. Billed as an ``All-Star
Tribute to Johnny Cash,'' this second concert in TNT's ``Masters
Series'' emphasizes the broad appeal Cash's music has had for four
decades and millions of fans. Defying labels the way Cash has
always defied convention, the guest list spans the genres: Brooks &AMP;
Dunn, Mary Chapin Carpenter, June Carter Cash, Sheryl Crow, Bob
Dylan, the Fairfield Four, Emmylou Harris, Chris Isaak, Wyclef
Jean, Kris Kristofferson, Lyle Lovett, Dave Matthews, the
Mavericks, Willie Nelson, Bruce Springsteen, Marty Stuart, U2 and
Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted with great dignity by Jon Voight, the special is a
tasteful, uncluttered reminder of how poor we'd be in a Cash-less
society.

`LIFE' A NICE CHANGE OF PACE FOR EDDIE MURPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy told the press late last year that his next film,
``Life,'' would be something different, and he's basically made
good on the promise. It's a big change-of-pace for him in a couple
of ways, and one of his more enjoyable vehicles in some time.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, he's sharing the movie (and the above-the-title
billing) with another comedian _ Martin Lawrence. While Murphy
became a star off a buddy movie, ``48 Hrs.,'' this is the first
time he's dared to team up with another star comedian.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, this gamble works. The two comics play off each
other well, and Murphy comes out slightly ahead in the laugh
contest. Murphy may have finally learned the lesson that too much
of him is oppressive, and he's better in smaller doses.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, ``Life'' is the first Murphy vehicle that actually
flirts here and there with being a serious film. It's partially a
prison drama with conscious nods to such classics in the genre as
``Papillon,'' ``Cool Hand Luke'' and ``I Am a Fugitive From a Chain
Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   In its own light-hearted, rambling way, it also works in this
department _ though it's very much a cotton-candy view of
chain-gang life that never tries very hard to be an honest
examination of the dehumanizing effects of life in a Southern
prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of con man Raymond Gibson (Murphy) and earnest
bank clerk Claude Banks (Lawrence), who meet in a Harlem nightclub
one night in 1932 when Ray picks Claude's pocket in the men's room
just before both men run afoul of a big-time gangster (Rick James).
</P>
<P>
   To exonerate themselves, the mismatched pair agree to transport
a truckload of liquor to the Deep South. On the way, they're framed
for murder by a crooked Southern sheriff, and end up with a life
sentence on a Mississippi prison farm.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie covers the pair's adjustment to a tedious
prison life, their numerous escape attempts and their off again, on
again friendship over the next 65 years, via sequences set in 1944,
1972, and the present day.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Ted Demme (``Beautiful Girls,''
``Monument Ave.''), who seems an unlikely choice for a Murphy
comedy, but has come through nicely _ giving the proceedings just
the right tight, fast pace, and a succession of clever and original
directorial touches.
</P>
<P>
   As much as any Murphy comedy, ``Life'' is also an ensemble
piece, with memorable moments not only from Lawrence but a large
cast that includes Clarence Williams III, Obba Babatunde, Bernie
Mac, Bokeem Woodbine, Rick James, Barry Shabaka Henley and Nick
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a strong showcase for ace makeup artist Rick
Baker. Making a familiar face age convincingly over more than half
a century is the most challenging makeup task imaginable, and Baker
does it so well with both stars that his work is almost sure to be
remembered come Oscar time.
</P>
<P>
   Life. Directed by Ted Demme. Written by Robert Ramsey &AMP; Matthew
Stone. Cast: Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Ned Beatty, Clarence
Williams III, Bernie Mac, Bokeem Woodbine. Universal. 105 minutes.
Rated R for language and prison-sex references.

NOT MUCH HUMOR OR SPARK IN `METROLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hero of the offbeat but unsatisfying British coming-of-age
drama, ``Metroland,'' is a thirtysomething ad man named Chris
(Christian Bale), who lives in the button-down, London
commuter-suburb of the title with his wife (Emily Watson) and baby
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film is set in 1977, at the tail end of the
counterculture. But it flashes back to 1963, when the teenaged
Chris and his best mate Toni (Lee Ross) are big dreamers eager to
escape their suburban existence; and to 1968, when Chris is a
struggling photographer in Left Bank Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The 1977 Chris is reasonably content with his routine existence,
but he occasionally pines for the more passionate lost love of his
Paris days (Elsa Zylberstein), he secretly fears he may have ``sold
out,'' and he envies the lifestyle of his pal Toni, now a wandering
poet.
</P>
<P>
   These feelings come to a head when Toni drops in from a
Stateside sojourn, and seems to go on a Mephistophelian campaign to
show Chris exactly what he's been missing in the way of personal
freedom, creative expression and sexual promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the boyhood pals is the real loser _ the one with the
job and family, or the dope-smoking hippie? When the well-respected
novel on which the film was based was first published in 1980,
there might have been some suspense in that question, but in 1999
it's a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in a sense, the movie is the flip side of the recent, ``A
Walk On the Moon,'' making an opposing argument that Western
Civilization wasn't much changed by the '60s _ that most people of
the era ultimately made the choices Chris made, and are much better
off for it.
</P>
<P>
   Conceptually, the film is unique _ it's a kind of nostalgia
movie within a nostalgia movie. And the cast _ especially Watson,
playing her first stable character in a film, and the always
reliable Bale, arguably England's best young actor _ is strong.
</P>
<P>
   But director Philip Saville can't quite find the humor in the
story, even the best performances can't quite make their mundane
characters seem worthy of much attention, and the script gives a
constrained sense of having been overly faithful to its source
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Metroland. Directed by Philip Saville. Screenplay by Adrian
Hodges, from the novel by Julian Barnes. Cast: Christian Bale,
Emily Watson, Lee Ross, Elsa Zylberstein. Lions Gate Films. 101
minutes. Unrated but contains nudity and sex scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

REGULATORS DEBATE `LOCAL' INTERNET CALL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Every day thousands of consumers across Massachusetts
dial a local phone number to gain access to the Internet. Now state
regulators are trying to decide whether those calls are really
local and who should pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is amazingly complex and the stakes incredibly high,
with some parties to the dispute warning of an Internet meltdown
and others dismissing it all as a scam perpretrated by a handful of
opportunists.
</P>
<P>
   If the regulators decide Internet connections should continue to
be considered local calls, Bell Atlantic says it will have to raise
local phone rates to all customers, not just Internet users, to
cover $150 million in annual fees it will have to pay to other
local phone companies in the state handling the Internet calls.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, if the state says Internet connections are
long-distance calls, Bell Atlantic will be spared these fees, but
then the other local phone companies say they will be forced to
charge Internet service providers more.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute revolves around the definition of a local phone call
and how the costs of transporting that call should be distributed.
Most people think Bell Atlantic is the state's only local phone
company, but actually there are hundreds of them, big and tiny,
competing primarily for business customers.
</P>
<P>
   When a Bell Atlantic customer makes a local phone call to a
customer of a different local phone company, contracts between the
two companies require Bell Atlantic to charge its customer for the
call and then compensate the other phone company for completing it.
</P>
<P>
   But when the other phone company takes the call and routes it to
an Internet service provider that connects the caller to the
Internet and anywhere in the world, is it still a local phone call?
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic says that under current regulation it will have to
pay out at least $150 million this year in local connection fees to
``make-believe local phone companies'' that complete what it
believes are really long-distance calls to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Unless state regulators halt the so-called reciprocal
compensation fees, Bell Atlantic says it will have to sharply boost
its rates, the equivalent of $2.80 a month per phone line, enough
to wipe out five years of rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The companies handling the calls going out on the Internet fire
back that Bell Atlantic is trying to walk away from contractual
commitments and drive them out of business. They warn that the cost
of Internet access will skyrocket if Bell Atlantic prevails because
they will have to pass on higher costs to Internet service
providers. They in turn would likely pass them on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the current system is overturned,'' warns Katherine P.
White, an AT&AMP;T vice president, ``we will deep-six this national
resource we call the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are huge for everybody involved,'' said Paul
Vasington, a commissioner at the state Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, which is expected to rule on the
matter in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy
ruled the Internet connections are local calls and required Bell
Atlantic to pay the compensation fees, which average about a penny
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   In February, however, the Federal Communications Commission
ruled the calls were long distance but left it up to individual
states to decide whether the current compensation arrangement
should be altered. The FCC said it intended to work out a new
compensation arrangement sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to pay out the reciprocal compensation
fees, Bell Atlantic is placing the money in escrow pending the
DTE's decision. For some of Bell Atlantic's competitors, the loss
of revenue is already taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Koch, president of RNK Telecom Inc. of Stoughton,
said he laid off 16 of his 21 employees last month, but has since
rehired four. He said Bell Atlantic currently owes his company
about $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gangi, president of Global NAPs in Quincy, handles phone
traffic from about 1 million people in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire seeking access to the Internet. He said he receives about
$1 million a month from Bell Atlantic for handling those calls.
</P>
<P>
   If he is ultimately denied that revenue, Gangi said he will be
forced to dramatically increase the fees he charges Internet
service providers. He said those fee increases will get passed
along to Internet customers in the form of much higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Gangi started out as an Internet service provider himself. He
said he reluctantly got into the phone business because Bell
Atlantic was doing such a poor job of servicing him. He said he has
invested millions of dollars in his business on the assumption of
receiving the reciprocal compensation fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic has more lawyers than I have employees,'' he
said. ``They knew what they were getting themselves into. They
thought the traffic was going to go their way. They got hoisted on
their own petard.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Mudge, a Bell Atlantic vice president, said companies
like Global NAPs have set up businesses relying on the revenues
from what he called a regulatory loophole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rolled the dice that this would be ruled local traffic.
They guessed wrong,'' he said. ``The Internet will survive without
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge dismissed the fears that the price of Internet access will
soar if the reciprocal compensation fees are ended for Internet
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only consumer threat here is that the consumers in
Massachusetts could get caught footing the bill while a handful of
make-believe local phone companies get rich,'' he said.

WOMEN WITH CANCER WAIT FOR BONE-MARROW STUDY RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (With SCI-BREAST-CANCER) 
(lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, Donna Bowers' life mirrored a million
other women's lives. She juggled family and career, rearing her two
little girls and working as a lawyer and health information manager
at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. The future stretched
ahead to a far horizon, and like most people, she did not think
about the prospect of her time running out.
</P>
<P>
   That changed abruptly in February, when Ms. Bowers, who is 38
years old, found out that she had breast cancer, and that it had
already spread to the lymph nodes under her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The more cancerous lymph nodes a woman has, the worse her
prospects. Ten or more put her in a bleak zone with a high risk
that the disease will recur, spread and kill her. Ms. Bowers
learned she had 16 positive nodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was sort of devastating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And the news plunged her into a terrible dilemma: Should she
take her chances with conventional breast-cancer chemotherapy, or
risk the rigors of high-dose chemotherapy followed by a bone-marrow
transplant?
</P>
<P>
   She knew that some doctors recommend the second choice, even
though the treatment itself is so dangerous that some women die
from it. She had several friends with breast cancer who had
undergone the treatment, in which patients are given such high
doses of chemotherapy that the immune system is practically
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   To restore it, doctors usually remove some of the patient's own
bone marrow before treatment, and return it to her afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bowers' doctor, Dr. Joyce O'Shaughnessy, a breast-cancer
specialist at Baylor, did not recommend a bone-marrow transplant.
Dr. O'Shaughnessy recommended that Ms. Bowers go ahead with the
less extreme chemotherapy program and wait for the results of
several major bone-marrow transplant studies before deciding
whether to have a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   That made sense to Ms. Bowers. ``If she tells me my chances of
survival are enhanced, I would do it,'' she said. ``If the
statistics show a 10 percent increase or better, I'd probably do
it. Eight or 9 percent, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she and her husband, a doctor, decided that she
should have ``the most aggressive treatment known,'' she said. ``I
told Dr. O'Shaughnessy to load me up with the most toxic stuff she
had and I'd let her know if I could handle it. My goal is to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the results, Dr. O'Shaughnessy said she still would
not recommend a bone-marrow transplant for Ms. Bowers. But she said
she wanted to see whether the findings would change over the next
few years. And Ms. Bowers said that if her cancer should recur in
the future, she would consider having the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have already had the procedure have also been awaiting
the studies, sometimes with anxiety over what the findings might
predict about their own fate. One woman in her 30s, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``Part of me wants to know, but part
of me doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the patient described (though not named) by Dr. Jerome
Groopman, a cancer specialist at the Harvard Medical School, in a
New Yorker magazine article last fall.
</P>
<P>
   She had the treatment in January 1998 for breast cancer that had
spread, or metastasized, to her liver and bones. She knew that only
20 percent of women with metastatic breast cancer lived five years;
she had three young children, and it seemed to her that the
high-dose treatment was her only chance at survival.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tumors have disappeared and she is considered
``disease-free.'' But she is well aware that it is still too soon
to tell how long the remission will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as good as my last CT scan,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of rumors and press reports that the studies would be
negative, she said, friends and relatives had called her ahead of
time to warn her to brace herself for bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Rich, a 43-year-old writer in New York who had the
high-chemo treatment in 1995, said she felt a bit skeptical about
the negative report on metastatic cancer, because it was only one
study. ``Cancer is so complex and individual,'' she said. ``Who
knows if it's helping one kind of breast cancer and not another?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rich, who has written a book about her experience that is
scheduled to be published next fall, was first treated for breast
cancer in 1989. She learned in 1993 that the disease had spread to
her bones, including her spine. By 1994 the spinal tumors had
nearly paralyzed her. Radiation shrunk them, but she knew they
might grow back.
</P>
<P>
   She had joined a support group of about a half-dozen women who
had metastatic breast cancer, but by early 1995 all the other
members had died, including a woman whose disease had spread to her
bones. Then a mutual acquaintance told Ms. Rich that this woman
wished she had had a transplant, and she began thinking it was time
for her to consider it.
</P>
<P>
   But she knew better than to expect a cure. ``One of the really
heartbreaking things with this is that you'll find people whose
cancer comes back after a month,'' she said. ``I knew someone like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far Ms. Rich has fared better. After the treatment she
said: ``I had no evidence of disease for three years. A year ago I
had one positive node in the adrenal gland. It's just been sitting
there and hasn't done anything for about a year. It could stay that
way for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she thought the transplant had brought about her
recovery, she said, ``I have no idea if the transplant helped or
not.''

   COMBAT
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO pressed its air campaign, hitting military installations,
television transmitters and bridges throughout Serbia. Allied jets
also hit military targets in Montenegro, the second Yugoslav
republic, in the strongest attack there in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serbian forces fired artillery shells over the border into
northern Albania in a running battle with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. Foreign monitors said five Kosovar rebels had been
killed in the past 24 hours. Some shells landed close to an
Albanian checkpoint at Morini.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pentagon plans to ask the president to call up about
30,000 reservists and national guard troops for service in the
Balkans, senior officials said. _ NATO acknowledged that an allied
warplane had mistakenly bombed civilian vehicles in Kosovo on
Wednesday, and the allied commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
retracted his claim that it was Serb forces that had done the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton said the bombing of civilians was
regrettable, but would not undermine his resolve to use American
military might to end the Balkan atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   _ Some refugees who came under attack arrived in Albania with
tales of twin terrors _ Serbs who had driven them from their homes
hours earlier, then the raid by the allied plane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three thousand more Kosovars crossed into Macedonia with
reports that Yugoslav forces had ordered a train and two buses full
of ethnic Albanians back into Kosovo just after they arrived within
easy walking distance of Macedonia. The report could not be
confirmed. Since March 1998, the United Nations estimates, almost
560,000 refugees have fled Kosovo.  &QL;

COMMANDER OF ALLIED AIR WAR IS ALSO FATHER OF PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American general selecting the targets and
directing the allied air war against Yugoslavia is also commanding
his only son, who is piloting one of the A-10 jets flying missions
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Short, 55, a veteran combat pilot who flew
combat missions in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf war, has told
friends that he is quite proud that his son is one of the NATO
pilots in the air war that he is directing from the Combined Air
Operation Center in Vicenza, Italy, according to Capt. Michael
Paoli, a spokesman for Short.
</P>
<P>
   Short was the military figure who accompanied Richard Holbrooke
to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last October to deliver an ultimatum to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. When the general walked into
the presidential palace, Milosevic asked him if he was the man who
would eventually bomb Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Short answered that he could be, but that he could end up
overseeing surveillance planes if a peace accord was reached. ``The
choice is yours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, Milosevic made his choice, and Short is holed
up in the drab temporary buildings in Vicenza that are operations
headquarters, talking to the crews of advance-warning aircraft and
charting how the war is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operations center isn't impressive from the outside, but
you walk inside into this darkened room with screens and overhead
displays on all walls,'' Paoli said. ``The commander can see the
planes moving across the screen, something like an air traffic
controller, and that's where he directs the whole air war.''
</P>
<P>
   Few American military officers are more familiar with those
targets and the difficulties facing the pilots than Short. During
the 1995 air war against Yugoslav positions in Bosnia, he was the
chief of staff for NATO forces in Naples, Italy. When the Bosnian
peacekeeping operation began, he was directing the planes carrying
supplies and soldiers in and out of the area from his post in
Ramstein, Germany, as director of operations for the U.S. Air
Forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the planning for the bombing of Bosnia in 1995 and
then, when we put the force into Bosnia, he was critical
coordinating the air transport,'' said Gen. George Joulwan, the
former supreme commander of allied forces in Europe. ``He was
impressive because he was not only professional but innovative _
this was all new stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of an army officer, Short led an itinerant childhood,
moving from base to base around the country. His wife, Gini, comes
from Hibbings, Minn. _ Bob Dylan's hometown. Both of their children
are in the Air Force. Their daughter is in pilot training in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Short's first combat missions were over Vietnam. ``I've heard
his war stories about guys being blown up next to him,'' Paoli
said.
</P>
<P>
   He then flew in Desert Storm, leading combat strikes as a pilot
of an F-15E and as a wing commander, according to Paoli. That was
one of the four times Short has been a wing commander, the captain
said.
</P>
<P>
   As both commander of allied air forces in Southern Europe and
commander of the 16th Air Force in Southern Europe, Short's
responsibilities have required him to act as diplomat and
commander.
</P>
<P>
   As a NATO military commander he has had to master the art of
working with a 19-member alliance. Now, in what is probably his
last command before he retires, Short is directing the air campaign
over Yugoslavia and Kosovo, working with officers from most of the
other NATO forces at his Vicenza center.

PATIENCE URGED WITH AIR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's two top military advisers on
Thursday urged patience with an air campaign that they asserted
could level the playing field for a resurgent Kosovar rebel force,
a position that some lawmakers called an effort to deflect growing
sentiment in Congress for ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the first time on Capitol Hill since the start of
the three-week NATO air war, Secretary of Defense William Cohen and
Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
suggested that Kosovar rebels, not NATO troops, could wage a ground
campaign against the forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia, after several more weeks of bombing took their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to prosecute the air campaign, Milosevic either
will be subjected to losing more of his capabilities, having less
power, or he will see the KLA balance start to shift,'' Shelton
told the Senate Armed Services Committee, referring to the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will not be easy to do with air power,'' Shelton said.
``It will take a long time, as we outlined right up front. But the
military objective as outlined can be accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a resurgent rebel force struck some senior
administration officials as odd, since military officials were
contending just days ago that the rebels had been routed by the
Serbs. ``It's a long-term project to create an army,'' said one
senior official who deals with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Pentagon officials said that they were unsure of
the accuracy of intelligence reports, cited by Cohen and Shelton on
Thursday, indicating that the rebel army was experiencing a
recruiting boom and renewing its guerrilla attacks on Serbian
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate there are about 10,000 hard-core
members of the KLA, and up to 20,000 more irregular troops. But
Serbian troops have driven the rebels into northern Albania, where
they are using reports of Serb atrocities against Kosovar Albanians
to mount an aggressive recruiting drive.
</P>
<P>
   The notion also raised suspicions among lawmakers, who contended
that Shelton and Cohen might be trying to shift the focus away from
the growing calls for the use of ground forces to achieve NATO's
objective of expelling 40,000 Serbian troops from Kosovo, and
escort and protect hundreds of thousands of refugees driven out of
the province by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were renewed charges that NATO has no exit
strategy for the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress returned from its two-week recess on Monday, many
senators and representatives have appealed to the administration
not to rule out the use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible this is a trial balloon or they're trying to
deflect attention from the ground troops possibility,'' Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a member of the Armed Services Committee,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also on the panel, added in an
interview, ``It certainly seems to be an inexpensive way out.
They're flying by the seat of their pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers suggested that Cohen and Shelton were conducting
psychological warfare against Milosevic and his field commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a head game with Milosevic politically, and with
the Yugoslav army to the extent they become so degraded, they say
to themselves, `We'd really be vulnerable to a NATO ground
operation,'' Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In back-to-back, all-day hearings before the Senate Armed
Services Committee and its House counterpart, Cohen and Shelton
steeled lawmakers, and the public, to the likelihood that the air
campaign could last weeks, even months, and that American
casualties were no longer possible, but probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick or easy or neat,'' Cohen
cautioned. ``This is very risky, there's a high risk of casualties
involved.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Who knew what China really needed was a bagel factory?
</P>
<P>
   On a bumpy side street in an obscure industrial area far from
the center of China's sprawling capital, where peasants leading
mules are as common a sight as motor vehicles and most of the
neighboring businesses are small repair shops, a wooden sign
bearing a cartoon bagel marks the entrance to Mrs. Shanen's Bagels.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is a cafe with red checkered tablecloths and the aroma of
cinnamon in the air that could as easily be in Soho or Seattle. But
the factory floor behind the cafe, where a platoon of women busily
knead dough, is unmistakably China.
</P>
<P>
   Up to two thousand bagels emerge daily from Mrs. Shanen's to
satisfy foreigners' cravings and locals' curiosity, along with a
growing line of other Western-style baked goods like brownies and
cheesecake, and even do-it-yourself bagel-making materials.
Contracts to supply hotels, embassies and international schools are
a mainstay, but the company also delivers fresh bagels to a roster
of offices and residences, and international chains like Starbuck's
and Park 'n' Shop are signing up as they open outlets in China.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing it all is Lejen Chen, a Chinese- American woman who
has loved bagels since her Brooklyn childhood and began collecting
recipes while a student at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen had several more chance encounters with torus-shaped
boiled bread before going into business. During and after college
she worked on a Boston cable-television program that one week
featured bagel baking. Two years after graduating, curiosity about
her roots and an appetite for adventure drew her to Beijing, where
she worked briefly as a guide for Americans attending a kite
festival who told her how much they missed a proper bagel for
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while free-lancing as a producer on a National
Geographic documentary project, she was appalled to discover that
what a hotel in the southern city of Guilin was billing as a bagel
was really a hamburger roll punctured with a cookie cutter.
</P>
<P>
   On her next trip to New York, she gathered up her recipes and
brought them to Beijing, intending initially just to bake them for
herself. A Chinese friend, Shan En, tried them, loved them and
encouraged her to open a shop to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Shan is now Ms. Chen's husband. He is also a native of Beijing,
a trained engineer and the owner of an electronics company, three
attributes that would prove essential in getting the bagel factory
running.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen started experimentally in 1996, baking batches of eight
in a friend's kitchen and delivering them to embassy shops. With
frozen imports in a few foreign-owned markets as their only
competition, the fresh bagels were a test-market hit. But expanding
to a factory posed some thorny challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The first was finding affordable space with adequate electric
power. For three months the couple drove around the city in a
fruitless search, before getting a tip about a vacant auto-repair
shop with high ceilings that looked suitable, if not very
conveniently located.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the licensing red tape for a new business can take
years to untangle, but Ms. Chen neatly sidestepped most of it by
organizing the bakery as a subsidiary of Shan's already licensed
company.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial bagel-making equipment is, naturally, unheard of in
China, and importing it would have been prohibitively expensive, so
Shan's engineering skills were put to work converting an old noodle
maker into a bagel presser and improvising a bagel boiler and
production ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients were also a problem, with local flour in particular
proving unsuitable for bagels. The bakery and cafe now use Canadian
wheat flour, Korean sugar, French yeast, California raisins,
Australian cream cheese and Norwegian salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Even deciding what to call the product in Chinese was tricky.
Some Madarin-English dictionaries translate bagel as mian bao quan
(bread in a circle), others as bai ji quan chi (hundred lucky
circles). Neither felt right. A friend suggested the solution Ms.
Chen chose: bei gu. ``It sounds more like `bagel,''' Ms. Chen said,
and its literal meaning, precious grain, was appealing if a bit
cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To name the business, Ms. Chen compressed her husband's name
into one word and put ``Mrs.'' in front.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest challenge was the huge gap in attitudes and
assumptions between Ms. Chen and her work force. Early on, Ms. Chen
decided to hire only women for the production line: ``I didn't want
to deal with the smoking, drinking and constant hacking'' that
seemed to come inevitably with hiring men, she said. Before she
could get started teaching her workers dough kneading, boiler
operation and quality control, she found she had to tutor them in
subjects from basic math to using a thermometer _ and persuade them
to show up on time.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting new workers is growing harder, Ms. Chen said. Local
job agencies are full of people laid off by shuttered factories,
she said, but ``workers from the agencies never work out. Their
idea of work is drinking tea and reading newspapers.'' The workers
she keeps usually come in through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   And though the factory pays for work permits for its staff,
Chinese bureaucracy still causes headaches: Local police officers
raided a housing complex one night and carted away some employees
who could not produce valid marriage status permits.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe is the heart of the business, part small-town gathering
place and part test lab for new products. One recent afternoon, Ms.
Chen was handing out free zebra bars. ``Tell me what you think,''
she said to Elisabeth Sjaastad, a Norwegian student at the Beijing
Film Academy with a craving for brownies who heard about the place
from her landlady.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Clark, a St. Louis native who has lived in Beijing since
her husband was transferred here three years ago, came in to stock
up on bagels, chat about the novel she is writing and give Ms. Chen
a peanut butter cookie recipe. ``All the expatriate ladies know her
as the bagel lady,'' Ms. Clark said with a smile. In the cafe,
plain bagels in three sizes cost 2.5 to 8 yuan apiece (30 cents to
96 cents), and recent menu additions include pizza bagels and apple
cider.
</P>
<P>
   Business is strong, and the bakery is outgrowing its factory,
meaning Ms. Chen will once again be hunting for space. And her
success has brought her unexpectedly face-to-face with a Chinese
business problem that plagues many a multinational corporation:
Counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to a Beijing supermarket, she found cheaper
bagels in look-alike packaging mixed in with Mrs. Shanen's on
display. After she castigated the store manager for stocking
inferior goods _ ``Look at the wrinkles! Look at all that grease!''
_ and demanded that the knock-offs at least be separated from hers,
she thrust a package into a wavering customer's hand, saying,
``Here, buy Mrs. Shanen's, it's the real thing.''

PORSCHE 911 CARRERA: A FOOLPROOF FORMULA FOR HIGH-SPEED GRIP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a sport utility or in a sports car, all-wheel-drive systems
move power to the wheels with the best traction. In sports cars,
which tend to spin the rear wheels on wet pavement, all-wheel drive
temporarily diverts power to the front, helping to stabilize the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all-wheel drive is also useful on dry roads during
``performance'' driving _ how you would travel to the hospital,
say, if your hair were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Porsche has offered all-wheel drive on its 911's,
rear-engine machines that, with 60 percent of their weight over the
drive wheels, never have much trouble finding traction on dry roads
but can be twitchy when it is wet.
</P>
<P>
   Porsche's system imbues its cars with an extra measure of
all-weather capability. But it also gives the 911 a
bonehead-friendly disposition, bailing out drivers whose appetite
for speed exceeds their ability to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Porsche is sensitive to assertions that its cars can be a
handful. Not long ago, 911's had the reputation of biting the
unwary with tree-spintering amounts of oversteer, the condition
when a car's rear end loses grip in a corner before the front,
causing a spin. While drivers in string-back gloves like oversteer,
which they can use to power-slide around corners like the bad guys
in the ``French Connection,'' most others find the behavior scary
and unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
   I met one such driver in the woods a few years ago. Driving his
new Porsche, he had dived into a highway off-ramp in North Carolina
much too fast. He reflexively lifted his foot from the accelerator,
which threw the car's weight forward and lightened the rear wheels;
then he got back on the gas and turned hard to make the ramp. The
rear end broke traction and he spun off the ramp into the nearby
trees. By the time I reached him, he was climbing out of the
passenger door. ``Oversteer,'' I said, and he nodded with the
solemn embarrassment of a man who had just devalued his $60,000
sports car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Porsche's new Carrera 4 makes such an incident highly unlikely,
if not impossible. To begin with, changes in the base car's
suspension have all but eliminated the 911's once-infamous
oversteer; the latest two-wheel-drive Carrera handles beautifully.
It is neutral, predictable and stickier than an investigation by
the special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrera 4 layers on a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system
that recruits the front wheels to find grip. Through a viscous
differential in its nose, it allots 5 percent to 40 percent of the
power to the front wheels, depending on how much traction the rear
wheels have. So if you accelerate out of a corner hard enough to
spin the rear wheels, power is channeled to the front, pulling the
car in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   All-wheel drive also means the Carrera 4 can negotiate an icy
road with far more composure than any 296-horsepower sports car has
a right to.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to variable valve timing, the 3.4-liter aluminum 6
doesn't seem to have a flat spot anywhere, pulling ardently at
almost any point on the tachometer. Steering response is light _
particularly so for an all-wheel-drive car _ and micrometer-fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrera 4 bolts from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 5 sonorous
seconds; Barnes &AMP; Noble should sell a CD of the sound it makes
under hard throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Porsche has added one more layer of defenses to the Carrera 4,
what it calls Porsche stability management. This is the first car
on the market to combine all-wheel drive with the face-saving, and
perhaps life-saving, virtues of stability control.
</P>
<P>
   One component of the system controls conventional anti-lock
brakes and traction control functions, plus what Porsche calls
``automatic brake differential,'' which allocates braking force
between front and rear depending on the car's weight balance.
</P>
<P>
   The second component uses an array of sensors and
computer-processing worthy of the IRS to make sure the car is going
where the driver tells it. If it is oversteering _ that is, if the
rear end is sliding to the outside of a turn _ the stability
control will brake the outside front wheel, reining in the Carrera
4.
</P>
<P>
   If the car isn't answering to the helm quickly enough, the
system will pulse-brake the inside rear wheel, causing it to tack
appropriately. If the road is really slippery, or if the driver is
a complete idiot, the car will throttle back the engine through a
drive-by-wire system _ a throttle linkage governed by electronics,
not moving parts. Or it will brake the wheels selectively and
otherwise work fiendishly to keep the Porsche badge pointing to the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All happens smoothly, seamlessly and instantly _ transparently,
to use the jargon. In fact, except for a little yellow warning
light on the dash, there is almost no indication that you are not,
in fact, the world's greatest driver. Purists could argue that with
the Carrera 4's stability control, Porsche has lowered its
ownership bar to mere money. It used to be you actually needed to
know how to drive to own a Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can always switch off the electronic safety net;
if you do, the Carrera 4 becomes a lot more interesting. All the
right sensations are here: the bolt-action crispness of the
six-speed manual gearbox (a Tiptronic automatic is available with
all-wheel drive for the first time this year), the Velcro-like
adhesion of the low-profile 18-inch Pirelli tires, the
toupee-toppling deceleration of four huge disk brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Carrera 4 comes in coupe and cabriolet configurations. I
drove the latter, which is slightly heavier because of floorpan
reinforcements, the top mechanism and two spring-loaded roll bars
that pop out when the car tilts beyond a certain angle. The extra
weight adds a couple of tenths of a second to the car's 0-to-60
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The top is semi-rigid, folding in a Z shape behind the rear
seats so that the leading edge of the ragtop blends in with the
bodywork. Opening or closing takes just 20 seconds. The top can
also be activated remotely with the key fob, which makes a huge
impression on your date as you walk to the car.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the cabrio top robs space from the already munchkin-sized
rear seats, reducing them to padded storage shelves with two sets
of three-point harnesses. The Carrera 4 Cabrio's storage is further
reduced because the all-wheel-drive differential resides between
the front wheels, shrinking the trunk space in the nose to the size
of a beer cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Carrera 4 Cabrio is almost identical to the
Porsche Boxster from the doors forward _ meaning there is a similar
dearth of storage in the cockpit. It also means that the
accommodations of this car _ $90,000 as tested _ are not
significantly plusher than the Boxster's, which costs half as much.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Boxster is an overachiever stylistically, and
granted, you can bedeck your Carrera 4 with every imaginable color
of leather, as well as oodles of wood and carbon-fiber trim. But,
at the bottom, the 911 shares a disconcerting kinship with its
down-market brother _ the same aesthetically disadvantaged black
plastic switchgear, the same reedy doors.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to open-top sports cars, the Carrera 4 cannot
avoid comparisons with another overachiever, the Chevrolet
Corvette. These appeal to different breeds _ the Porsche buyer,
let's say, has significantly more Lafite-Rothschild in his wine
rack. But the Corvette convertible is quicker than the Porsche
Cabrio, can carry two sets of golf clubs and also offers a
remarkably effective stability-control system. At about $45,000
each, two Corvette convertibles would seem to trump one Carrera 4
Cabrio.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is no car on the market that compares with the
Carrera 4 in its goof-proof handling and performance. It will not
do the impossible, of course, but it certainly redefines the
possible. &QL;

<P>
   When Mario Andretti and his twin brother, Aldo, came to the
United States from Italy as teen-agers in the 1950s, their first
jobs were at a gasoline station in Nazareth, Pa., owned by their
uncle, Lewis Messenlehner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a racing career that earned him an Indy 500 victory,
a Formula One world championship and worldwide fame, Mario Andretti
finds himself back in the service-station business.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect him to stick his head in your car window to
ask, ``Cash or charge?'' Along with his older son, Michael,
Andretti has opened a Texaco station in San Francisco that they
hope will re-establish the brand in Northern California, and also
redefine what a gasoline station is.
</P>
<P>
   The new Andretti Speedmart at 9th and Howard Streets combines a
typical convenience-mart station with a Starbucks and a Burger
King. The 37,250-square-foot tract also includes an Andretti car
wash.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-pump station brings the concept of cross-branding _ used
by retailers like Kmart that put fast-food outlets in their stores
_ to the retail petroleum business. Andretti said he hoped the idea
would encourage station owners to switch to Texaco _ which would
suit the Andrettis just fine, since they are the company's
wholesale distributors in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   With gas prices down _ at least until they spiked recently _
Andretti is learning how tough it is to work with hair's-breadth
margins. ``If I knew about competition before, now I'm really
finding out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andretti still races an Indy car (sponsored by a certain
oil company). And Mario, despite his retirement from full-time
racing in 1994, is still perhaps the most famous figure in Indy-car
racing.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that Andretti owes something to gasoline
retailing. It was while working at his uncle's station that he
first heard the siren call of engines from the nearby Nazareth
track. You know the rest.

<P>
   Q. (italics)I recently started work at a public relations firm.
As the new kid on the block, I don't yet have a stable of clients,
so I keep getting pulled away for projects that no one else wants
to handle _ and that often require expertise or experience I lack.
I want to be a team player, but I worry that I am being set up to
fail, or at least to disappoint my bosses. I would say something to
the person who hired me, but I don't want to get a reputation as
being difficult. Any advice?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First things first: Congratulations on the new job in public
relations. Now relax. No one expects you to be an expert on
everything overnight. What matters more is how you handle the
challenge of getting up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   At any company, a new employee can be pulled in 40 different
directions, said Mark Schannon, associate director of the
Washington offices of Ketchum, a public relations firm. That is
intended in part to help you learn as much as possible, but also to
help the organization fill its existing needs.
</P>
<P>
   One of your first projects should be to find the best ways to
gain the knowledge you need to perform your job, said Angela
Scalpello, vice president for employee development at Ogilvy Public
Relations in New York. If your company doesn't have a mentoring
program, she advised, ask your manager who could give you the best
guidance in different areas of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Your eagerness to learn your way around will improve your
reputation, not hurt it, Ms. Scalpello said. ``You come across as
searching for ways to hit the ground faster and make a contribution
sooner,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   If you do wind up with a project that proves too tough, don't
suffer silently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell people, `If we're overloading you in any way, it's
your job to tell us,''' Schannon said. ``If you've basically
demonstrated you're somebody who will take on any task any time and
work your heart out for the organization, then you can very quickly
earn the right to go, `I'm not saying I don't want to do this; I'm
saying I don't know how to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the importance of the assignment, asking for help
could save you serious headaches down the road. ``You never get
into trouble here for saying, `I don't know how to do that,'''
Schannon said. ``You get into trouble for saying, `I know how to do
that,' and you don't. Then the client gets angry. We get
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   But be careful not to sound as if you're whining. ``Avoid
saying: `I can't do this. Can you help me?''' Ms. Scalpello
advised. ``Instead, say something like: `I've been asked to create
a media list. Here's what I was planning to do. Am I on the right
track?'''
</P>
<P>
   That way, she said, you let people offer specific guidance
without making them wonder: ``Why did we hire this person? She has
no idea what she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In any workplace that combines great challenges and large
potential rewards, a certain fear of failing and a willingness to
take risks are necessary for success. ``The fear is the fun,''
Schannon said. ``If you don't think being scared by hard things is
fun, get out of agency life.'' &QL;

GENERAL SAYS PROSPECT OF AMERICAN CASUALTIES HIGH 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration sought to prepare
Congress and the country Thursday for the possibility that allied
air attacks against Yugoslavia could continue well into summer and
American casualties are likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick or easy, or neat,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen told members of the Senate and House armed
services committee, as he stressed that the allies ``have a long
road ahead'' in trying to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to withdraw his forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the prospect for casualties remains very real and
high,'' said Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, echoing Cohen's suggestion that U.S. deaths could occur the
longer the allied campaign goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a risk-free military operation,''
Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, Shelton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright went to
Capitol Hill on Thursday to appear before various Senate and House
committees to brief members on how NATO's Operation Allied Force is
going and to push for passage of an emergency spending measure to
help finance the U.S. portion of the campaign through this fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost thus
far of the U.S. contribution to the military operation is as much
as $1 billion. But administration officials and U.S. lawmakers say
the current figure is much higher, and that it will cost at least
$6 billion or more if the NATO campaign continues into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is expected to present Congress with a
definitive emergency funding request next week. Congressional aides
said Thursday that preliminary figures presented by the
administration include about $5.4 billion for military-related
operations and about $500,000 for aid to help the Kosovar refugees
and the countries where they now are being cared for.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures could rise to more than $8 billion in the
final administration request, according to some congressional
aides, depending on what other funding measures are included in the
package Congress approves.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in San Francisco, President Clinton said that the
U.S. commitment to aiding the Balkans should continue beyond the
conflict to consolidate democratic reform in the region and build
professional armed forces under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever it ends, we have some building to do,'' Clinton told
the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The president called for
Washington to work with the European Union and international
financial institutions ``to mobilize support.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not put a price tag on the additional aid, but he
did say: ``We need to condition this help, just as we did with
western Europe 50 years ago, on closer cooperation among the
beneficiaries and a new understanding of their sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, Shelton and Albright underwent sometimes hostile
questioning from lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized the Pentagon and the
president for not including plans for a ground war as part of the
overall NATO operation. In scathing comments, the Republican
presidential contender said that while he was supportive of the
allied bombing it was a mistake ``to tell your enemy ... that you
will not exercise whatever options are necessary in order to
achieve victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Limited actions beget limited results,'' said McCain, a former
Navy pilot who was shot down over North Vietnam and held prisoner
for nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, however, reminded lawmakers that the United States was
part of a unified NATO alliance and could not act unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen quickly added that a commitment of NATO ground troops
has not been ruled out ``with respect to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also heard from Republican lawmakers who
oppose the NATO operation and would like to ``pull the plug'' on
it, as one put it, with a vote in Congress to withhold funding for
the U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Cohen and Shelton that he
worries about American forces becoming involved in ``a protracted
war that, in my opinion, we won't end up winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that NATO had ``a choice as to whether or not we
could allow this extermination policy of (Milosevic's) to take
place ... on the installment basis, a village at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a battle of freedom over fear,'' he stressed.
``It's a battle of democracy over dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we chose a commitment over indifference, and I know it's
controversial but I don't think there's any choice,'' he said.

WHEN FEAR OF FIRING DETERS HIRING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mass., Conn.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last few years, several people have spoken to me about
their reluctance to hire people whose race, color, creed or
national origin _ or age, disability or sex _ put them in protected
classes under anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning goes this way: You have to be absolutely sure that
someone in a protected class is the best possible candidate,
because people in these categories can make your life miserable
with litigation if you ever have to dismiss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dirty little secret'' that people are thinking this
way, said Tama Starr, president of Artkraft Strauss, a sign-making
company in New York, and one of the few business people who has
spoken out on the subject. Those who subscribe to these ideas
``have to choose between different protected classes and weigh the
risk of hiring them,'' she said, adding, ``This is a very obnoxious
way to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers tread on swampy ethical terrain when they allow fear of
possible problems to deter them from hiring apparently capable
minority applicants _ or to hesitate so long over a decision that a
candidate loses interest or gives up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of discrimination suits is not wholly groundless. A
1997 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management
found that of 616 personnel executives who responded, 53 percent
said their organizations had been sued at least once by former
employees in the last five years; nearly half the 611 suits they
reported involved claims of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But Martha R.A. Fields, chief executive of Fields Associates, a
management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., says the risk of a
suit is often an excuse that masks a deeper motive for not hiring
people in protected classes. It is more likely, Ms. Fields said,
that managers' hesitation to hire these workers is born of feeling
safer hiring people like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, she said, find it easy to think to themselves: ``If
I know people who are like me, I know the good, bad, and the ugly
about them. If I don't know them and I see images of them in the
media, I'm, like, `Oh man, those black people, they might be
welfare-dependent, or criminals, or crime victims. I don't know if
I really want to bring that into my organization.'''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, such bias is economically irrational as well as
unethical. ``The demographics of this country are shifting in major
ways,'' Ms. Fields noted, as minority groups, especially Hispanic
people, account for a rapidly growing share of the population and
its purchasing power. ``Consumers want to see people like
themselves in organizations,'' Ms. Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Another underlying problem is managers who are poor at managing.
Some who speak these fears are simply afraid to fire
(italics)anyone(end italics) _ not just someone in a protected
class _ and shy away from situations they perceive as requiring
them to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid hiring problem employees from any group, managers just
``need to do a good job of checking resumes, identifying the time
gaps and verifying simple facts,'' said Mary C. Dollarhide, an
employment lawyer with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &AMP; Walker in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   For $200 to $300, a manager can also get a criminal background
check on a candidate and a docket search to see if he or she often
files lawsuits. ``If you do your due diligence, you're going to
stand a much better chance of not bringing in the gripers,
complainers, bad actors and poor performers,'' Ms. Dollarhide said.
</P>
<P>
   But a thorough screening does not absolve managers of having to
manage. ``If you get somebody in your midst whom you fail to
discipline because you're afraid you're going to get slammed for
having reprimanded someone in a protected class, well, guess what:
The failure to do that is going to land you in exactly the same
spot,'' Ms. Dollarhide said. ``If the employee is terminated, he
can sue and you're left with no records to support your case.''
</P>
<P>
   Much sound management translates into ethical behavior.
Employees who are treated fairly, honestly and directly are both
less likely to require dismissal and less likely to sue over it
later.
</P>
<P>
   That frees everyone to concentrate on the business they enjoy.
``I still believe that people are good and honest and they want to
do a nice job,'' said Ms. Starr of Artkraft. ``Having to fight
through more stupidity just hampers everybody's humanity.'' &QL;

PENTAGON WILL ASK FOR 30,000 RESERVISTS FOR NATO WAR IN YUGOSLAVIA

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon plans to ask President Clinton to call
up about 30,000 reservists and National Guard members to bolster
the attack against Yugoslavia, significantly widening the American
contribution to NATO's war in the Balkans, senior military and
administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the size of the call-up, its impact is likely to
ripple across the country, affecting families, interrupting college
educations and putting strains on employers. Since a majority will
be pilots or aircraft crew members, the impact may be felt most in
the aviation industry, which employs thousands of reservists and
Guard members, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On a day overshadowed by confirmation that an allied warplane
mistakenly bombed a civilian vehicle in Kosovo, President Clinton
offered a rationale for American involvement that, like the
activation of the reserves, signaled a prolonged effort.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors in San
Francisco, Clinton said that only a democratic transition in
Yugoslavia would clear the way for stability in the Balkans,
although that is explicitly not one of NATO's military objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will require a democratic transition in Serbia, for the
region's democracies will never be safe with a belligerent tyranny
in their midst,'' he said. ``It will demand from us a recognition
that there is no easy way out of the region's troubles, but there
is a solution that advances our interest and keeps faith with our
values, if we are ready to make a long-term commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of that commitment continues to rise. The White House
is expected to ask Congress for $5.9 billion in emergency spending
to cover the costs of American involvement in the operation over
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which officials said could be formally submitted as
early as Friday, has increased significantly from estimates of $3
billion to $4 billion earlier this week, administration officials
said. They attributed the increase to the activation of so many
reservists and the request by NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley
K. Clark, for about 300 additional American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers have criticized the
administration's strategy in the Balkans, Clinton's senior military
advisers urged patience, saying that an air campaign would
ultimately undermine Milosevic or at least level the playing field
for a resurgent rebel force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there is any question that we can
accomplish the mission, the military mission that was laid out with
air power, to reduce the capabilities of the Serb military and
police forces,'' Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate's Armed Services Committee. But,
in the strongest language to date, Shelton conceded publicly that
military success might not yield NATO's political goals of
returning the refugees to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen warned senators that as
NATO's air raids continued, American casualties were no longer
``possible'' but ``probable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick or easy or neat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO strikes continued Thursday, with reports of new attacks on
military targets, television transmitters and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO warplanes were reportedly launching the most intensive
attacks in recent days in Montenegro, the junior republic in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the forces arrayed against Milosevic has grown
steadily. Requests for more aircraft from NATO nations would
increase the total to more than 1,000, more than double the 430 the
alliance had ready when the strikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Clark's request for American aircraft, which
surprised officials within the Pentagon, has forced officials to
consider the large call-up of reservists and Guard members.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the aircraft requested, for example, are aerial
tankers, needed to refuel the waves of fighters and bombers
conducting raids into Yugoslavia. Many of those tankers _ KC-135's
and KC-10's _ are assigned to reserve or national guard units
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is still working out the details of which units
will be called up and how many people will be needed. While a
senior defense official said the total would be around 30,000, an
administration official said it could be as high as 33,000. By law,
Clinton can authorize the activation of 200,000 reservists or Guard
members for 270 days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The final details of the activation are expected to be completed
by the weekend and could be approved by Cohen by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, as expected, the call up would be the largest
single activation since 265,000 took part in the Persian Gulf war
in 1990 and 1991. It is the first of any significance since since
3,800 reservists and Guardsmen went to Bosnia with the first NATO
peacekeepers in 1995. Since then, thousands have continued to serve
in Bosnia, where they now account for about 1,000 of the 7,000
American troops there.
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Pentagon has relied on several hundred reservists
who have volunteered for duty in the Balkans, many of them pilots
willing to serve a few days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those called to duty will be in the Air
Force Reserves or the Air National Guard. While many of them will
be pilots or crew members for tankers, cargo planes or other
support aircraft, some of those activated will operate fighter
jets, including F-16's and A-10's.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is also expected to have a large contingent of
reservists, many of them soldiers needed to support the deployment
of two dozen Apache helicopter gunships to Albania. The Apache
force is slowly setting up an operating base in Albania's rough,
undeveloped terrain and needs engineers and security officers, as
well as Army reservists trained to interact with locals.
</P>
<P>
   The total size of that force is now expected to be as high as
4,800 soldiers, more than double the 2,000 officials estimated when
the deployment was announced, Army officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps will contribute far fewer reservists,
the officials said. All of them will come from units in high demand
in the fighting, including crews of EA-6B jets, which jam the
enemy's radar and other electronic communications, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the total that Cohen requests will be a
ceiling. In other words, the Pentagon plans to seek authority for
some 30,000, but may not need all of them to report to duty. The
officials said they probably would be called up in batches as the
campaign continues.
</P>
<P>
   All of the armed services have come to rely more heavily than
ever on the nation's 900,000 reservists. In the Air Force, in
particular, reserve and National Guard units are routinely used
during their scheduled training periods to patrol the skies over
Bosnia and Iraq. Rarely, though, have so many been called up at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Although the activation is not nearly as large as that for the
Persian Gulf war, its impact will be real, particularly in the
aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of commercial pilots come from a military
background,'' said Michael Sellwag, an airline industry analyst for
Warburg, Dillon, Read in New York, ``and if they're in the reserves
and they're called to active duty, that could lead to scheduling
headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   The activation _ as well as the dispatch of still more aircraft
to the Balkans _ comes at a cost to the government, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5.9 billion in emergency spending the White House is
expected to request from Congress, $5.4 billion would cover the
cost of reservists' salaries, fuel and other supplies and
munitions. Another $500 million would pay for aid to the thousands
of Albanians who have fled Mr. Milosevic's campaign in Kosovo.

PATRICIA ARQUETTE SHINES IN DELICIOUSLY DARK `LOVER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roland Joffe isn't exactly the first name that springs to mind
as the director of a noirish comedy about insurance money, murder
and marital double-crosses.
</P>
<P>
   He's known as a serious filmmaker who favors ``cause movies''
like ``The Killing Fields,'' ``The Mission,'' ``Fat Man and Little
Boy'' and ``City of Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's nice to see him lighten up and have some fun with this
wicked and archly funny dark comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye Lover'' is a quintessentially '90s movie in that it's
as amoral as can be but refuses to apologize for its
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   It features a fine, underplayed performance by Patricia
Arquette, who plays Sandra Dunmore, a rising Los Angeles real
estate agent whose reach exceeds her grasp. She and her alcoholic
husband, Jake (Dermot Mulroney), live far beyond their means, and
Jake is on the verge of losing his job at an advertising and
public- relations firm. Jake's big brother, Ben (Don Johnson), a
top exec at the agency, is the only one who can keep Jake pulled
together. But little does Jake know that Sandra and Ben have been
having a torrid affair.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Sandra is sick of selling rich people's estates. She'd
rather have her own mansion, but with Jake on the decline it
doesn't seem likely anytime soon. She hatches a plan with Ben to
bump off her hubby and gain his insurance money, but Ben has grown
tired of their tangled, sordid trysts. He begins dating a
co-worker, the pure, pert _ and resourceful _ Peggy Blane
(Mary-Louise Parker).
</P>
<P>
   But all Sandra wants is the money and she'll stop at nothing to
get it. Arquette winningly plays her with a passive aggressiveness
that both repels and attracts.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the body count is rising and Sandra's security is
threatened by an idiosyncratic cop named Rita Pompano (Ellen
DeGeneres) who seems to have a psychic gift for sniffing out the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Joffe successfully captures a milieu in which illusion and
surface image are everything. Everyone is different than they
appear.
</P>
<P>
   While there are some dreadful plot contrivances and Joffe could
tighten the film's pace, this sharp director
</P>
<P>
   knows how to evoke a film noir style.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film's problems stem from the script. Its
elimination of nearly all the main characters gives the story very
little room to evolve. By the end, it threatens to become a parody
instead of a black comedy. Thankfully, Arquette proves more than
capable of filling the void.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye Lover. Directed by Roland Joffe. Written by Ron Peer,
Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow. Cast: Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney,
Ellen DeGeneres, Mary-Louise Parker, Don Johnson. Warner Bros. 100
minutes. Rated R for sexual content, language, violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

 &HT;    Rainout pushes rotation back
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With the rainout of Thursday night's game, Braves
starter Tom Glavine was pushed back a day in the rotation. Instead
of facing Curt Schilling and the Phillies Thursday night, Glavine
will take on the Rockies in Denver at 8:05 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux is pushed back to Saturday, against Darryl Kile, and
John Smoltz will pitch Sunday against Pedro Astacio. Rookie Odalis
Perez, who was supposed to pitch Sunday, will now start Tuesday's
game in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game against the Phillies will be made up in a
doubleheader in Philadelphia on Friday, July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said Thursday night, either way was fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no feelings about it other than I don't like
rain-outs,'' he said. ``You get yourself geared toward pitching and
when you don't, it's a disappointment. There's disadvantages to
both situations, pitching against Schilling or in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has had success in Coors Field, where he has two
shutouts, a 2-1 record and a 3.70 ERA in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Injury updates
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko pulled his right hamstring while stretching for a
throw from Walt Weiss in the fifth inning on Wednesday night.
Klesko is expected to miss several games.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko will be replaced by Randall Simon at first base in
tonight's lineup against right-hander John Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something in my leg pretty good in that stretch,''
Klesko said. ``Every time I went to stretch after that, it just got
worse.... I've never had anything like this so I don't know (how
long of a recovery to expect). It's been eight years since I pulled
a hamstring. It could be a couple days with medical treatments they
have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez is nursing a sore back, which he hurt Wednesday night
swinging at a pitch. He had treatment on Thursday and will be
re-evaluated today in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger reported good news on Thursday, the day after he
threw a little long toss and pitched for five minutes off the mound
at 60-70 percent. He said he's still on track to be ready when he
comes off the disabled list on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' Remlinger said. ``I won't know until Friday when
I air it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger has thrown only fastballs to this point, and it's been
the breaking balls which gave him the most pain when he first
pulled the muscle in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Holding pattern
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have until 2 p.m. today to trade Mark Wohlers or they
will have to release him. There was no definitive word from the
team Thursday night as to whether they would be able to get
something in return for Wohlers before the deadline. If they
release him, the Braves still owe Wohlers $6 million, $5.2 million
for this year's salary and $800,000 to buy out next year's option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure working on it,'' general manager John Schuerholz
said. ``Some clubs are interested, some not. These were pretty
difficult circumstances in which we were placed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves release Wohlers, he will be put on waivers. When
he clears them in three days, he will become a free agent.

 &HT;    Strawberry stumbles again
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the day Dwight Gooden was released from the Betty
Ford Clinic five years ago, he walked out the front door to find
Darryl Strawberry waiting for him in a car.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, who had been treated at the clinic four months
earlier for the same addiction _ cocaine _ took Gooden to his home
in nearby Rancho Mirage, Calif., and set his old friend straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc, you've got to get out of Florida,'' Strawberry said in a
sermon about the dangerous streets of Tampa, Gooden's hometown and
a district so notorious for drugs and high living that some players
simply called the place the Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, linked forever with Strawberry from the 1980s New York
Mets glory days, listened, learned and turned his life around.
Strawberry evidently did not. A life so nearly ruined has moved
closer to the brink.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was three miles from the Yankees' Legends Field
complex in Tampa, where the club had sent him to extended spring
training to rehab from chemotherapy, when he was arrested at 10:10
Wednesday night for soliciting sex from an undercover policewoman.
A subsequent search turned up 0.3 grams of cocaine wrapped around a
$20 bill in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A Tampa police department spokesman said, ``It appeared for
personal use. One hit size.''
</P>
<P>
   Released on $6,000 bond, Strawberry suggested his wife's uncle,
Rodney Simon, had driven his gold 1999 Ford Explorer the night
before and may have left the $20 Strawberry found in the glove
compartment. Simon subsequently denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry also said he had simply been joking with the
policewoman about the possibility of sex and had no intention of
meeting her at a nearby motel, as the police report indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strawberry continually apologized and was very remorseful for
what he had done,'' an police investigative report read. Arresting
officers noted Strawberry said ``this would ruin his career.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence from the Yankees was deafening. Owner George
Steinbrenner was out of town at a funeral and issued no statement.
Team attorney Lonn Trost had no comment, except to say the club
would allow the case to work its way through the usual legal
channels. But behind the front office door, Steinbrenner is
doubtlessly seething. It was a gesture of goodwill that the Yankees
even picked up Strawberry's $2.5 million option this season.
</P>
<P>
   Impossibly, Strawberry had just gone from being one of the
game's premiere problem children to a genuine feel-good story.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees dedicated the 1998 postseason to him after he was
diagnosed with colon cancer during the League Division Series,
wearing his No. 39 inscribed on its hats in his honor while
completing one of the most dominant seasons in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the arrest is a mistake,'' said interim manager Yankees
Don Zimmer. ``This guy has done some great things for this club in
2-1/2 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last February, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence had made him the organization's spokesman. He has been
drug-tested twice weekly since his 1995 suspension as part of major
league baseball's aftercare program without incident. During
chemotherapy that lasted into spring training, Strawberry responded
with a religious fervor, saying God had tested him in his previous
bouts with addiction and alcoholism so that now, he might now help
people better understand cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible taught me to accept everything with joy,'' he said
last month. ''I have peace within about this.''
</P>
<P>
   But off the field, his life is in near-collapse. Despite serving
six months in house arrest from a 1995 IRS tax evasion case, he
still owes the government well in excess of $1 million in back
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to work out in Tampa until he was over the effects of
chemotherapy, Strawberry's future with the Yankees was murky,
before he was arrested at the corner of West Kennedy Boulevard and
South Arrawana Avenue on Wednesday night. The cocaine charge, a
third degree felony, is punishable with a five-year maximum jail
sentence while the solicitation charge, a misdemeanor, could draw
an additional 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Said Yankees pitcher David Cone, ''I just hope it's not as bad
as it seems.''

 &HT;    Late pick not new to Reeves
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons are about to venture into new
territory, but when they pick next-to-last in the first round of
the NFL draft Saturday, it will be familiar to coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   In his 12 years as coach of the Broncos, 1981-92, Denver's first
draft choice came 20th or later eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute trades, the Falcons' first pick will come at
No. 30, the latest first-round draft choice in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's lowest first-round draft choice to date has been
safety Devin Bush, whom they selected with the 26th pick in '95.
Atlanta drafted that late only after trading in the first round,
sending the No. 10 pick to Cleveland and getting back the No. 26
pick and wide receiver Eric Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   Only five times in 32 previous drafts has Atlanta had to wait
longer to make its first selection, and on each of those occasions
it was because the Falcons traded their first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta traded away its second-round pick last year for wide
receiver Tony Martin and won't draft again Saturday until the 92nd
pick, near the end of the third round.
</P>
<P>
   It is the price a team pays for going 16-3 and making it to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So what has Reeves learned about drafting late? ``About the only
thing that sticks out is that if you draft early, which we did the
first two years, it's a lot easier to separate talent of players at
the top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the first 15 to maybe 20 players are clearly the
best, and everybody knows they're the best. Then it becomes a lot
more difficult to evaluate them. In the later rounds, your chances
for making a mistake are a lot greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves and his staff in Denver had mixed luck with the late
first-round picks, landing such keepers as running back Gerald
Wilhite with the 21st pick in '82, wide receiver Ricky Nattiel with
the 27th pick in '87 and free safety Steve Atwater with the 20th
pick in '89.
</P>
<P>
   They also had some duds, including nose tackle Ted Gregory, a
No. 26 pick in 1988 who never played in the NFL, and quarterback
Tommy Maddox, the No. 25 pick in '92, who barely did.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has been criticized in the past for his personnel skills,
and his first two drafts in Atlanta have been hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   His first choice in Atlanta in 1997 was cornerback Michael
Booker. He struggled as a rookie, but started eight games last
season when Ronnie Bradford was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Falcons not traded their No. 3 pick in the '97 draft to
Seattle and moved back to the No. 11 pick (Booker), they could have
selected former Ohio State cornerback Shawn Springs, who made the
Pro Bowl in his second season. Imagine the Falcons with Pro Bowl
choice Ray Buchanan and Springs at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, by swapping first- and third-round picks with
Seattle, Atlanta picked up second- and fourth-round picks used to
select running back Byron Hanspard and starting linebacker Henri
Crockett. The third-round pick was used to select starting tight
end O.J. Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons with Atlanta, Reeves has had more
success with late-round draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Calvin Collins, a sixth-round draft choice in '97,
has started 32 of 35 games, including the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The only starter to emerge from last year's draft was a
seventh-rounder, tackle Eprhaim Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight, a wide receiver drafted in the fourth round, had a
big impact as a return man.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Reeves and current Falcons college scouting chief
Reed Johnson drafted Karl Mecklenberg in the 12th round in 1983. He
had an outstanding career as a linebacker and defensive end for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Denver strong safety Tyrone Braxton was a 12th-round
pick in '87. Perennial Pro Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe was a
seventh-round pick in '90.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late rounds, you're looking for a quality that stands
out, maybe competitiveness, or a guy is a real hard worker, or
maybe you think he has talent but he's never played up to it,''
Reeves said. ``Or maybe it's a guy who projects to another
position, or a guy who got lost on a bad team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson probably said it best. ``It's not a science; you make
mistakes,'' he said. ``We rank what we think are the top 240 to 260
players, and there's still not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe there aren't enough draft choices.

 &HT;    Hurricanes' James is target of Patriots
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that Heisman Trophy running back Ricky Williams
appears headed to Indianapolis with the No. 4 overall choice
Saturday, the tailback-needy New England Patriots have targeted
Edgerrin James of Miami to fill a void created by the potential
career-threatening knee injury to former Georgia star Robert
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: New England personnel director Bobby Grier must
find a team willing to allow the Patriots to trade up into the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   New England owns the 20th and 28th selections and spent much of
Wednesday attempting to complete a deal with Washington, which is
choosing No. 5. But Redskins general manager Charley Casserly has
set a steep price and Washington is content now to stay put and
select Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Grier and coach Pete Carroll were scrambling Thursday in the
wake of the trade that sent tailback Marshall Faulk to St. Louis.
They contacted Rams officials to talk trade and also spoke with
Chicago (No. 7 overall) and Arizona (No. 8). Should the Patriots
fail to move up, they're probably looking at a group of tailbacks
late in the first round that includes Kevin Faulk (LSU), James
Johnson (Mississippi State) and Sedrick Irvin (Michigan State). The
Patriots are one of just a handful of teams that has a first-round
grade on Irvin. The Atlanta Falcons are one of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Ram tough
</P>
<P>
   Having acquired Faulk, the Rams immediately changed draft gears.
Instead of targeting James, personnel chief Charley Armey and his
staff went back to the war room to debate the relative merits of
North Carolina State wide receiver Torry Holt and cornerback Chris
McAlister of Arizona. Because they traded Eddie Kennison to New
Orleans this spring and can't count on oft-injured Isaac Bruce, the
Rams sorely need a deep threat and Holt fills the bill. The early
bet, however, is that they select McAlister, one of the few corners
with size in this draft. Of their incumnent corners, Ryan McNeil
currently is an unrestricted free agent and Todd Lyght will enter
the final year of his contract in '99.
</P>
<P>
   No deal
</P>
<P>
   Saints general manager Bill Kuharich all but conceded Thursday
his team won't be able to deal up ahead of Indianapolis and steal
Williams, the player for whom coach Mike Ditka would have
surrendered his entire draft this year along with additional picks
in 2000. ``It's probably dead now,'' Kuharich said. Choosing 12th,
the Saints will hope that either Holt or Ohio State wide receiver
David Boston falls to them. They will consider UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown, too, if he is available. While a deal now is unlikely,
it's notable that New Orleans was considering including one of two
veteran defenders, tackle Wayne Martin or corner Alex Molden, in a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Hard feelings
</P>
<P>
   It's assumed Oregon quarterback Akili Smith will be the third
overall choice, going to the Bengals. A former Cincinnati
first-round quarterback, David Klingler ('92), offered a word of
advice: Take part of the signing bonus and get a good insurance
policy. ``It's a shame for the guy who goes (to the Bengals),''
Klingler said. Klingler, retired and living in Houston, said he has
back problems so severe he can't throw a football 35 yards. He
blames his physical problems on the pounding he took during his
four seasons with the Bengals. Owner Mike Brown suggested Klingler
is angling for a disability grievance.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina gets Jeffers
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys refused Thursday to match the Carolina
Panthers' offer for free-agent wide receiver Patrick Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina signed the 6-foot-4, 218-pound Jeffers to an offer
sheet Monday. The one-year deal was worth a reported $1.2 million,
including an $800,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' compensation for losing Jeffers, who had 18
receptions for 330 yards and two touchdowns last season, is
Carolina's fifth-round pick, No. 140 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Add Penn State tackle Floyd Wedderburn (knee) to the list of
players red-flagged because of physical concerns. ... Chicago is
now considering McNown with the seventh overall selection. ...
Pittsburgh could draft John Tait of Brigham Young, the top-rated
offensive tackle, but he might not fit their needs. The Steelers
recently signed former Rams starter Wayne Gandy to play left tackle
and Tait isn't considered physical enough to play the right side.
... San Francisco 49ers co-owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. filed a $150
million countersuit against his sister, claiming breach of
contract. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio in
response to last week's suit against DeBartolo by his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York, and the corporation, demanding her brother
repay $94 million to the company and attempting to oust him from
any team management role. ... A lawsuit Jeff Danish filed against
linebacker Andre Royal over a hazing incident during the Saints'
training camp last summer was dismissed Thursday on a technicality.
Royal did not respond to the lawsuit, and Danish's lawyers hadn't
pursued the case further.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The solar system is not alone as an array of planets orbiting in
the gravitational embrace of a shining star.
</P>
<P>
   Laying to rest any lingering notion of the Sun's family being a
singular phenomenon in the universe, astronomers announced on
Thursday the detection of three large planets around Upsilon
Andromedae, a solar-type star 44 light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   Solitary planets had been observed around several other stars in
the last four years, but this is the first clear evidence showing
another star accompanied by multiple planets in a stable system
bearing some resemblance to the Sun's.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the planets are several times more massive than Jupiter,
the solar system's giant, which is 318 times heftier than Earth.
The third planet, with at least three-quarters the Jovian mass, is
so close to the star that it completes a full orbit _ its year _
every 4.6 Earth days. Astronomers said that they would not be
surprised if they eventually find other, more distant objects
around the star.
</P>
<P>
   Other astronomers greeted the discovery with unbridled
enthusiasm. They called it a major milestone in planetary science.
Here, finally, was what they had eagerly been seeking: another
planetary system to compare with their own. They expected further
study of the Upsilon Andromedae system to challenge some theories
of planet formation and evolution, and probably hatch new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Of even greater philosophical as well as scientific importance,
the discovery encouraged astronomers in their growing belief that
the universe abounds in stars with planetary systems. This, in
turn, increased the probability that some of them include habitable
worlds, scientists said, though no such claim is being made for the
newly discovered system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single planets we found around other stars was a glorious
discovery, but the architecture of other planetary systems had been
missing,'' Dr. Geoffrey Marcy, a leader of the discovery team, said
in an interview. ``Here for the first time, we can see a kinship
between these planets and our own solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a theorist of planetary systems at the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, who must come to grips with the
implications of the findings, said simply, ``This is exciting
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made independently by two teams, one from San
Francisco State University and the other from the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
They joined in announcing the results at a news conference in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A full report, which has already been reviewed by more than a
dozen independent astronomers, has been submitted for publication
in The Astrophysical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having two completely independent sets of observations gives
us confidence in this detection,'' said Dr. Debra Fischer, of the
San Francisco team. And Marcy, the team leader and most prolific
discoverer of extra-solar planets, said, ``I would bet my house on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Upsilon Andromedae is a nearby bright star visible to
the unaided eye, the three planets cannot be seen even with the
most powerful telescopes. Astronomers infer their existence, orbits
and minimum masses from years of careful study of their
gravitational effects, characterized as reflex motions, on the host
star. In their orbital courses, the planets tug first one way and
then the other on the star, causing ever-so-slight changes in the
star's velocity.
</P>
<P>
   This observational technique has been responsible for the
detection of 18 Jupiter-class extra-solar planets since 1995, when
Swiss astronomers found the first planet around another normal
star, 51 Pegasi.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Noyes, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer, said the new
observations should dispel any doubts that these objects are true
planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nagging question was whether the massive bodies orbiting in
apparent isolation around stars really are planets,'' Noyes said in
a statement. ``But now that we see three around the same star, it
is hard to imagine anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Lin, a theorist at the University of California at
Santa Cruz who has sought to explain how such huge planets could
exist so close to their stars, much closer than Jupiter is to the
Sun, said the new detections should enable scientists to evaluate
their various theories. They are struggling to understand if
systems with several super-Jupiter planets, traveling eccentric
orbits close to their stars, are more typical than the solar
system, with its gaseous giant planets all traveling circular
orbits at great distance from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very important discovery,'' Lin said in an
interview. ``It tells us that planetary systems are quite
ubiquitous, and some of them are quite stable. It also tells us
that the existence of habitable planets is highly probable.''

UNDATED: highly probable.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Earth-size planets could exist in the Upsilon
Andromedae system, astronomers said, they would be undetectable
with current search methods. In any event, they would be unlikely
to exist in what astronomers think of as the habitable zone of a
planetary system, close enough to be warmed by the star, like
Earth, but not so close as to be baked like Mercury and Venus.
Also, the gravitational forces of Jupiter class objects in that
vicinity would more than likely have cleared it any small planets.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery teams calculated that the middle planet in the
Upsilon Andromedae system is in an orbit corresponding to the
distance of Venus from the Sun. It is at least twice the mass of
Jupiter, making the complete circuit every 242 days. The outermost
known planet, at least four times more massive than Jupiter, orbits
the star about once every four earth years at a distance comparable
to the region between Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers suspect that these giant planets are, like Jupiter
and Saturn, huge spheres of gas without a solid surface. But, also
like Jupiter and Saturn, they could have many large moons.
Possibly, Lin speculated, on one of these moons there could be
liquid water, and atmosphere and other conditions conducive to
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' Lin remarked, ``on one of those satellites, I
would probably have a beach-front property.''
</P>
<P>
   The planet closest to Upsilon Andromedae had already been
discovered by Marcy and Dr. R. Paul Butler in 1996. At the time,
they detected additional motions of the star suggesting other
companions, but only with repeated observations and careful
analysis could they be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers were less surprised by the discovery than relieved.
For several months, they had generally assumed the existence of
extra-solar planetary systems. After all, the Sun is a common type
of star, one of 200 billion in the Milky Way alone, and beyond lie
more than 80 billion other galaxies. It hardly seemed likely that
the Sun's planets were unique.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery is expected to tax the ingenuity of
theorists. It had been thought that such giant gas bodies could
only form at great distances from a star, out where temperatures
are low enough for ice to condense and begin the process of
planetary formation as gaseous spheres. Finding the single
Jupiter-class object near stars had forced scientists to invent
migration theories, explaining how the planets might have formed at
greater distances and then worked their way in closer to the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am mystified at how such a system of Jupiter-like planets
might have been created,'' Marcy said of the Upsilon Andromedae
system. ``This will shake up the theory of planetary formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss of the Carnegie Institution said the discovery could upset
conventional ideas explaining giant Jupiter-class planets. ``Maybe
nature has many ways of making giant planets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next milestone, astronomers said, would be finding evidence
of another system with a Jupiter-class planet out at a distance
from its star corresponding to Jupiter's from the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we do,'' Marcy said, ``there will always be the question
of whether the solar system is a cosmic freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Harvard-Smithsonian team were Dr. Sylvain
Korzennik, Dr. Peter Nisenson and Adam Contos, a graduate student.
Dr. Timothy Brown of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
worked with them. Their observations were made at the Whipple
Observatory near Tucson, Ariz. The San Francisco team used the Lick
Observatory near San Jose, Calif. Butler, formerly at San Francisco
State and now at the Anglo-Australian Observatory near Sydney, is
the lead author of the journal report on the detections.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a decade or more before spacecraft are in place to
look for Earth-size planets of other stars.
</P>
<P>
   After years of searching and speculation, both fanciful and
educated, the discovery of multiple objects orbiting Upsilon
Andromedae marked the beginning of the science of comparative
planetary systems.

CLINTON'S VIEW OF U.S. GOAL: `PEACEFUL TIME FOR EUROPE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an address by President Clinton on
Thursday in San Francisco to the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, as recorded by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the
crisis in Kosovo _ why we're there, what our objectives are, how
this fits in with our larger vision of the future. ...
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned
and long premeditated attack on an entire people simply on the
basis of their ethnicity and religion, an attack grounded in a
philosophy that teaches people to dearly love a piece of land while
utterly dismissing the humanity of those who occupy it.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Mr. Milosevic has been doing ever since Yugoslavia
started breaking up in 1989. ...
</P>
<P>
   As these difficult days proceed it is important to remember that
we have no quarrel with the Serbian people. They were our allies in
World War II. They have often been our allies. In a sense, they are
victims of this tragedy, too. And we must understand the anguish of
Serbian-Americans who, like Albanian-Americans, are worried about
their loved ones back home.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should not blame Serbs or look down on
Serbian-Americans because we disagree with the Milosevic
government. We must not let his ethnic cleansing provoke us to
ethnic bias. ...
</P>
<P>
   We've struck at Serbia's machinery of repression, at the
infrastructure that supports it. We've destroyed all of Serbia's
refineries, half of its capacity to produce ammunition. We've
attacked its bridges and rail lines and communications networks to
diminish its ability to supply, reinforce and control its forces in
Kosovo. Increasingly now we are striking the forces themselves,
hitting tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, radar
missiles and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   As the allies have said, all of us, repeatedly, Mr. Milosevic
can stop NATO's bombing by meeting these conditions:
</P>
<P>
   1. Serbian security forces must leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   2. The displaced Kosovars must be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   3. There must be an international security force to protect all
Kosovars, including the Serb minority there, as they work toward
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   If he refuses, our military campaign will continue to destroy as
much of his military capability as we can, so that each day his
capacity for repression will diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile his actions, though absolutely devastating to the
civilian population and horribly burdensome to the front-line
states of Macedonia and Albania, have not destroyed the armed
opposition among Kosovars. Indeed, their numbers and determination
are growing. Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic will have to choose either
to cut his mounting losses or lose his ability to maintain his grip
on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As for NATO, we are prepared to continue this effort as long as
necessary to achieve our objectives. Our timetable will be
determined by our goals, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we must do more to aid the refugees. They are
pouring out of Kosovo. We must help to preserve their lives and
health and their hope of return. This week NATO approved Operation
Allied Harbor, under which 8,000 troops will work with relief
agencies in Albania to establish camps, provide logistical support,
deliver aid and insure security. Thus far we have contributed in
the United States $150 million to this effort. Conditions at the
borders are beginning to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are most concerned about the fate of the refugees,
hundreds of thousands of them, trapped inside Kosovo. They are
unable to leave but afraid to go home. Mr. Milosevic apparently
wants to use them as hostages and human shields. And he's
preventing relief groups from getting to them. People of good will
all around the world today are trying to find ways to overcome this
cruel and cynical manipulation of innocent human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Milosevic also continues to hold on to the three American
servicemen his forces seized in Macedonia. He continues to flout
his obligation to allow the Red Cross to visit them. I want to say
again, as clearly as I can, the United States will hold him
personally responsible for their welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the stand we have taken, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo,
against organized ethnic hatred is a moral imperative. But it is
also a strategic imperative. ...
</P>
<P>
   The real question today is not whether Kosovo will be part of
Serbia. The real question is whether Kosovo and Serbia and the
other states of the region will be part of the new Europe. The best
solution for Kosovo, for Serbia for Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and
all the countries of southeast Europe is not the endless
rejiggering of their borders, but greater integration into a Europe
in which sovereignty matters, but in which borders are becoming
more and more open and less important in a negative sense.
</P>
<P>
   It is to affirm the principle that Mr. Milosevic has done so
very much to undermine that successful modern states make a virtue,
not a blood feud, out of ethnic and religious diversity. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Balkan war that began in Kosovo 10 years ago must end in
Kosovo. It should be the last conflict of the 21st _ 20th _
century. It should not be the defining conflict of the 21st
century. The United States has the opportunity and the
responsibility to make that decision come out right for our
children and our grandchildren. We can help to lead to a new day
for the people of this long-suffering region, a more peaceful time
for Europe and a better future for the United States.

   New Internet Frenzy: An Acquisition Boom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies went on a buying spree in the first quarter
of 1999, using the sky-high valuations of their shares to buy up
other companies _ almost all of them Internet-related, too _ at a
record pace.
</P>
<P>
   According to data from Thomson Financial Securities Data in
Newark, N.J., Internet concerns announced acquisitions worth $12.29
billion in the quarter _ a greater amount than for all of last
year, when the total was $8.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest deals announced last quarter were the At Home
Corp's acquisition of Excite Inc. for $5.95 billion in stock and
Yahoo's agreement to buy Geocities for $4.66 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend we're seeing is one of high- multiple companies
buying other high- multiple companies,'' said Thomas Burnett,
director of Merger Insight, a research firm in New York, adding
that almost all the deals were for stock.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett said that while the on-line acquirers so far have gone
after their own kind, that is likely to change, and soon. ``The
idea would be to use your high-multiple stock to buy a real
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that an Internet service provider like America
Online would find it increasingly attractive to buy or team up with
a non-Internet media company, like CBS Inc. ``They've got to
leverage their 16 million customers,'' he said, referring to
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Other targets for Internet companies might be savings
institutions or banks, which could provide on-line financial
services, Burnett added.
</P>
<P>
   As for the second quarter of 1999, it certainly started with a
bang. On April 1, Yahoo agreed to buy Broadcast.Com for stock worth
$4.73 billion.

   NASDAQ Looks East for Listings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, parent of the
NASDAQ stock market, plans to open an office in Shanghai next year
in an effort to recruit more Chinese companies. The office is
intended to give the NASD a leg up in its battle with the New York
Stock Exchange for listings around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chief executive of the NASD, announced plans for the
office at a news conference last Tuesday in New York with Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji of China. ``We hope this is the beginning of a
process to create for China a way to bring investors' capital to
growing companies,'' Zarb said.

   FUNDS WATCH
</P>
<P>
   A Leveraged Buyout Fund For the Run-of-the-Mill Rich &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The leveraged buyout fund for individuals is here. Or at least
an buyout fund for pretty rich individuals: the Independence
Private Equity Select fund, which has minimum investment is
$250,000, a mere pittance for most such offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The fund closed in March after a subscription period that netted
more than $50 million. A fund of funds, Independence is invested in
three leveraged buyout funds, all of which are managed by leading
investment firms: Apollo Advisors; Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice; and
Hicks, Muse Tate &AMP; Furst.
</P>
<P>
   Is there really a need for a budget-priced leveraged buyout
fund? Absolutely, said Mark Klein, managing member of Independence
Holdings Partners LLC, the New York investment firm managing the
fund. ``Wealthy individuals don't have access to private equity
markets,'' he said. That has meant that they have missed out on
returns in excess of 40 percent a year from past funds managed by
Apollo, Hicks, Muse and Clayton Dubilier, according to Klein's
research.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will pay Independence Holdings a 1 percent annual
advisory fee, as well as a so-called incentive allocation of 5
percent of all profits after their initial investment is returned
to them over the funds' life. That's in addition to the fees paid
to the underlying funds. Klein expects the fund to return all
capital and proceeds to investors in less than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Holdings, which Klein describes as an ``alternative
investment company for high-net-worth individuals'' is in the
process of organizing a new fund and plans to offer it later this
year. The fund, which is treated as a private equity placement, has
stringent regulations as to the assets and income people need to
invest. Investors can contact their private bankers or financial
advisers to see whether they qualify.

 &HT;    Congested border highways to get $42 million in relief
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The border scored a victory in its push for more
highway money Thursday when Texas Transportation Commissioner David
Laney and several key lawmakers announced a wide-ranging plan to
spend an additional $42 million to speed up and expand border
highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic has choked many larger cities on the Texas-Mexico border
since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect five
years ago, and late last year leaders from every border county
banded together to pressure the Legislature to spend more on roads,
job training, and economic development on the border.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, together with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and a host of border
lawmakers, unveiled a package that will boost the Texas Department
of Transportation's program for NAFTA-related projects from $8
million to $50 million _ an increase that Laney said will help get
needed roads built faster on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll see a lot of dirt flying and a design work and
planning work (being done) within the year,'' said Laney, who
chairs the three-member commission that oversees the Texas
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The money will come from TxDot's budget, he said, without
offering specifics: ``We'll find it somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan also includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Reducing, or in some cases eliminating, the local match
requirement for some projects. Many border communities have
complained that needed projects often aren't done because they
can't raise the matching funds the state requires.
</P>
<P>
   _Hiring a border czar at TxDot. Edward Wueste, an Eagle Pass
native and 38-year veteran of the Federal Highway Administration,
will be hired May 1 as the agency's assistant director for border
trade transportation. He will be responsible for cutting red tape
and overseeing border highway projects.
</P>
<P>
   _Speeding up work on certain highways, such as U.S. 77 leading
north from the Rio Grande Valley, U.S. 83 from Brownsville to
Laredo, U.S. 59 from Laredo to Victoria, and Texas 44 from Corpus
Christi to U.S. 59. Some are slated for widening, while others,
such as U.S. 77, will be diverted around small towns where
motorists now face stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who is being closely watched by border leaders after
successfully courting border voters during last year's elections,
said he's following through on the promises he made on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said then, and I still believe, that if the border region
succeeds, the state of Texas will succeed,'' he said. ``The border
of Texas, I think, will be the epicenter of trade in the state of
Texas, and we need to start treating it as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Allen, head of the McAllen Economic Development Corp. and
the driving force behind the newly formed Border Infrastructure
Coalition, called the announcement ``a good first step. I think
Perry has really been out front in pushing for the border. I'm
hoping we see some good results at the end of the session.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen and his allies on the border are still pushing for the big
prize. They originally asked lawmakers for close to $1 billion in
transportation spending on the border, a figure that was pared to
around $600 million in a Senate committee. Now many border
lawmakers are looking to bonds and other alternatives to funnel
money toward the border.

OLD FAVORITES PROPEL WALL ST. AS HOUSEHOLD NAMES FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors piled into basic-industry stocks again
Thursday in what increasingly appears to be a shift away from the
household names that had dominated the market's long advance.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-swinging session marked by heavy volume, the Dow Jones
industrial average climbed 51.06 points, to 10,462.72, yet another
record. The Nasdaq market began by extending Wednesday's steep
slide, only to stage an impressive rally and close up 14.49 points
at 2,521.77.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is a classic'' realignment, said Charles
Pradilla, chief strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. ``Even though
the market is hitting new highs, the rotation below the surface has
been extraordinarily dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a trend that has come into focus over the past week or so,
shares of producers of machinery, chemicals, paper, oil and other
industrial goods are in strong demand. Chevron, Minnesota Mining
and United Technologies all gained more than four points Thursday
to pace the Dow blue-chip average, followed by Boeing, Exxon,
International Paper and Goodyear, all up more than three points.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the impetus has come from evidence of economic revival _
or at least improved prospects _ overseas, and a pickup in business
at American factories. A Federal Reserve report of faster
industrial growth in the Philadelphia region added to these signs
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent favorites were hammered, in the meantime, including
Pfizer, which was down 14 5/8, to 130, after reporting
first-quarter profits that matched expectations, but also warning
that second-quarter earnings-per-share growth would be only in the
single digits. EMC slumped 9 3/16, to 115 7/8, after Storage
Technology, a chief rival in the data storage business, reported
disappointing profits and the layoff of 6 percent of its work
force. Storage Technology plunged 7 1/16, to 19.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks slumped heavily but then rallied to finish
mostly with small changes. An exception was Ebay, which gained 16,
to 178 7/8, after trading as low as 152 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wild stuff,'' said Philip Rettew, a senior market analyst
at Merrill Lynch. ``There haven't been many times that this is like
_ the enormous degree of speculation,'' especially in companies
that have yet to earn a dime. People have now decided, Rettew
added, that even Internet stocks are to be bought, rather than
fled, on dips.
</P>
<P>
   The April 15 tax deadline, analysts said, contributed to the
day's market activity, as some people added money to retirement
accounts that might otherwise have gone to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume swelled to 1.09 billion
shares from 952 million on Wednesday. Trading on Nasdaq eased from
Wednesday's record-setting 1.42 billion shares to 1.23 billion,
still the ninth-busiest ever.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's gain, the Dow industrials are ahead 13.96
percent for the year. The Dow's gain briefly surpassed the Nasdaq's
before that market's composite index rallied, up 15.01 percent so
far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, up 3 3/8 on Wednesday, added an additional 3 11/16 on
Thursday, closing at 41 11/16, after announcing earnings that beat
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors and Ford also reported higher profits than most
Wall Street analysts had forecast, but Ford edged up only 1/16, to
62 13/16, while GM fell 3 3/16, to 86 9/16. The decline was said to
reflect GM's shrinking market share, high retiree costs at the
parts unit it is spinning off, and the fact that profits were not
as good as the most optimistic analysts hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, the toy maker, climbed 2 5/16, to 28 1/4, after
announcing that it would close plants, discharge 10 percent of its
work force and form an Internet unit, part of which would be sold
to the public. It also reported a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Several stock brokers were hard hit, including Charles Schwab,
which gave back 14 1/4 more points, to 124, after losing 12 1/4 on
Wednesday. The firm's earnings matched predictions, but analysts
had hoped for faster growth of its online trading business.
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette slumped 7 15/16, to 85 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines stocks, sharply higher on Wednesday, fell Thursday.
Delta slumped 3 3/16, to 68, despite stronger earnings, as analysts
fretted about overcapacity and a dispute with pilots. UAL fell 4
5/16, to 77 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks fell again. In addition to Pfizer's skid,
Schering-Plough lost 3 1/8, to 52 1/16, and Bristol-Myers 3, to 61
5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.58 points, or
42-hundredths of 1 percent. The Dow industrials and the Nasdaq were
up 49-hundredths of 1 percent and 58-hundredths of 1 percent,
respectively. The Russell 2000, a gauge of small-capitalization
stocks, edged up nine-hundredths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange beat declining
ones by 1,781 -1,295; there were 74 new 52-week highs and 56 new
lows.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Bolsa advanced 3.65 percent, but major markets in
Japan, Brazil and most of Europe were down by fractions of 1
percent.

CLINTON OPPOSES ETHNIC PARTITIONING OF KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton, while expressing strong
distaste for the continued rule of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, voiced resolute opposition Thursday to ethnic
partitioning of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need in the Balkans is greater
Balkanization,'' Clinton told the annual convention of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that dividing the territory of the Serbian
province, as well as other tension-fraught regions of southeastern
Europe, between Christians and Muslims and along other ethnic lines
would be a ceaseless nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it starts, it would never end,'' Clinton said. The ``best
solution'' for the region, he said, ``is not the endless
rejiggering of their borders but greater integration'' into
post-Cold War Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton came as close as he has in his
years-long diplomatic fencing with Milosevic, to saying that the
former Communist bureaucrat must go if there is to be peace in
war-torn southeastern Europe, long a breeding ground for some of
the continent's nastiest antagonisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, it will require a democratic transition in
Serbia, for the region's democracies will never be safe with a
belligerent tyranny in their midst,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his prepared remarks, did not address the NATO
airstrike in Kosovo on Wednesday in which ethnic Albanian refugees
were killed and wounded. In answer to a question, Clinton expressed
his regret but said: ``You cannot have this kind of conflict
without some errors like this occurring.''
</P>
<P>
   The tragic development in the three-week-old engagement was the
focus of a few hundred protesters massed behind police barricades
outside the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill where Clinton spoke. The
sign-waving antiwar demonstrators raised a chant reminiscent of the
Vietnam era, during which Clinton resisted being drafted to serve
in a conflict he believed was immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Clinton, what do you say,'' cried a protest leader, and
the crowd replied, ``How many kids did you kill today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombs and lies drive the new world order,'' said one sign.
Another read: ``No new Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the editors' meeting, the fifth of his
tenure, was arranged quickly when the White House decided the
president should not pass up a chance to address a group that could
influence the public perception of the biggest U.S. military
operation since the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The trip also marks Clinton's first ventures on the Democratic
fund-raising trail since the NATO air attacks began. Clinton is to
be the star of party events Friday in Michigan and Massachusetts.
Facing Republican criticism, Clinton called off a series of
scheduled fund-raising events early in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart justified the president's
return to the effort saying: ``The business of this country is
ongoing. One of the things that any president does, whether it's a
Democrat or Republican, whether it's the '90s or the '80s, is, as a
leader of the party, participates in party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his speech to the newspaper executives by
contrasting the tightly controlled media in Yugoslavia and the free
American press represented by the several hundred editors in the
Fairmont ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton also cited the three U.S. servicemen
captured early in the conflict along the Kosovo-Macedonia border
and repeated his warning to Milosevic about their treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States will hold him personally responsible for
their welfare,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Clinton's speech was intended as a philosophical
justification for the U.S.-led NATO operation against Milosevic's
victimization of Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made it clear, however, that while the administration
does not want a Milosevic-ruled ``greater Serbia'' it is even less
interested in seeing a ``greater Albania.'' That would almost
certainly exacerbate the religious divide in the region and could
foment new trouble between U.S. allies Greece, with its Orthodox
Christian majority, and Turkey, which is largely Muslim,
administration officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   While Kosovar Albanian demands for independence are ``certainly
understandable,'' Clinton said, partition is ``not the best
answer.'' He said NATO was fighting for ``the principle of
multi-ethnic, tolerant, inclusive democracy. We have been fighting
against the idea that statehood must be based entirely on
ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people,'' Clinton said, ``think the best way to solve
Kosovo's problems, and Serbia's and Bosnia's, is to withdraw their
borders and rearrange their people to reflect their ethnic
distinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such suggestions, Clinton said, did not recognize the realities
of the region, which are of a ``staggering complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to choose this course, we would see the continuous
fissioning of smaller and smaller ethnically based, inviable
states, creating pressures for more war, more `ethnic cleansing,'
more of the politics of repression and revenge.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mattel Inc., after reporting a loss in the first
quarter, said Thursday that it would dismiss more than 3,000
employees, or about 10 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has struggled with reduced sales and high
costs, also said that it would start an Internet business and might
sell a stake in it to the public through a stock offering later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The steps are the latest in an effort by Jill E. Barad, Mattel's
chairwoman and chief executive, to right the company, the world's
largest toy maker, after several quarters of disappointing
earnings. Last month she reorganized management, and the company's
chief operating officer departed.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, which has about 29,000 employees, said the work force
reductions would begin next week and would also involve closing
some factories and other offices. It would not provide further
information.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, known for its Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, reported
a loss of $17.9 million, or 7 cents a share, for the first quarter
in contrast to a net profit of $12.7 million, or 4 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue fell 2 percent, to $692.1 million from $705.2
million, as sales of its Tickle Me Elmo doll nearly evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Mattel's loss, its rival Hasbro Inc. reported a
77 percent gain in net income and a 38 percent rise in revenue.
Hasbro has a stable of hot toys like Furby, Pokemon and
Teletubbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasbro had a no-holds-barred great first quarter,'' said John
G. Taylor, an analyst at the Arcadia Investment Corp. in Portland,
Ore. ``Their products have a lot more heat on them right now.''
Hasbro's stock closed up $1.875 at $32, a new 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Mattel's less-stellar numbers, analysts on a
conference call congratulated Ms. Barad for a strong quarter, and
the company's stock gained even more _ $2.3125 to close at $28.25.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because after several quarters of earnings that
were worse than expected, the results this time were a tad better
than analysts had anticipated. The stock rise also reflects a view
that the worst is behind Mattel and a frenzy by investors of the
type that these days accompanies any public offering of an
Internet-related stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad, who has been under pressure from investors to improve
results, said the company was rebounding after problems that
included a cutback in ordering by Toys ``R'' Us, the largest toy
retailer. Shipments of Barbie, the flagship product, were up 3
percent worldwide and 11 percent in the United States in the
quarter. ``The core brands are holding up very very well,'' she
said in the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview if Mattel was out of the woods, she
replied: ``I think Mattel was never essentially in the woods. I
think the industry was changing and we weren't changing fast enough
to be in front of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts remained skeptical, saying that some of the
sales comparisons with last year meant little because of weak sales
at that time. Barbie sales at retail were down in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't say there's any proof there that they're out of
the woods,'' said Sean P. McGowan, an analyst with Gerard Klauer
Mattison &AMP; Co.. Jill S. Krutick, who follows Mattel for Salomon
Smith Barney, agreed, saying, ``I think it's still a work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., will take a
pretax charge against earnings of $300 million to $350 million in
the second quarter to cover both the restructuring and costs
related to its acquisition of the Learning Co. an educational
software maker, which is expected to close in May.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will lead to savings of $50 million this year
and $400 million over the following three years, the company said.
Mattel stuck with its previous target of earning $1.50 a share this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mattel has dabbled with electronic commerce, it now
intends to offer many of its products electronically, along with
such entertainment as online Hot Wheels racing and Barbie
animation.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects sales through Mattel.com to reach $60
million this year with profit margins far higher than for sales
through traditional retailers. But these retailers, who are worried
about being bypassed, will share in some of the benefits from the
online sales, Ms. Barad said, declining to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the No. 2 toy maker, reported net earnings of $13.8
million, or 7 cents a diluted share, up from $7.8 million, or 4
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue reached $668.4 million, less
than $24 million behind Mattel. A big reason for the increase was
Hasbro's acquisition last year of Tiger Electronics, maker of the
talking Furby creature.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro could do even better in coming quarters because it has
the license to make toys connected with ``The Phantom Menace,'' the
new Star Wars movie that is to open next month. Mattel will counter
with products for ``Toy Story 2,'' ``Tarzan'' and a new Sesame
Street movie.

RABBI ADMITS TO SIPHONING PUBLIC MONEY FOR PRIVATE JEWISH GIRLS'
SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an elaborate scheme that somehow went
undetected for nearly two decades, investigators said Thursday: A
prominent Hasidic rabbi and a Brooklyn public school district
conspired to place dozens of Hasidic housewives in no-show jobs on
the district payroll as part of a plot to siphon more than $6
million to a private Jewish girls' school and its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The women got health insurance benefits for their families _
some with as many as 10 children _ but often handed their paychecks
over to the rabbi, Hertz Frankel, investigators said. The rabbi
gave most of the money to the school, Beth Rachel, in Williamsburg,
which bills itself as the largest Jewish girls' school in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, investigators said, there appeared to be an
understanding: Frankel assured administrators of the public school
district, No. 14, that they had the support of a critical bloc of
Hasidic men on the nine-member community school board.
</P>
<P>
   In a resolution of the case announced Thursday by the special
commissioner of investigation for the city's schools, Frankel, 68,
pleaded guilty last Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn to
one count of conspiracy in the scheme, which lasted from the
mid-1970s until 1994, two years after investigators were given the
first hints of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Eugene H. Nickerson sentenced Frankel to three years'
probation and ordered him to pay $1 million in restitution. The
school, where the rabbi is a principal, was permitted to pay the
money on his behalf because there was no evidence that he had
benefited personally from the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps who is so
prominent in the international Hasidic community that he was
enlisted as a plaintiff in a suit to recover Jews' wartime assets
from Swiss banks, did not appear in public Thursday. But in a
statement he confirmed the unusual scheme but dismissed it as an
acceptable _ albeit under-the-table _ private-school voucher
program.
</P>
<P>
   And he laid much of the blame on two dead men: William A. Rogers
and Mario DeStefano, the district's superintendents during the
course of the scheme, who died in 1992 and 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``In meetings with me,'' the rabbi said, ``Dr. Rogers repeatedly
told me that this was equitable because our private school was
lifting a serious economic burden from the New York taxpayers by
educating our children in religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who denied holding any sway over the district board
members, said he first learned that the financial arrangement was
``unlawful'' from federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to funds from the city and the state, the girls'
school did receive public money from one potentially legitimate
source: Title I, the federal program for remedial education for
needy students, which goes to private schools as well as public
ones.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigators said the federal funds paid for dozens of
employees to whom the girls' school was not entitled, and for
courses that were anything but remedial.
</P>
<P>
   No aspect of the scheme had ever been described publicly before
Thursday. And investigators on both the city and federal levels,
along with prosecutors and aides to Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew,
were at a loss Thursday to explain how such an extensive
arrangement involving so much money had eluded so many potential
levels of detection for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people benefited from this corrupt bargain,'' said the
special commissioner, Edward F. Stancik. ``None of them were New
York City public school students or their parents. It is the
students who were the real losers in this.''

 SUN MICROSYSTEMS REPORTS RECORD REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR 3rd By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems Inc. reported Thursday record
revenues and earnings for its fiscal third quarter, as the maker of
workstations and servers continued to gain market share. While
Sun's earnings were just a penny above the consensus estimate,
revenues were substantially higher than analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sun, which reported its results after the market's
close, ended the day at $60.4375, down $2.125 in Nasdaq trading,
amid a day of turmoil for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's strong results, coming just a day after Apple Computer
Inc. beat estimates for the sixth consecutive quarter, indicate a
shift in the market. Sun and Apple have long been considered
vulnerable because they do not adhere to the standards set by the
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and the Intel Corp.'s
Pentium microprocessors. But it now appears that both companies are
finding ways to differentiate their products and generate
above-average revenue growth and profit margins while ``Wintel''
stalwarts like the Compaq Computer Corp. sputter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas a year ago, both the investor and the end user opinion
was that being out of the mainstream was a bad thing, now being out
of the mainstream is a good thing,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``One way it's a good thing is that it
provides clarity of focus. Another is value-added.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 31, Sun reported earnings of $261.2
million, or 63 cents per diluted share, up 13 percent compared with
$232.0 million, or 59 cents a share, in the comparable period a
year ago. Revenues rose 24 percent to $2.94 billion from $2.36
billion in the third quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the quarter include a charge of $28.7 million in
connection with the acquisition of the Maxstrat Corp.. Due to the
structure of this transaction, Sun also incurred an increase of
$10.9 million to its income tax provision. Without these one-time
items, Sun earned $291.4 million, or 71 cents a share. Per-share
figures do not reflect Sun's recent two-for-one stock split which
was paid on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Sun to earn 70 cents a share, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We experienced particularly strong demand for workgroup
servers, high-end servers, storage and services,'' Michael E.
Lehman, Sun's vice president of corporate resources and chief
financial officer, said in a telephone interview.

TWO DAYS' COMMENTS AFTER CIVILIANS WERE ATTACKED 
</HEADLINE>
 (ac) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are statements related to the reports Albanian
civilians were killed in a NATO air attack:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WEDNESDAY  &LR;  The Supreme Commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark,
in an interview transmitted by the Bloomberg News Service:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a military convoy and a refugee convoy. We struck
the Serb convoy, and we have very strong evidence that the Serbs
then retaliated by attacking the column of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the White House, Joe Lockhart, in a briefing
about 2 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I have no information that leads me to believe
they struck a convoy with refugees. I will remind you, and maybe
this should be a daily reminder or note of caution, that the people
who tell you these things look at you with straight face and say
they haven't forcibly removed anyone from Kosovo, that they haven't
killed anyone, that they haven't burned any villages, that somehow
NATO has done all that.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, Director of the Agency for International
Development, which is overseeing refugee relief, in a telephone
briefing for several reporters at 2:30 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   If civilians were killed, that would be a result of ``a very
cynical policy of using human beings as shields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got very hard evidence of that. We do have evidence that
they are using Albanian Kosovars as human shields and that this may
be an example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, at the daily
briefing at the Pentagon, also at 2:30:
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO pilots reported hitting military vehicles on a road. I
don't know if this is the same road. But they have reported hitting
military vehicles. We have been attacking convoys as regularly as
we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're looking at now. But as I said, we just got
this report from refugees, and we don't know whether they're
reporting about something that happened today or something that
happened several days ago. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite sure that we only hit military vehicles, and we
will obviously review what happened there to find out if there was
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spokesman for the Pentagon, Michael Doubleday, in a
telephone interview at 7 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that, for the sake of understanding, think of two
different events. The first occurred on the road between Djakovica
and Prizen, near the town of Zrze, at 15:30. We don't know exactly
what happened. We don't have anything that supports Serb
retaliation. We believe there was an attack by NATO aircraft on a
convoy against military vehicle. In the course of the attack the
pilot saw civilian vehicles and broke off the attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon in a phone interview with The New York Times at 8 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   ``General Clark had an initial report that there was Serb
retaliation against civilians in the convoy. On further checking,
he has found no evidence to substantiate that there was Serb
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Clark no longer believes the report is correct.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THURSDAY  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for NATO, Jamie Shea, at the daily briefing at 9
a.m., Eastern time:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to comment first on yesterday's incident. NATO deeply
regrets the loss of life to civilians from the attack yesterday on
a convoy traveling between Prizren and Djakovica. As you all know,
NATO pilots have orders to strike only at military targets. We have
taken every possible precaution to avoid causing harm to civilians.
Our Operation Allied Force was launched to save civilian lives, not
to expend them.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman for NATO, Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani, at
the same briefing:
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO confirms from its preliminary investigation that it
appears that one of its aircraft may have mistakenly dropped a bomb
on a civilian vehicle in a convoy yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen as he testified to the Senate
Armed Services Committee:
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, let me express our regret for what happened
yesterday. Any time there's a loss of innocent life, of civilians'
being killed during the course of combat, it is regrettable. I
would just discuss the facts as I know them now. And here we want
to be tentative as qualified as I can, because reports are still
being refined. And the one thing we've learned over the years is
not to jump to any hasty conclusions about what the factual
situation was on the ground.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a case of an isolated aircraft's going after a
convoy unrelated to the air campaign itself. It was part of a
two-hour air campaign, during which time the missions of the NATO
air force were being carried out, attacking a variety of sites.
There was, in fact, a convoy that was spotted, and apparently the
pilot went after that convoy. And during the course of that he did
have some triple-A, antiaircraft artillery fire, directed at him.
Also some shoulder-fired or Man-Pad type of surface-to-air missiles
fired at him. It was under those circumstances in which that attack
was being carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, as he answered a question from the American
Society of Newspaper Editors in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, first of all, what we believe happened is that the pilot
thought it was a military convoy and that there were apparently
civilians in the convoy who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is regrettable. It is also inevitable in a conflict of
this kind, with planes traveling at high speeds, doing the best to
fulfill their mission. And if the requirement is that nothing like
this can ever happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr.
Milosevic displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes
thousands upon thousands of them. And keep in mind, in Bosnia there
were more than two million refugees and a quarter of a million
people killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like
this occurring. This is not a business of perfection. I ask you to
think about the hundreds and hundreds of sorties which have been
flown in the last three weeks and the small number of civilian
casualties.''

U.S. EDITORS PROTEST CONTROLS ON KOSOVO NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Editors and executives of seven major U.S. news
organizations have written a letter of protest to Defense Secretary
William Cohen urging him to loosen the current controls on
information about the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia, saying that
``on many days, the state-controlled Yugoslav media has been more
specific about NATO targets than the United States or NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Detailed information about the allied operation is vital to an
informed public discussion of this matter of national interest,''
the editors said in the letter, which was dated April 9 but
delivered this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking here Thursday to the annual
gathering of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, said he had
raised this issue with two other NATO leaders on Wednesday
``because I think it's important not just in the United States but
throughout Europe to get more information out more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added that the mountainous Balkan terrain and
cloudy weather had hampered the ability of NATO's forces to assess
the damage caused by the allied bombing. ``Sometimes there are
inevitable delays,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Downie Jr., the executive editor of The Washington Post,
who questioned the president about the issue after Clinton spoke to
the editors, said afterwards that he understood the difficulties of
coordinating with 18 other NATO nations and the obstacles presented
by the terrain and the weather. But, Downie said, ``that's not a
sufficient explanation for the lack of information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can tell us,'' he continued, ``that X percentage of
today's bombing run we don't know the result because of cloud
cover. But they do know which planes are returning to base and
which ones are returning to ships without dropping bombs at all,
which they have not told us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening of hostilities in the Persian Gulf war, there
were extensive discussions between Washington news executives and
the Pentagon over how the military could best provide information
without endangering its strategy or its troops.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the editors acknowledged the need to ``withhold
information that would jeopardize ongoing operations or endanger
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, they said, ``the current restrictions seem to us to go way
beyond that need.''

BREAKTHROUGH MAY LEAD TO LAB-GROWN HUMAN BLOOD VESSELS

   HOUSTON_ It may sound sci-fi but it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have grown an artery from animal cells that acts
like the real thing when sewn back into the donor animal, a
breakthrough that could lead to the production of lab-grown human
blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   It's an important development in tissue engineering, a field
aimed at growing replacement parts for people and solving the
perennial problem of insufficient organ donors. Vessels and organs
created from the patient's own cells would greatly reduce the risk
of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The pig neo-artery was made with a spongy, synthetic
``scaffolding'' shaped like a vessel and seeded with cells taken
from the blood vessels of an adult pig. Placed inside a
``bioreactor'' system that mimics the fetal environment, the cells
grew and the scaffolding dissolved, leaving a tube of vascular
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the naked eye, the vessels looked exactly like native
vessels,'' said Dr. Laura Niklason, a bioengineer at Duke
University. ``The surgeons who sewed them in told me the way they
held a suture was also comparable. The arteries also withstood
blood pressures the same as native vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, scientists hope to grow blood vessels from human
cells and use them in heart bypass surgery. Even further down the
road, the lab-grown vessels could someday supply blood to lab-grown
organs, such as hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, published in Fridday's issue of the journal
Science, was conducted by Niklason, Dr. Robert Langer of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a leader in bioengineering,
and Baylor College of Medicine cell biologist Karen Hirchi of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other Houston researchers are engaged in perfecting lab-grown
blood vessels. Larry McIntyre, chair of Rice University's Institute
of Biosciences and Bioengineering, said the Texas Heart Institute
is experimenting with inserting genes into cells to develop vessels
with a clot-resistant lining. Jennifer West, an assistant professor
of bioengineering at Rice, is developing new material for the
scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, scientists are focusing on other parts of the
anatomy. In January, researchers reported that replacement bladders
_ a relatively rudimentary organ _ had been grown in the lab,
implanted in six beagles and functioned for as long as 18 months. A
similar method has been used to grow skin, for use in treating
severe burns, and cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   While the pig vessel experiment is an important development, it
is too early to say when bioengineered blood vessels will be used
in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of biological and technical challenges must be
overcome,'' Hirschi said. ``Human vessel cells are much more
difficult to grow and their rate of growth is much slower. We also
need to learn if the culture process changes cells in any way that
will significantly affect their ability to function.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the latest artery experiment, Hirschi and her colleagues
isolated two types of cells from the pig vessels: endothelial cells
from the inside of the vessels and smooth muscle cells from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   After multiplying them in a culture, the smooth muscle cells
were applied around the polymer scaffold. The scaffold was
suspended in the bioreactor, a sort of glass tube, and profused
with a nutrient solution.
</P>
<P>
   The pulsing action of the bioreactor, for reasons that are still
unclear, resulted in stronger veins than those grown in a static
environment.
</P>
<P>
   While in the bioreactor, the supporting polymer scaffolds
dissolved over an eight- to 10-week period, leaving a tube of
smooth muscle cells. The tubes were then lined with endothelial
cells to make complete vessels. Several days later, the 1.5-inch
vessels were implanted into the orginal donor pigs and left in
place for four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels, which functioned for the entire four-week test,
were as strong as the animals' native vessels and held surgical
sutures without tearing.
</P>
<P>
   In other experiments, vessels had not proved strong enough to
function more than a few days. Hirschi helped develop a nutrient
solution that included vitamin C and copper, which strengthened the
material, or matrix, that binds cells together.

 &HT;    Twister tears path through Vienna
 &HT;    By Duane Stanford, Ralph Ellis and Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Ga. _ A tornado chewed up and spit out a big bite of
this Middle Georgia town Thursday, leaving as many as 400 people
homeless and injuring 50 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit at about 10:30 a.m., toppling a brick church
steeple, obliterating a supermarket and flattening a metal
warehouse building, all in or near downtown Vienna, population
2,700.
</P>
<P>
   The most concentrated damage occurred at two low-income
apartment complexes at the edge of town. More than 125 apartment
units were ravaged, their roofs ripped away as residents cowered in
closets or under tables.
</P>
<P>
   The twister was one of two that touched down in Georgia, spawned
by a wide-ranging storm front that killed a man in Mississippi and
damaged homes in eastern Alabama before moving into Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   At least two people were injured in Candler County in
east-central Georgia when a tornado touched down north of Metter,
about 60 miles west of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes quickly declared Dooly and Candler counties
disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   As he flew over Vienna (residents call it VIE-anna) on Thursday
afternoon, Barnes was convinced that he was approaching the scene
of a catastrophe. His first question after his helicopter landed
was ``How many folks were killed?''
</P>
<P>
   When the answer came back ``none,'' Barnes said, ``The Lord was
looking after us on this day.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who rode out the devilish winds might give that
assessment a big ``Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Brown, 48, and her daughter Tina, 20, were baby-sitting
half a dozen toddlers in a trailer on Power Street when the tornado
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it went to raining. Then it (the trailer) started
rocking. We were lying flat down on the floor. They were screaming
and hollering _ but not only the babies, me too. Then the walls and
the roof caved in on us.''
</P>
<P>
   They pushed their way through the wreckage and were taken to the
hospital. Bobbie Brown had cuts on her arm and foot, and Tina Brown
had a gash on her leg. None of the children was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments before the storm hit, Tommy Clark, 29, the father
of one of the children, came to the Browns' trailer to warn them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had time to do was tell them to get down. Tables, TVs,
everything was moving on me, and I couldn't clamp down on
anything,'' Clark said. ``All I could do was stick my fingers in
the floorboards. If it took me, it would have to take the trailer,
too. If you went down there now, you'd see eight holes in the
floor, where I put my fingers in the linoleum.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Dooly Medical Center in Vienna reported treating 50
to 60 people after the storm, most of them for cuts and bruises.
The most serious injuries were some deep lacerations and broken
limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were admitted to the hospital suffering from
inhalation of natural gas, released when a gas main broke during
the storm. Five people injured during the storm were hospitalized
overnight, but all were expected to be released by today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad, but it could have been much worse,'' said hospital
spokesman Kent McMackin.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna Police Chief David Musselwhite said power was cut off to
much of the city, but it was expected to be restored by this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 apartment units were damaged, and 25 to 30
single-family homes were destroyed, according to officials of the
Georgia Emergency Management Agency. About 400 people will stay in
emergency shelters at two schools in the Vienna area, and the
classes will be canceled at least through Monday. The worst damage
to commercial buildings in Vienna was to the Stevens Grocery Store
and to a warehouse owned by the Vienna Cotton Co. On East Pine
Street, Mary Hooks was styling the hair of five elderly women at
her Sensational Touch beauty shop. The shop is in a double-wide
trailer that also serves as Hooks' home.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit, Hooks and the customers crouched on the
floor, then lay down. One woman was holding a baby, a grandchild
she was caring for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We covered up the baby; we almost smothered it. We tried to
hang on to what we could _ walls, chairs ... ,'' Hooks recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Two trees crashed onto the trailer, including the new addition
where she planned to move her shop. The trailer rocked, but stayed
upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people say it sounds like a freight train,''
Hooks said. ``It does.''
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, the beautician was able to revive her spirits
somewhat. People helping salvage her belongings were able to find
family pictures, a set of encyclopedias and her cosmetology
license.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Bobby Horton, 50, was inside his $100-a-month rental
house, when the rain started falling hard. He saw a man walking
down the street and called him to come inside. As he entered, the
wind started blowing the front door wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both tried to hold the door, but the wind was too strong,''
Horton said. ``It blew me back by the headboards (of a bed across
the room), and I stayed there until it was over. I was looking at
the roof when it blew off, and the walls when they went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Carter, 59, was sitting in his maroon easy chair inside
his house, reading verses of the books of Isaiah and Genesis for
his Bible study, when the lights went out.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he cracked the blinds and saw the black funnel cloud
heading right for his home. He quickly switched from reading
Genesis to reciting the 23rd Psalm. He hit the floor and heard a
loud crash as a pecan tree smashed into the roof of his house.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later, he realized he had walked through the valley
of death without a scratch. ``I'm blessed,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Payne was standing in a parking lot outside Flippy's
convenience store in Vienna when he saw the twister coming. He
barely had time to hop into the back of a pickup truck, which he
discovered was already occupied by two other men. They all started
praying together: ``Thank you, Jesus. Don't let it hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the winds passed over, Payne said he looked up and saw two
brick homes across the street being destroyed. ``It looked like
somebody took a handful of trash and threw it up into the wind. It
ain't no good feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man reported that while the storm was at its worst, he
looked outside to check on his Rottweiler, which he'd left chained
to a tree. The dog was fully airborne, held to the tree by the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   After the winds subsided, the dog was unhurt.

A BIG QUARTERBACK SEEKS HIS FIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daunte Culpepper stood in a Gentleman's Quarterly
fitting room Thursday afternoon, slipping on GQ styles. The
National Football League draft had gone Madison Avenue. And
Culpepper, Central Florida's Herculean quarterback in town for
Saturday's draft, liked the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a fashion show once in high school _ when I'm going
out, I like to look nice,'' Culpepper said, smiling, reveling in
his whirlwind breeze through Manhattan. The fitting revealed a 49
extra-long jacket, a 19-inch neck, a 36-inch waist and a size 14
shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Next was a trip to the Bronx. To John F. Kennedy High School.
</P>
<P>
   There Culpepper found 144 boys aged 12 through 14 who
participate in the NFL's new football program, Junior Player
Development. It is an ambitious idea, a joint program among the
NFL, the New York Police Athletic League and local high school
football coaches. The eight-week program is one the league hopes to
duplicate in cities with NFL franchises. The long-term goal is
youth leagues formed as part of an overall $100 million investment
for youth football.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper stood in the middle of a circle formed by the sitting
players and told them that though he was preparing to be drafted by
an NFL team this weekend, it would never have happened without his
teammates, family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Later he said: ``I looked into their eyes and I saw myself. It
wasn't that long ago that I was sitting in a circle and listening
to somebody come and speak. I don't know if I touched or reached
only one. But I know when I was a kid sitting there, I was
wide-eyed and I listened. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, I was always among the biggest in size among my
friends. In high school, I was the third-biggest player on my team
even though I was the quarterback. I was bigger than most of the
offensive linemen. Now it's one thing to be big; you've also got to
have some speed and be quick to be a winning quarterback. I know
there are some teams out there who are picking high in the draft
who are overlooking me. Down the road, it's up to me to make them
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper is stepping out tomorrow and wants to look nice.
</P>
<P>
   And Culpepper _ 6 feet 4 inches, listed at 255 pounds but now
weighing 247, he says _ has an unusual look at quarterback. In this
quarterback-rich draft of college players, where as many as six are
expected to be selected in the first round, Culpepper is unique.
His combination of size and speed at quarterback has never been
witnessed in pro football. There has never been a quarterback this
big who moves this way. Besides his arm strength, intelligence and
leadership qualities, it is his size that makes him the newest of
this draft's new wave of quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the NFL, year 2010. Might all quarterbacks then
routinely sign in at 6-4, 250? Solid size at quarterback now is
considered 6-2, 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the NFL combine in 1979, the two biggest offensive linemen
were 285 pounds and 279 pounds,'' said Gil Brandt, an NFL personnel
analyst. ``At this year's combine the smallest offensive lineman
was 291 pounds, and there were only five out of the 43 there under
300 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The game changes. The sizes explode. At quarterback, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Daunte Culpepper, who is expected to be selected in the
first round somewhere between No. 7 and No. 10 but who may slide as
low as pick No. 15, may be a quarterback ahead of his time, a
quarterback who ushers in a new era at the position where slender
and sleek will give way to more bulk and muscle.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Florida last season, Culpepper threw for 28
touchdowns, ran for 12 more and passed for nearly 4,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a buzz about him through his hometown in Ocala and
most of Florida,'' said Culpepper's agent, Mason Ashe. ``He is a
folklore hero there and his appeal covers many bases. We've found
him to be patient and mature. He knows what the potential is ahead
and isn't worried so much about trying to sign endorsement deals
and be on every billboard today.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper knows that in the storied 1983 class of quarterbacks,
six were first-round picks and Dan Marino was the sixth selected.
Culpepper is likely to be the fourth, behind Tim Couch and Akili
Smith and Donovan McNabb. Scouts wonder about the competition he
faced (too soft?) and his size (can he really maneuver and lead at
the pro level?).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm durable,'' Culpepper said. ``I've never missed a practice
or game due to injury, and I'm blessed for that. Defenses are
getting bigger, and quarterbacks need to be bigger and stronger,
too. I can throw the deep route or the short route or the
intermediate route. I will study, stay late, lead, do all the
things it takes to win, because I'm definitely a winner. I don't
mind all the evaluation _ I've been waiting for this weekend all of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   For a new game. For Culpepper, it fits.

TEXAS COURT OVERTURNS CONVICTION OF 14-YEAR-OLD IN CHILD'S DEATH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas appeals court Thursday overturned the
conviction of a 14-year-old girl serving a 25-year sentence in the
beating death of a young child.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Austin must now decide whether to again try the
defendant, Lacresha Murray, or to appeal the ruling to the state
Supreme Court. The girl's lawyer, Keith S. Hampton, said he would
attempt to have her released from the Giddings State Home and
School, where she is being held, as the legal process continues.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning the conviction, the state's Third Circuit Court
of Appeals found that the police had obtained Lacresha's statements
illegally. Lacresha, who was 11 at the time of her arrest, was the
youngest person ever charged with capital murder in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Jayla Belton, 2, died on May 24, 1996, of massive
internal injuries after spending the day in the home Lacresha
shared with her grandparents and five brothers and sisters. The
family often baby-sat for Jayla and other children.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned Lacresha three days after she had been removed
from her grandparent's home and placed under the supervision of the
Department of Protective and Regulatory Services. During the
interview, she initially denied having hurt the child, but
eventually implicated herself.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha's grandparents, who are also her adoptive parents, were
not present for the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Although the girl was informed of her right to remain silent,
her right to a lawyer and her right to stop the interview, the
appellate court found that Lacresha had not been told ``she was
free to leave the interview room or the children's shelter, and she
was never told she could call her grandparents or any other
friendly adult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum, we cannot say that the appellant's statements
were not the product of fright or despair,'' Justice Lee Yeakel,
wrote in a 28-page opinion. ``Therefore, the juvenile court erred
in refusing to suppress both appellant's recorded and written
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Travis County District Attorney's said they
have not decided what they will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not likely we will drop this matter,'' Rosemary
Lehmberg, first assistant district attorney, told The Associated
Press. ``That's because our job is to make sure justice is done.
That means we need to continue to seek justice for Jayla Belton as
long as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said the ruling highlighted the need for parents to be
notified, or judicial supervision, when the police intend to
question a child about a crime in which he may be a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   When he notified Lacresha that her conviction had been
overturned, Hampton said, she took a minute to let it soak in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she wanted to know when she would get to go home,'' the
lawyer said. ``She wanted to know if this was over. Unfortunately,
it's not over.''

   5. Jermaine Fazande Oklahoma 6-0 260 ... Strong lead blocker
with bulk

<P>
   Others -- Joel Makovicka (Nebraska, 5-11, 245), Terry Jackson
(Florida, 5-11, 222), Nick Williams (Miami, 6-0, 270)
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   One of the deepest positions. Five could go in first round, top
12 will be gone the first day. Expect some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   1. Torry Holt NC State 6-0 1/4, 192 ... Big time playmaker; knee
injury hurts stock
</P>
<P>
   2. David Boston Ohio State 6-1 1/4 215 ... Some like best
because of size-speed (4.4) combo.
</P>
<P>
   3. Troy Edwards Louisiana Tech 5-9 1/2, 191 ... Consistency as
receiver big question
</P>
<P>
   4. Peerless Price Tennessee 6-0, 180 ... Clutch performer in the
biggest games
</P>
<P>
   5. Kevin Johnson Syracuse 5-11 195 ... A little raw but

<P>
   4.3 speed intriguing
</P>
<P>
   Others --D'Wayne Bates (Northwestern 6-1 3/4 205), Dee Miller
(Ohio State,6-0, 200), Tai Streets (Michigan, 6-2, 195).
</P>
<P>
   Tight Ends
</P>
<P>
   Weak group. None will go in the first round, maybe first two
rounds. Plenty of potential, plenty of projects.
</P>
<P>
   1. Reginald Kelly Mississippi State 6-4 1/4 255 ... All-around
skills; limiteduse as receiver
</P>
<P>
   2. Rufus French Mississippi 6-3 1/4, 260 ... Best receiver of
this group
</P>
<P>
   3. Jim Kleinsasser North Dakota 6-3 270 ... Complete package;
might becomebest here
</P>
<P>
   4. Dan Campbell Texas A&AMP;M 6-5 265 ... Overshadowed by Spiller at
A&AMP;M; huge upside
</P>
<P>
   5. Sheldon Jackson Jr. Nebraska 6-3,245 ... Will excel if used
as H-back
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Jerame Turnan (Michigan 6-4 250), Derrick Spiller
(Texas A&AMP;M 6-2,240), Reggie Davis (Washington, 6-2, 230)
</P>
<P>
   Tackles
</P>
<P>
   When Outland Trophy winner Kris Farris barely makes the top 10
on most lists, you know this is an exceptional group. More than a
dozen could go first day.
</P>
<P>
   1. John Tait Brigham Young 6-6, 310 ... Clearly best of deep,
talented group
</P>
<P>
   2. Lonnie Shelton Eastern Michigan 6-5 1/2 340 ... Son of former
NBA player; shined at Senior Bowl
</P>
<P>
   3. Matthew Stinchcomb Georgia 6-6, 305 ... SEC's best O-lineman;
AcademicAll-American
</P>
<P>
   4. Jon Jansen Michigan 6-7, 315 ... Pure right tackle; plenty of
teams in need
</P>
<P>
   5. Floyd Wedderburn Penn State 6-5, 335 ... Best at RT;
excellent run blocker, concerns on the pass
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Luke Petitgout (Notre Dame, 6-6, 315), Chris Terry
(Georgia, 6-5,290), Kris Farris (UCLA, 6-8, 313)
</P>
<P>
   Guards
</P>
<P>
   Gibson brings this group well above average. Still, don't expect
many to go early. Top two could go in first round, top five will be
gone first day.
</P>
<P>
   1. Aaron Gibson Wisconsin 6-6, 388 ... College T projects best
as NFL G
</P>
<P>
   2. Doug Brzezinski Boston College 6-4 310 ... Gets nasty; can
dominate in short area
</P>
<P>
   3. Brandon Burlsworth Arkansas 6-4, 310 ... At 4.88, reportedly
fastest OL at combine
</P>
<P>
   4. Derrick Fletcher Baylor 6-6 1/4 374 ... Runs 5.2 at 374
pounds
</P>
<P>
   5. Randy Thomas Mississippi State 6-3 1/2 305 ... Plenty of room
for development here
</P>
<P>
   Others -- David Loverne (San Jose State, 6-2 3/4, 292), Yusuf
Scott (Arizona, 6-2, 325), Anthony Cesario (Colorado State 6-5 1/2,
312).
</P>
<P>
   Centers
</P>
<P>
   Woody is a first-rounder and may be only one here selected in
draft's first day.
</P>
<P>
   1. Damien Woody Boston College 6-3, 328 ... Clearly best here;
Could go infirst round
</P>
<P>
   2. Grey Ruegamer Arizona State 6-5, 315 ... Best of the rest of
weak crop
</P>
<P>
   3. Mike Newell Colorado State 6-4 285 ... Back surgery drops
stock
</P>
<P>
   4. Todd McClure LSU 6-1 3/4 299 ... Height a concern for many
teams
</P>
<P>
   5. Phillip Armour North Texas State 6-3, 320 ... Sleeper with
all the tools
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Lennie Friedman (Duke, 6-3, 301), Craig Page (Georgia
Tech 6-2 1/2 290), Eric de Groh (West Virginia, 6-4, 324)
</P>
<P>
   Defensive ends
</P>
<P>
   Hard group to grade. Plenty of questions. Barely above average
crop at a position where teams always are searching for hidden
gems. Expect plenty of reach picks, disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Ebenezer Ekuban North Carolina 6-3 3/8 280 Ghana native;
limited experience, unlimited potential
</P>
<P>
   2. Patrick Kerney Virginia 6-5 1/2, 270 ... Lacrosse player
turned DE; outstanding off the corner
</P>
<P>
   3. Mike Rucker Nebraska 6-4 3/4 260 ... May be better suited as
OLB
</P>
<P>
   4. Lamar King Saginaw Valley 6-3 300 ... Got lost on way to
Nebraska; found onway to NFL
</P>
<P>
   5. Tony Bryant Florida State 6-4, 275 ... Was better as junior
opposite Andre Wadsworth
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Aaron Smith (Northern Colorado, 6-5, 280), Adrian
Dingle (Clemson,6-2 1/2, 290), Dimitrius Underwood (Michigan State
6-6, 260)
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackles
</P>
<P>
   McFarland is a gem, should be top 15 pick. Top five should go in
first three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   1. Anthony McFarland LSU 6-0 1/2, 299 ... Dominated the best at
Senior Bowl; runs 4.7
</P>
<P>
   2. Larry Smith Florida State 6-4, 290 ... Huge upside; history
of injury
</P>
<P>
   3. Jared DeVries Iowa 6-4 280 ... Might be better on the end
</P>
<P>
   4. Reggie McGrew Florida 6-2, 305 ... Can dominate against the
run
</P>
<P>
   5. John Thornton West Virginia 6-3, 300 ... Big-time run stuffer
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Antonio Dingle (Virginia, 6-2, 320), Jason Wiltz
(Nebraska, 6-31/2, 310), Russell Davis (North Carolina, 6-3 1/2,
295)
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebackers
</P>
<P>
   Kearse here (rather than DE) brings grade way up. He may be only
first-rounder in the group and could be a top-7 pick. No more than
10 will go Day 1. Another area for reaches and risks.
</P>
<P>
   1. Jevon Kearse Florida 6-4 3/4, 262 ... Potential to be one of
the greats at DE or OLB
</P>
<P>
   2. Gary Stills West Virginia 6-1 3/4, 240 ... Lunch-pail
run-stuffer, cover backer
</P>
<P>
   3. Mike Peterson Florida 6-1 1/2 233 ... Makes up for size with
big-time speed (4.45)
</P>
<P>
   4. Rahim Abdullah Clemson 6-5 1/8, 245 ... Prototype body with
range and speed
</P>
<P>
   5. Keith Newman North Carolina 6-2 1/2, 244 ... Might serve
better inside witha little bulk
</P>
<P>
   Others -- David Bowens (Western Illinois, 6-4, 245), Kory Minor
(Notre Dame, 6-1, 235), Tom Burke (Wisconsin, 6-2, 255)
</P>
<P>
   Inside linebackers
</P>
<P>
   Strong group, a bit top-heavy. Size questions lower overall
grade. Three may go in first round, 10 should go first day.
</P>
<P>
   1. Chris Claiborne USC 6-2 3/8 248 ... Heart-size-speed (sub
4.5s) combo very special
</P>
<P>
   2. Andy Katzenmoyer Ohio State 6-2 1/2 258 ... Workouts silenced
all critics
</P>
<P>
   3. Al Wilson Tennessee 5-11 239 ... Height a concern, desire,
productivity is not
</P>
<P>
   4. Barry Gardner Northwestern 6-0 3/8 242 ... Former walk-on
everything youneed in ILB
</P>
<P>
   5. Dat Nguyen Texas A&AMP;M 5-11 231 ... Simply makes play after
play after play
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Johnny Rutledge (Florida, 6-2, 245), Wali Rainer
(Virginia, 6-13/4, 241), Eric Barton (Maryland, 6-2 3/4, 245)
</P>
<P>
   Cornerbacks
</P>
<P>
   Deep, deep group. Five could go in first round, top 12 will be
gone the first day. Top two, maybe three, are franchise-type
corners.
</P>
<P>
   1. Champ Bailey Georgia 5-11 3/4 185 ... Best athlete in draft,
can go both ways, return kicks
</P>
<P>
   2. Chris McAlister Arizona 6-1 1/4 206 ... Exceptional athlete,
play-maker
</P>
<P>
   3. Antoine Winfield Ohio State 5-8 5/8 175 ... Feisty, coverman;
won Thorpe Award
</P>
<P>
   4. Fernando Bryant Alabama 5-10 185 ... First-round talent in
this deep pool
</P>
<P>
   5. Fred Vinson Vanderbilt 5-10 1/2 177 ... Foot injury a
concern; finesse coverman
</P>
<P>
   Others -- Dre' Bly (North Carolina, 5-9 1/2, 188), Daylon
McCutcheon (USC, 5-8 3/4, 186), Jacoby Rhinehart (SMU, 5-10, 185)
</P>
<P>
   Safeties
</P>
<P>
   Too many questions keep grade at average. No more than two will
go early, rest may have to wait for Day 2.
</P>
<P>
   1. Anthony Poindexter Virginia 6-1, 210 ... Exceptional player;
knee injury aconcern
</P>
<P>
   2. Antwan Edwards Clemson 6-0 1/4 210 ... Some like at CB,

has kamakaze style
</P>
<P>
   4. Larry Atkins UCLA 6-2 1/2 215 ... Cover skills a question,
but he just makes plays
</P>
<P>
   5. Marquis Smith California 6-2 3/8 216 ... Pure SS, loves hit,

<P>
   Others -- Rich Coady (Texas A&AMP;M, 6-1, 210), Damon Moore (Ohio
State 5-11, 210), Scott Shields (Weber State, 6-4, 226).
</P>
<P>
   Kickers
</P>
<P>
   Gramatica brings group well above average. He will be picked in
early-to-mid rounds; Hall, Sailer may go late.
</P>
<P>
   1. Martin Gramatica Kansas State 5-8 166 ... Has 70-yard leg;
likely mid-round pick
</P>
<P>
   2. Jeff Hall Tennessee 5-11 190 ... Big reason Vols won it all
</P>
<P>
   3. Chris Sailer UCLA 5-9 190 ... Proven clutch kicker who can

   AMERICAN AIR PILOTS' UNION IS FINED NEARLY $46 MILLION
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge fined the American Airlines pilots' union nearly
$46 million for a sickout in February that led to the cancellation
of about 6,600 flights, stranding hundreds of thousands of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The union had disputed the claim, saying the sickout cost the
airline less than $5 million during the job action. U.S. District
Judge Joe Kendall sided with American, however. The union vowed to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines' third-quarter earnings rose 10.8 percent, while
Continental Airlines said its first-quarter profit fell 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   SCHWAB PROFIT UP, BUT STOCK FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab, the nation's largest online brokerage firm, said
that its first-quarter profit doubled, matching expectations.
Growth in trades handled daily was below the industry average,
however, and the company's stock plunged. Shares of Schwab fell
$14.25, or 10.3 percent, to $124, dragging down other online
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC INDUSTRIES PROPEL DOW'S RISE
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 51.06 points, to
10,462.72, another record, as investors intensified their move out
of issues of household-goods companies and into shares of basic
industries. The Nasdaq market, after skidding, reversed course and
closed up 14.49 points, to 2,521.77. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index fell 5.58 points, to 1,322.86.
</P>
<P>
   With emerging financial markets on the mend, the Korean
Development Bank sold $1 billion of bonds, and Brazil indicated
that it would soon be ready to return to the capital markets. The
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 5.52 percent, from 5.50
percent.

<P>
   GM AND FORD POST STRONG PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in on strong sales of high-profit sport utility vehicles

</P>
<P>
   HUNTSMAN AND IMPERIAL IN DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Huntsman said that it would pay $2.7 billion for control of four
businesses owned by Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain, a deal
that would make Huntsman the world's largest privately held
chemical company. Huntsman's annual sales would nearly double, to
$7.4 billion, under the deal. The four businesses would go into a
joint venture, of which Huntsman would own 70 percent. Jon
Huntsman, the company's chairman, said its overseas invisibility
was an important reason for pursuing the venture.

   BRAZILIAN OFFICIAL DEFENDS MOVES
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Brazil's central bank defended a January bailout of

TREASURY THEFT PROBERS EYE ROLE OF LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Investigators probing the alleged theft of nearly $9
million from the state treasury are trying to determine whether a
Boston lawyer with close ties to former Treasurer Joseph D. Malone
knew where some of the money went.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's office wants to know whether
Richard C. Arrighi, a fund-raiser for Malone, was aware that most
of the $812,000 allegedly stolen by former deputy treasurer Robert
E. Foley wound up with a company that constructed a luxury
condominium project in Waltham, according to people familiar with
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents and other sources, Arrighi advised
and performed legal work for the project's developer, who also
founded the construction company that allegedly received much of
the money that Foley is charged with stealing in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a brief conversation last month, Arrighi declined to
be interviewed. His lawyer, J. Owen Todd of Boston, said Arrighi
was not aware of the source of any of the money that allegedly went
to the company, Sturdy Oak Construction Co. of Norwood. He said
Arrighi was cooperating with Reilly's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the part he played, he was not in a position to know the
source of the money of any of his clients, including this project''
Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   But with investigators looking into Arrighi's links to Foley and
Sturdy Oak, the treasury scandal, which erupted two months ago,
continues to threaten Malone's reputation. Investigators have so
far found no evidence that the former treasurer was even aware of
the thefts before they were uncovered in February. But Arrighi's
relationship with Malone _ he is a longtime political supporter and
was called on to do legal work for Malone's late mother _ could
raise further problems for the former treasurer as investigators
try sort out how nearly $9 million was pilfered from the state's
Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Malone declined to comment on Arrighi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is the most prominent of the four people charged so far in
the scandal, which has been described as the largest theft of state
money in the Commonwealth's history.
</P>
<P>
   According to the charges, Foley, working with accomplice Thomas
Ciliberto, an ``heir finder,'' stole a total of $2.4 million from
the fund in two separate embezzlements: the first in 1992 and 1993
in which $1.6 million was taken and the second in 1994 and 1995
when $812,000 was taken. A significant portion of the $812,00 may
have gone to Sturdy Oak, investigators suspect.
</P>

   Another treasury employee, John F. Trischitta, and heir finder
Martin Robbins were accused in February of taking $6.5 million from
the same fund.
</P>
<P>
   Heir finders scour state records for unclaimed property in hopes
of fetching a fee for returning it to rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi often boasted of his tight political connections to
Malone as he promoted his legal career at several major Boston law
firms, sources in the city's legal community have told the Globe. A
source at Warner &AMP; Stackpole said Arrighi left the firm in the
early 1990s amid discomfort among partners with his promotion of
his political ties to Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Arrighi said last month that he has been friends with Foley
since the late 1980s and had represented him ``on some real estate
deals,'' which Arrighi declined to specify. Also, Arrighi said he
introduced Foley to Malone shortly after Malone's election in 1990
_ an introduction that led to Foley's landing a top job in the
treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 deposition, Foley said that Arrighi had been doing
legal work for Alexander H. McNeil of Dedham, the developer of the
Waltham project and that he was a business consultant for McNeil _
even while he was working fulltime for Malone's office.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's investigators are probing what Arrighi may have known
of the source of money that Foley allegedly channelled into Sturdy
Oaks in 1994 and 1995. They are basing their pursuit on the legal
theory of ``conscious avoidance.'' Under that doctrine, which has
been upheld by federal appeal courts, an individual can be charged
with being an accomplice to a felony if it is shown that he
suspected a crime had been committed but purposefully failed to
follow up with inquiries even though he was in a position to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While it is now regarded as Waltham's best-built condominium
project, the Village at Clark's Pond went through a financially
perilous stretch during the early and mid-1990s. The downturn in
the region's commercial real estate market during the late 1980s
had badly hurt McNeil, the project's developer, according to
sources close to McNeil. And even though he had high hopes for
Clark's Pond, Guaranty-First Trust Co., the bank that lent him $7
million in 1988 to begin construction, filed suit two years later
for failure to make timely payments on the mortgage loan.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a portion of the condominium project was taken over
by developer David Sweetser of Wellesley. Sweetser declined to
return phone calls, but records on file at Waltham City Hall
indicate that he used McNeil's contracting firm, Sturdy Oak
Construction, to complete the project. In all, 88 townhouses and
condominium units are located on the 18.75-acre site.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil's son-in-law, William J. Piersiak, of Wellesley, took
over Sturdy Oak's operation in 1991. But two years later, in 1993,
financial problems were still hampering Piersiak's plans for
completing construction on schedule. But those financial problems
appear to have lifted a year or two later, and with the upswing in
the economy, the units began to sell quickly for between $250,000
and $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil and Piersiak declined to be interviewed. Piersiak's
lawyer, George C. McMahon of Quincy, said that Piersiak was
cooperating with investigators but refused to answer any questions
about the firm's finances or any alleged infusion of money from
Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's office expects to bring indictments in the case at the
end of May by the latest.
</P>
<P>
   A Suffolk County grand jury is taking testimony in the case and,
as the Globe reported recently, has been presented evidence that
many more checks were stolen from the fund than the three that have
already been disclosed. The sources did not know how much in all
may have been stolen but doubted that other current treasury
employees were involved in the thefts.

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: LESSONS OF KOSOVO

<P>
   The way adults of any intelligence can find out how well they
are dealing with a crisis, personal or national, is to ask
themselves two questions. Would we do the same things again if we
had the chance? If not, what do we now do to get out of this mess?
So:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would the United States again decide that to help Kosovo's
Albanians we would give Slobodan Milosevic what he wanted most _
the cover to drive a million of them into foreign exile or become
displaced persons at home, wandering their roads in terror?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would we spray bombs at a dictator without it occurring to our
leaders he would immediately drive out or slaughter the people we
were supposed to save? (Were our leaders fools? Yes.) Would the
U.S. president again decide that before going to war, he would
guarantee not to send ground troops, so Milosevic need not get all
worried?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would we again bombbombbomb the capital of the Serbs, who
thought of themselves as far more our friends than his? So far this
has produced three major results: humiliating Serbs forever,
turning friendship into enmity, and persuading many to rally around
a man they detest and fear.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would we be roaming around again with a diplomatic begging cup
asking Russia, the same addled country that we pity, or any other
country that will answer the phone, to find a way out for us?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would we again allow Washington to weaken the world's human
rights movements by arousing fears that they will one day mean more
bombbomb assignments for America? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would we allow ourselves to forget about those people we could
indeed help, not with war, but with economic and political
pressures against their tormentors? While we are stuck in the
bloody mud of the Balkans, about 35 million other victims of
despotism are in exile or tormented at home, victims of
dictatorships we enrich.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While dictators persecute and kill Chinese and Sudanese
Christians, Tibetan Buddhists and Muslim Kurds, it must be admitted
that President Clinton and U.S. business executives are at worship.
See them _ kneeling at China's feet as they pray to the gods of the
Politburo for trade profits.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because we cannot help every suffering group, would we again
make a mockery of America's human rights promises by remembering
them in Europe but not paying much attention to the persecuted of
Africa and Asia? As former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
said on ABC: ``At the back of my head I have to ask whether some of
this isn't racist. I really mean that.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, we would not deal with Kosovo the same way again. But nobody
will hand us a second chance free. The price is acknowledging that
the war is a fiasco for America, for Kosovo's Albanians and for
Serbs who risked their own lives for freedom.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then we could choose. We could send in troops after all. We
could begin a new Balkan war and watch with interest how far it
spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Or, I urge, we can call for a cease-fire. Say, two weeks to do
something more useful than handing Milosevic another ultimatum to
get up and get out or Secretary Albright will smack him good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He will have to give up his dream of killing or expelling all
Kosovars, just when we were helping him fulfill it. When the Kosovo
war is over, we will see how briefly the Serbian freedom movement
will remain extinguished.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the cease-fire, an agreement might be worked out that all
refugees return to a self-governing Kosovo that remains part of
Serbia _ unless the current or future government of Yugoslavia is
smart enough to accept a partition that would give it areas and
sites holy to Serbs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, Milosevic will not accept a ``NATO-led'' protection force
for Kosovo so dear to NATO bureaucrats. Remember? NATO has not  &UR; won
 &LR; the war.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But countries inside and outside NATO could do the job _
including Russia _ perhaps patrolling with some small Serbian
police units. Otherwise, the Kosovo Liberation Army would operate
without hobble and might continue some of the expulsions Serbs have
experienced _ like the 300,000 Serbs purged from Croatia by the
dictator Franjo Tudjman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the people of Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia,
Montenegro, Albania etc. will find better solutions some decade.
Meantime, the United States should not keep hanging around the
Balkans with an occupation force, on the ground or in the air. &QL;

that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.

waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

U.S. SUSPECTS YUGOSLAV ARMY HAS LETHAL AND NONLETHAL CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States believes that the Yugoslav army has stocks of
lethal and nonlethal chemical weapons and that some of the less
deadly forms have probably been given to the Serbian paramilitary
forces that have terrorized Albanians in Kosovo, according to
Pentagon and other Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Thursday that the administration had no
evidence that the Yugoslav army or the Serbian forces had used, or
were planning to use lethal chemical agents against either the
ethnic Albanians they have been driving out of Kosovo or the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been battling Yugoslav forces in
the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton warned Yugoslavia Thursday that America's
response to any use of chemical agents or other unconventional
weapons would be ``swift and overwhelming.'' The United States has
``intelligence about the capabilities of the Serbs in a number of
areas militarily,'' Clinton said, addressing a meeting of newspaper
editors in San Francisco. ``I think they are quite well aware of
the dangers of overly escalating this,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Thursday that Yugoslavia had a
``chemical warfare capability'' that included both lethal chemicals
and those that were capable of incapacitating but not killing
people. Belgrade, they said, has ``weaponized CS,'' a form of tear
gas, and has ``probably made this weapon available to Serbian
paramilitary forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials added that the Yugoslav army might also have made
weapons out of BZ, an incapacitating agent that causes
hallucinations and delirium, and were ``suspected of having unknown
quantities'' of mustard and deadly sarin gas, which have not yet
been put into weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Even sarin gas that has not been mounted on weapons can kill or
make people desperately ill, the officials said. The Japanese
religious cult Aum Shinrikyo killed 12 people and injured thousands
more in a 1995 terrorist attack in which cult members punctured
plastic bags containing liquid sarin in the Tokyo subway.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they had no evidence that Yugoslavia was
making or testing biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been extremely reluctant to discuss
Yugoslavia's ability to develop, produce and stockpile chemical
weapons and other unconventional arms, or, as they are sometimes
called, weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But an official said Thursday that the military was
``concerned'' both about the advanced chemical weapons program that
Yugoslavia maintained before its breakup in 1991 and its subsequent
efforts to reconstitute its program and stockpile both lethal and
nonlethal chemical agents and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So far, one official said, Yugoslav centers suspected of being
involved in the development and production of chemical agents have
been off NATO's target list because of concerns that a direct hit
on a chemical center might result in an explosion that could either
kill civilians or make them very sick.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO forces have struck such centers and other targets where
the weapons that could dispense chemical agents are made or stored.
NATO has also hit buildings where the equipment to produce such
weapons might have been manufactured or stored, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   One official stressed, however, that any concern about avoiding
these locations would disappear if NATO and the Pentagon determined
that the Yugoslav army used chemical weapons either on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo or on the Kosovo Liberation Army.

   Serbia is known to have inherited from the former Yugoslavia a
sophisticated and extensive chemical weapons program, which
involved three production plants on Serbian territory and one that
was moved from Mostar in Bosnia to Lucani in southern Serbia by
Yugoslav forces in 1992, according to Jonathan B. Tucker, a
chemical weapons expert at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 and 1987 before the breakup of the country, according to
a newsletter by Applied Science and Analysis, a respected trade
publication, the former Yugoslavia produced 250 sarin filled
artillery shells, which were put into storage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it had an ambitious program for 1990-1995 for
producing 3,000 rockets filled with the sarin nerve agent and 100
artillery shells filled with mustard gas. The plan also called for
100 short-range missiles with mustard gas warheads. The plan was
interrupted by the breakup of the country, and while at least some
chemical weapons were destroyed, it is unclear how many remain, the
newsletter asserts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the newsletter reports, the fate of some 30 tons of
CH3POCl2, a chemical that is restricted by a treaty banning
chemical weapons because it can be used to make sarin and other
chemical agents, is unknown. The material was taken from a chemical
agent production facility in Mostar in Bosnia in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of former Yugoslavia's former chemical weapons
infrastructure, production capacity and expertise is now in Serbian
hands,'' Tucker said. In other words, while the size of the current
chemical weapons stockpile is unknown, he added, Yugoslavia appears
to retain the ability to produce such agents quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has not signed the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which bans development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use
of chemical weapons. The convention also bans the use of nonlethal
riot control agents like CS ``as a method of warfare.'' Developed
by the British in the 1950s, CS is a military code-name for
ortho-chlorobenzylidene malonitrile, which causes intense
irritation of the eyes with crying or temporary blindness and
irritation of the respiratory system and stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has signed and ratified the convention,
has unilaterally reserved the right to use CS in narrowly defined
defensive situations like rescuing downed pilots behind enemy
lines. During the Vietnam War, it was used extensively, and CS is
still widely used for domestic-riot control, which is permitted
under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the nerve agent BZ, whose chemical name is
3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, is totally banned by the Chemical
Weapons Convention. A stable powder that makes it easy to
disseminate in an explosive munition, BZ produces hallucinations.
One milligram of BZ can produce a delirium that lasts up to three
days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Human Rights Watch alleged that the Yugoslav army still
had stores of chemical weapons, a charge repeated last week by the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group. In a second
report issued a year later, Human Rights Watch said there was
significant circumstantial evidence based on survivor testimony
that Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Gen. Ratko Mladic had used BZ
against Bosnian Muslims fleeing the town of Srebrenica in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the State Department said while it believed
the Serbs had used tear gas against Muslims during the Bosnian war,
it had no evidence that BZ or other chemical weapons were used
during the siege of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has been closely monitoring Yugoslavia's
chemical facilities for months, officials said. A report in January
1998 by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, one expert
said, assessed the development and deployment of chemical agents in
both Serbia and Croatia and examined the Yugoslav army's doctrines
regarding their use. It also studied the potential impact any
direct military attacks on chemical stockpiles would have on
civilians and the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army is well prepared to defend itself against
chemical attacks, Pentagon officials said. Each brigade ``has a
chemical defense platoon commanded by a chemical officer,''
Pentagon officials said. Half of the platoon is dedicated to
decontamination, and half to detection, officials said. Individual
soldiers in smaller units are also trained in decontamination and
detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Milosevic's back is to the wall, he might
consider using chemical weapons as a last resort,'' Tucker said. If
NATO ground forces are deployed, he added, ``they too should be
prepared for the possibility of Yugoslav chemical attacks.''

SHACKLETON AND THE JAMES CAIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 16: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, the work of the Australian photographer Frank
Hurley, who died in 1962 at the age of 76, appears in two recently
published books, ``The Endurance,'' by Caroline Alexander, and
``The Pity of War,'' by Niall Ferguson. Hurley's Antarctic
photographs will also hang at the American Museum of Natural
History through Oct. 11 in an exhibition called ``The Endurance.''
They capture the duress and beauty of Ernest Shackleton's
miraculous Antarctic expedition with an immediacy that makes it
seem strangely timeless. That is how it must have felt to
Shackleton's men, too _ a case of infinite travail in a place cut
off from what the rest of the world called time.
</P>
<P>
   What the world was making of its time, while Shackleton was
trapped in Antarctic pack ice, emerges in one of the photographs
Ferguson reproduces from Hurley's later career, a gruesome image
called ``Hun dead rolled into shell crater as an easy means of
burial.'' Shackleton sailed from London the same day Germany
declared war on Russia _ Aug. 1, 1914 _ and he continued south with
the Admiralty's permission. When, in mid-May 1916, he finally
staggered into a whaling station on South Georgia Island, he
assumed the war was over.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton and his men had seen their ship, the Endurance, break
up in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. They had sailed three
lifeboats to a desolate rock called Elephant Island, and then with
a crew of six Shackleton had sailed a 22-foot lifeboat called the
James Caird 800 miles across the South Atlantic to make landfall on
South Georgia Island, which he and two crewmen were forced to
traverse on foot. Shackleton then rescued his crew and all returned
safely to the catacomb of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There are few more striking photographs in the history of
exploration than the ones Frank Hurley shot from the shore of
Elephant Island as the James Caird departed, leaving 22 men behind.
The boat seems inordinately small, its two jury-rigged masts
ridiculously short. But Hurley's photographs cannot capture the
isolation of the men who stayed behind nor of those who put to sea.
The viewer is required to make an imaginative leap no less
impossible than the one required by Hurley's later photographs _
those of the dead German soldier and the bitter, blasted landscape
of the Western Front.
</P>
<P>
   No museum can ever bring the actuality of war into its
exhibition halls, nor can the present exhibition convey even an
iota of the suffering or heroism of Shackleton and his men.
Instead, the curators have brought the James Caird itself to New
York. There it rests, in a room filled with rolling, turbulent
video footage of the South Atlantic. You are encouraged to try
taking a sun-sight using a sextant. But there is really only one
thing to do: Stand beside the James Caird and ask yourself the
question that Hurley's photographs, of the Antarctic and after,
also make you wonder _ how would I have borne it? &QL;

PEPPERDINE NARROWS THE FIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The choice has become clear: Pepperdine will
either stay close to home to hire a new men's basketball coach or
go with someone from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director John Watson is expected to announce the Waves'
new coach next week. The finalists appear to be Pepperdine
assistant Randy Bennett, Lipscomb head coach Don Meyer, former
Vanderbilt coach Jan van Breda Kolff, Biola head coach Dave
Holmquist and UCLA assistant Jim Saia.
</P>
<P>
   Holmquist, 48, interviewed on campus Wednesday. His career
record in 19 seasons at Biola is 532-188.
</P>
<P>
   Of those four coaches, only Bennett does not have head-coaching
experience. But he was an assistant at Idaho under current Chicago
Bulls coach Tim Floyd and an assistant at San Diego under current
San Antonio Spurs assistant Hank Egan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sat beside a few pretty good guys,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who interviewed April 5, was an assistant at San Diego
from 1988-96 before going to Pepperdine to join Lorenzo Romar's
staff. Under Romar, he was in charge of advance scouting, game
preparation, practice planning and recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff, 47, an alumnus of Vanderbilt, resigned as the
Commodores' head coach on Feb. 26 after six seasons despite an
overall record of 104-81. Vanderbilt, which was 14-15 this past
season, only made one NCAA appearance in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff said Thursday he couldn't comment specifically
on his status as a candidate. But he has Division I head coaching
experience and a local connection _ he is from Palos Verdes and his
father Bill coached the Lakers to two Western Conference
championships in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 53, is 702-220 in 27 seasons as a college head coach.
He's been at Lipscomb, an NAIA powerhouse, since 1975. He
interviewed earlier this week on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Saia, 34, has been an assistant at UCLA for the past three
seasons. He came to Westwood after two successful years as the head
coach at Columbia College in Sonora, where he was named the Central
Valley Conference Coach of the Year twice.

BRITISH AND DUTCH OFFER PLAN TO EXPAND INSPECTIONS IN IRAQ  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Britain and the Netherlands proposed Thursday
that the U.N. Special Commission known as Unscom be replaced by a
new enlarged body to carry out more intrusive inspections of Iraq's
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was circulated to the Security Council's 15
member nations the same day that the Russia's representative to the
United Nations, Sergei Lavarov, boycotted a briefing of the council
by Richard Butler, the chief U.N. arms inspector, calling his
latest report on Iraq's weapons programs ``a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Russia further demonstrated its dissatisfaction
with the way the council is treating Baghdad by circulating its own
resolution calling for the lifting of all economic sanctions on
Iraq, while strengthening the U.N. inspection program somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   American officials immediately dismissed the Russian move. ``In
the light of Iraq's demonstrated intention of keeping weapons of
mass destruction, this resolution cannot be taken seriously,'' said
the acting American representative to the United Nations, A. Peter
Burleigh.
</P>
<P>
   As for the British-Dutch proposal, U.S. officials declined
direct comment, saying the document was being studied.
</P>
<P>
   Unscom officials expressed dismay at the proposal, saying they
doubted that the new inspection mechanism would be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Under the British-Dutch plan, Unscom would be replaced by an
expanded, and more generously financed body called the U.N.
Commission for Investigation, Inspection and Monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls on Iraq to give the new commission
``unrestricted access and provision of information'' and to allow
its inspection teams ``immediate, unconditional and unrestricted
access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and
means of transportation which they may wish to inspect.''
</P>
<P>
   It also seeks to improve the dire situation Iraq's people are
facing after almost a decade of economic sanctions stemming from
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It would abolish the current $5.2 billion limit on the amount of
oil Iraq can export to buy essential supplies every six months,
like food and medicine. It also creates a mechanism for bringing
the roughly $300 million worth of oil Iraq is believed to be
smuggling out illegally each year into this U.N.-supervised
oil-for-food plan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Iraq could spend one-third of the money it now pays
as compensation to victims of its invasion of Kuwait on such items
as food and medicine until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it asks the U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to
create an expert committee to recommend ways of increasing Iraq's
oil production and streamline procedures for approving essential
imports. Currently Iraq cannot even produce the $5.2 billion worth
of oil it is allowed to sell under the existing oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's U.N. representative, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, said the
new resolution is based on the findings of three panels set up by
the Security Council to review policy towards Iraq after President
Saddam Hussein expelled all U.N. arms inspectors late last year and
said he would no longer cooperate with attempts to disarm his
country.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstock said that even countries like Russia, which think the
Security Council is too harsh on Iraq, support existing U.N.
resolutions demanding that Baghdad give up its weapons of mass
destruction and accept long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is anxious to see sanctions on Iraq eased in part because
it is owned large sums of money for weapons and other goods sold to
Iraq, which Baghdad cannot repay unless it is allowed to sell oil
freely again. France also favors easing sanctions, partly because
it has high hopes of developing lucrative commercial ties with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and Britain are unlikely to agree to any
major easing of sanctions until they are satisfied it has been
disarmed and agreed to a monitoring program which would prevent it
from ever again developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia previously has called for the abolition of Unscom and for
the dismissal of Butler, its chief executive officer. It blamed
Butler for triggering American and British air attacks against Iraq
last December with a report saying Baghdad had failed to cooperate
with arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The one important recommendation of the three Iraq panels that
the new British-Dutch resolution does not take up is the suggestion
that foreign companies be allowed to invest directly in Iraq's oil
industry .

GRISLY ACCIDENT IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, April 16: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of NATO's air campaign against Serbia is to stop
the killing and reverse the expulsion of Kosovo's persecuted ethnic
Albanians. Yet on Wednesday a NATO pilot mistakenly bombed a convoy
of Kosovo refugees headed toward the Albanian border, killing 72 of
them, according to Serbian figures. It was a tragic and painfully
ironic accident of war. But as President Clinton rightly noted
Thursday, accidents are inseparable from war, and it would be a
greater tragedy to slacken the bombardment or unduly restrict the
military target list.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot apparently mistook the refugee column for a Serbian
army convoy. He may have been misled by Serbian police vehicles
that had initially been escorting the refugees. The facts still
need to be sorted out. But it is good to see that, after some early
confusion, NATO and the Pentagon have accepted full responsibility.
American military officials have sometimes failed to acknowledge
such costly and embarrassing errors in past conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of planes flying 24 hours a day at high speed over
unfamiliar terrain and often in overcast weather, it is conceivable
that Serbian civilians, and perhaps more Albanians trapped inside
Kosovo, will be inadvertently killed or injured. NATO must continue
to do all it can to minimize civilian deaths, but it cannot avoid
them entirely. Only Slobodan Milosevic can do that, by agreeing to
NATO's peace terms, including a withdrawal of all Serbian forces
from Kosovo, the safe return of all refugees and acceptance of an
international military force to protect them. By far the greatest
threat to Kosovo's Albanians is Serbia's soldiers and police. NATO
bombing is the best hope for ending that threat by forcing Serbia's
withdrawal.

TRADE WITH THE CHINESE

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, April 16: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China did not end his visit to
America this week with the trade deal he wanted, but he is likely
to get it soon. Thanks in part to Zhu's energetic lobbying of
businessmen as he traveled around the country, the Clinton
administration will probably endorse Chinese membership in the
World Trade Organization. Though other important issues continue to
divide the two countries, China's commitment to lifting trade
barriers qualifies it to join the WTO, and President Clinton is
right to try to close the deal in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   China discovered late last year that the foreign capital it
badly needs as it seeks to reform its economy was no longer
arriving as it had before the foreign investors grew scared
following the devaluations of several Asian currencies and Russia's
default on its domestic debt. It appears that the Chinese
leadership then decided to essentially accept Western terms for
opening its economy enough to join the WTO, in the hope that would
encourage more foreign capital to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately both for the Chinese and the White House, that
decision became clear only as pressures were growing in the United
States against any accord with China. Suspicions lingering from the
Clinton campaign's fund-raising among Asian donors in 1996 were
intensified by revelations that China may have stolen nuclear
secrets and that the administration had been slow to act after
learning of the apparent security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's record on China policy, from human rights
to security issues, has not been an impressive one, but that should
not stop Congress from accepting this deal. More open trade between
the two countries will not only benefit American business, it has
great potential for opening China to moderating influences.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the trade deal, which now seems likely to be
completed soon when a team of American negotiators visits Beijing,
came after a remarkable road trip through America by Zhu in which
he galvanized support from American businesses that believe they
will benefit from the concessions made by China. While there will
be losers _ the textile industry is already gearing up to fight the
tentative agreement _ the world economy will probably benefit.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no certainty that China will live up to all its
promises, particularly since it will be difficult to monitor the
extent to which non-tariff barriers to imports are removed. But
having China a member of the WTO, and subject to its enforcement
provisions if there are violations, is better than having it
outside the organization.

THE MESSAGE IN THE MARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, April 16: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rally near New York's fortified city hall Thursday drew far
fewer than the 25,000 protesters organizers had predicted to make
their latest pitch against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his police
policies. Still, the mayor would be wise not to misread their
numbers as a lack of concern in the city. The angry chants, the
bitter placards, the voices of State Comptroller Carl McCall, Ossie
Davis and Harry Belafonte all spoke for many residents who are
deeply worried about relations between police and the minority
community and dubious about Giuliani's ability to respond to their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy that produced this latest protest was the shooting
by police of Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41 bullets on
Feb. 4. Since then the mayor has made some progress trying to reach
out to minority leaders. The Street Crime Unit, which included the
four policemen now charged with murder in the Diallo case, has been
revamped, and the mayor has launched a $10 million effort to add
minorities to the force.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the challenge for Giuliani and his embattled
police commissioner, Howard Safir, remains the same. They have to
reassure a frightened minority community and a growing number of
white New Yorkers who are convinced that the aggressive techniques
used to drive down the crime rate have gotten out of hand. No one
wants to return to the crime statistics of six years ago, but the
past two months of demonstrations carry valid political messages
for the mayor. It is not just New Yorkers of color who worry about
racial targeting in street frisks for weapons. Moreover, people in
all sections of the community _ and many sectors of law enforcement
_ believe that Safir has been too slow to adjust tactics in
response to the lower crime rate. The 10-point plan endorsed at the
rally contains some good ideas on monitoring corruption and
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was quick to dismiss Thursday's rally as politics, an
event engineered by black leaders, unions and disgruntled
Democrats. But Giuliani has to understand that ordinary citizens,
as well as critics and activists, worry about police tactics, just
as he needs to acknowledge that managing the public-opinion
chemistry of this volatile city is an essential part of its
politicians' work.

<P>
   Your home soon will be worth less than it is now. And in a few
years, it will be worth even less. And in a few decades, it will be
worth a lot less. That's right _ less.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what real-estate brokers tell you. Forget what you read
in the real-estate section of your local newspaper. Forget your
dream about cashing out of that new split-level on steroids when
you retire and taking off for some sunny and cheaper clime.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it. You're doomed because of demographics. You're doomed
because of disinflation. You're doomed because home builders will
keep building homes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, your home _ unless you're one of the lucky few _ might
be losing value right now, as you sleep, as you mow the lawn, as
you fix the roof, as you write the mortgage check.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the real-estate recession was over? Just wait until
the Real Estate Crash of 2010.
</P>
<P>
   And this is not a Paul Erdman novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the gray world of housing economics, it is known simply as
McFadden's chart, although adjectives and analogies to Mount
Everest or the Matterhorn are sometimes attached _ and they are
certainly apt.
</P>
<P>
   The chart is the centerpiece of a report written in 1994 by
Professor Daniel McFadden, an economist. Simply put, McFadden
posited that home prices would peak in the mid-1990s, and slowly
fall to their inflation-adjusted 1911 level (no, that's no typo _
1911) through the first half of the 21st century, affecting not
only baby boomers but Generation X, Y, and Z, too.
</P>
<P>
   This work, ``Demographics, the Housing Market, and the Welfare
of the Elderly,'' is no dumbed-down press release, either.
McFadden, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley,
wrote it under the aegis of the National Bureau of Economic
Research for a book, ``Studies in the Economics of Aging,'' which
was published by the University of Chicago Press.
</P>
<P>
   His work, much of it indecipherable to anyone without a
knowledge of advanced mathematics, is based on decades of
information, and it attempts to balance an obvious demographic
problem (the wave of baby boomers entering retirement) with housing
demand (which he believes will increase in retirement locales but
decrease in work locations) and housing supply (which he believes
will increase in capacity, despite limited land in desirable
areas).
</P>
<P>
   And in the time since his study first appeared, he hasn't backed
off any of its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The McFadden chart, and its thesis, though downplayed or
dismissed by some economists, has its believers.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuccillo, the former chief economist for the National
Association of Realtors, shares some of McFadden's pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of layers at which this can be attacked,''
he says, ``but the bottom line is the same: After about 2022, the
housing market begins to fall off badly, and values probably suffer
badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will notice my date is later than McFadden's,'' Tuccillo
continues, ``and there are several reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older boomers, those born between 1945 and 1956, will be more
long-lived, more active, and more interested in the housing market
than their forbearers. It's not until the younger boomers start to
retire that the numbers begin to turn against the real-estate
market.''
</P>
<P>
   McFadden's thesis is also one of the central focuses of the book
``Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming
Generational Warfare,'' written by William Sterling and Stephen
Waite, an investment strategist and a portfolio manager,
respectively, at Credit Suisse, and published in 1998 by the
Library of Contemporary Thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring war, pestilence, famine, or _ more likely, perhaps _
massive waves of immigration, the imbalance in size between the
baby boomers and the baby-bust generation suggests a buyers' market
for real estate ahead,'' says Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be especially true in many Northern suburban
residential markets when the baby boomers begin to retire in large
numbers beginning around 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautions, too, that the demographic shifts occur gradually,
so it's not as if a bear market in real estate can be predicted
with pinpoint accuracy. And the vagaries of the business cycle also
make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is more predictable,'' Sterling says, ``is that the
underlying trend in real estate prices will be generally
unfavorable, and that home prices may have trouble keeping up with
inflation after the boomers begin to retire in large numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the crash will come like a man going bald:
slowly, surely, painfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary for home prices to decline in nominal
dollars in coming years for homes to represent a terrible
investment for baby boomers,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McFadden chart implies, between 1995 and 2020, an annual
inflation-adjusted depreciation of about 0.8 percent per year,
which sounds rather harmless,'' Sterling says. ``But compounded
over 25 years, that results in an inflation-adjusted loss of 19
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume a rate of inflation that approximates recent experience _
say, 2 percent annually. In that case, McFadden's projections imply
that home prices rise modestly but fail to keep pace with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Using McFadden's profile for real home prices, today's $150,000
home would be worth $172,000 in 2010, $193,000 in 2020, and
$216,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound bad,'' Sterling says, ``until one realizes
that, to keep up with inflation of 2 percent annually, today's
$150,000 home would have to be worth $190,000 in 2010, $232,000 in
2020, and $283,000 in 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss of value on an after-inflation basis will get worse as
more boomers move into retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``McFadden projects an average annual real depreciation per year
of about 1 percent over the 1995-to-2030 period, which would imply
a 30 percent decline in real values by 2030 from their 1995
level,'' Sterling says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, a home that cost $150,000 in 1995 will have a
value of $136,000 in 2010, if inflation is zero, and $121,500 in
2020 and $105,000 in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   ``If inflation settles in at about 1 percent per annum, then
today's $150,000 home can be expected to remain at around $150,000
into the 2010, 2020, and 2030 horizon. Even modest-sounding rates
of inflation, like 1 percent per annum, imply a substantial loss in
the purchasing power of the dollar over long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   The detractors to the McFadden chart are many, of course. Even
McFadden has his doubts about the collapse of real estate, noting
the difficulty and the track record of long-range forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not shorting real estate,'' he says. Still the
evidence is strong that the inflation-fueled real-estate heyday
that many boomers and, in particular, their parents witnessed in
the 1970s and 1980s isn't going to be seen again. Ever. &QL;

<P>
   ``Senior boomers will be forced to accept the unpleasant choice
of selling at unattractive price levels or rethinking their plans
to move south or buy smaller homes,'' Sterling says, adding that
this could forestall a retirement real-estate boom in places like
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical characteristic of real-estate markets under
distress is that transactions simply dry up,'' Sterling says.
``Would-be sellers, when confronted with poor market conditions,
often just take their homes off the market, hoping to re-list later
on when things improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if demographic analysis is correct, boomers who are
waiting for things to improve may have a long wait indeed.'' &QL;

ANGELS' OLIVARES IS CONFIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Omar Olivares is in that ``zone.''
</P>
<P>
   He's listed as the club's No.5 starter, but his two starts this
season rank as the two best by the entire staff. He threw 71/3
scoreless innings against the Rangers on April 10, then followed it
up with Thursday's outing against the A's _ one run and four hits
in seven innings in the Angels' 12-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fall into a rhythm you feel you can do anything,''
said Olivares, 2-0 with a 0.63 ERA. ``You feel like you can throw
the ball anywhere you want, make the ball do whatever you want it
to do. You know it's hard for them to hit. I'm throwing to both
corners, I'm very aggressive, I felt they were swinging defensively
and didn't know what I was going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel it. It's hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason might be that Olivares had to win the
starting job out of spring training. He had to pitch well and he
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt real good in spring training,'' he said. ``Physically
and mentally I felt a lot better. I just kept it going. It's
probably the best spring I've had in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficult search: On the other end of the spectrum is Ken Hill.
Hill threw his between-starts workout Thursday with one goal in
mind _ get comfortable. It might seem strange that a pitcher with
Hill's experience feels like he doesn't know what he's doing on the
mound, but that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   After he gave up five runs on five hits and seven walks in only
four innings at Texas on Monday, Hill said: ``Right now I'm
searching. I'm worried about too many things. There's too much
going on in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Hill is struggling to find rhythm and as a result
he can't find the plate. But he worked with pitching coach Dick
Pole and bullpen coach Joe Coleman on Thursday and altered his
delivery motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he's trying to do is get comfortable and get into a
rhythm,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``He was in total
doubt. But today he threw great. I know he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill will make his next start Saturday against the Mariners at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Out with bruise: Second baseman Randy Velarde was hit by a pitch
on his left arm near the elbow in the sixth inning and was replaced
by Jeff Huson to start the bottom of the inning. He was diagnosed
with a bruise and is expected to be in the lineup tonight against
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Strange schedule: The Angels return home beginning tonight for a
three-game series against the Mariners but are right back out on
the road starting Tuesday in Toronto. After three games against the
Blue Jays, the Angels play three in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first month of the schedule's pretty strange,''
Collins said. ``We're in Southern California and we only play six
games in the first month pretty much.... I still go on the premise
it doesn't matter where you play, you still have to execute. But
the hard part is being on the coast and having these back-and-forth
things. The time changes get to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching matchups for the three-game series between the Angels
and Mariners: Tonight (7:05) _ Tim Belcher (0-1, 12.27 ERA) vs.
Jamie Moyer (1-1, 2.94); Saturday (7:05) _ Ken Hill (0-1, 7.56) vs.
Freddy Garcia (2-0, 3.65); Sunday (5:05) _ Steve Sparks (0-2, 7.20)
vs. Ken Cloude (0-1, 37.82).

BILL WENDELL, ANNOUNCER ON DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct spelling of name in 3rd graf)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Wendell, a radio and television announcer whose crisp
authoritative voice provided an ironic foil to entertainers from
Ernie Kovacs to David Letterman, died Wednesday at a hospice in
Boca Raton, Fla. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from cancer, said one of
his daughters, Francette Nunziata.
</P>
<P>
   Until his retirement in 1995, Wendell was most recently known
for the off-stage introduction of guests at the beginning of
Letterman's show at NBC and later CBS. The introductions typically
began with a municipal characterization like, ``From New York,
mountain fortress of the ancient Incas, it's `Late Night With David
Letterman ...'''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendell also worked with Bob Hope, Dave Garroway, Jack Paar,
Merv Griffin, Gary Moore, Alan King, Tom Snyder, Billy Crystal and
Jerry Seinfeld. But what brought him the earliest and widest
attention was his work in the 1950s as the on-air sidekick for
Ernie Kovacs, Mrs. Nunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always playing practical jokes on each other,'' his
daughter recalled. ``One time Ernie was supposed to gulp a big
martini, but it was supposed to be filled with water, only it was
really filled with vodka. He spit it out and started coughing like
crazy on live national television. Dad and his cronies were
laughing their heads off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell was born William Joseph Wenzel, Jr. on March 22, 1924,
in New York City to William J. Wenzel , a beverage distributor and
an owner of several Manhattan fruit stands, and Mildred S. Wenzel,
a housewife. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War
II, he worked in radio and early television. He had taken the
professional name of Wendell ``because he wanted to give his family
some privacy and maybe a German name at that time wasn't that
popular,'' Mrs. Nunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell then went on to work as a staff radio and television
announcer for NBC, on call for network promotions, special news
bulletins and network identifications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Mrs. Nunziata of Pelham Manor, N.Y.,
Wendell is survived by his wife, Anne Eustace Wenzel; two other
daughters, Anne Wenzel Markgraf of Burbank, California, and
Elizabeth Hansbury of White Plains; two sons, William J. Wenzel 3d
of Southport, Conn., and Richard Eustace Wenzel of Mount Vernon,
N.Y., and 14 grandchildren. &QL;

linguistics scholarship incorrectly. It was from 1957 until the

generative grammar, a theory that focuses almost exclusively on
syntax, or the rules of sentence formation.

A WAGERING CHECKLIST FOR DERBY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARCADIA _ After the upsets in last weekend's prep races, more
than 20 horses are aiming for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. But only a
handful are qualified to win it, and they don't include Santa Anita
Derby winner General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Says who? Says the bettors' guide that we modestly call the Ten
Commandments for Derby Handicapping.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1992, every Derby winner met at least eight of our
10 fundamental criteria, and six of those seven winners scored
better on our checklist than the post-time favorites they defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the candidates (and jockeys if announced):
</P>
<P>
   From the Santa Anita Derby: General Challenge (Gary Stevens),
Prime Timber (David Flores) and Desert Hero (Corey Nakatani).
</P>
<P>
   From the Blue Grass Stakes: winner Menifee (Pat Day), Cat Thief
(Mike Smith), Vicar (Shane Sellers), Kimberlite Pipe (Robby
Albarado), Pineaff (Jose Santos) and Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   From the Arkansas Derby: winner Valhol (Billy Patin), Certain
and Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   From the Wood Memorial: winner Adonis (Jorge Chavez), Best of
Luck (Jean-Luc Samyn) and Cliquot (Rene Douglas).
</P>
<P>
   From the Gallery Furniture.com: winner Stephen Got Even (Chris
McCarron) and K One King (Alex Solis).
</P>
<P>
   From the Flamingo: First American (Eddie Delahoussaye).
</P>
<P>
   From Dubai: Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey) and Aljabr.
</P>
<P>
   Fillies: Three Ring, possibly Silverbulletday, and less possibly
Excellent Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they measure up to the Ten Commandments:
</P>
<P>
   1. Prefer horses with the bred-in stamina for the 1\-mile Derby
according to the controversial ``dosage index,'' sometimes referred
to as an idiot's guide to pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for _ among others _ Menifee, Worldly Manner and First
American, who have dosage indexes on the high (wrong) side of 4.00.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prefer horses who were among their age group's leaders last
season _ rated within 10 pounds of the leader in the Experimental
Free Handicap of 2-year-old colts and geldings.
</P>
<P>
   An obstacle for General Challenge but good news for Prime
Timber, Cat Thief, Lemon Drop Kid and Worldly Manner. Also Three
Ring, Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting if you include the
fillies' ratings.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prefer horses who had the talent to win races of 1 mile or
more as 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge didn't. Menifee didn't, if only because he
missed the fall season. Prime Timber didn't, but he came close in
the Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   4. Throw out horses who missed out on the experience of winning
a race at age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, Valhol, Adonis and Stephen Got Even are among the
nonwinners at 2.
</P>
<P>
   5. Prefer horses who had three or four races _ no more, no less
_ between Jan. 1 and the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Adonis will have five. The Dubai horses will have none, unless
you count their trial races.
</P>
<P>
   6. Toss out any horse who didn't prep in a 1[-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   The fillies prepped against their own gender at 1 1/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
   7. Prefer horses who finished third or better in their final
preps, like 39 of the past 41 Derby winners.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, fifth in the Blue Grass, is the most popular
horse who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't be too impressed by horses who won their final preps.
The past seven Derby winners saved their best for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Timber would be the third straight Santa Anita Derby
runner-up to win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   9. Prefer horses ridden by jockeys of national renown.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, on Prime Timber, will try to show the rest of the
country how good he is.
</P>
<P>
   10. Don't bet on the post-time favorite. None has won since
Spectacular Bid in '79.
</P>
<P>
   Future-book bettors haven't settled on one horse, so we won't
hold No.10 against any horse just yet.
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all add up to?
</P>
<P>
   No horse meets all 10 criteria.
</P>
<P>
   But Vicar, the Florida Derby winner, and Cat Thief are 9 for 10.
And Prime Timber and Certain make the cut at 8 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   As for General Challenge, he checks in at 7 for 10, a late
bloomer who'll need every inch of his talent to get around the Ten
Commandments. &QL;

STRAWBERRY'S ARREST THREATENS TO END CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the latest chapter of his troubled life, Darryl
Strawberry now awaits the outcome of his arrest Wednesday night on
charges for cocaine possession and solicitation of prostitution.
Others who will control his future in baseball are waiting, too.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry pleads guilty or is convicted of a drug charge,
major-league baseball officials would very likely suspend and
penalize him as a repeat offender. If wrongdoing is established in
any manner, the New York Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, could
void Strawberry's 1999 contract and possibly end the career of the
37-year-old outfielder, who was told last fall that he had colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was arrested in Tampa, Fla., where he was working out
and preparing to join the Yankees' Class AAA affiliate at Columbus,
Ohio. Released on $6,000 bond just past midnight, Strawberry could
not be reached for comment Thursday; a phone call to his agent,
Eric Grossman, was referred to a Tampa-area lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from major-league baseball and the Yankees indicated
they would have little to say until the case is resolved.
Strawberry has postponed his workouts indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of acquiring facts,'' said Lonn Trost,
the Yankees' executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   These are the facts, as presented by the Tampa police:
Strawberry was driving a sports utility vehicle about three miles
from the Yankees' minor-league complex in Tampa, in an area that
had drawn neighborhood complaints about rampant prostitution,
according to Joe Durkin, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Strawberry yelled something undecipherable to an
undercover police officer, circled the block and came back to
approach an undercover officer to offer $50 for a sex act. The
police stopped Strawberry, and in searching his wallet, discovered
0.3 grams of cocaine wrapped inside a $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, Sgt. Marc Hamlin wrote in a
report that Strawberry ``continually apologized'' to the police
``and was very remorseful for what he had done. He asked several
times if there was anything that we could do to change this
situation, because this was going to ruin his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry maintained that the cocaine was not his, according to
the report, telling the police that his wife's uncle had used the
vehicle the night before and might have folded the $20 bill and
placed it in the glove compartment, where Strawberry said he could
have found it and put it in his wallet without noticing the
cocaine. Strawberry also said he was joking with the officer about
sex and did not intend to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine possession, a third-degree felony, carries a maximum
penalty of five years in jail; solicitation has a maximum penalty
of 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Because of past drug violations, Strawberry has been tested
randomly twice a week. Rich Levin, a spokesman for major-league
baseball, said Strawberry had not failed any tests to his
knowledge. He was most recently tested on Tuesday, and the results
are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry is convicted or pleads guilty to a drug charge,
Levin said, this would constitute a violation of baseball's policy.
Levin said all cases are weighed individually, and there is no
minimum penalty. Given that Strawberry was suspended for 60 days in
1995 after his second offense, however, it stands to reason that he
would be suspended again.
</P>
<P>
   People in the Yankee organization said Strawberry's wife,
Charisse, traveled from the couple's California home to Florida on
Thursday. Strawberry has two children from his first marriage, and
two from his current marriage, 5-year-old Jordan and 3-year-old
Jade.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said he ``reached
out'' to Strawberry, and refused further comment about his contact
with the player. But Strawberry's status was the topic of numerous
meetings within the organization on Thursday, even in the absence
of Steinbrenner, who was in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, a star slugger with the New York Mets from 1983-90,
was virtually out of baseball when he initially signed with the
Yankees in 1995, because of injuries and a long list of personal
problems that included repeated treatment for drug and alcohol
addiction, and the failure to pay taxes and make timely payments to
his ex-wife. Strawberry, who had made millions, was deeply in debt
when he tested positive for cocaine in 1995 and was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   When Steinbrenner signed Strawberry, he told him he would always
be a friend as long as the outfielder did not cross him; if he did
so, Steinbrenner told Strawberry, ``I will be your worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, unwanted by other teams, signed with the Yankees
again in 1996 and showed he still had power. A knee injury limited
him to 29 at-bats in 1997, but Steinbrenner signed him again for
1998, and Strawberry enjoyed a resurgence, hammering 24 homers in
295 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Beloved and respected by teammates and club officials,
Strawberry quietly accepted his role as a part-time player and was
seen as a symbol of the unselfish approach of the 1998 Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry was told that he had colon cancer on Oct. 1,
some teammates burst into tears, and the team dedicated its
postseason to him. There was an outpouring of sympathy for
Strawberry, who continues to receive treatment for the cancer, from
Yankee fans and people around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were not sure if he could play in 1999, but fond of
Strawberry and aware of the potentially adverse public relations if
they cut him loose, Steinbrenner signed him anyway. Strawberry
received a $2.5 million minor-league contract which, like many
contracts, protects the team against certain behavior by the
player. Minor-league contracts essentially are paid on a prorated
basis over five months, from April to the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was undergoing chemotherapy as spring training began,
hampering his training schedule, and immediately, others within the
organization said they noticed how different Strawberry seemed. He
often appeared annoyed, expressing frustration that he wasn't
locked into the Yankees' opening-day plans, and griped about
feeling unwanted and left out.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was not moving well and was far from being ready to
play the outfield, he became a major distraction, the antithesis of
what he had been in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of sense that he was very depressed going through
chemotherapy and that one of his goals was to make the team out of
spring training,'' pitcher David Cone said. ``He seemed very
deflated when that didn't happen.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, the day the Yankees announced that he would start
his comeback in the minors, Strawberry acknowledged that he had
gone through mood swings. ``Now I'm at a peaceful place,'' he said.
``Having a good attitude about it is the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all patients being treated for colon cancer suffer some
form of depression, according to Dr. Scott Walder, the associate
chairman and professor of medicine at Montefiore Hospital in the
Bronx. He said there were three reasons for this: They get
depressed about the knowledge they have cancer and the sense of
mortality that goes along with that knowledge; the chemotherapy can
create symptoms that are unpleasant; and they have to cope with the
disruption of life's routines.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients who have beaten some sort of addiction, Walder
said, will have relapses. ``They've beaten their addiction, and
with the onset of the cancer they will feel it's futile and
sometimes regress,'' Walder said. ``Or they think, `I'm being
punished and will reward myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Des Jarlais, the director of research for chemical
dependency at Beth Israel, speaking generally of those recovering
from addictions, said, ``At a simplified level, any severe stress
is likely to generate a relapse to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, or
whatever the addiction was.''
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of stress, Des Jarlais said, will ``mimic the
symptoms of drug withdrawal in many ways. People who have had
addictions have learned those feelings will be relieved in a very
easy way'' _ by reverting to substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry appeared distant last weekend, when he rejoined his
teammates at Yankee Stadium for the presentation of the 1998
championship rings. His knee, which he has said is arthritic, has
bothered him, and with Chili Davis off to a great start, the
Yankees had no need for him as a designated hitter. His debt
remains. He is a cancer patient. He returned to Tampa, to work out
on his own, out of the cocoon of friends provided by every team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' said Ricky Ledee, in a reaction typical in
the Yankees' clubhouse. ``I didn't expect that. But we don't know
the whole story yet. It's sad for his wife, for his family, and
everyone in here. You don't know how his wife is going to react,
you don't know how George is going to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said: ``I hope his career isn't over. I hope they don't
give up on him. But these sort of situations also conjure up the
flip-side argument _ How many chances do people get?''

SONY AND IBM CREATE ALLIANCE ON INTERNET MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striking an alliance in the struggle to establish standards for
delivering music over the Internet, IBM and Sony announced late
Thursday that they would make their competing standards mutually
compatible.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Internet and music-business leaders met
in Los Angeles this week to discuss ways of protecting their
industry from illegal distribution of music over the Internet by
means of a free and increasingly popular technology known as MP3,
which threatens to destroy profits from CDs and other commercial
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents
major record labels, has organized the ``Secure Digital Music
Initiative'' to establish a standard for the legitimate selling and
trading of licensed music on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including AT&AMP;T Corp., IBM, Liquid Audio,
Microsoft Corp. and Sony, have developed technologies intended to
deliver CD-quality music online while preventing illegal copying.
Each is pushing for its technology to be adopted as the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Sony announced Thursday that it would make two of its new
technologies, MagicGate and OpenMG, compliant with IBM's proposed
standard, known as the Electronic Music Management System, or EMMS.
Like IBM's technology, MagicGate and OpenMG are intended to prevent
digital music from being illegally copied, but they are not as
broad as EMMS, which includes tools for preparing and distributing
music as well as protecting it from piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Sony will continue to developing its own secure music
standard, known as Super MagicGate, which will offer similar tools.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Clancy, a spokesman for Sony, said the company did not
believe it was diminishing its own chances of creating a standard
by cooperating with IBM. Rather, he said, making their two
standards interoperable would ``make it more attractive for the
music industry to support.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM has announced plans for a field test of its technology in
San Diego in June in which several thousand households will be able
to buy commercial digital music over television cables.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Selvage, IBM's general manager for global media, said the
company had constructed its standard and the test in consultation
with major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the industry leaders gathered in Los Angeles said
the new standard amounted to closing the barn door after the cows
had left, since a growing number of consumers were already trading
music freely _ or at least inexpensively _ on the Internet using
MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have these proprietary or collegial standards, but how
will they play in the mass market?'' asked Peter Harter, vice
president for global public policy for GoodNoise Corp., a concern
that sells licensed digital music files over the Internet in the
MP3 format.

SEX TRADE SHOW OPENS IN NEW YORK, IRRITATING GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Baroness surveyed the wares at her booth at the
Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in midtown Manhattan Thursday:
the glistening black latex dresses and trousers, the hot pink
plastic tank tops and bike shorts, the racks and racks of
accessories for men, women and other customers who might quarrel
with either classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``World domination through latex,'' she proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   And then, the Baroness took in her unlikely surroundings: the
city's premier convention center on a bright spring afternoon,
where the sunshine suddenly illuminated a world that had once
thrived only in the darker corners of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been anything like this before,'' she said as
Erotica USA, a pornography trade show _ the industry's first
mainstream convention exhibition in New York City _ bustled to life
around her. ``I've been to fetish events. But nothing like this,
nothing to bring it into the mainstream like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square, half a mile away, it has become difficult to
find remnants of the city's pornography industry, forced out by
legislation advanced by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But Thursday
afternoon, to the obvious irritation of Giuliani and a number of
religious leaders, was the start of a four-day celebration of
pornography, held in a 45,000-foot hall in one of New York's
architectural landmarks _ and a public building at that. The
event's Web site is www.erotica-newyork.com.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone familiar with the city's deservedly notorious history
of sex clubs, dirty-book stores and the like, this was fairly tame
stuff. The closest thing to nudity Thursday afternoon was Annie
McMaster's bare feet, as she talked up a gravity-free sex device
(don't ask) that she was trying to sell for $250. The exhibitors
were instructed not to display photographs or videos depicting any
kind of sexual acts, and to provide opaque bags with their
merchandise. No one under 21 was allowed in, and guards were posted
to make sure the rules were obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 20 minutes after the Galleria River Pavilion opened
up, the line trailed down three sets of stairs to the ticket
booths, where people paid from $30 up to $150 for the show,
including lectures and live dancers. Even in its sanitized form,
the apparent initial success of the exhibition was presented by its
promoters as a challenge to Giuliani's attempt to clean up the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 35 years I've been a pornographer, and we've always been
underground,'' said Al Goldstein, who _ between signing autographs
_ was running a booth that displayed his magazine and, inevitably,
the Web site devoted to the magazine. ``I never dreamed we'd be in
the Javits Center. It is such a class place.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not share those feelings. ``It was a big mistake
for them to contract with something called Erotica-whatever-it-is,
Erotica 99,'' he said. ``I thought it was an inappropriate area to
get involved in, for a government-sponsored organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the state-run center said that Erotica USA, which
is paying $39,000 for the space, met all the requirements to stage
the exhibition. ``This is a legal business and we cannot make moral
judgments on the rental of space based on whether or not we approve
of an event's content,'' said Mike Eisgrau, the center's director
of public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The result of that decision was a head-turning afternoon at the
Javits Center, which was otherwise renting out halls for a
pharmaceutical convention and a teacher certification examination.
Booths devoted to piercing, pornographic videos, erotic chocolates
and sex toys were in unusual proximity to separate exhibitions of
cellular telephones from AT&AMP;T and compact disks from Tower Records.
</P>
<P>
   A dermatologist wearing his white New York University jacket
handed out leaflets about hair- and wrinkle-removal procedures.
``We thought there might be people here who need our services,''
said the dermatologist, Dr. Bruce Burgeen.
</P>
<P>
   It was all very polite. ``This is very, very soft-core,'' said
Abby Ehmann, who called herself the editrix of a magazine devoted
to fetishism.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, was by design. ``The idea is to mainstream it
_ to make it not an intimidating environment,'' said Fred Bari, the
show's promoter, who normally works selling truck insurance. ``We
consider this an alternate kind of date, rather than just going to
the movies. Something to make your blood run a little faster.''

BRAZIL'S CENTRAL BANK DEFENDS ITS ACTIONS DURING CURRENCY CRISIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The president of Brazil's central bank
sought Thursday to defuse a potentially explosive congressional
investigation into government support of the banking system during
the nation's currency crisis in January, rejecting assertions by
lawmakers that his institution acted illegally.
</P>
<P>
   After conducting a three-week-long investigation, the central
bank's president, Arminio Fraga, and its supervision director, Luiz
Carlos Alvarez, told members of a Senate panel that a bailout of
two small investment banks in January prevented a collapse of other
banks. The officials also said that suggestions of an
insider-trading conspiracy at the central bank that may have
provided some financial institutions with advance tips about
exchange-rate policy changes were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This institution acted prudently,'' said Fraga during
testimony in Brasilia, the capital. ``One only has to study the
American Depression of the '30s to see what happens when the
central bank fails to prevent a banking crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraga confirmed reports that the central bank had sold dollars
at below-market levels to the two banks, Banco Marka and Banco
Fonte Cindam, to help them cover losses in financial-derivatives
markets. Although such help is allowed under Brazilian law, and
Fraga said it was done to limit risk in the financial system, the
operations have raised questions because some executives at the
banks were reported to have protected their own investments while
clients lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Anger about the episode, which occurred over a frantic three-day
period in mid-January when the currency was devalued, led to a
broad inquiry into what critics are calling the government's
unacceptably lenient treatment of banks.
</P>
<P>
   Several banks reported enormous profits after the devaluation,
largely because they bought dollar-linked government bonds before
the shift in exchange-rate policy. In addition, the devaluation,
while beneficial to some banks, has resulted in a widening of the
budget deficit, to roughly 14 percent of the gross domestic product
in January, compared with 8 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it results in greater transparency and greater public
understanding of the central bank's actions, then this look into
its actions are positive,'' said Marcio Pochmann, a University of
Campinas economist.
</P>
<P>
   But the inquiry comes at a delicate time, when the economy is
beginning to stir after months of stagnation. Inflation has slowed
in recent weeks as many retailers have absorbed suppliers' price
increases and the government has ruled out wage increases indexed
to price rises.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation fears subsiding, the central bank reduced its
main interest rate on Wednesday to 34 percent from 39.5 percent,
the third cut since Fraga was appointed bank president last month.
With investors' confidence growing, the government filed this week
for permission in the United States to sell up to $3.75 billion of
dollar-denominated bonds. The bond issue, which is expected in
coming days, would mark Brazil's return to global debt markets for
the first time since the Russian default last summer closed the
door to many developing-country borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery in Brazil's prospects, swifter than similar
recoveries after devaluations in South Korea and Mexico, is still
far from complete, as officials of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's government concede. ``The president knows that many of
the key decisions of his second term will be taken over the next
three or so months,'' Finance Minister Pedro Malan said in an
interview. ``The worst thing to happen now would be to declare that
the worst is behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are concerned that the outcome of the
congressional inquiry could threaten the optimism built up over the
last several weeks. A former finance minister, Mailson da Nobrega,
said, ``The possibility this episode could evolve into a scandal
could threaten the credibility of the economic team.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears likely, though, that Fraga's explanation of the
central bank's actions will lessen that possibility. For one thing,
it is unclear how executives of the failed banks might have
benefited from the bailouts, which ultimately resulted in the
closing of Banco Marka and the sale of Banco Fonte Cindam.
</P>
<P>
   As for other financial institutions accused of using inside
information to profit from the devaluation, Fraga said his own
inquiry showed that information needed to make such decisions was
widely available in the Brazilian and foreign press. Most of the
institutions mentioned have either declined to comment or have
rejected speculation that they used inside information.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fraga himself, he is largely shielded from the fallout of
the investigation, regardless of its results. He was made central
bank president only in March, more than a month after his
predecessor, Francisco Lopes, decided to aid Banco Marka and Banco
Fonte Cindam. Lopes is expected to testify before the Senate panel
next week.

ESTELLE SAPIR, WHO FOUGHT BANK OVER HOLOCAUST ASSETS, DIES AT 73  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Estelle Sapir, a Holocaust survivor who won a rare
recovery of the family funds she had sought for half a century from
a Swiss bank, died on Tuesday at her home in Far Rockaway, Queens.
She was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sapir, who had been in poor health for some time, died of
cardiac arrest, her niece Jeannette Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Miss Sapir became the lead plaintiff in a class-action
lawsuit involving thousands of Holocaust survivors who sought to
recover deposits made by their families in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate committee, Miss Sapir became a symbol
of the movement to recover these deposits.
</P>
<P>
   After years of denying Miss Sapir's claims that Credit Suisse, a
major Swiss bank, was holding a fortune deposited by her father
shortly before he died in a concentration camp, last year the bank
joined Miss Sapir in announcing that her case had been settled.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a confidentiality agreement, neither party
would say how much money was involved, but Swiss news organizations
reported the figure to be $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse said the case set no precedents, but it appears to
be the first instance in which a Swiss bank has not insisted that a
claimant provide the death certificate of a Holocaust victim who
made deposits. Such a requirement, the claimants have long argued,
is impossible to satisfy, because the Nazis kept very few records
of those who died in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The Sapir family fortune, the precise amount of which has never
been determined, was deposited in several banks before the war by
Miss Sapir's father, Jozef Sapir, a Jewish businessman from Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Sapir was sent to the Nazi concentration camp at
Majdanek, Poland, Miss Sapir said, she was able to speak with him
through barbed wire in a detention camp in Southern France.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to survive,'' she said he told her. ``You'll be OK,
because there's money in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   He then drilled her repeatedly on the names of the banks where
he had spread out assets accumulated from several businesses.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, during which Miss Sapir worked for the French
underground, she visited a number of banks in England and France
where her father had told her he had left part of his money. The
bank accounts were turned over to her without question, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Geneva branch of Credit Suisse, saw things differently.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Sapir asked to collect the money in 1946, the bank
manager demanded that she provide her father's death certificate
and records of his deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sapir said that her father's financial records had been
lost in the chaos of the war and that there was no death
certificate. Credit Suisse persisted in its demands for
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sapir never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that my father was always behind me and with me,'' she
said after her lawsuit was settled last year. ``When I die and go
to heaven, I will see him and say, `I accomplished it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Credit Suisse found a record of a depositor named J.
Sapir, which seemed to confirm that Miss Sapir's father had held an
account at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the bank entered into serious negotiations with
Miss Sapir, and she agreed to accept a payment in exchange for
withdrawing from the class-action suit against the three major
Swiss commercial banks _ Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland
and the Swiss Bank Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the agreement, Credit Suisse suggested that it had
settled the case in the absence of direct evidence of how much
money Jozef Sapir might have deposited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a sufficient basis in the facts, combined with our
concern with Miss Sapir, to arrive at today's settlement,'' Bob
O'Brien, the managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Sapir, who as born in Poland, moved to the United States
about 30 years ago, her niece said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Bernstein, Miss Sapir is survived by two
other nieces, a nephew and several great-nieces and great-nephews.
She never married. &QL;

POLICE: WOMAN MARRIED, THEN KILLED 85-YEAR-OLD HUSBAND FOR HIS
MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (rk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew G. Vlasto, a member of a prominent
Greek-American family active in publishing and politics, was 85
when he married for the first time to a woman who was 57 years his
junior.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later he died under suspicious circumstances,
shortly after $80,000 had been abruptly withdrawn from his bank
accounts by his new wife, Sylvia S. Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, more than five years after Vlasto's death, Manhattan
prosecutors accused Ms. Mitchell of manslaughter, asserting she fed
him lethal drug cocktails so she could inherit his estate of more
than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell, who is now 33, was arrested Saturday in Las Vegas
by detectives from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and a
complaint saying that she ``recklessly caused'' her husband's death
was filed Thursday in Manhattan Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint asserted that after being traced recently to Las
Vegas, Ms. Mitchell admitted to a detective that she married Vlasto
with the intention of looting his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, she also acknowledged that she took
Vlasto to a doctor who she knew would prescribe the narcotics that
she administered to him. The complaint indicated that in the weeks
before Vlasto's death, Ms. Mitchell dispensed the drugs to him in
their apartment in Chelsea and in Bellevue Hospital where she
barred his relatives from visiting him after he collapsed from a
drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, Ms. Mitchell is challenging extradition to New
York City for a possible trial on charges of manslaughter in the
second degree and grand larceny in the second degree. She is being
held without bail for a hearing later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasto was a lawyer and banker in Greece before coming to the
United States in 1947 and working as an editor for Atlantis, a
Greek language newspaper owned by relatives that ceased publication
in 1974. He later operated a business that supplied votive candles
to churches and looked after his real estate investments in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vlasto's death in November 1993, his relatives have
pressed the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, to
investigate the matter more vigorously. The relatives maintain that
they gave prosecutors financial and medical records in 1993 and
1994 that implicated Ms. Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In the court complaint, which is a procedure for ordering an
arrest before an indictment, Michael Lentini of the district
attorney's detective squad said that Ms. Mitchell admitted to him
that she married Vlasto ``under false pretenses with the intent to
take his property.''
</P>
<P>
   Lentini said the marriage ceremony, on Aug. 19, 1993, was
performed by a Pentecostal minister on West 125th Street in Harlem
and that a witness said that Vlasto was unable to walk and that Ms.
Mitchell, who was then 28 years old, carried him into the
minister's office.
</P>
<P>
   Following the wedding, Ms. Mitchell obtained a joint bank
account, giving her access to Vlasto's savings. In September and
October 1993 she withdrew almost $80,000, including the transfer by
wire of $70,000 to the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City in her
name, Lentini said.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasto's relatives said that he stopped communicating with them
in the summer of 1993 and they learned of his marriage only after
he was hospitalized. He did not leave a will and in a court
settlement in 1994 with Vlasto's relatives, Ms. Mitchell was
permitted to retain what was left of the $80,000 withdrawn from
banks. But she waived all rights to her husband's estate, which
included about $170,000 in bank accounts in the city and about
$400,000 in banks and real estate holdings in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition before the settlement, Ms. Mitchell denied
giving Vlasto drugs. She said she met him in 1991 and later worked
for him in his apartment before he proposed marriage to her.

MICHAEL CRICHTON GIVING COMPUTER GAMES SECOND TRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Crichton, the author of ``Jurassic Park'' and the
creator of ``ER,'' is trying to revive his career _ as a
computer-game designer, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton made a computer game, called Amazon, in 1982. He was so
disenchanted with the result that he vowed, he said Thursday, ``I
was never going to do it again until the technology allowed you to
do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The technological moment has arrived, Crichton figures, and on
Friday he is announcing that he is founding Timeline Studios, a
computer-game company. His co-founder is Michael Backes, another
Hollywood veteran, who worked with Crichton on ``Jurassic Park'' as
the graphics supervisor and on ``Rising Sun'' as a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The Timeline founders said they thought that today's more
powerful personal computers and new 3-D software tools finally made
it possible to create movie-quality images, detail and movement in
computer games. That transformation may be accelerated by the
arrival next year of the Sony Playstation II, which, Crichton said,
may eclipse the PC as a game platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most computer games give you a big empty environment to go in
and kill people,'' Crichton said. ``Even the suspense techniques
are beat-the-clock _ do this before you blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides ever-faster PCs, Timeline is relying on new
software-development tools, and it has close ties to Virtus Corp.
Virtus was founded in 1990 by David Alan Smith, who developed the
computer visualization technology used in many movies, including
James Cameron's ``The Abyss'' in 1989. For years Smith has worked
at Virtus to bring improved graphics to the mainstream of desktop
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The backgrounds of computer games often seem a blurry dark
space, because crowd scenes and detailed landscapes have been out
of reach technologically. ``I wasn't going to do this if the
backgrounds were fog and you couldn't do crowd scenes,'' Crichton
said. ``Why do a computer game if you have to apologize for what it
looks like?''
</P>
<P>
   But with a new technology called Openspace 3D by Virtus,
Crichton and his partners say that barrier has been overcome,
enabling them to display scenes with dozens or hundreds of
characters. For game creators, Smith says, the technology allows
them to work with a ``virtual back lot'' of characters and objects.
They can move in scenes without waiting for them to be rendered by
the computer, as is the case with standard computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to make a very compelling world very quickly,''
Smith explained. ``And a game developer can try out ideas as soon
as you get them, a creative process that is much more like what a
movie director does.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton would not divulge any details of the games he is
working on. They will be announced later this year, for release
early next year.

NICOLA TRUSSARDI, WHO LED FAMILY FASHION HOUSE IN ITALY, DIES AT
56  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nicola Trussardi, who diversified and expanded his family's
small-town glove business into a multimillion-dollar fashion house,
died on Wednesday in Milan of injuries suffered in an automobile
accident. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi died after undergoing brain surgery for injuries he
received when he lost control of his car driving from Milan to his
home in Bergamo on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic entrepreneur, Trussardi took the company founded
by his grandfather, Dante Trussardi, in Bergamo in 1910, and
extended its limited but respected reputation for quality leather
gloves into an internationally known manufacturer and retailer of
men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear clothing, accessories
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a former vice president of the National Chamber of
Fashion of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi was born in Bergamo in 1942 and graduated from the
University of Milan with a degree in economics in 1968. He joined
the family company in 1971 after the death of his older brother,
Dante, and took control in the late 1970's after the death of his
father, Giordano.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Maria Luisa, and four children,
Beatrice Trussardi of New York and Francesco, Gaia and Tommaso
Trussardi of Bergamo.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi developed innovative procedures for tanning and
finishing leather and expanded its use to wallets, shoes, belts and
luggage and, soon after, leather clothes.
</P>
<P>
   His first pret-a-porter collection in 1983 was shown in the La
Scala Opera House foyer, and subsequent collection presentations
also combined fashion and cultural institutions. The greyhound was
chosen as the company logo.
</P>
<P>
   The Trussardi Laboratory was established as the umbrella for the
company's fashion design and the Trussardi Research Center for the
development of products like perfume, china, carpets and objects.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with more than 100 boutiques around the world and
seven stores selling clothes and accessories designed for young
urban customers, had sales of almost $500 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi's latest project, on which he had worked for some
years, was Citta della Moda, a ``fashion town'' that he proposed
for Milan. The project, which a spokesman for the company said
would proceed, is to include fashion schools, space for shows, a
hotel for fashion visitors and other institutions that would
centralize the industry.

 &HT;    Children barred from outside world see light of day
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin, Tom Beyerlein and Lou Grieco
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For years, the four children of Edward and
Lucinda Sizemore were banned from leaving their Monroe Avenue home.
Not to play. Not even to go to school. With one exception: On
Halloween their father briefly took them out, then ushered them
back inside.
</P>
<P>
   That account surfaced Thursday from the children and their aunt
Della Lewis, who is caring for them pending an investigation by
Montgomery County Children Services.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been caring for the children since Jan. 29. On
Thursday, the children seemed excited when a reporter knocked at
the back door. They stared curiously with warm smiles and were
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest child, a 17-year-old boy, speaks and can write in
English but has had little formal schooling. The rest of the
children _ 4- and 11-year-old boys and an 8-year-old girl -
communicate with each other in a guttural, primitive-sounding form
of English. Still, none has problems understanding the other.
</P>
<P>
   The children were removed from their home in January after the
oldest child mailed a note to an aunt in what appeared to be a plea
for help. That aunt, Lewis' sister, contacted Lewis, who went to
the home. Lewis, who had not seen her sister in 10 years, said she
saw the children peering through curtains but no one would answer
the door. At that point, Lewis contacted the Montgomery County
Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Sizemore, 41, and Lucinda, 40, were arraigned this week
in Vandalia Municipal Court. Both pleaded not guilty to four counts
of nonsupport of a dependent. They are in the Montgomery County
Jail, each on $10,000 cash bond. Pre-trial hearings are scheduled
for Wednesday in Vandalia Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got these kids, all I did was cry,'' said Lewis,
a sister of Lucinda Sizemore. ``These children didn't know how to
take a shower when they first got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me all kinds of stories. A lot of times all I can do
is shake my head. I don't know what to say,'' Lewis said, tears
flowing from her eyes, her face reddening. ``They never saw the
light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the 4-year-old often gets up in the middle of the night
and stands screaming in the kitchen doorway. ``It's a frightful
scream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three younger children attempted to share their stories with
their visitor.
</P>
<P>
   What did you do while you were in the house? the reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm,'' sighed the 11-year-old boy. He stared at the living
room ceiling as he began to recollect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watt TV. Me chat (sat) around. We vaw (draw). Me tidn't
(didn't) do nuthin' else. Tat (That's) all me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to go to school?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yap. So me to know how to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old, who was away at a relative's home, did have
some formal schooling through elementary school grades, according
to Sgt. Charles Turner of the Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way the detectives could communicate with the
kids,'' said Turner. ``They had their own language.'' But the
children could understand what the detectives were saying, Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors on Monroe Avenue said the Sizemores moved into the
rental house four or five years ago. They almost never saw Lucinda
Sizemore or the three youngest children outdoors, although they
would sometimes see Edward Sizemore and the eldest boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right from the start they were kind of strange, because
they moved in in the middle of the night,'' said next-door neighbor
Mary Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said she saw two of the three small children in the
backyard of their home only once. When the children saw her, she
said, they scampered back into the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids, I thought they were smaller than they (really) were
because you couldn't understand anything they said,'' Murphy said.
``The only audible word they'd say was 'Mama.' It was like little
kids just learning how to talk. And they were scared to death of
people. They'd see people and they'd run and hide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The (sheriff's) detectives told us it was like Pig Latin,
gibberish,'' neighbor Shelly Cales said of the children's language.
``They had their own system of gestures and nods. They understood
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said she would see Edward Sizemore regularly bring fast
food or small quantities of groceries home after work. ``I don't
think they had a refrigerator, so he'd have to bring things in
every day,'' she said. ``They had furniture at one time, but Rent A
Center came and reclaimed it last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said she tried to welcome the family to the neighborhood
when they arrived several years ago. But, though Murphy could hear
them inside, she said they didn't answer when she knocked.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest child introduced himself to her last year. Later,
Murphy and another neighbor received bizarre cartoons in their
yards with the Sizemores' address written on them. Murphy feels the
oldest youth drew them.
</P>
<P>
   They were ``really far-out cartoons _ really modernistic,
robot-like cartoons,'' Murphy said. ``He'd say something like, 'I
know who you are, I know your kids.' I don't have any kids, so it
didn't pertain to me. They were sort of threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Riehle, who lives across the street, said she called
Children Services in 1995 because she would hear a baby incessantly
crying in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a normal cry,'' Riehle said. ``It just tore my heart
out.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she'd see the three small children, clad only in
underwear, lined up looking out of the front window, but they'd
never go outside.
</P>
<P>
   Cales and Riehle both spoke by phone Wednesday with the
17-year-old. They said he told them the youngest children were
enjoying playing outdoors at their aunt's home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the parents avoided a referral to Children Services by
returning to their native Kentucky with the children, Sheriff's
Detective Jim Scenters said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 29, Scenters and another detective went to the Monroe
Avenue home. The officers had the children removed that night. They
were taken to Children's Medical Center for examinations. The two
eldest children had medical problems that had gone untreated for
years, Scenters said. He would not identify the medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the 11-year-old had suffered from a hernia since
birth, while the 8-year-old had a toe infection for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got these kids from the hospital they were
wrapped in blankets,'' their aunt said. ``They had no winter
coats.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said her niece and three nephews often remind her of the
the main character in Nell , the movie in which a girl grows up in
a forest wilderness and learns to speak, but in a language unheard
of by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's visit, the three children played with yo-yos,
drew Winnie-the-Pooh sketches and watched TV.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want to go back home, the reporter asked the 11-year-old
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me not know,'' he responded

THOUSANDS RALLY IN DIALLO'S MEMORY FOR STRONG OVERSIGHT OF POLICE

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A multiracial throng of thousands marched in memory
of Amadou Diallo Thursday, shutting down half the Brooklyn Bridge
and several streets in downtown Brooklyn and lower Manhattan during
the afternoon rush as they chanted about justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
   Handing out placards decorated with red peace symbols,
organizers of the four-hour rally focused on their 10-point plan
for police reform, which calls for federal monitoring of police
conduct and civilian oversight of the New York department. But the
diverse crowd was filled with a broad range of critics of the
status quo, and the message of the march became, at times, a
massive thumbs-down to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and march organizers on the scene estimated the
crowd at 10,000, but later, the Police Department released an
official tally of 4,500, and the Rev. Al Sharpton suggested the
turnout was 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked too hard too long, moving from the back of the
bus, to now put our children in the back of an ambulance,'' former
Mayor David N. Dinkins told those at the rally, who filled about
two and a half blocks in front of 26 Federal Plaza in lower
Manhattan by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton compared the 90-minute trek across the Brooklyn Bridge
to the landmark crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma,
Ala., in 1965. The singer Harry Belafonte invoked the heroes of the
civil rights struggles of a generation ago, whom he had also
marched alongside: the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X,
Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow warriors demand that I be here _ I will be here
until the day I die defending that cause: peace,'' Belafonte said.
``I'm here to see that that seed of rebellion grows into a mighty
forest.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest and most highly orchestrated in a series of
demonstrations that have become a focal point of civic discourse in
the 10 weeks since four white police officers sprayed 41 bullets at
Diallo, a West African immigrant, killing him as he stood in the
vestibule of his apartment building in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But the turnout fell far short of the 25,000 that some
organizers had predicted, despite a $300,000 campaign that included
advertising on radio and television, as well as calls from phone
banks, direct mail and leafletting at churches and subway stations.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking out reporters as he left City Hall about 7:15 p.m.,
Giuliani suggested that the controversial advertisements depicting
a black youth frightened by police officers, as well as signs
comparing the mayor and the police force to Nazis, may have
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of rhetoric has been at the stage of frenzy, and
that does not reflect at all what is going on in the city,'' said
Giuliani, whose earlier description of Diallo demonstrators as
``silly'' became a rallying cry of the protesters. ``Maybe the
rhetoric had gotten to such a vicious and hateful level that people
just don't want to associate with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers tried to play down questions about numbers, pointing
instead to the large number of white, Hispanic and Asian marchers
who joined the black protesters who have formed the core of the
Diallo demonstrators. At the rally's end, Sharpton sniped, ``You in
the media, we know you count us as three-fifths of a man anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said there were no arrests and no problems during the
rallies or along the two-mile marching route between.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful, controlled nature of the event stood in marked
contrast to the last rally of a similar size, when Giuliani _ who
was not yet mayor _ joined about 10,000 police officers at City
Hall to protest Dinkins' plans for the Civilian Complaint Review
Board in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That demonstration spun out of control, with officers damaging
cars and storming the Brooklyn Bridge, and many protesters spewing
profanity and racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are the type of marcher that believes in violence,
turning over cars and cursing, you're at the wrong march,''
Sharpton told the boisterous crowd gathered at Cadman Plaza, next
to the federal courthouse where jury selection is under way in the
trial of four officers accused of torturing a Haitian immigrant,
Abner Louima, in a Brooklyn police station in 1997. ``That's
Giuliani's march against Dinkins. We march with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd were veteran protesters, but many were
first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Bregman, 56, became a spontaneous protester on her way home
to Brooklyn Heights from the subway. Unable to find a magic marker,
she ruined a red lipstick to make her personal sign: ``3 bullets is
self-defense. 19 bullets is murder. 41 bullets is slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not go to marches,'' Ms. Bregman said. ``I don't care to
be with crowds. I'm not going to stand around and yell, `No
justice, no peace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not plan to come, but I just have to say my peace,'' she
explained. ``This is not a black issue. It's a people issue.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pity the poor soul who has to argue that theater is
dead while Judi Dench is standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   When a character advances this argument in ``Amy's View,'' the
new play by David Hare, you tend to wave it away as though it were
a gnat, and not just because the speaker is one of those irritating
embodiments of societal brutality and selfishness that Hare is fond
of whipping up. After all, there in plain sight is an overwhelming
refutation of what is being said: a short, rather square-shaped
woman with a puckish face who, you would swear at that moment, is
the most ravishing creature you have ever laid eyes on.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Amy's View,'' which opened Thursday night at the Barrymore
Theater, Ms. Dench plays an actress with a capital A, the kind who
inspires critics to purple prose every time she sets foot on a
stage. There isn't a more glorious instance of type-casting on
Broadway this season. London theatergoers have been Ms. Dench's
starry-eyed captives for decades, but Americans know her mostly for
her recent work in film as the formidable monarchs of ``Mrs.
Brown'' (as Victoria) and ``Shakespeare in Love'' (as Elizabeth),
for which she just received an Academy Award. That it is cinematic
success that has made Ms. Dench a bankable New York stage star,
returning here for the first time in 40 years, is the kind of irony
that abounds in ``Amy's View,'' a disgruntled, often annoying
assessment of the casualties of an impatient, media-driven society.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares what it took to get her here, as long as she has
finally arrived?
</P>
<P>
   Those who have seen Ms. Dench only in movies will discover
qualities that a camera can't capture: a force of willpower,
concentration, technique and sheer radiance that brands her
presence into your memory. It registers in her most florid,
actressy gestures, which are always appropriate here. But it is
never stronger, and this is the acid test of any great performer,
than when she is absolutely still.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of people who have purchased tickets to ``Amy's
View,'' which runs through July 18, on the strength of Ms. Dench's
new international celebrity will not be disappointed in its star.
They may, however, have difficulty swallowing the bitter, not
entirely distilled brew of diatribe and piety that is Hare's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy's View,'' which has been directed by Richard Eyre with his
usual likably warm affection for actors, follows a formula that its
author has exploited more successfully in earlier works like ``The
Secret Rapture,'' ``Plenty'' and ``Skylight'': that of a sensitive
woman of principle, a latter-day variation on Shaw's St. Joan, set
against and usually brought down by a corrupt world that chews up
and spits out its idealists. Not that Esme Allen, the shortsighted,
dreamy London stage star portrayed by Ms. Dench, is an unqualified
saint.
</P>
<P>
   Hare is too savvy a dramatist to paint his protagonists only in
angelic shades of white, although he came perilously close to doing
so with his Oscar Wilde in ``The Judas Kiss,'' seen on Broadway
last season. But he is usually at his best in bringing complexity
to thwarted heroic figures. Ms. Dench's Esme has arrogance and
affectation to burn, not to mention an infuriating urge to
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   But, boy, does she have to suffer for those traits, as well as
for just being human in a cruel universe and for representing, one
suspects, Hare's vision of the downward moral slide of Britain in
the second half of this century. Esme isn't plagued by nasty boils,
but in other respects she is close kin to Job. God, or at least
Hare, visits upon her many calamities, divesting her of life's
insulating comforts, from love and companionship to her very home.
Through the play's four acts, which span 16 years, she is stripped
to the bare hub of her faith, her religious belief in her craft as
an actress.
</P>
<P>
   That Hare shares that faith is evident in ``Via Dolorosa,'' his
wonderful one-man show at the Booth Theater about his visit to the
Middle East, in which he speaks of ``the elaborate conventions of
theater,'' which are ``so much the very heart of my life.'' The
same spirit, too keen to be dismissed as merely sentimental,
pervades ``Amy's View,'' and as embodied by Ms. Dench, it is what
gives the play its qualities of transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   But be prepared for some heavy sledding along with the cloud
surfing provided by Ms. Dench. Esme is the only wholly convincing
character in ``Amy's View,'' which is a problem since Hare has
chosen to divide the duties of earthly penance between two female
characters: Esme and her much-loved daughter, the Amy of the title,
played by Samantha Bond.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``Amy's view'' (and the phrase is repeated at least once
too often) that, as another character puts it, ``you have to give
love without any conditions at all,'' and that eventually you will
reap the rewards. Well not, it seems, in this lifetime, not if you
hook up with the sort of fellow Amy does. That's Dominic Tyghe
(Tate Donovan), a sexy, self-centered, ambition-riddled young man
of the sort that Laurence Harvey used to play.
</P>
<P>
   Dominic, an orphan (for symbolic reasons, natch), represents the
new order of things English ushered in by the Thatcher regime,
tricked up with the sins of post-modernism. An aspiring filmmaker,
he is the voice of those who have no patience for the leisurely
exposition and moral underpinnings of theater and the novel. He
even argues that criticism (perish the thought) can be more
creative than the art it criticizes. He's all media ectoplasm, as
opposed to Esme's creative substance, an upstart to her
traditionalist grande dame, and needless to say, they loathe each
other on sight.
</P>
<P>
   That puts poor Amy at the dead center of the debate, and pure
debate, for long stretches, is what the play is. Hare brings in a
parallel love story of sorts, that of Esme and Frank Oddie (Ronald
Pickup), Esme's neighbor in a pastoral Berkshire community near
Pangbourne. Frank is also an investment counselor who steers Esme
into putting her savings to disastrous use in topical ways familiar
to anyone who has followed international finance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The ephemeral aura of Bob Crowley's set, representing Esme's
living room as a ghostly thing about to evaporate, is underscored
by Wendall K. Harrington's tone-setting projections between acts,
in which verdant landscapes and thatched cottages give way to gray
urban scenes. Clearly, what we are watching is the disintegration
of a spurious fantasy of England. Hitting the point home is the
presence of Evelyn Thomas (the excellent Anne Pitoniak), the
elderly mother of Esme's late husband, who grows increasingly
decrepit as the evening wears on. (MORE) nn

`ALL TOO HUMAN' IS CLEARLY ALL ABOUT STEPHANOPOULOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although written by a political underling, George
Stephanopoulos' book ``All Too Human'' is reminiscent of one of
those Barbra Streisand movies in which the actress-director so
dominates the screen that she suffocates the plot and submerges the
other characters.
</P>
<P>
   The mop-topped Clinton spokesman-turned-pundit has as hearty a
love of the limelight as the boss who both inspired and appalled
him. Even if power stemmed from proximity, Stephanopoulos reveled
in it.
</P>
<P>
   He's vain, and this revealing but calculating memoir is about
him. Seemingly frank in its sentiments, ``All Too Human'' is
tailored as carefully as one of Stephanopoulos' suits. The excesses
of Washington, D.C., media ``bigfeet'' are played down.
Stephanopoulos has become one of them. By contrast, the year-long
Monica Lewinsky saga is used to play Clinton in a harsher light and
conveniently reveal inner doubts of Clinton's young aide.
</P>
<P>
   As Little Rock lounge singer Gennifer Flowers played doctored
tapes of Clinton in 1992 _ to support her claims of a 12-year
affair _ Stephanopoulos writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole torso tightened as I was hit by a wave of nausea,
doubt, embarrassment and anger. He lied. Even if he didn't, what's
he doing talking to her in the middle of the campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   The torso may have been tight, but Stephanopoulos went on
putting down bimbo eruptions through the 1992 campaign, and served
through Clinton's triumphant comeback in his 1996 reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The limelight attracts, even if it is reflected. Pressure
can be incredible _ Stephanopoulos would be seeing a therapist
during his later White House tenure _ but power is often delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos had long worshipped New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and
nurtured hopes that Hamlet-on-the-Hudson would run for president.
But as Clinton prepared to accept the 1992 Democratic nomination,
Cuomo tried to get hold of Stephanopoulos. The call came as
Stephanopoulos was helping Clinton revise his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton was now the Democrats' best hope, Cuomo was
nominating him, and I was Clinton's guy _ a man to see if you had a
message to send or a problem to be fixed,'' he writes. ``Cuomo's
call to me was both a sign of my growing power and a source of even
more. When I excused myself to return the call, I made sure Clinton
knew where I was going and why.''
</P>
<P>
   If the reader's stomach can hold that kind of prose, there are
delicious revelations to be savored in ``All Too Human.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1993 U.S.-Russia summit in Vancouver, B.C., Clinton
seemed to constantly grasp Boris Yeltsin's elbow, guiding Russia's
president through a walk in the woods and a photo opportunity at
the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The official explanation was jet lag. Yeltsin was bushed. It
turns out, however, that Yeltsin was bombed. Yeltsin drank wine
over lunch, three scotches on a boat ride, and gulped more wine by
the glassful at dinner. In Stephanopoulos' words, ``With his
slicked-back white hair, he looked a boiled potato slathered in
sour cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' complicated relationship is exposed in perhaps
too-intimate detail. Bill and Hillary Clinton clearly love each
other, but have it out over his lack of discipline on many fronts.
The president depends on her judgment, which is often flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The prime example cited by Stephanopoulos is Hillary Clinton's
resistance to releasing information about the couples' Whitewater
land investment, and her resistance to appointing a special
counsel. Stonewalling over a small-time land deal set off a feeding
frenzy in the White House press corps.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady starts to cry at one meeting, referring to the
couples' succession of crises. She accuses Stephanopoulos of giving
up on them during the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were out there alone, and I'm feeling very lonely right
now,'' she declares. ``Nobody is fighting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode is fascinating but repellent. Here and elsewhere,
Stephanopoulos has strayed over the border between what is personal
and what should stay private.
</P>
<P>
   The book has two other major flaws. While he's present at
dramatic moments, Stephanopoulos is an image shaper and not an
intimate. After each speech, he asks the question, ``Where's the
news peg, the sound bite?'' Hence, the reader learns little of how
substantive policy was formed, from Clinton's risk-taking efforts
for peace in Northern Ireland to the economic policies that have
produced unprecedented prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He also inhabits a claustrophobic, rarified world, from the
campaign ``War Room'' in Little Rock to his compact quarters next
to the Oval Office. It is a universe preoccupied with spin, scandal
and power.
</P>
<P>
   The American people never seem to intrude into this world, or
matter very much to Stephanopoulos. In fact, they've made very
sophisticated judgments about America's 42nd president. They
appreciate Clinton's strengths and know his flaws, every bit as
much as his closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has won two terms through his tenacity, drive and
ability to connect _ and because he is effective and fights for
their interests. He is, however, widely distrusted and rarely seen
as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   The voters at a distance have wrestled with the same
contradictions that Stephanopoulos witnesses and writes about close
up. But a D.C. insider should never be distracted by the outside
story.

 NEW YORK: wears on .
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hare's script features some witty dialogue about the idea of
England itself as theater, a sham show in opposition to the
sincerity of Esme's brand of theater. The talk often has a Shavian
sparkle and eloquence, but it also often seems to come less from
characters than position papers.
</P>
<P>
   This is unfortunately true even for the deep-feeling Amy,
although Ms. Bond has a rasp in her voice and a glow in her face
that suggests a blood bond to Ms. Dench. Donovan and especially
Pickup, who is too much the classic stage drunk here, have yet to
settle into their roles in ways that would make the women's
attraction to them credible.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is Ms. Dench's Esme, and what Hare has written
for her is often first-rate, combining a flowery, purely theatrical
charm with a sense of profoundly still waters beneath. With
transitions so subtle as to be invisible, Ms. Dench accordingly
takes her character through a journey in which she begins as a
deliciously comic figure not unlike the posturing stage divas of
``Hay Fever'' and ``The Royal Family'' and winds up as something
closer to a Buddhist nun.
</P>
<P>
   When she says to Dominic in the first act, by way of defining
her acting style, ``I play lots of layers,'' she accompanies the
statement with a silly, self-deprecating flutter of charadeslike
movements. Shortly thereafter, she says that the basic skill of her
profession is saying one thing while thinking another, and the
moment is astonishing, because that is exactly what Ms. Dench is
projecting at that moment, seemingly without self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The play's splendid final act, which is worth all the others put
together, takes place in a dressing room where Esme is preparing to
go on while chatting with an enthusiastically admiring young actor
(the appealing Maduka Steady), who asks her the secret of her
strength onstage. ``You go down to the core,'' she says, with
almost dismissive simplicity. ``There it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is, indeed. Most of what Ms. Dench says in this scene
is similarly simple, and her presence is correspondingly elemental.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes here, as Esme looks into a mirror while applying
makeup, are so fiercely articulate that you flinch. More than all
of Hare's verbiage, those eyes capture what remains ineradicably
vital in this woman when the flashy surface has been peeled away.
It is the essence of how stage acting can penetrate in ways no
other art can. As long as performers like Ms. Dench are around, the
theater need not fear for its life.

HORSEMEN LIKE PLANS FOR SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Santa Anita chairman Frank Stronach, revealing
details of his ambitious renovation plans, won applause from about
300 horsemen Thursday when he said the track's hillside turf course
and the picturesque walking ring will be essentially unaltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to listen, huh?'' Stronach told a gathering in the
Santa Anita turf club _ acknowledging he bowed to the pleas from
horse owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   After Stronach's Magna International purchased Santa Anita in
December, he floated proposals to eliminate the unique hillside
portion of the turf course and build a second grass oval, and to
make room for retail and amusement facilities behind the grandstand
by moving the walking ring to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach indicated he changed his mind in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell him, `Please don't change the turf course,''' trainer
Vladimir Cerin said after the announcement. ``He seemed dead set
against it. This morning, he told me he was leaving it alone, and I
was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He cleared up a lot of aggravating rumors,'' said trainer
Bruce Headley.
</P>
<P>
   That was the intent of Stronach's 45-minute give-and-take with
horsemen, many of whom got their first looks at scale models of the
planned changes.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is scheduled to begin the day after Santa Anita's
62nd season ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach said the first, $18 million phase will include building
new turf-club dining and bar areas and the start of improvements in
the stables area. That phase is to be finished before the track's
Oak Tree meet opens Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Further plans call for adding dirt and turf training tracks;
building a Citywalk-style shopping and entertainment area and an
arena for equine-themed shows; modernizing the track's art deco
facade; and _ ``later'' _ erecting an on-site hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ruining tradition,'' Stronach told the crowd.
``We're enhancing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita, which dropped out of bidding to host the 2000
Breeders' Cup, now has its eye on the 2002 event, Stronach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have a first-class track,'' Stronach said, ``when we
show this place off to the world.'' &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

   IN THIS PRIVATE SCHOOL, BLACK KIDS SUCCEED. At a time when much
of the nation lambastes public schools for failing America's
children _ especially minorities _ Piney Woods Country Life School
in Mississippi stands as a shining example of how to succeed with
children deemed society's losers. ``With 300 students in seventh
through 12th grade, from 29 states and two African nations, Piney
Woods thrives because of its sense of mission, its time-tested
pedagogy, its business acumen, its religious faith, its racial
pride, its hard work, its strict discipline and its stubbornness,''
reports columnist Bill Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   UNEMPLOYMENT AND MINORITIES: WHO'S BEING LEFT OUT? With the
latest national unemployment figures reaching the lowest level in
almost 30 years, what could possibly be wrong? wonders columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras. The real bad news, he says, is that blacks
have an `official' 8.1 percent unemployment rate, albeit down from
8.3 percent. That's 2.5 times higher than whites and 51 percent
higher than Hispanics. ``Ninety-five percent of Fortune 500
executives are white and 96.4 percent of whites are employed,'' he
points out. ``Could it be that racism has something to do with the
huge black unemployment figures?''
</P>
<P>
   TWO SIDES TO THE INDIAN GAMING PHENOMENON. Gaming casinos have
brought about extraordinary success _ and extraordinary doubts and
fears _ to Indian country. On the one hand, some reservations
experienced an explosion of sudden riches that was nearly
overwhelming, and many tribal leaders as a result made mistakes. On
the other, there are reservations still in the grip of poverty. And
some of those _ the Navajo, the Hopi _ have chosen not to have
gambling. ``They are fierce protectors of their sovereignty and
they fear a casino would interfere with their cultural and
traditional way of life,'' reports columnist Tim Giago. ``Their
dignity is something money cannot buy.''
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBERING YEHUDI MENUHIN. When her grandson became interested
in an old violin in her attic, Virginia Helbling wrote to Yehudi
Menuhin, a violinist she hugely admired, to ask whether there was
any book about his life directed to young people, reports columnist
Kirsten Chapman. He replied that there was though it was out of
print. But a beautifully illustrated child's book he'd written,
``The King and the Fiddlers,'' complete with handwritten
dedication, mysteriously arrived at her grandson's home. The
82-year-old Helbling, from Dresden, Ohio, remembers with gratitude
and affection how Yehudi Menuhin _ who died last month _ touched
her family. ``There is a special place in my heart for this man and
his kindness,'' she told Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET CHO: WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE `ALL-AMERICAN GIRL.' After the
network dumped her show ``All American Girl,'' comedian Margaret
Cho, now 30, returns to the spotlight a little smarter, a little
wiser. The sitcom represented both the high point and the low point
of Margaret's young career. Then 25, she was on top of the world. A
year later, she felt like the world was on top of her, she says.
But today, reports Larry J. Tazuma in KoreAm Journal, Cho is
greatly in demand as a stand-up, has won enviable roles in movies
(``Face/Off'') and TV (``The Nanny,'' ``Dr. Katz'') and continuous
airings of ``Pulp Comics'' and her HBO Special on Comedy Central
keep her very busy.

 &HT;    PINEY WOODS, Miss. _ At a time when much of the nation lambastes
public schools for failing America's children _ especially
minorities _ Piney Woods Country Life School stands as a shining
example of how to succeed with children deemed society's losers.
 &HT;    Robert Collins, an African-American 11th-grader who came from a
violent home in Baltimore, was able to find a sponsor to send him
to Piney Woods. The 90-year-old school is tucked away on 2,000
acres of rolling hills, timberland, pastures and lakes 21 miles
south of Jackson.
 &HT;    ``Piney Woods has a lot to offer,'' said 17-year-old Robert,
who, before he came here, often contemplated suicide. ``It teaches
you discipline. You meet a lot of people from a lot of different
places. You get to see how different people react toward one
another. Since I've been here, I've gained independence, and I'm
becoming content with myself. When I came here, I thought very
little of myself. But Piney Woods is teaching me how to become a
man.''
 &HT;    Founded in 1909 by black educator Laurence Jones, Piney Woods is
one of four historically private, black boarding schools left in
the nation. Before integration, more than 80 such schools existed.
They were havens where Southern black parents sent their children
to escape the inadequate, segregated public schools that Jim Crow
created. The civil rights movement changed everything, however,
causing black support for the schools to drop, forcing many to shut
down almost immediately. During the past four years, three more of
these schools, all in the South, closed.
 &HT;    How does Piney Woods survive, when 80 percent of its students
are from low-income families? Why did the CBS TV program ``60
Minutes'' feature it? How does it continually send more than 90
percent of its graduates to college each year?
 &HT;    With 300 students in seventh through 12th grade, from 29 states
and two African nations, Piney Woods thrives because of its sense
of mission, its time-tested pedagogy, its business acumen, its
religious faith, its racial pride, its hard work and its
stubbornness.
 &HT;    The school's third president, Charles H. Beady Jr., speaks of
its unique success in unadorned terms: ``The mission of the school
is to provide education and educational opportunities primarily for
youngsters from lower socioeconomic backgrounds within a Christian
environment, with the understanding that all students can learn.
That's the way it was when the school started. That's the way it is
now. We are living proof that because a youngster is black, poor
and from a single-parent home does not mean that that youngster is
automatically destined for academic and social failure.''
 &HT;    Statistics for the American College Test (ACT) bear out Beady's
claims. In 1990, for example, the average student nationally scored
nearly 10 points higher than the average Piney Woods student. In
1997, it was just three points.
 &HT;    ``With an overwhelmingly at-risk student population, Piney Woods
is inching closer to matching the national average on standardized
tests,'' Beady said. ``We attribute much of this growth to a
climate that says to our students that the academic deck of life is
not stacked against you here. You can learn. We will see to it that
you do.''
 &HT;    Strict discipline lies at the heart of the school's operation.
In no way a boot camp _ students can withdraw whenever they wish _
Piney Woods is a place where adults are in full control, where
students must obey all rules and meet all academic standards if
they want to remain. ``We spend a lot of time making sure students
are where they're supposed to be and doing what they're supposed to
be doing,'' Beady said.
 &HT;    Attending the school's two-hour classes is mandatory, and
students are required to study two hours each night. Although it
prepares students for college, Piney Woods also has a vocational
program through which students work 10 hours a week on campus. Some
work in the laundry, food service, buildings and grounds or on the
500-acre farm, where much of the campus meat supply is produced. By
working, the students help defray the cost of their approximately
$10,000 tuition.
 &HT;    Rising at 5:30 a.m., students, along with faculty, are required
to attend prayer service weekday mornings and church service three
times on Sundays. They don clean, crisp uniforms each day and abide
by other rules of dress and behavior. ``We don't allow our boys,
for instance, to walk around with their drawers showing,'' Beady
said. ``They must wear belts. We don't allow our boys to wear
earrings and those crazy haircuts.'' And girls are forbidden to
wear sexually provocative outfits.
 &HT;    ``None of this is meant to be simply punitive,'' he said. ``It
is meant to have the children focus on what's in their heads and
not what's on their heads. We don't need or want `cool pose' at
Piney Woods.''
 &HT;    All youngsters, not just those in ROTC, must say ``ma'am'' and
``sir.'' And those caught abusing alcohol or drugs, engaging in
gang-related activity, having sexual intercourse, fighting or
acting insubordinately, such as talking back to a teacher, are
subject to automatic expulsion. Yes, corporal punishment is still
permitted.
 &HT;    Without discipline, Beady said, the school's traditional liberal
arts academic program _ one that encourages students to think
critically in all subjects _ would be worthless. All students must
maintain at least a ``C'' average.
 &HT;    Piney Woods' superintendent and principal, Earnest O. Ward Sr.,
who has been at the school for nearly 25 years, dismisses
suggestions that he and his colleagues are old-fashioned: ``We
don't apologize. We're with our students 24 hours a day, seven days
a week. They need discipline. They want discipline, and we're
giving it to them so that they can be successful in life.
 &HT;    ``And because we want to better the whole child, we take the
holistic approach to education: We educate the head, the heart and
the hand. The head is for knowledge; the heart is for ethical
values; and the hand is for work. We let kids know that there is
nothing wrong with good, honest work.''
 &HT;    In addition to keeping students on track, Ward's greatest
callenge is recruiting and retaining an excellent faculty. From the
outset, the school is at a disadvantage because it pays $2,000 to
$3,000 less than the state, which itself is 49th in teacher pay
nationwide. And, because Piney Woods is a boarding school, its
teachers work for less for longer hours.
 &HT;    Piney Woods operates on an annual budget of nearly $8-million,
and survives on an endowment of about $30-million, donations,
grants and bequeathals. Its charter mandates that 60 percent of its
students must be classified low income. It has attracted donors
such as Oprah Winfrey, who gave $43,000 for the school to hire a
social worker, and cartoonist Charles Schulz, who donated a
dormitory that is affectionately called ``Snoopy'' Hall.
 &HT;    The average student pays $2,500 of the approximately $10,000
tuition. The school, which graduates 40 to 50 students a year,
makes up the rest. Otherwise, most students, such as Robert
Collins, could not experience this special place.
 &HT;    Because of the generosity of Piney Woods and its supporters,
Robert escaped the self-destruction of his Baltimore neighborhood.
``I'm going to college,'' he said. ``I'm not sure which one. But
I'm going because I want to be a lawyer.''

UNEMPLOYMENT AND MINORITIES: WHO'S BEING LEFT OUT?
</HEADLINE>

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    National unemployment figures for March (covering people
actively looking for work) has reached the lowest level in almost
30 years: 4.2 percent. Hispanic unemployment has reached the lowest
ever level since records began on Hispanic employment in 1973: 5.8
percent, a 15 percent drop from 6.7 percent the previous month.
Average hourly earnings for all are up 3.6 percent from last year.
 &HT;    Among whites, unemployment has fallen to 3.6 percent from 3.8
percent. For high school dropouts, unemployment has fallen from 7.5
percent to 6.1 percent. Among high school graduates, unemployment
hovers at 3.4 percent.
 &HT;    The good times are rolling for almost everyone. But, there is
something wrong with this picture: The same reports show that
rather than creating another 200,000 jobs a month, only 46,000 new
jobs were created last month, down almost 160,000 from February.
That, of course, signals a possible slowdown in the economy, as
does the loss of more than 300,000 manufacturing jobs over the past
year.
 &HT;    But the real bad news is that blacks have an `official' 8.1
percent unemployment rate, albeit down from 8.3 percent. That's 2.5
times higher than whites and 51 percent higher than Hispanics.
Despite all the good economic times, a record breaking stock market
and record low unemployment among whites and Hispanics, blacks are
still losing out on jobs.
 &HT;    But while they are stuck at high unemployment rates, illegal
aliens from around the world _ particularly from Mexico _ come into
the country with little education and little English and yet still
find work. They find jobs in every state they go to, despite local
black populations with high unemployment.
 &HT;    Many blacks complain that these illegals steal jobs from them,
but the March national unemployment figures belie that. While
prosperity clearly hasn't reached some specific pockets of
population, most urban/suburban areas are choking on help wanted
signs and ads. So, why is black unemployment at levels that could
be consider catastrophic?
 &HT;    We are told that whites are getting off welfare faster than
blacks and Hispanics. So the actual proportion, therefore, of
blacks and Hispanics on welfare is increasing.
 &HT;    Among Hispanics, particularly among illegals from south of the
border, the statistics are meaningless, for illegals don't register
for work at employment development offices, nor do they normally
apply for unemployment benefits.
 &HT;    What we have here, are unemployment statistics that might be
bogus for Hispanics without papers, but more importantly, for
American blacks.
 &HT;    There is a possible reason why the black unemployment rate is so
high. It hasn't been that long ago _ about five years _ that the
Bush-appointed Federal Glass Ceiling Commission reported 95 percent
of executives of the Fortune 500 companies were white and only 3
percent black. If there is any doubt that such an executive
hierarchy doesn't affect employment patterns, look again.
 &HT;    Ninety-five percent of the executives are white and 96.4 percent
of whites are employed. What a revelation! Could it be that racism
has something to do with the huge black unemployment figures? Is it
a coincidence that most all corporate employment opportunities are
controlled by whites, as they are in small business, where most
jobs are created year in and year out?
 &HT;    If the cause is racist, what can be done about it? This inequity
has festered for 400 years _ since and because of slavery. There
are hundreds of laws outlawing employment discrimination, but that
obviously isn't effective or so many blacks wouldn't be unemployed.
Most blacks are high school graduates. Over a million blacks have
earned business degrees from colleges in the past decade. Yet, they
have disaster-proportion unemployment.
 &HT;    Faced with this kind of competition, Spanish-speaking illegals
don't take jobs from blacks, they take jobs blacks don't even want.
So, illegals aren't the employment problem for blacks. Most of the
problem is in the white community _ the employment community.
 &HT;    Thus, blacks must become employers themselves. They must
establish businesses and hire their own people.
 &HT;    Hispanics have done that very thing and Hispanics are entering
the Millennium owning close to two million businesses and creating
new businesses and jobs every day. In March, 1999, Hispanic
unemployment hit a record low. That did not happen in a vacuum.
That's free enterprise.

TWO SIDES TO THE INDIAN GAMING PHENOMENON
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by

 By TIM GIAGO (Nanwica Kciji) 
 &HT;    (Tim Giago, Lakota Indian, is CEO of book publishers Lakota
Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian
name is Nanwica Kciji.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Imagine if you will, being so poor that you lived in a shanty
without running water or an indoor bathroom. Your welfare checks
and the monthly rations of government commodities barely kept the
wolf from the door. Unemployment ran as high as 80 percent, and the
average life span was 47 years. The automobile used for
transporting your family to the hospital or grocery store was held
together with baling wire.
 &HT;    This is the way it was in Indian country a short 12 years ago _
before the casinos came.
 &HT;    But today, on some reservations an explosion of sudden riches
has been nearly overwhelming. The jump from extreme poverty to
extreme wealth happened so quickly it was as if every member of the
tribe hit the million-dollar lottery. That is what the advent of
gaming in Indian country has created, an unparalleled phenomenon
that astonishes, excites and frightens many.
 &HT;    In other more isolated reservations, poverty still grips the
community and little has changed.
 &HT;    For those tribal leaders caught by the unprecedented overnight
leap from rags to riches, the endeavor to adjust rapidly became one
of trial and error.
 &HT;    And some tribes, in their haste to get on the gaming bandwagon,
threw all caution to the wind and brought in casino management
companies of dubious reputation. Others signed compacts with state
governments that nearly shredded their status as sovereign nations.
Many tribal leaders made mistakes.
 &HT;    That is what happens when people accustomed to living in poverty
are suddenly thrust into wealth. Every snake oil salesman in the
country with a get-rich-quick scheme suddenly converged upon tribes
long treated as `out of sight, out of mind.' So it was that tribes'
education to the world of high finance had begun.
 &HT;    In the past I have been critical of some of the better-off
tribes _ a few of them signing legal documents with state
governments that would eventually impact all of the Indian Nations.
My mistake was not allowing them to learn and to grow using their
errors as educational tools.
 &HT;    This month an 84-room hotel will be opened by the
Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe on the North Dakota-South Dakota
border. This is the first phase of a $10.8 million plan that will
feature a new casino and resort. Another new casino twice as large
as the current one will open in the fall. The tribe hopes to have
an RV (recreational vehicle) park open by midsummer.
 &HT;    The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Tribe of Minnesota, who owns the
extremely successful Mystic Lake Casino at Shakopee, and whom I
have also criticized, financed this entire project.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the Mashentucket Pequot, owners of the richest Indian
casino _ the Foxwood Casino at Ledyard, Conn. _ has begun to hire
Indian people from all over America to management positions. Thus,
they are now using their prosperity, as are the Shakopee
Mdewakanton, to reach out to other tribes less fortunate than
themselves.
 &HT;    I attribute this dramatic change to the painful learning process
both tribes have experienced and to the stability in their tribal
governments that has allowed them to invest wisely and to feel
secure enough to extend a helping hand to others.
 &HT;    I also applaud the replacing of much of its non-Indian
management with Indians from its own and other tribes, a process
undertaken by a tribal leadership that is much more sensitive to
the conditions on other reservations and have a strong desire to
help weaker Indian Nations.
 &HT;    Gaming has brought about extraordinary success _ and
extraordinary doubts and fears _ to Indian country.
 &HT;    As a result, understandably, there are those Nations that have
chosen not to have gambling.
 &HT;    Conditions of extreme poverty exist today on those Indian lands
where gaming has not been embraced. The Hopi (Arizona) and Navajo
Nation (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah) are two good
examples. Neither tribe has looked to gaming for their salvation.
 &HT;    The Navajo voted against gaming in a reservation-wide referendum
about two years ago. The Hopi, who are very traditional and
spiritual in their beliefs and lifestyle, voted in a special
election in 1994 not to open a casino. Hopi Chief of Staff Eugene
Kaye said simply, ``The people decided they didn't want gaming so
they just voted it down.''
 &HT;    Twice, the issue has been on the ballot of the Navajo Nation and
twice, it has gone down to defeat. Former Chairman Albert Hale
said, ``When an issue as important as gaming comes up, we cannot
afford to leave it in the hands of the politicians because many of
them would look at it as a revenue producer and probably favor it.
We left it up to the Navajo people and they said no.''
 &HT;    The Navajo and Hopi are politically astute. They have observed
the good and the bad of Indian casinos on other reservations and
they fear a casino would interfere with their cultural and
traditional way of life. For the most part, the Hopi and Navajo
still speak in their native languages. They see more evil in gaming
than good. They are fierce protectors of their sovereignty and they
have watched other tribes diminish their own sovereignty in order
to gain wealth.
 &HT;    Both tribes maintain very rigid social management units within
their matrilineal clans. This tightly knit management process
ensures continuity and gives the tribe as a whole a means for
survival even when facing destructive natural elements or the
extreme pressures exerted upon them from the encroachment of modern
society. It is this concept of a communal, sacred responsibility
that has allowed these people to look sudden wealth in the face and
turn their backs to it.
 &HT;    Anyone who visits Chinle, Window Rock, or Tuba City on the
Navajo Nation or Shongopavi, Shipaulovi or Oraibi on the Hopi
Nation, will not fail to observe the quiet dignity the people carry
in their poverty.
 &HT;    Thus far, even though they are the poorest of the poor, the
Navajo and Hopi have not succumbed to the temptations offered by
that green god called money. Dignity is something money cannot buy.

 &HT;    (Kirsten Chapman writes a weekly column for the Columbus
Dispatch in Columbus, Ohio, and is the author of three books,
including recently published ``The Way Home.'')

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Upon learning last month that violin virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin had
died, an 82-year-old grandmother in Dresden, Ohio, was transported
back in time to some very special memories.
 &HT;    She had inherited a violin 23 years ago as part of a relative's
household goods, Virginia Helbling wrote in a letter the day after
the musician's death. Not knowing how to play the instrument, she'd
stored it within a blanket chest inside a closet.
 &HT;    More than a decade later, her grandson Andy, who was 12 or 13 at
the time, ``spied the violin and picked it up. He began asking
questions about it that I could not answer,'' Helbling said.
``Finally he put it away.''
 &HT;    Within a week, though, her grandson asked whether he could have
the violin so he could take lessons.
 &HT;    ``I was ecstatic,'' she recalled, ``for I love music.''
 &HT;    Eventually, his mother _ her daughter-in-law _ found a teacher
and Andy excelled.
 &HT;    Later, in an issue of Architectural Digest, Helbling saw a
photograph of Menuhin ``strolling across a luxurious lawn in front
of a beautiful English home ...
 &HT;    ``And he was smiling,'' she said, surprised. ``Most of his
pictures were so solemn,'' she explained.
 &HT;    She had first learned in school about Menuhin _ born April 22,
1916, five days before her own birthday.
 &HT;    ``I could not imagine anyone so young being so talented,'' she
wrote of the child prodigy. ``When I was in college I attended one
of his concerts and again was impressed.''
 &HT;    At the stunning age of 7, just two years after he'd begun
studying the violin, Menuhin performed as a soloist with the San
Francisco Orchestra. At 11, he made his Carnegie Hall debut with
the New York Symphony Orchestra.
 &HT;    ``It seems ridiculous to say that he showed a mature conception
of Beethoven's Concerto,'' reported The New York Times of the
event, ``but that is the fact.''
 &HT;    The photo of Menuhin, who moved to London in 1959 and later
became a British subject, prompted Helbling to write to his agent.
She wanted to know, because her search had proved fruitless,
whether any book about his life was ``aimed at young people.'' She
explained about her grandson.
 &HT;    ``Not long afterward, I received a letter from Yehudi Menuhin
saying there had been such a book but it was out of print,'' she
said. ``The envelope had the return address of his home in London.
 &HT;    ``One day Andy's mother called me, all excited, (to ask) if I
had sent Andy a book from England. She'd asked her mother, sister,
brother and a few friends and no one knew anything about it.''
 &HT;    Helbling at that moment realized that ``Yehudi Menuhin himself
had sent Andy a hard-backed, beautifully illustrated child's book
that he'd written called `The King and the Fiddlers' ... He had
written a note to Andy on the fly leaf and signed it.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I fired off a letter of profuse thanks and told him
we would love to attend one of his concerts if he came to the
States.''
 &HT;    She later had another letter from the famous violinist in which
he mentioned two concert dates.
 &HT;    As a thank-you, Helbling sent him a gift: a ``gathering basket _
that his wife could use when she cut flowers for the house.''
 &HT;    She, in turn, received a gracious note from Menuhin, not only a
founder of schools for young musicians, but also a renowned
humanitarian.
 &HT;    For Christmas 1998, Helbling gave her grandson _ now 22 and an
Ohio Northern University senior, who once played with the Eastern
Ohio Symphony _ a custom-made box to hold the Menuhin book and
letters, which ``I think he will always treasure.''
 &HT;    ``I am convinced that music can bring men together,'' Menuhin
once said.
 &HT;    Helbling would agree:
 &HT;    ``There is a special place in my heart for this man and his
kindness. ''

MARGARET CHO: WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE `ALL-AMERICAN GIRL'
</HEADLINE>

 By LARRY J. TAZUMA 
 c. 1999 KoreAm Journal 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    When comedian Margaret Cho first arrived in Hollywood, the
narration may have been something like: You arrive with high
expectations, only to be shot down by the first manager you meet.
He tells you, among other things, you're too ethnic, so pack up
your bags and go back home. Determined, you grit your teeth, grease
your elbows, and begin a life that is as cloudy today as when you
were living it.
 &HT;    Mature for your age, you tell yourself you've already seen it
all and waste no time proving it. At 25, you get your own show. It
airs on network TV, primetime. You fire your manager. Hollywood
types tell you what to do. The community turns on you. You can't
figure out why.
 &HT;    The network dumps your show. Depressed, you turn to drugs and
chase them down with alcohol.
 &HT;    ``All-American Girl'' represented both the high point and the
low point of Margaret's young career. At 25, she was on top of the
world. A year later, she felt like the world was on top of her.
 &HT;    ``I went through a couple of years of ... depression, a lot of
really bad stuff in my personal life,'' she said. ``It was awful.
And then, a lot of people who I thought were my friends would drop
me. People I got to know through the whole network process _ people
like actors and people that I've worked with, like the executives
that I'd become very close to _ wouldn't talk to me anymore because
everybody was really freaked out because they thought the show
would keep going.
 &HT;    ``Even though it wasn't really a failure, it wasn't really a
bomb, it did kind of OK in the ratings. Now, it would've been a
hit.''
 &HT;    In fact, ``All-American Girl'' was far from being a bomb.
According to an Entertainment Weekly June 2, 1995 analysis of
Nielsen ratings for the 1994-95 TV season, AAG placed 43rd out of
141 scheduled series. In fact, it placed above 33 shows that were
renewed the following season: ``Coach,'' often considered a hit
show, placed 52 that season and ``The Marshal,'' also renewed,
placed 87. Both shared the same network as AAG.
 &HT;    And remember Will Smith's hit comedy, ``Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air''? It tied that season with AAG at 43.
 &HT;    AAG's average weekly draw was an estimated 15.8 million viewers,
a half million viewers above such current hits as Fox's ``Ally
McBeal,'' which litigates in 22nd place, and 1.5 million more
viewers than NBC's ``Just Shoot Me,'' flashing around 27. NBC's
``3rd Rock From the Sun'' (53) and ``NewsRadio'' (60) don't even
come close.
 &HT;    ``It's very surreal,'' said Cho, about the whole chain of
events. ``It's true what they say about Hollywood _ one week you're
at the top and then you're down at the bottom. It happens in a
flash.
 &HT;    ``You know, fortunately I already had low self-esteem so I
didn't have that far to go, but it was awful! And it took me a
couple of years to get out of it. I also had to get out of problems
I was facing caused by all this trauma. And I had a very difficult
personal life and very terrible relationships ... very abusive
situations.''
 &HT;    There once was a time when Margaret used every chance to talk,
whether onstage or off, as a form of therapy. She would have told a
complete stranger _ especially a strange journalist _ her life's
troubles, perhaps in the hope that someone out there listening or
reading would pick up the pain through her words. These days,
however, there is a decidedly different air about Margaret.
 &HT;    For her fans, her stand-up still contains honesty true to
original form. But beyond the stage, Margaret is noticeably happy.
 &HT;    At 30, Margaret Cho is a little older, a little wiser. She wakes
up at around 5:00 a.m. and goes to sleep by 9:00 p.m., unless she
has a show to do. She owns a dog and is in a steady relationship.
She says she doesn't touch a lick of alcohol, nor any recreational
drugs for that matter, and has become a vegan _ which is a
vegetarian, only more so.
 &HT;    ``When I was 15 years old, I left home quite early. I was pretty
much on my own when I was about 16 years old and I was out of the
house and onto my career at that point,'' she says. ``So I was very
independent and I wanted to find out what my life was gonna be
about really soon. But then I realized that I kind of missed those
things (home and family).
 &HT;    ``Now I'm going back and reestablishing a closer relationship
with my family. Because I broke away so early I didn't get a lot of
things that I needed, that I realize now that I needed. I'm not
sure I can say exactly what those things are. They're like
emotional things ... structure, too. The need to be living with
people you know, who know you very well. And to be intimate with
others. And so I'm learning more about that now.''
 &HT;    Getting work has never been a problem for Margaret. She is very
in-demand as a stand-up, and manages to win enviable movie and TV
roles, the biggest of which came in John Woo's ``Face/Off'' with
Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. She's done three films that have
yet to be released, and a few upcoming TV appearances, including
``The Nanny,'' ``Dr. Katz'' and continuous airings of ``Pulp
Comics'' and her HBO Special on Comedy Central.
 &HT;    As for a future TV series, Margaret has been working on a few
concepts with fellow writer and performer Karen Kilgariff. During
February, the duo performed a live workshop at ``Uncabaret'' at
Luna Park in West Hollywood on Monday nights, and talks were
underway with a cable network to develop the show into a series.
But those talks have apparently stalled, she said. The problem? The
same as with ``All-American Girl'' _ not enough creative
independence.
 &HT;    Explains her manager, ``If you want to be on TV more than
anything, then you're going to be subjected to the same thing that
Margaret was subjected to for `All-American Girl.' They
(executives) will have the leverage, and if they tell you to do
something, you're going to have to do it. And if they tell you to
wear something, you're going to have to wear it.
 &HT;    ``It's more important to (her) to maintain integrity than to be
on a sitcom.''
 &HT;    This time around, Margaret is wise enough to know better.

BUFFALO RESIDENTS UNEASY AS A WEEK OF ABORTION PROTESTS IS ABOUT TO
BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ When Martha Hulings' 21-year-old daughter became
pregnant two years ago, her family went through a wrenching
discussion over whether she should have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   She was unmarried, after all, and still in college. But in the
end, she kept the child, named Alyah, a playful girl with dark
curly hair. And because of that experience, Martha Hulings stands
squarely in the anti-abortion camp.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Hulings heard that anti-abortion protesters were
coming to Buffalo this month, seven years after they drew national
attention with a series of large, unruly demonstrations at abortion
clinics here, she rolled her eyes and groaned. She said the
protesters should just stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody should mind their own business,'' said Ms. Hulings,
51, who was shopping with her granddaughters at the Broadway
Market, a 111-year-old working-class institution stocked with
ethnic bakeries and butcher shops. ``Them coming here again, I
think it's going to cause a lot of problems. We don't need the bad
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in this city of 328,000 share Ms. Hulings'
apprehension. Whatever their views on abortion, residents here are
voicing wariness, ambivalence or even dread as they brace for
Operation Save America, a weeklong anti-abortion rally that begins
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the concern is the memory of the raucous events of seven
years ago, when more than 1,000 protesters from around the country
descended on Buffalo, blocking entrances to clinics and doctors'
offices, and more than 600 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Spring of Life'' rally closed no clinics, but
generated intense media coverage in that election year, just as its
organizers, the group Operation Rescue, had planned. Operation
Rescue is also organizing this year's event.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, many people in this predominantly Roman Catholic
city feel especially uncomfortable with the timing of the event,
less than six months after the unsolved killing of Barnett A.
Slepian, a doctor who performed abortions and who was shot in his
home by a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, the specter of the rally has nudged to
the surface Buffalo's bruised hometown pride, a defensiveness of
sorts. In a city that has been down on its luck and dismissed as a
punch line of a place, good only for crippling blizzards and
controversial demonstrations, few residents seem ready for another
ugly, messy protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely city, with lovely people,'' said Jim Hall, 72, a
retired security officer who was strolling in Delaware Park. ``It's
a shame that those people are coming back,'' said Hall, who said he
supports abortion rights. ``They're going to put us in a bad light
again, like the last time. Why the same thing, over and over
again?''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders here on both sides of the abortion divide are
crossing their fingers that next week's demonstrations will be more
muted than the politically charged protests of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the laws governing abortion protests have
changed. Under a 1994 federal law, demonstrators must stay at least
15 feet from abortion clinics to allow physicians, patients and
others access.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric, too, has evolved. A new group of religious leaders
called the Buffalo Coalition for Common Ground, for instance, has
held workshops and programs in recent months for both sides to
discuss the underlying causes of abortion, said the Rev. G.
Stanford Bratton, the coalition's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of Operation Save America, meanwhile, say that their
agenda is broader this time. The focus will no longer be on
abortion alone, but on other issues that they say are weakening
America's moral fiber, like child pornography, teen-age sex and
school violence, said the Rev. Robert L. Behn of Last Call
Ministries in Cheektowaga, the event's primary local coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, demonstrators plan to congregate not just at the
two remaining abortion clinics in the Buffalo area, but also at
bookstores, schools and other places in Buffalo, Rochester and
Batavia.

 &HT;    Bush leads GOP field in money raised
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The George W. Bush presidential campaign money
machine, which has pulled in $7.6 million without hands-on help
from the candidate, already has collected money from all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Election Commission reports filed Thursday confirmed
what preliminary numbers had indicated: When it comes to piling up
cash, the other Republican contenders can only dream of being in
the Bush league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am humbled by the tremendous support from people across the
country for my exploratory effort,'' said Bush, who, though not
formally an announced candidate, is well beyond the exploratory
phase.
</P>
<P>
   The money from more than 23,000 contributors, combined with
equally impressive poll numbers, establishes Bush as the clear
early favorite for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush, quite frankly, is not only the pre-eminent
favorite among the establishment candidates, he is running away
from the field,'' said challenger Pat Buchanan, in Austin on
Thursday for a fund-raiser to back his effort to be the pre-eminent
anti-establishment candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan also lobbed this note of caution: ``Even the most
attractive rookies wind up with scar tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   When all the numbers are in, Bush's collections for the first
three months of 1999 could top the total raised by all his GOP
opponents. Former Vice President Dan Quayle was in second place
with $2.1 million raised, but he also spent $1.6 million. Elizabeth
Dole, the only GOP contender who shows up as a serious challenger
to Bush in early polls, raised $685,000.
</P>
<P>
   At this point in 1995, Bob Dole, the GOP frontrunner and
eventual 1996 nominee, had raised $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side this year, Vice President Al Gore raised
$8.9 million and spent $2 million in the quarter. Former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's only challenger, collected $4.3 million and spent
$1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was proud he raised big money without spending
much, at least by presidential campaign standards. The governor's
exploratory committee listed $855,000 in expenditures, with large
chunks going to professional fund-raisers in Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not picked up the phone and called individual givers,''
Bush said. ``I have to start going to fund-raisers eventually, but
so far we've been able to raise money without fundraisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only formal fund-raising event so far was a dinner this
month in Phoenix featuring ex-President George Bush, the governor's
father. The younger Bush's report showed a $5,000 expenditure for
the Ritz Carlton banquet room where the event was held.
</P>
<P>
   Texas provided the most money for Bush, just over $4 million,
for 54 percent of the total. California was second with $457,000.
Michigan, home base of Bush supporter and veteran GOP fund-raiser
Heinz C. Prechter, was third with $402,000. Florida, where Bush's
brother Jeb is governor, was fourth with $376,000.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, busy with the legislative session, will not hit
the fund-raising trail until June. Until then, the fund-raising
effort is in the hands of a team of ``pioneers,'' Bush backers who
have pledged to raise $100,000 apiece. Under federal election law,
individual contributions are limited to $1,000. Political action
committees can give up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's money gives him a great leap forward toward the
campaign's goal of raising the $45 million or more it would take to
be able to pass on federal matching funds and escape spending
limits.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate Steve Forbes, who funds his campaigns out of his
deep pockets, is not taking matching funds, which will let him pour
as much as he wants into TV ads in Iowa and New Hampshire. In his
Thursday report, Forbes, who spent $37.5 million of his money in
1996, reported that $694,000 of the $713,000 he raised in the
quarter came from his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP contenders, though reporting numbers far below Bush's,
issued releases Thursday trumpeting their success. Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who has received donations from all 50 states, said he
collected $4.3 million during the period, but that included $2
million transferred from an account amassed for his senatorial
races.
</P>
<P>
   A planned Thursday meeting between Bush and Buchanan was
canceled for scheduling reasons. The two men chatted briefly by
phone Wednesday night. Buchanan said he and Bush will differ
sharply on foreign policy issues, with the governor being pushed
toward an ``interventionist'' view of foreign policy by experts
brought in to get the governor up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush would be well advised to stay away from
the compulsive interventionists and the people who have to meddle
in every quarrel,'' said Buchanan, who opposes U.S. intervention in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bush, ``If he's for isolation and protectionism, we differ.
I'm for free and fair trade. And if he's for trying to wall off
Mexico from Texas, we differ, because I believe we ought to enforce
the border but I think we ought to welcome trade with Mexico.''

SAFIR SAYS POLICE NEED TO DEAL BETTER WITH PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hours before thousands of protesters massed in lower
Manhattan, Police Commissioner Howard Safir acknowledged Thursday
that his force needed to do a better job of reaching out to New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in front of mostly black and Hispanic high school
students, who received him warmly, the commissioner said, ``One of
the things we have not done as well in this Police Department is
how we relate to young people, and how we relate to people in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   At a daylong forum on the criminal justice system, Safir started
his address by telling the several hundred young people gathered at
the Bronx County Building about his roots in the borough. Then he
moved onto police issues, saying that the 50 percent drop in crime
over the last five years is ``the positive side,'' one that means
several thousand more people are alive today.
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued, ``The other issue is, at what cost. The other
issue is, is the process worth the product. I believe it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He then asked the students how many of them had been stopped by
police. A clear majority of hands went up. He also asked how many
thought the police had treated them nicely. Quite a few hands went
up. And, he asked, how many thought not? Quite a few more.
</P>
<P>
   What the department needs, the commissioner said, is ``to figure
out how we can do better at keeping crime down, but figuring out
ways of the police engaging and disengaging with you, and
de-escalating situations, when you haven't done anything. There's a
balance that really has to exist in which the police can do the job
of keeping all of us safe but at the same time do it in a manner
that doesn't harass you or violate your rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the killing of Amadou Diallo, he said, he has met with
about 60 community groups. He has not heard a lot of brutality
complaints, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear is the perception of a lack of respect on the part
of police officers when they're dealing with minority
communities,'' he said. Officers, he added, ``have to understand
that they're visitors to those communities, and they have to treat
those communities as if it were their own homes.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the department's new emphasis on courtesy and
its stepped-up recruiting efforts, and implored the students to
consider police work, calling it a ``very honorable profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The students clapped _ loud and hard. At the urging of Luis
Gonzalez, the administrative judge of the Bronx, they clapped
again, even louder and harder. Afterward, several students gave the
commissioner generally high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was raising some good issues,'' Jonathan Santana,
17, a student at Theodore Roosevelt High School, said. ``I think
it's a good thing he's trying to make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ricketts, 18, a senior at Samuel Gompers High School,
agreed, and showed Safir a degree of compassion that few adults
have accorded him lately. ``He's been going through a lot,''
Ricketts said. ``I feel for him.''

WARM WEATHER INSPIRES L.A. GARDENERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You notice one. Then a few more. Then you realize
they're everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   New leaves burst from once-skeletal branches. Trees and bushes
flaunt shades of glowing green that dispel the gray of winter.
Flowers in bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's warm air carried the scent of new growth.
</P>
<P>
   Spring is here, inciting people to join the riot of color and
fragrance, adding their own plants and flowers to the rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gorgeous. It inspires me. It makes me want to grow
things,'' said Barbara Winters of the Chatsworth community of
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting in the sun at Green Thumb Nursery in San Fernando
Valley's Canoga Park, she was loading her cart with long-stalked
Calla lilies to plant at home. She said she wanted ``something to
make me think of renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar said spring started nearly a month ago. But for
many folks in the San Fernando Valley region, it sure didn't feel
that way until the sun warmed their skin and chased away a late
cold snap. Though it isn't as dramatic as in snowbound northern
climes, the change still makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we live in California. It's perfect weather,''
said Dawn Coombs, 32, of the West Hills community. ``I love being
out in the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   She was loading flowers and succulents into her trunk for the
garden her son's fourth-grade class tends at his elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are bound to plant. They're plant-hungry,'' said Cal
Wright, a landscaper at Green Thumb Nursery who has been in the
business 50 years. ``A day like today _ oh, man, they're in here.
I'm sure this whole week we're going to be busy.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sun is what's bringing people out, then he's probably
right.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the San Fernando Valley are near 90, with lows
about 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rain has been wonderful,'' said Erik Nelson, 61, of
the Reseda community. ``But now that the sun is out, hopefully
things will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his roses are blooming, so he bought some small Heidi
cherry blossom plants to line the perimeter. And to accent his
vegetable garden, he got seeds for Persian cornflowers _ bright
purple blossoms with spindly petals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are landscaping their places and really getting into
it,'' Wright said. ``A lot of people are coming in for azaleas;
they're in bloom. Mums are in bloom. We sell roses like crazy.
These people buy roses like we're giving them away.''
</P>
<P>
   But all the blooming is making some people crazy for another
reason. Pity those folks with hay fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good year only for allergists,'' said Dr. Jacob
Offenberger, an allergy expert with offices in the Granada Hills
and Studio City communities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's El Nino rains created new growth, and this year's La
Nina brought warm weather that induced all those plants to bloom
ahead of schedule. Also, the lack of rain has kept the air thick
with pollen from grass and trees, creating what Offenberger called
``megadoses'' of the sneeze-inducing dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year everything germinated,'' he said. ``Last year we
said was the worst. This year we've seen more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   He advised against early-morning walks, because the pollen
settles down about 10 a.m. He also suggested seeking help from a
doctor if over-the-counter allergy remedies no longer give relief.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina has affected spring in another way _ the dry weather has
diminished Mother Nature's usual wildflower display.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly having the desert flowers we've had blooming
in the past,'' said Lana Longwell, an interpretation ranger at
Joshua Tree National Park.
</P>
<P>
   People used to flock to the park this time of year to view the
yellow bladder pod and creosote blooms, and the red blossoms of
ocotillo cactus. Now, she said, ``if they are coming, they're
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Native flowers are still plentiful in many locales, however. To
help find them, the Theodore Payne Foundation for California
Wildflowers and Native Plants in Sun Valley has its wildflower
hotline, (818) 768-3533. The red maids and blue larkspur in the
Santa Clarita woodlands are especially nice, as are the California
blackberry and purple nightshade in the Santa Monica Mountains, the
hotline said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are determined to have such beauty in their own back
yard, though.
</P>
<P>
   Patti Smith, 48, of the Encino community said the warm weather
fired her desire to return to her garden, and she and her husband
said they played hooky Wednesday to go to the nursery. They were
bringing home some delicate purple foxgloves and bright African
daisies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want lots of color, and maybe the feeling of getting my
hands a little dirty,'' Smith said. ``I've had the craving to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Debra Stark, 44, of Tarzana said the return of good weather
signaled she should complete her garden, ``which is a never-ending
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun, the sense of spring _ it's time to plant,'' she said.
``It seems like the rain is over. It just seemed like now is the
time.''

COWBOYS' LETT FAILED ANOTHER DRUG TEST, TEAM OFFICIAL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL draft has taken on a new urgency for the Dallas Cowboys.
When they stare at the long list of players to choose from
Saturday, they will probably circle the name of a defensive lineman
because Leon Lett, one of their best defensive tackles, may again
be removed from their roster by a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Lett, a ferocious inside force who has been a Pro Bowler but has
battled substance abuse during his eight-year career, has again
failed a drug test, according to a Cowboys official and a player on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a ban of at least one year under the NFL's drug
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Lett was suspended by the NFL for four games during the 1995
season, then missed the last three games of the 1996 season and the
first 13 games of 1997 because of failed drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' official said that after being informed about his
recent positive test for a banned substance, Lett filed an appeal
that is being reviewed by the NFL commissioner, Paul Tagliabue.
Lett may be challenging the validity of the test collection and
processing arrangements, something he did before the imposition of
his second ban.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small chance, the official said, that the appeal by
the 30-year-old Lett will be upheld. But the far stronger
possibility is that Lett will be suspended for at least all of the
1999 season, and he could be banned permanently if the appeal is
denied because he is in the third stage of the league's anti-drug
procedures, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what drug was involved.
</P>
<P>
   If Lett were suspended, he would be allowed to apply for
reinstatement no sooner than 60 days before the one-year
anniversary date of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas official said his emotions concerning Lett ranged
from ``sadness to anger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Leon was straightening out his life,'' the official
said. ``This is terrible news.''
</P>
<P>
   The league and clubs are forbidden from commenting about the
results of any drug test. Lett could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has been through each phase of the league's drug program,
which is widely considered to be one of the more comprehensive ones
in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has been in the third stage, in which a player is tested up
to 10 times a month for three years. According to the policy, any
positive test in this stage results in banishment for a minimum of
one year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lett's NFL career has been both fascinating and disturbing. He
arrived in the Cowboys' training camp in 1991 out of Emporia State
in Kansas, then was almost released because he lacked knowledge of
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   But after improving his technique and working extensively with
weights, Lett, a seventh-round pick, not only made the roster, but
also eventually started.
</P>
<P>
   A famously shy person off the field, Lett, a 6-foot-6-inch,
295-pounder, went on to dominate at his position. It is no
coincidence that Lett was growing into a premier player just as the
Cowboys made their Super Bowl runs under their owner, Jerry Jones,
and the former coach Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way Lett's life took some dramatic twists. In
Super Bowl XXVII in January 1993 against Buffalo, Lett was prancing
down the sideline and holding the football with one hand, about to
score a touchdown, when the ball was knocked from his hands. He
came under criticism for showing off and reported receiving racist
hate mail.
</P>
<P>
   The following Thanksgiving Day, in a game against Miami, his
overzealous pursuit of a blocked field goal resulted in the ball's
bouncing off his body and being recovered by the Dolphins, a play
that led to a Dallas defeat.
</P>
<P>
   When news media reports surfaced that Lett was going to be
suspended a second time, the Cowboys vehemently denied that their
star defensive player was facing any disciplinary action from the
league. Only after the NFL announced the test result did the
Cowboys admit there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When Lett was reinstated from that ban in December 1997, Jones
said Lett would have ``a great support system now that he's back
with his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his second suspension, Lett was the fifth Dallas
player in 13 months to violate the league's drug policy. Jones
initiated a campaign to clean up his team and hired the former
Cowboys star Calvin Hill to create a department geared solely to
improving player behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were already seriously considering drafting a
defensive lineman Saturday even before they learned of the
situation concerning Lett. Now, drafting a lineman may be
imperative for the Cowboys, who have the 22nd pick overall.
Defensive tackles Anthony McFarland from Louisiana State University
and Reggie McGrew from the University of Florida may still be
available when Dallas makes its selection. &QL;

COMMENTARY: DON'T EXPECT COMMISSIONER TO HEAR THE BELL TOLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The League for the Hard of Hearing called this week,
offering to test these old ears free on ``International Noise
Awareness Day,'' next Wednesday. Can't make it, sorry to say.
</P>
<P>
   But are substitutes allowed? If so, the league may want to try
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
   You keep reading how he is tone deaf, poor fellow. At least that
is what some politicians, editorial writers and police union
leaders are constantly saying about him. The phrase pops up over
and over: tone deaf. If it is true, maybe the commissioner can do
himself a favor and take the league up on its offer.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? ``Tone deaf'' is not to be taken literally
in this case?
</P>
<P>
   Come on. Are we really to believe that someone graced with
Safir's Dudley Do-Right somberness is oblivious _ tone deaf, if you
will _ to how New Yorkers of good will, not just the barking dogs
of the press, may sometimes interpret the ethics of his behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's to interpret?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the commissioner flew off to the Oscars on the tab of a
Revlon executive. Don't we all have generous friends?
</P>
<P>
   So he had eight on-duty detectives guard him and his family at
his daughter's wedding. Is it his fault that those who know zilch
about international terrorism cannot grasp his personal security
needs?
</P>
<P>
   So he announced a disputed plan to arm his officers with
hollow-point bullets even as the police fusillade that killed
Amadou Diallo was still reverberating across the city. Life does go
on, you know.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the police commissioner is supposed to be above
politics, he spoke last November at a ceremony that looked
suspiciously like a campaign event for Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, just
24 hours before Election Day. The First Amendment protects free
speech, right?
</P>
<P>
   So he agreed to a new police substation near Wall Street while
the local business improvement district made space available for a
museum on police history _ a project that happened to be championed
by Safir's wife, Carol. You never heard of coincidences?
</P>
<P>
   So he sent detectives to question a woman who had bumped into
Carol Safir's car. Can we rule out a security threat? Are we to
believe that this woman, Monica Nascimento, really had no idea that
New York's police commissioner and his family drive around in a car
carrying Virginia plates?
</P>
<P>
   So he brought a lawsuit against Ms. Nascimento that suggested,
it would seem falsely, that she was drunk or on drugs, and then he
said he knew nothing about it. Hey, do you know every legal jot and
tittle when you drag someone into court?
</P>
<P>
   How could anyone call this tone deaf?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Safir has become the butt of rude jokes, and he has left
more than a few New Yorkers wondering if his credibility has
suffered mortal damage. One person asking such questions, though
not calling for the commissioner's dismissal, is City Councilman
Sheldon Leffler, a Safir critic and chairman of the Council's
Public Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   All these things erode his overall effectiveness _ his capacity
to lead young officers and his capacity to create bridges to other
communities,'' Leffler said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if we accept that Safir just may have a tin ear, the
question becomes whether that is reason enough for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to dump him while crime is going down.
</P>
<P>
   True, crime was also declining under the previous commissioner,
William Bratton, and the mayor deemed him expendable. But Bratton
did terrible things, like hanging out at Elaine's and enjoying life
in the limelight. No one can fault Safir for that. He never looks
as if he is enjoying himself. And he stands so deeply in the
mayor's shadow that he need never worry about sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Giuliani is standing by his man with Tammy Wynette
solidness. ``The mayor has expressed to me 1,000 percent support,
both publicly and privately,'' the commissioner told The Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   He is old enough to remember someone else who got that kind of
backing: Sen. Thomas Eagleton, in the 1972 election. Eagleton had
``1,000 percent'' support from George McGovern _ until McGovern,
the Democratic presidential candidate, dropped him as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Safir has to worry at this point. He just has to keep
his ears sharp enough to sense what may be up if the mayor ever
says that he stands behind him 100 percent.

DAFFY DUCK GAINS STAMP IMMORTALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Philatelic purists gasped two years ago when the
U.S. Postal Service gave Warner Bros. icon Bugs Bunny his own
stamp, but the idea has become a major hit with customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bugs stamp, the first honoring an animated cartoon
character, was 1997's biggest seller at 378 million sold, including
12 percent of those saved in collections. The Sylvester and Tweety
stamp, the second in the ``Looney Tunes'' series, led last year
with 400 million printed and 9.5 percent saved.
</P>
<P>
   Daffy Duck's turn comes with a massive initial run of 427
million. The stamp, designed by Warner artist Ed Wleczyk, shows the
big-mouthed bird standing at a mailbox with letters bearing the
Bugs and Tweety stamps. One of the letters is addressed to Acme
Ponds, taken from the ``Acme'' name used as a running gag in
``Looney Tunes'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   First-day ceremonies have been scheduled today at Mann's Chinese
Theatre in Hollywood with ``Seventh Heaven'' star David Gallagher
and 200 fourth-graders wearing duck bills. Wal-Mart, the nation's
largest retailer, will hold a promotional event Saturday with a
collectible postmark and an array of Daffy Duck merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service has insisted its goal with the Bugs Bunny
stamp was to launch its ``Stampers'' campaign to entice young
people to take up the hobby, and it has since signed up 2 million
children for the program.
</P>
<P>
   But some collectors assert the service had sold out its
integrity in return for profits _ generated from stamps that were
saved rather than used _ and as a payback to Time Warner Inc., the
studio's parent and one of the nation's largest postal customers.
Opponents also argued that use of corporate properties represents
free advertising and violates Postal Service rules of not honoring
commercial enterprises and products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the `Looney Tunes' stamps are totally inappropriate,
and most of our readers back me up,'' said Michael Laurence,
publisher of Linn's Stamp News. ``These stamps are commercial
images that trivialize the idea that they should portray icons of
our history.''
</P>
<P>
   But other philatelists are unconcerned. ``I think the stamps are
wonderful as long as people are just buying them for enjoyment,''
said Israel Bick, executive director of the Van Nuys-based
International Stamp Collectors Society. ``This is strictly business
for the Postal Service. As far as I'm concerned, it's OK for them
to make money from stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   Bick cautioned that the Daffy stamps will probably be a poor
investment, particularly if they carry a postal cancellation. As
for whether the appearance of Bugs and Daffy will spur a new
generation of hobbyists, Bick said, ``We'll see in 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence said he doubted that the Looney Tunes stamps are making
children interested in collecting. ``It's an adult hobby that's
accessible to kids,'' he said. ``I would have run for the hills
when I was a child if stamps had carried cartoon characters on
them. I became interested in 1944 at the age of 5 partly because
the president (Franklin Roosevelt) and the king of England were
collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bugs stamp was such a hit, however, that the Postal Service
was forced to go to a second printing for the first time since
1993, when it ordered an additional 200 million Elvis Presley
stamps after an initial run of 300 million. Nearly one-fourth of
the Elvis stamps _ an astounding 124 million _ were never canceled,
generating $36 million in profit for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence decries the general trend toward placing entertainment
celebrities such as James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and movie monsters
on postage stamps, a practice that had been previously limited to
small nations looking for income. ``We shouldn't be imitating what
Antigua does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. does not received any proceeds from the stamps but
generates profits from gift items such as coffee mugs and framed
posters sold at its network of more than 180 studio stores. Some of
the Postal Service's 38,000 outlets will sell Daffy stationery
items.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service originally sought out Burbank-based Walt
Disney Co., but agency officials have said its requirement of
royalty-free use of Disney's characters precluded an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the year 2000, there's no specific plan as to which
character will be chosen. Up to nine other ``Looney Tunes''
characters _ including Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Pepe LePew, Marvin
the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn and the Singing Frog _ are reportedly
under consideration. But the most likely are probably Porky Pig or
a combo of the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote.

MAN WHO KILLED TEEN SEEKS RELEASE FROM STATE HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ Twenty years after he tortured, shot to death
and cannibalized a Poughkeepsie teen-ager, Albert Fentress
testified in court Thursday for the first time, hoping to persuade
a Suffolk County jury that he should be freed from a state
psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentioned the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress, 57, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in
the killing of Paul Masters, is contesting the latest in an
unbroken string of decisions by state judges to extend his
confinement. If the jury decides that he is no longer a danger to
himself or others, Fentress could be transferred to a halfway house
with little supervision.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour and a half on the witness stand Thursday, Fentress
calmly spoke at length of his daily routine at Pilgrim State
Psychiatric Hospital in Brentwood, his weekly meetings with
therapists, his occasional field trips to Manhattan or Montauk
Point. He said he awakens every morning at 5:30 to say a prayer,
and attends Roman Catholic Mass every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But he and his lawyer, Kim Darrow, carefully avoided any
discussion of the murder victim, a high school graduate who had
planned to leave for college in Albany when he wandered into the
back yard of Fentress, then a middle-school teacher, on a Sunday
evening in August 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors have been told repeatedly what happened that night: how,
with images from the movie ``Deliverance'' playing in his head,
Fentress lured Masters, 18, into his basement, tied him to a post
at gunpoint, sexually abused and mutilated him, shot him twice in
the head, and cooked and ate parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   But because Darrow did not ask Fentress about the crime, lawyers
for the state's Office of Mental Health and the Dutchess County
district attorney's office, who are seeking to extend Fentress'
confinement, were barred from bringing it up on cross-examination.
Though Fentress confessed to the crime the day it happened, he was
never required to testify in court, because prosecutors accepted
his insanity plea.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony Thursday was part of a proceeding under New York
criminal law that allows mental patients whose institutional
commitments are extended by a judge to ask for a rehearing before
another judge or for a jury trial. Jury trials are extremely rare,
however, and state officials say they can recall none before on
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   When Fentress took the stand Thursday morning, after seven days
of testimony by medical and psychiatric experts who offered
conflicting views of Fentress' mental fitness, the jury sat in rapt
attention. But he spent the next half-hour matter-of-factly
reciting the most mundane details of his existence. Only when
Darrow asked about his family did Fentress' voice become filled
with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, he broke into sobs as he was questioned about the deaths
of his parents, who lived in Suffolk County in Melville. In April
1995, he recalled, he visited his mother for the last time, just
days before she died of cancer. ``She sensed that there was not a
lot of time left,'' Fentress said haltingly, his voice breaking.
``She had said that one of the things that had been most on her
mind had been that she had never been able to speak with Mrs.
Masters,'' Paul's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Wiping tears from his eyes, Fentress continued, in his only
reference to his victim: ``We had all hoped we could speak with
Mrs. Masters at one point. Mrs. Masters had recently died, and Mom
was aware of it. God counts the tears of mothers _ it's a Jewish
saying. And I was aware that even though I had not been able to
speak to Mrs. Masters, that Mom and Mrs. Masters would be speaking
shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at his home in San Jose, Calif., Burt
Masters, the victim's father, said Thursday that his late wife
might indeed have welcomed an approach from Fentress' mother. But
he said his own feelings toward Fentress had not changed and
probably never would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me like Fentress has spent a lot more time on
litigation than on really recognizing and understanding his
problems and trying to do something about them,'' Masters said.
``I'd like to see more concern for Paul. It does seem to me like he
is tending to ignore that. He dwells on his own bad fortune, rather
than what somebody else might be suffering. I'd be very relieved if
the jury decides to retain Fentress.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Gatto, an assistant state attorney general who is
representing the Office of Mental Health, said that she had elected
not to challenge Fentress too aggressively on cross-examination
because he seemed well prepared for any attempts to rattle him.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop the lawyer from Dutchess County, Assistant
District Attorney Wayne Witherwax, from making a try after Fentress
explained that his brother, 41, and sister, 52, who also live in
Suffolk County, wanted to show their support, but that he had
persuaded them not to attend because of the media coverage of his
trial. His brother has two young children who could face teasing
from their classmates, he suggested. His sister is ill, he said,
and must avoid stress. ``I do not want the family, the children, to
suffer because of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an angry retort from Witherwax: ``You didn't think
of the stress and strain you'd cause your family when you killed
Paul Masters, did you?''

CAMPBELL RESIGNS AS CO-HEAD OF CITIGROUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services
concern, said Thursday that William I. Campbell, co-head of its
lucrative and far-flung consumer banking business, will retire
later this year to ``pursue other interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's duties will be absorbed by Robert I. Lipp, the
consumer banking unit's other co-head. Campbell, 54, had been
running Citicorp's consumer banking business before the company
merged with Travelers Group Inc. last year. Lipp, 60, had been
overseeing Travelers' consumer finance business prior to the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's retirement had been rumored inside Citigroup for
months and many employees there had believed he was going to leave
sooner. Citigroup said Campbell's retirement was completely
voluntary, and prepared statements from senior Citigroup officials
supported that view.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and management consultants have been critical of
high-level job-sharing arrangements at merged companies, citing
their inherent instability because of a lack of clear lines of
command. But Lipp and Campbell are said to have gotten along well.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's consumer business has not been marked by the kind of
strife that has created well-publicized, and continuing, turf wars
within the company's corporate business over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's co-chief executive, John S. Reed, recruited Campbell
to run the consumer business in 1996 and the choice was somewhat
controversial at the time. Campbell, the former chairman of the
Philip Morris &UR;  &LR; Cos. tobacco unit, Philip Morris USA, had no banking
experience _ although Reed has long favored hiring people who might
bring new thinking to the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Campbell's marketing experience, built over a
28-year career at Philip Morris, was an advantage in Reed's eyes.
Citicorp, and now Citigroup, has been attempting to establish a
global brand identity for the Citi name that would be as
recognizable as Levi's, Coke or Nike.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell also initiated a disastrous round of cigarette
price increases that severely eroded Philip Morris' market share
and resulted in the worst financial performance in that company's
history. In short, Campbell was regarded as an adept and affable
networker at Philip Morris, but a subpar operator. He retired from
Philip Morris in 1995, after which Reed, who sits on Philip Morris'
board, hired him as a consultant and then later as head of the
consumer unit.
</P>
<P>
   While Campbell brought an outsider's perspective to Citigroup,
he never entirely won the allegiance of some of the banking
veterans who worked for him. Citigroup employees said Reed would
like the pace of Citigroup's global branding effort to be
quickened.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Soifer, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, said:
``Campbell's role has always been to inject a consumer brand and
marketing expertise into Citi rather than his banking expertise.
Lipp, on the other hand, is a hands-on operational manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipp, who spent more than two decades with the old Chemical
Banking Corp. before joining Travelers and is very well regarded
within Citigroup, is seen as someone who can effectively harness
the potential of the company's global consumer business.
Citigroup's consumer business now accounts for two-thirds of the
company's profits and its steady performance and growth are crucial
to Citigroup's long-term well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Campbell brought an overarching vision to the consumer
business at Citibank that complemented the work that had already
been accomplished by his predecessors,'' said Diane Glossman, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. ``At this point, the value of the
skills that Campbell brought to the company have largely been
assimilated so that the strong execution skills possessed by Bob
Lipp are now of material importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, merging the two companies, even on the consumer side,
has been more of a challenge than anyone at Citigroup envisioned
when the company first announced the merger a year ago.
Opportunities to cross-sell several Citigroup products to customers
have not arisen as quickly as many anticipated and there is still a
lack of interest among some camps in the consumer operation about
cooperating with one another.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts do not think that these issues will stand in the
way of Citigroup's turning in steadily improving earnings. In fact,
Citigroup's stock has been on a tear lately. It closed at $71.0625
in trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, down 3.15
percent for the day, but well above its 52-week low of $28.50.

BOEING BREAKS THROUGH CLOUDS WITH SOLID EARNINGS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After the better part of two years of disappointing
financial results because of problems with its core commercial
airplane business, The Boeing Co. finally had good news Thursday
for shareholders, industry analysts and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced it earned $469 million, or 50 cents a
share in the first quarter, compared with just $50 million, or 5
cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   That easily beat Wall Street expectations that the Seattle
aerospace giant would earn about 42 cents a share for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 11 percent to $14.4 billion from $12.9 billion in the
first quarter of 1998. Boeing said its airplane factories are
healthier and commercial profit margins are up.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted by pushing Boeing's stock up about 10
percent for the second day in a row. The stock jumped $3.69 to
close at $41.69 on the New York Stock Exchange, still well below
the $54 stock price of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are more comfortable that perhaps the worst of
Boeing's problems are behind them,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's
Ragen MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference with reporters, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit
and Chief Financial Officer Debby Hopkins said the company has had
two good quarters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had solid and improving performance across the company,''
Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quarter is gratifying,'' he added. ``It indicates we have
made some real improvements. But we have a long way to go... We are
focused on creating value and we are making real progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said the company's three operating units _ commercial
airplanes, military aircraft and missiles, and space and
communications _ all did well in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two quarters now that show improving results,'' he
said. ``Everything I see says we are turning.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts welcome the better results, but cautioned that Boeing
must continue to show improvement, which will prove difficult
because the industry is in a down cycle after several boom years,
years that Boeing failed to capitalize on because of its problems
ramping up production to record levels. Now, that cycle is over,
mainly because of the bleak economic situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing expects to deliver a record 620 commercial planes
this year, it has said deliveries will fall to about 480 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Boeing said it has not changed its previous projection
that revenue will fall $9 billion in 2000 _ from $58 billion this
year to $49 billion. And commercial margins are expected to remain
flat or even drop slightly for the remainder of this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has certainly demonstrated that things are
starting to turn around,'' said analyst Jacobs. ``They are making
headway. But they still have a long road ahead of them. If they
continue to take steps in the right direction, they will eventually
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he is also encouraged that Boeing's delivery rate
may be flat in 2001. Many analysts had been expecting Boeing to
deliver fewer planes in 2001 than in 2000. Jacobs was projecting
deliveries would fall to about 426 in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Condit said Asia is improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big instigator of this cycle was Asia,'' Condit said. ``We
are beginning to see signs that the problem is certainly easing.
Korea is looking significantly better... I continue to worry about
Japan.'' The U.S. aircraft market is strong, Europe is stable and
South America is weak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said Boeing deliveries could be ``flat to potentially
higher in 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   That's very good news, Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a very positive sign that perhaps Asia will not
turn out to be as bad as we were projecting,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing gets about 60 percent of its revenue from Commercial
Airplanes, which had operating earnings of $382 million for the
first quarter. That was up from $23 million in the first quarter of
1998, when Boeing's production lines were struggling. Revenues from
commercial jets were $9.8 billion in the first quarter, up $1.7
billion from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said overtime, parts shortages and out-of-sequence work
in the airplane factories are all down to ``reasonable levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Employment reduction is slightly ahead of schedule, he said.
Boeing is eliminating more than 50,000 jobs from its peak of
238,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said employment at the end of the first quarter was about
108,000, down from 118,000 at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He also said a production rate increase of the next generation
737 model in Renton, Wash., went better than expected. Boeing is
now producing 24 of the jets a month. But those planes don't make
as much money for the company as other models, and that could begin
to hurt margins.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's profit margin in its core commercial business is the
key to the company's continued good performance, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, Boeing made zero profit on the 559 planes it
delivered. But margins were far better at the end of last year than
at the beginning. In the fourth quarter, Boeing's commercial
business made 1.9 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   That jumped to 3.9 percent in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hopkins told reporters that commercial margins are projected
to fall slightly for the rest of 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   She said that is because of the mix of planes delivered to
customers. A higher percentage of next generation 737s, Boeing's
least profitable plane, will be in the delivery mix, with fewer
747s. Boeing is cutting production of the 747, which is the
company's most profitable plane.
</P>
<P>
   But Condit said Boeing's margins could rise depending on how
well the company does in improving production efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity is on the cost side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Margins on the company's defense and space business continue to
be strong. Boeing's military aircraft and missiles segment had
operating revenue of $3 billion for the first quarter of 1999,
which was flat with the year-earlier period. Its space and
communications segment posted operating revenue of $1.5 billion.
That was about $300 million less than the first quarter last year,
due partly to fewer launches for its Delta II rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said the military aircraft and missiles division got a
boost in the quarter from what she called a ``favorable contract
settlement.'' The settlement added about 3 cents a share to
Boeing's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to say what the settlement involved.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also continues to make good progress in identifying
businesses that don't add value to the company, she and Condit
said. The company has said if it can't fix programs that don't make
money for Boeing, or are not a good fit, they will be shut down or
sold off.

ONLINE SELLER DVD EXPRESS FILES FOR $57.5 MILLION IPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Online retailer DVD Express Inc. has filed for a
$57.5 million initial public offering, reflecting the surging
markets for both Internet commerce and the DVD format.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood-based DVD Express noted in this week's filing that it
has grown rapidly since it launched two years ago with two
full-time employees. Its fourth-quarter revenues were $8.9 million
_ more than 10 times sales in the 1997 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which now has 100 employees, would trade on the
Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DVDS if its IPO is successful. But
the company did not disclose in its initial filing how much of the
company will be sold in the IPO, the price of each share or the
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Express announced in early January that it had sold its
millionth disc through its dvdexpress.com site and predicted it
would hit the 2 million mark in the second quarter. Founder and
President Michael DuBelko, who owns 84.2 percent of the company
according to the filing, could not comment because of Securities
and Exchange Commission rules governing IPOs, but had said in
January that DVD Express was considering an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now positioned for extraordinary growth as DVD
completely replaces VHS as the preferred format for premium home
entertainment,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The filing with the SEC disclosed that proceeds will be used to
make marketing payments to America Online, repay bank debt and
expand infrastructure, sales and marketing along with the
ubiquitous ``general corporate purposes.'' AOL, which owns 7.2
percent of DVD Express, agreed in September to a three-year
marketing alliance with $15 million in payments plus an undisclosed
share of DVD Express revenues once certain thresholds are met.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Express also has signed marketing deals with Infoseek, which
operates the Go Network, and search specialist Alta Vista. TV
producer Stephen J. Cannell has a seat on the 11-member board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The offering will be underwritten by ING Barings and Friedman
Billings Ramsey.!dlim!

JUDGE FINES PILOTS' UNION AN UNPRECEDENTED $46 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change $58 million to $50.1 million in 13th graf. Rewrites
first 7 grafs for better organization.) (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the pilots' union at American Airlines
to pay the carrier nearly $46 million Thursday for defying his
order to return to work in February after hundreds of pilots called
in sick in a dispute that forced the airline to cancel thousands of
flights. The assessment was greater than the net assets of the
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my oath requires me to do makes me sick to my stomach
because a lot of decent men and woman pilots are going to be hurt
by this,'' Judge Joe Kendall of the U.S. District Court in Dallas
said as he delivered his decision, which amounted to one of the
largest assessments ever made against a union.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, the independent union that
represents American's 9,200 pilots, can appeal the decision.
Richard Lavoy, its president, who was also held personally liable
in the case, did not say whether the union would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed in the judge's decision,'' he
said outside the courtroom. ``We will do what we have to do to
protect our members. We will examine all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the judgment would effectively wipe out the union,
which has an estimated $38 million in assets, Lavoy said, ``We are
a long, long way from that.'' It was not clear where the union
would get the remainder of the $46 million if the decision stood.
</P>
<P>
   The award to American is the latest chapter in a bitter dispute
that crippled the country's second-largest airline this winter. The
sickout, which began on Feb. 6 and lasted about 10 days, resulted
in the cancellation of more than 6,600 flights and inconvenienced
more than 600,000 passengers, including many who were traveling
over the busy Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on the purchase in December of Reno Air, a
small airline that flies mostly in the West, by AMR Corp., the
parent of American. AMR is worth $12.1 billion. The pilots said
that the purchase violated their contract and worried that AMR
would use Reno as a way to transfer American flying to lower-paid
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it had no intention of creating an ``airline
within an airline'' and promised that it would merge Reno into the
American network, though it said that the process would take as
long as 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But for many American pilots the Reno purchase was the last
straw after years of bitter relations with management. Union
leaders maintain that the sickout was a spontaneous action that
spread quickly after a few dozen pilots called in sick in protest.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company said that it was orchestrated by the union
leadership. ``We don't take any pleasure in all this,'' Chris
Chiames, an AMR spokesman, said Thursday. ``We have been searching
for labor peace with all of our labor groups in recent years. It is
a shame that the APA is dominated by a leadership that is only
interested in confrontation and that they led their members into an
illegal job action.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides held several meetings with a federal mediator over
the last month to try to resolve the dispute. They have agreed not
to comment on those talks.
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall issued a temporary restraining order on Feb. 10 at
the company's request, the number of pilots on the sick list rose
even higher. The next day, Kendall found the union, Lavoy and Brian
Mayhew, the union's vice president, in contempt and ordered the
union to place $10 million in escrow. LaVoy placed $10,000 with the
court and Mayhew remitted $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who was appointed by President George Bush in 1992,
ordered a hearing, which began on Monday and concluded Thursday, to
determine the size of the damages that the union should pay.
American said that the entire 10-day sickout cost it between $200
million and $225 million. But it said that the cost of the
disruption after the judge ordered the pilots back to work amounted
to $50.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the pilots called two expert witnesses who argued
that only 233 pilots called in sick after the contempt citation and
estimated that the damage to American was between $1.4 million and
$4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall sided with American and grew short with the union's
witnesses. ``American Airlines is not going to want to go to the
public and the stockholders and talk about taking that kind of hit
without it being true,'' he said at one point, referring to the
airline's damage estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he had strongly criticized the union leadership for
badly serving its members.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he determined the $46 million assessment by
taking American's $50.1 million estimate and discounting it 6
percent, which was the airline's estimate of its percentage of
error. He then deducted an additional 5 percent for travelers who
simply chose not to buy American tickets during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Juravich, director of the Labor Center at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, said the amount was among the largest
ever levied against an American union. ``This fine is really
unprecedented in American labor history and represents a level of
accountability for unions that's never really been applied,'' he
said. A $52 million fine imposed against the United Mineworkers
Union in connection with a coal strike was vacated by the Supreme
Court in its 1993-94 term, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the damages were announced, many pilots were worried
that the judge might try to wipe out the union. Some pilots have
been openly discussing joining the Air Line Pilots Association, a
much larger national union that is a member of the AFL-CIO and has
more power in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, pilots said that if the company tried to destroy
the union, it would make the next round of contract negotiations
with the airline that much more difficult.

RAMS TRADE FOR FAULK  
 MOVE AFFECTS CARDS IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Suddenly, the St. Louis Rams could determine the fate
of the Cardinals in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, picking sixth, no longer are in the market for a
running back after acquiring Marshall Faulk from Indianapolis on
Thursday. Instead, they may draft North Carolina State wide
receiver Torry Holt, one of two receivers the Cardinals have been
interested in taking with the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams may pass on Holt for Arizona cornerback Chris
McAlister, whose stock is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   With Faulk gone, the Colts are expected to use the fourth pick
on Texas running back Ricky Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   After making the trade for Faulk, Rams officials said they will
probably choose Holt or McAlister, figuring Georgia cornerback
Champ Bailey won't be available. Bailey, the highest-rated
defensive player on most teams' draft boards, is expected to be
taken by Washington as the fifth pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams may take McAlister over Holt because they have spent
most of the off-season upgrading their offense and have done little
to help the defense. They added quarterback Trent Green, formerly
of Washington, and guard Adam Timmerman, formerly of Green Bay,
through free agency and picked up Faulk in Thursday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rams Coach Dick Vermeil acknowledged Thursday that he's a big
fan of McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I coached his dad (James) at UCLA,'' Vermeil said. ``So, in
essence, I knew (Chris) before he was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chris McAlister is more physical, a stronger type of
guy. Champ Bailey is a more finesse type guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Charley Armey, vice president of player personnel for the Rams,
said McAlister and Bailey are rated almost even on their draft
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as close as it comes, but you know what's happening in
the NFL with big receivers. That's why everybody is hot on
McAlister. He can go up with those guys and win the battle.'''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis will consider taking Holt to replace wide receiver
Eddie Kennison in the lineup. They traded Kennison to New Orleans
for a second-round pick in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams also could trade out of the No. 6 spot. They
received calls Thursday afternoon from Miami and New England, both
wanting to move up to get University of Miami running back Edgerrin
James, who many thought would be the Rams' pick before the Faulk
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have the best chance of making a deal because they
have two first-round picks, Nos. 20 and 28. New England is
desperate for a running back because of the loss of rookie starter
Robert Edwards, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in a beach
football game at the Pro Bowl in January.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams keep the sixth pick overall, James could fall to the
Cardinals, who never thought they had a shot at getting him. The
Cardinals also have another first-round pick, No. 21 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Running back is not a position of need for the Cardinals, who
return their top three backs _ Adrian Murrell, Mario Bates and
Michael Pittman. But Murrell and Bates will be in the last year of
their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin said previously that in most drafts, he
wouldn't pass up a great running-back prospect regardless of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to think long and hard about him if he were there,''
one Cardinals official said. ``He might be too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   James, 6-foot, 216 pounds, is considered just a notch below
Williams. He's only 20 years old and is coming off a spectacular
junior season. He gained 1,416 yards, including 299 in the season
finale against UCLA. He also rushed for 17 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals take James, they likely would try to trade
Murrell, who has value because of three consecutive 1,000-yard
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also could pass on James for Holt, Ohio State wide
receiver David Boston or Brigham Young offensive tackle John Tait,
the Tempe McClintock product.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts' trade of Faulk ends the chances of New Orleans Coach
Mike Ditka trading up to get Williams. The Saints offered all of
this year's draft and two high picks next year to any of the teams
picking in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be difficult now because the first three teams
are focused on quarterbacks, which means Ricky (Williams) falls to
Indy at No. 4,'' Saints General Manager Bill Kuharich said.
</P>
<P>
   In getting Faulk, the Rams gave up two draft picks _ this year's
second- and fifth-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, 26, the best all-purpose back in the league, rushed for
1,319 yards, caught 86 passes and scored 10 touchdowns last year.
He was expendable because he wanted to renegotiate his contract for
as much as $6 million a year. &QL;

THOUSANDS MOURN SLAIN OFFICER AS DOUBTS PERSIST ABOUT SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio) (rk)

<P>
   ORANGE, N.J. _ Thousands of police officers from as near as
Little Ferry and as far as Washington, as well as hundreds of
civilians, lined the edge of a park outside St. Matthew A.M.E.
Church here Thursday for the funeral of Joyce Anne Carnegie, the
Orange police officer who was fatally shot last week in what the
police said was an encounter with a robbery suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The fluid gospel tones of ``If I Can Help Somebody'' gave way to
the dirgelike, staccato tattoo of a chorus of snare drums from a
massed Emerald Society band as the flag-draped coffin of the
38-year-old policewoman was carried from the church.
</P>
<P>
   One officer, gently cradling his fallen comrade's police cap,
went before the pallbearers, who were in turn followed by Joseph
Lane, Ms. Carnegie's partner, and then by a long procession of
family members and friends led by her parents, Ernestine and
Charles Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, during a service before more than 400 people packed
into the church and over a public address system that blared the
words to those arrayed outside, Ms. Carnegie was eulogized as an
officer who did not lose her sense of humor upon putting on the
uniform and who remained ``engaged with people'' rather than simply
enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``She done good, this little girl who grew up in this town to be
a police officer,'' said the Rev. Reginald Jackson, in what became
a refrain throughout his eulogy. ``She has caused the state of New
Jersey to stand still today. She did what she could.''
</P>
<P>
   A suspect, Terrance Everett, 24, of East Orange, has been
charged in her killing, but the investigation has been clouded by a
swirl of whispered doubts among some investigators that he is the
right man.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a spokesman for Patricia Hurt, the Essex County
prosecutor, whose office is heading the investigation, confirmed
that Ms. Hurt's chief deputy, Patrick Toscano, had resigned
Wednesday but denied reports that it was the result of disagreement
over the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Toscano did not return phone calls seeking comment. He is the
third top official to resign from the prosecutor's office's in the
last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's funeral, according to the Orange deputy fire chief,
Michael Romano, drew more than 5,000 police officers and civilians,
and more than 1,400 vehicles joined the procession to the Hollywood
Park Cemetery in Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carnegie, the third of four children, was born in Newark and
moved to Orange with her family when she was 8. She attended two
years of college in Ohio before returning to the city, where she
had at a variety of jobs before joining the Police Department in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Thursday was a day to celebrate the short life and career
of an officer who seemed to have touched many people in this town
of 29,000, it was also a day for many officers gathered here to
feel a bit of respite from the turmoil of recent months as some
police departments have faced accusations of brutality and racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has put those other things aside, and we are having
a moment of peace,'' said Sgt. Marshall Brown, a state trooper, as
he looked out over the sea of officers and civilians, noting the
mix of black and white, and men and women. ``Now if it could just
stay like that.''

CHAPMAN SUF FERING THROUGH CAREER-WORST SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After a light practice Thursday, Suns guard Jason Kidd
and the club's strength and conditioning coach, Robin Pound, were
engaged in a friendly shooting contest, and Rex Chapman was
complaining about being excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shooting 33 percent, and I can't even get in their
shooting game,'' Chapman lamented.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it says something about the Suns' 31-year-old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman is suffering through _ by far _ the worst shooting
season in his 11-year NBA career. His previous worst was 1994-95
when he shot 39.8 percent for Washington in a season cut to 45
games by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A career 35-percent three-point shooter, Chapman is hitting 31.9
percent from behind the arc to go with his 33.0 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he still is feared as a shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are still honoring him,'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge said.
``They're still defending him the same way they always have,
whether he's shooting 30 percent or 50 percent, whether he's 0 for
10 or 10 for 10.''
</P>
<P>
   But the continuing respect from the opposition hasn't done much
to relieve the frustration of a season that has tested Chapman's
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would still be nice to hit some shots,'' he said. ``It's a
challenge I'm having to accept. I go out there every night and hope
I'll do well. There isn't much choice.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't how Chapman envisioned the season unfolding. After
playing the last two seasons for the league minimum, with a
20-percent raise the second year, and leading the club in scoring
last season, Chapman signed a five-year deal at the start of the
season that begins at the league average of about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   He was at peace, knowing this is where he wants to finish his
career. He has been a natural fit with Jason Kidd in the backcourt,
benefitting from Kidd's ability to break down defenses and create
open shots for Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it makes us a different team when I'm making
shots,'' Chapman said. ``It always helps to hit them. It helps your
confidence. And it helps in close ballgames when we can not only
run things through me, but we can run things for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Chapman on the floor, defenses pack in against the Suns
making it difficult for Kidd to get to the basket, for the club's
big men to get room in the low post and for others to slash to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rex can score in a lot of different ways,'' Ainge said. ``He
demands a lot of attention whenever he's on the court, even if he's
not hitting a lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Chapman has gone through stretches of games where his
shot seemed to be returning, he has slipped back into the
season-long slump each time. Part of his struggles can be
attributed to his health.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman started the season with a hamstring strain. He suffered
a bruised calf later, which caused him to compensate in how he
jumped and landed. He also has a damaged nerve in his right foot
that caused pain in his big toe. Maybe most important, he has
developed tendinitis in his left knee _ his take-off leg _ that he
suspects resulted from compensating for the calf or toe.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Chapman is a jump-shooter who depends a great deal
on the lift he gets from his legs. Some long-range shooters use
more of a set shot, which isn't effected by leg injuries. Chapman's
leg problems clearly have affected his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever experienced thinking about
shooting,'' Chapman said. ``I've caught myself thinking about it
before games, after games, going through things in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an easy game to play when things are going well, and
you realize sometimes you take things for granted when they go
poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've caught myself at times in warm-ups thinking, `Do I want
to land on my left leg, where my knee hurts, or do I land on this
(right) one, which isn't any better because of my foot.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about landing on one foot or the other. I don't
think about it in games, but more than likely I'm doing the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns finally placed Chapman on the injured list for five
games because of the right foot and toe, and to rest the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that if you can be out there, put a wrap
on it and I'll play,'' Chapman said. ``But I do feel a lot
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Will his shot recover, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he looks a lot better,'' said Ainge, who saw Chapman
pressing to shoot his way out of the slump earlier in the season.
``He's playing really well even if he isn't hitting a lot of shots.
I've told him he doesn't have to feel like he's got to do it every
night. But if the shots are there, take 'em.'' &QL;

ARIZONA PLAYERS SHOW THEIR SKILLS AT DESERT CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - One thing is certain about this year's crop of
the state's college basketball seniors: Arizona's Jason Terry will
be drafted in June.
</P>
<P>
   What remains unknown is the draft status of Arizona State's
Bobby Lazor and Mike Batiste, Arizona's A.J. Bramlett and Northern
Arizona's Casey Frank. And that's why they're at this week's Nike
Desert Classic, and Terry is not.
</P>
<P>
   They will have a chance to prove they belong this weekend in
front of NBA general managers and scouts at ASU's Wells Fargo
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Terry, who was named Pac-10 Player of the Year, is a definite
first-round pick and most likely a lottery pick (Nos. 1-13) on June
30. But the same security isn't afforded to Batiste, Lazor,
Bramlett and Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Many NBA general managers and scouts speak in generalities at a
tournament like this, not wanting to tip their hand. ``They've got
a chance'' are things we already know, but the consensus is that it
still could be too early to predict where any player will go in the
draft, let alone this state's contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very early in this process of what appears to be a very
wide-open year,'' says Boston Celtics General Manager Chris
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a good outing at the Classic can help a player's stock
rise tremendously. Just ask Michael Dickerson, the former UA star.
Dickerson was regarded as the Classic's best player last year and
was rewarded by being taken with the 14th pick overall by the
Houston Rockets, for whom he now starts.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor and Batiste, both All Pac-10 selections, have farther to
go than Dickerson, but they might be intriguing choices for some.
For one, shooting seems to be at a premium among this year's draft
crop, according to Dick Van Arsdale, director of player personnel
for the Suns. And both the 6-foot-9, 235-pound Lazor and the 6-8,
230-pound Batiste have sweet shots for their size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazor's probably one of the better shooters out here,'' Van
Arsdale said. ``It's hard to find good shooters. Guys can't shoot
off the dribble. Their techniques aren't as good.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main concerns for Batiste and Lazor will be what
position they can play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a legitimate big man at ASU often left Batiste
and Lazor to handle the role of center. They don't have the
prototypical size to play inside in the NBA, so it becomes a
question of whether they have the quickness to play on the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Batiste and Lazor say they are concentrating on this week
and not how they may fit on the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought about it,'' Lazor said. ``I'm just
getting ready to play as well as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like my NCAA Tournament, my Final Four, my national
championship game,'' Batiste said. ``It doesn't matter if I score
two points or four points. As long as I play well, that's my goal.
Then I can walk out of here with a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The last ASU player to be drafted was Ron Riley in the second
round of 1996. A year earlier, Mario Bennett was a first-round pick
of the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of NBA products from UA, however. And
that could work in Bramlett's favor. He improved his game in each
of his four years at UA, but scouts say that needs to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of his future depends on how well he continues
to develop,'' said Allen Bristow, former Charlotte Hornets head
coach who is coaching Bramlett on the Pacific squad this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. had a quality senior year and is athletic,'' Wallace
said. `It's just going to be a question with him over time, just
really how much strength can he add to his frame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a good shot,'' said the 6-10, 262-pound
Bramlett, who played center at UA but will have to play forward at
the next level. ``I think any team would be happy to have me on
their team. I'll do anything to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 6-9, 240, will also have to prove he can play away from
the basket after earning All-Big Sky honors as a center for NAU. He
is the proverbial long shot, but it doesn't bug him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only good things can happen from here on out,'' Frank said.
``There's no pressure whatsoever. Nobody's expecting anything from
me, except me.'' &QL;

 JONES CHANGES AD DRESS, RACING TEAM, ENGINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Hello, Scottsdale. Goodbye, rat race.
</P>
<P>
   Weary from too many years spent living in the shadows of
Tinseltown, P.J. Jones boldly packed a suitcase two years ago and
moved away from the only home he'd known.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 29, waved bye-bye to his Southern California roots and
moved to north Scottsdale, where some of the laid-back neighbors
included racing peers Arie Luyendyk, Mark Blundell, and until a
couple of weeks ago, J.J. Lehto, who has returned home to his
native Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoyed coming (to the Valley),'' Jones said. ``I
have a lot of friends here, and I think it's a better place to live
than California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a change I just felt I had to make.''
</P>
<P>
   One major change has led to another.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly six years in the Dan Gurney All American Racers
stable, several of which were spent developing the new Toyota V-8
engine, Jones decided it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones moved again, this time to Patrick Racing, where he
replaced Scott Pruett this season and joined teammate Adrian
Fernandez, who lives in Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was hired by Pat Patrick last season and has won three
races, including last Sunday's triumph in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones believes the Toyota power plant eventually will
put a driver into victory lane, he also believes he can reach the
winner's circle faster with Patrick, whose chassis-engine
combination consists of a stronger Reynard/Ford-Cosworth package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Toyota engine is getting better and better,'' said Jones,
the eldest son of 1963 Indianapolis 500 champion Parnelli Jones.
``The only way (Toyota) won't be successful is if it jumps out of
racing, and I don't see that happening. Honda has been kicking its
butt for the last four or five years, so I don't think Toyota can
afford to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me, I don't know what that time frame is. Toyota will
win, but when? I just needed to get into something that was proven
to be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former sports-car star in the defunct International
Motor Sports Association circuit, still hasn't won in two CART
races this season, which continues Sunday with the Toyota Grand
Prix of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't come close, really.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones believes it could happen soon, something he didn't
believe last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win,'' Jones said. ``I want to win real bad. But
it's kind of hard to show up on Sundays when you know you're in a
development program and the engine's still not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of shakes your confidence a little bit. You start
wondering if it's you and not the car. We had some good runs in
some places, but when you're not running well and the engine keeps
breaking, well, it's a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still don't have any regrets about being with (Gurney)
all those years. He was a real shot in the arm for my career. The
only thing I regret is we didn't develop the engine sooner. If we
had, maybe I'd still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurney also feels no animosity toward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an ex-driver, I understand where (Jones) was coming from,''
Gurney said. ``You have to sort of make the moves that are best for
you. P.J. has to find out if he's as good as he thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I think he's got great talent. So I don't begrudge him
leaving us. Not at all. Actually, all of us here are rooting for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he drove two seasons for Gurney on the IMSA circuit,
finishing second in 1993 to teammate Juan Manuel Fangio II for the
driving championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jones began CART testing for Gurney's Toyota package the next
season, then joined the CART series midway through the 1996 season.
After numerous wins in other racing divisions in previous years,
Jones' best CART finishing was ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't disturb the Patrick hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Jones) got all the credentials,'' said Patrick General
Manager Jim McGee said, whose drivers are returning to the Swift
chassis for this weekend's race. ``He drives the car plenty hard.
(Gurney) didn't keep him for a long time without a reason. He saw
some talent there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do, too.''

JEFFERSON HAS STRESS FRACTURE  
 OUTLOOK FOR UA FORWARD `ABSOLUTELY FINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Jefferson, who started 26 games as a freshman for
Arizona's basketball team, complained of increasing pain in his
left foot during off-season workouts and was found to have a stress
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 Jefferson, a forward from Phoenix Moon Valley High,
began to experience pain in his foot late in the season that
continued to worsen. A post-season examination revealed the
fracture in the fourth metatarsal. UA medical personnel said the
fracture might have occured as far back as Jefferson's high school
playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Wildcats medical personnel said the injury is not as serious as
the stress fracture that sidelined forward Luke Walton the entire
season and caused him to be redshirted.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who has been on crutches, is to have a walking cast
placed on the foot this week. He will wear it for one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it is anything serious, this is more a
precautionary thing,'' said Jim Rosborough, UA associate head
coach. ``It certainly wasn't anything that hindered him at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prognosis from our medical people is that he will be
absolutely fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is expected to do weight-training in May for a couple
of weeks before returning to the court for off-season workouts.
Jefferson is not expected to have his playing status affected next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona in recent weeks has become interested in prep
All-American Jason Kapono, a 6-foot-7 forward from Lakewood
(Calif.) Artesia High, who plays Jefferson's position. Coach Lute
Olson made an in-home visit to Kapono's family earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats also have Walton, junior Justin Wessel and
sophomore Rick Anderson available to play wing forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was named to the All-Pac-10 freshman team after
averaging 11.3 points, 4.8 rebounds and 2.9 assists last season.

CHEFS CHARGED WITH STEALING ACTOR'S BASEBALL CARDS FROM
RESTAURANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.) (rk) 
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two chefs from the Official All-Star Cafe were among
four people charged in federal court Thursday with pilfering rare
baseball cards from the collection of actor Charlie Sheen that were
on display at the Times Square restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts, which occurred during a two-month period last year,
involved removing the valuable cards from their plexiglass display
cases and substituting color photocopies for the originals, said
James Margolin, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The first card stolen is among the most valued artifacts of
baseball memorabilia: a card printed around 1910 that shows Honus
Wagner, a legendary shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates and one of
the first players inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame. A
similar card sold at auction at Christie's in 1996 for $640,500.
</P>
<P>
   Also stolen, the authorities said, was a baseball card of Sherry
Magee, an outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies starting around
1904, and an uncut sheet of 25 cards that included a scarce 1933
card of Napoleon Lajoie, a Hall of Fame second baseman for the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sheen, Jeff Ballard, said that the actor would
remove his memorabilia collections, worth millions of dollars, from
the All Star Cafe in New York and the one in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen issued a statement saying that he was pleased that the FBI
and the New York City police had succeeded in recovering most of
the cards, but that he regretted they had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is an investor in the Planet Hollywood International
restaurant chain, which owns the Official All-Star Cafe. Matt
Hallman, a spokesman for the company, would not comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The four men accused of the thefts appeared before magistrate
Judge Andrew J. Peck in federal court Thursday on charges of
selling stolen property and conspiring to take stolen property
across state lines. The crimes carry sentences of up to five years
in jail and $250,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Garland, 34, the executive chef, and his nephew, Benjamin
Ramos, 21, pleaded not guilty and were released on their own
recognizance. Their lawyers would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, 33, an assistant chef, did not plead and was
released on his own recognizance. Gregory Corden, 36, the
restaurant's maintenance manager, did not plead and was released on
$75,000 bail. Lawyers for Hess and Corden did not return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said all the cards were recovered
except two that were thrown away.

2 POINT GUARDS MULL TRANSFER TO ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The starting point guards for the Northwestern
and Old Dominion women's teams are considering transferring to
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Leonard, whose sister Brett is an ASU incoming freshman,
has asked for but not yet received her release from Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's mother said Thursday the decision as to whether Dana
will leave is ``up in the air'' and that a suburban Chicago
newspaper report of the sisters reuniting at ASU was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Levens is leaving Old Dominion and is considering ASU,
her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   With Natalie Tucker having two more years of eligibility and the
addition of freshman recruits Brett Leonard and Sarah Allen, ASU
probably has room for only one more guard. ASU is already adding
Colorado transfer Nikki Swagger, a post player, and is getting a
visit next weekend from Swagger's former Colorado teammate, Melody
Johnson. Johnson also plays the post and has announced her
intention of leaving Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-6 Leonard started all but one game and averaged 12
points and 4.2 assists for Northwestern (12-16), whose coach, Don
Perrelli, retired after 23 collegiate seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-9 Levens, from Belvidere, Ill., started 23 games for Old
Dominion (28-4), which reached the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 for a
fourth consecutive year. She averaged 6.7 points and 2.5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Both would have two years of eligibility remaining after sitting
out the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was a ``Parade'' All-America fourth-team member out of
Glenbrook South (Ill.) High School and rated among the top 25
players in the country in 1997. Her sister was rated as a top-100
senior by ``Blue Star Report'' before tearing the anterior cruciate
ligament in her left knee during Glenbrook South's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ASU returns four starters but will lose seniors Rachel Holt
(center), Kristine Sand (forward) and Kitch Kitchen (guard) after
the 1999-2000 season. &QL;

ORIOLES FOIL CLEMENS' ATTEMPT TO TIE RECORD FOR CONSECUTIVE
VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Mussina and Cal Ripken, who have 25 years of
major league experience between them, tried to help another veteran
put his name in the record books at Yankee Stadium on Thursday
night. But Roger Clemens would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Yankees' seven-run spree against Mussina, who was
hurt by Ripken's shoddy defensive play, in the first four innings,
Clemens was unable to gain his American League-record tying 17th
consecutive victory because he gave up seven runs to the Baltimore
Orioles in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' team was unable to gain its eighth straight victory as
the Orioles broke a 7-7 tie with two runs off Mariano Rivera in the
ninth inning to win by 9-7. That left Clemens with no decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was battered from start to finish, although the finish
for him came in the fourth inning. And that was only because Don
Zimmer, the interim manager, was being kind to the veteran pitcher,
or engaging in wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who scored five runs in the first three innings,
delivered a double knockout blow to Clemens, the five-time Cy Young
award winner. With no one out in the fourth, Will Clark and Albert
Belle, who had already slugged a first-inning home run for the
first two runs, whacked successive home runs in the space of three
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, went to the mound after
Belle's shot, patted Clemens on the back and excused him for the
evening. He left with a 7-6 deficit that threatened to end his
16-game streak of victories, which dates to last June 3, when he
pitched for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But the winning pitcher in the Orioles' 1997 victory that ended
Randy Johnson's string of 16 consecutive victories, was unable to
drive a stake through Clemens' streak. Mussina's 7-6 lead
disappeared in the Yankee fourth, in great part because of an error
by shortstop Mike Bordick on Chad Curtis' leadoff grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The run that Curtis subsequently scored on Chuck Knoblauch's
sacrifice fly removed Clemens as the potential losing pitcher, thus
keeping his streak alive despite his having allowed 7 runs, 11 hits
and 3 walks. No-decisions do not count in such a streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' game-tying seventh run also was their sixth
unearned run, the first five courtesy of a double error Ripken
committed in the second inning on Luis Sojo's two-out bases-loaded
grounder to third. The Yankees scored two runs on Ripken's bobble
and wild throw, then three more on successive doubles by Knoblauch
and Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The errors gave Ripken five for the season in seven games and 14
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The five-run Yankee burst gave Clemens a 5-4 lead, but he was
not any better at holding an advantage than Mussina was. Harold
Baines and B.J. Surhoff singled with no one out in the third,
Ripken sacrificed them to third and second and Baines scored on
Bordick's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams put the Yankees ahead again leading off the
Yankees' third at 6-5, walloping a monstrous home run, his first of
the season, a third of the way up the third tier of the right-field
stands. But then the Orioles saw Clemens and raised him one with
the home runs by Clark and Belle. Before this game, Belle had hit
only one home run against Clemens in 66 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, booed consistently by the Yankee Stadium fans, had other
opportunities to hurt the Yankees. After Brady Anderson and Delino
DeShields each singled home a run in the second inning, Belle went
to bat with the bases loaded but grounded into an inning-ending
double play. He batted against Mike Stanton with the bases loaded
and two out in the seventh, but swung at a 3-0 pitch and popped it
to first.

MARLINS EXTINGUISH METS' STREAK 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ First, the New York Mets' starting pitcher failed.
Then the bullpen, which had been nearly flawless, followed suit.
And on one strikeout, the Mets drew mock cheers when catcher Mike
Kinkade threw the ball into left field while trying to toss it
around the horn.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Florida Marlins had concluded their ride around
the bases, the Mets' five-game winning streak was gone, too. The
Marlins racked up 18 hits and 25 base runners Thursday night as
they defeated the Mets, 11-4, at Shea Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Mets had talked about the depth and talent
of their bullpen. But with Masato Yoshii putting them in an early
hole, the Mets never got a chance to bring in their best relievers
with a lead to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they trotted out Josias Manzanillo and Rigo Beltran,
who had each been unscored upon before Thursday night, and those
two served up batting practice for the Marlins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most damage came from Luis Castillo, who reached base six
times on three singles and three walks, and Todd Dunwoody, who had
four hits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii was roughed up in spring training, surrendering 26 hits
and 22 runs in 221/3 innings. But in his first start of the season,
he easily handled the Marlins, pitching seven innings and allowing
five hits and three runs.
</P>
<P>
   But he barely got out of the first inning Thursday night. He
surrendered an infield single to Castillo on a bullet up the middle
that Edgardo Alfonzo stopped with a dive, then hit Alex Gonzalez
with a pitch. Mark Kotsay followed with a single to center field,
scoring Castillo. Derek Lee then ripped a line drive that Rey
Ordonez caught, doubling Kotsay off of first. But Dunwoody hit a
line single that scored Gonzalez for a 2-0 lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura singled in a run in the bottom of the first, but
Yoshii continued to struggle, giving up three more hits and two
more runs while making it through the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored one run in the bottom of the fifth to make it
4-2 when Ricky Henderson slid under catcher Jorge Fabregas' tag on
a two-out single by Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' bullpen, which had been spectacular in the first nine
games, finally let manager Bobby Valentine down. Manzanillo, who
had surrendered two hits and no runs in his first two appearances,
had little better luck than Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   Two-out run-scoring singles by Gonzalez and Kotsay in the sixth
increased the Marlins' lead to 6-2. Beltran came on in the seventh
and gave up three unearned runs following an error by Bonilla,
whose attempt at a sliding catch in right field failed as the ball
slid out of his grasp. Beltran allowed a two-run homer to
pinch-hitter Bruce Aven in that inning and was touched for two more
runs in the eighth, when he yielded a solo home run to Preston
Wilson. &QL;
