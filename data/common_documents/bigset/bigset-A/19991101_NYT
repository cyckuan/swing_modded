BUSH'S SPEECH: AN UNCHANGING SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BUSH-SPEECH) 
 (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from a speech that Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas delivered in Fargo, N.D., last Thursday. Its basic language
and themes are repeated in most of his campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody said, ``Well, how's your mother doing?'' I said, ``You
know, I've learned an interesting lesson and that is, you can never
escape your mother, no matter what your job is or how old you
are.'' I was giving a speech in Fredericksburg, Texas, one time.
It's in central Texas. I was there, my dad was there, my brother
was there, my mom was there. . . . My dad was the speaker, and I
got up to say, ``Mr. President, welcome to central Texas,'' and
there was a nice group of applause. I said, ``Mother,'' and before
I could say anything else, the place went wild. I said, ``Mother,
it is clear the people of Texas still love you, and so do I. But
you are still telling me what to do after 50 years.'' True story: a
guy in a big cowboy hat strode out in the middle of Main Street,
Fredericksburg, Tex., cups his hands and screams, ``And you better
listen to her, too, boy!''
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty good advice. I have listened to her. She talks about
duty and service. She talks about honor and dignity. She said, ``If
you ever get elected to public office, don't be sticking your
finger in the air to try to figure out which way the wind is
blowing. Do what you think is right.'' I've got a famous mother,
and I've got a great wife. I am sorry that Laura's not here so I
can introduce you to her. The best decision I ever made _ the best
decision I ever made _ was to ask Laura Bush to marry me. I'm not
so sure the best decision she ever made was to say yes. The thing I
love most about Laura is that she understands, like I understand,
that the most important job title we'll ever have is not first lady
or governor. It is mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   We are the proud parents of 17-year-old twin daughters. I don't
know what's harder: running for president or raising those girls.
But I do know I love them, I love them a lot. Which caused me to
hesitate about seeking the presidency. I wasn't sure that I wanted
to subject them to what I knew would happen to 17-year-old twin
daughters. One of them was reading the newspaper the other day. She
said, ``Daddy, I've been reading about you in the newspapers. And
I've been reading about those polls. You are not nearly as cool as
the people think you are.'' She may be right, but I want to share
with you, if you don't mind _ I understand this is a Chamber of
Commerce banquet, but I've got to seize the moment _ I want to
share with you why I've asked the three ladies of my life to make
an incredible sacrifice and join me in the quest to become your
president, to become your president.
</P>
<P>
   And here's why: I feel incredibly fortunate to be an American. I
love our country. I love what our country stands for. I love
Americans. I'm running for president because I want our nation to
be prosperous as we head into the 21st century, but there must be a
purpose to prosperity. And the purpose of prosperity is to see to
it that the American dream, the great American dream, touches every
willing heart. The purpose of prosperity must be so that people
don't feel left out in our country or feel left behind. I'm running
because I want the political party with which I'm associated to
match our conservative minds with our compassionate hearts. And I'm
running to win the respect of the people of America and I'm running
to do one thing, and that is to become the next president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you understand what I know: that prosperity is not a
given. It just doesn't happen. In all due respect to some of the
elected officials in Washington and in the executive branch, if you
listen carefully, it sounds like they think they invented
prosperity. They no more invented prosperity than they invented the
Internet. You and I know the role of government is not to create
wealth. That's not the role of government. The role of government
is to create an environment in which entrepreneurship flourishes,
in which small businesses become big businesses, in which some
youngster may have a dream about becoming a high-tech
businessperson and is willing to risk capital to do so. So the
proper role of government is to create an environment that's
conducive to capital. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We will be prosperous if we embrace free trade. I intend to work
to end barriers and tariffs everywhere entirely so that the entire
world _ I mean the entire world _ trades in freedom. I'm going to
remind people in this country that it is the fearful who build
walls _ it is the fearful who build walls. It is the confident who
tear them down. And I am confident in the North Dakota farmer. I am
confident in the American entrepreneur. I am confident in American
enterprise, and I am confident that the best in America is the best
in the entire world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   America must not retreat. We must not withdraw within our
borders. We must seize the moment and lead the world to peace,
which we can do. And we always have got to remember that the
greatest export we have to this world is, and always will be, the
incredible freedom we understand in the great land called America.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll be prosperous and strong if we do the right things. But
it is important to remember that prosperity alone is simple
materialism. There has to be a great purpose to our prosperity. The
success of America has never been proven by cities of gold, but by
our citizens of character. ... Should I be fortunate enough to earn
the confidence of the American people, I'll be an activist
president who sets a tone, a positive tone, an optimistic tone, and
I'll set goals worthy of a great nation. I will not _ I will not _
use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I will be guided by conservative principles that government
should do a few things and do them well, and government should not
try to be all things to all people. And so where to begin? Where to
begin? I believe our nation ought to usher in what I call the
responsibility era, an era that will stand in stark contrast to the
last few decades, which have clearly said, if it feels good, do it,
and if you've got a problem, blame somebody else. My hopes for
America, my vision for this country, is that each of us understands
for certain that we are responsible for the decisions we make in
life. That each of us must understand that we're responsible for
loving the children we bring into this world and that we are
responsible for loving a neighbor just like we'd like to be loved
ourselves. . . .
</P>
<P>
   But the great false hope of the past is that all we have to do
is hold a committee meeting: ``Don't worry, government will pass a
law, and everything will be fine.'' That's not the way it works. I
know the people of North Dakota understand that. You see, cultures
change one heart, one soul, one conscience at a time. And hopefully
by now our society has learned that while government can hand out
money, what it cannot do is put hope in our hearts or a sense of
purpose in our lives. This is done in churches, synagogues and
mosques and charities that warm the cold of life. And so a second
great challenge for our country and for our next president will be
to rally the armies of compassion which exist all across North
Dakota and all across America. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The real strength lies in the hearts and souls of decent, caring
people, not in the halls of government. I believe strongly that
societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down. So my
challenge will be to say to people of faith and good heart:
``You're welcome to interface with people of need. I will remove
the bureaucratic structures and the bureaucratic mindset that
thwarts people of faith from interfacing with people of need.'' I
will include the armies of compassion in prison programs,
drug-treatment programs, maternity group homes, because I
understand, and I know you understand, that when we change hearts,
we change America for the better.
</P>
<P>
   And the final challenge will be to make sure that every child
gets educated _ I mean every child _ and that no child gets left
behind. I believe that the people who care more about the children
who live in North Dakota are the citizens of North Dakota. I
believe in local control of public education in America. I'm not
running for federal superintendent of schools. I'm running for
president. I understand, I understand, local control, but I also
understand the need to have a president who sets high standards and
calls upon the best. I'm going to ask a simple question: Can we
pass power back from Washington, D.C., to the state level? And I'll
give you a simple answer: You bet. Absolutely. I gave a speech when
I was in California, my first education speech. I talked about the
poorest of the poor. That's called Title I money.
</P>
<P>
   This is money spent by the federal government to help the
poorest of the poor. Incredibly enough, we don't know whether or
not the money we're spending is achieving the objective of what we
all want for every child in each grade. Should I become your
president, I'm going to say if we spend federal money, we're going
to ask the states and localities to measure, and if standards are
met, if the poorest of the poor are learning, we're going to say
thank you, teacher, thank you, principal, and thank you, community
leader, for helping. But if we find that the poorest of the poor,
when federal money is spent, are trapped in failed schools, if
standards are not being met, I intend to free the parents to make
different choices: public school, charter school, private school, I
do not care. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've heard the pundits [inaudible passage) who
describe this business about compassionate conservatism. It's kind
of the talk of the political process, at least as it's related to
me. Let me give you a flavor for what it means. If somebody asks
you what it means, you might just look them in the eye and say,
``It's conservative to cut taxes. It is compassionate to give
people their own money back. It is conservative _ it is
conservative, just ask Governor Schafer _ it's conservative to
insist upon reforming welfare by using work. That's conservative.
That's smart conservative thought. It is compassionate to take the
side of churches and charities that confront the suffering which
remains. It is conservative _ and it is right _ to confront
illegitimacy. It's compassionate to offer practical help to women
and children in crisis. And it is conservative to trust local
people to make the right decisions for schools. It's conservative
to have high standards for everybody.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   I've got two pledges I want to make, then I look forward to
shaking some more hands. Pledge one is I will run a campaign that
will make you proud. I'm going to run a positive campaign, a
hopeful campaign, an optimistic campaign. I feel so passionately
about the reasons why I asked my girls to run, that that's all I
intend to talk about during the course of this campaign. America
needs candidates who are willing to reject negative politics and
campaign in a positive way. And here's my final pledge _ thank you
for having me here _ should I be fortunate enough to become the
president, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not
only uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to uphold the honor
and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help
me God.

HOT PATRIOTS STEAM THROUGH ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Their charter flight arrived here five hours
later than expected Saturday because of mechanical problems. Then
they had to play in 90-degree-plus heat, many, many miles from
their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Those could have been easy excuses, but instead the Patriots
took it out on the Cardinals Sunday, 27-3, and head into their off
week at 6-2. Drew Bledsoe threw for four touchdowns and helped the
offense gain 386 yards, while the defense held an Arizona attack
led by backup quarterback Dave Brown to 166 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots return to action they'll host the New York
Jets, now 1-6, and the Tuna, Bill Parcells. Another overmatched
foe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be able to stand on the sideline in the fourth
quarter and chew the fat with Drew more often,'' offensive lineman
Bruce Armstrong said with a smile. ``We got those early points up
there, and that's what we can do when we have some things clicking
in our favor. That's what we should do. It's a good feeling to have
a game like this where we go out in front and then we hold on and
win. But now we have to take the next week to get healthy and then
come out with the same attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's four-TD game was his second of the season and the
eighth of his career. Two of the scores went to Shawn Jefferson,
helping build a 20-0 halftime lead. Jefferson's 64-yard
catch-and-run was the longest touchdown reception of his career.
His other was a 36-yard over-the-shoulder catch in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's a great receiver, and it was great just to be able to
get him the football,'' said Bledsoe, who got to take a
late-fourth-quarter breather in favor of John Friesz. ``He's a guy
I really appreciate out there and I'd love to spend the rest of my
career throwing it to him. We haven't got him the ball lately, but
today I was able to see him open and we were able to connect.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, Bledsoe threw it only 22 times,
completing 14 passes for 276 yards and no interceptions. The
Patriots ran the ball even more than they did in last week's win
over Denver, rushing a season-high 43 times for 142 yards (3.3-yard
average). Terry Allen carried 21 times for 88 yards (4.2), and
Kevin Faulk chipped in with 17 carries for 42 yards (2.5).
</P>
<P>
   The defense got a lot of pressure on Brown, sacking him three
times and intercepting him twice (Ty Law and Kato Serwanga). The
Patriots held the Cardinals to eight first downs, 76 yards rushing,
and only 3-for-16 success on third-down conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out there and wanted to go right at them with our
defense and make something happen,'' said Chris Slade, who had five
tackles, one sack, and a pass defensed. ``It's great to be 6-2, but
we have to keep going with this. We can't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   Running backs had only 37 of the team's 150 receptions before
Sunday, but Bledsoe went to them early. On the Patriots' first
scoring drive, their second offensive possession of the game,
Bledsoe threw down the left sideline on a 38-yard toss to Allen,
then found an uncovered Lamont Warren for a 3-yard pass in the
right corner of the end zone with 8:56 remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots added to their lead with another score with 1:13
remaining in the quarter. Bledsoe took a three-step drop and fired
a quick slant over the middle to Jefferson, who put a fake on free
safety Kwamie Lassiter at the 35. Jefferson ran it in the rest of
the way to complete a 64-yard hookup, and it was a 14-0 game after
Adam Vinatieri's extra point.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona using a makeshift offensive line, the situation was
ripe for the Patriots to make a big play or two defensively, too.
The first came early in the second quarter when Brown dropped back
for what was supposed to be a dump pass to a back. But the ball was
tipped at the line of scrimmage by Ferric Collons into the arms of
Law at the 45.
</P>
<P>
   Law fumbled at the 50, where Chris Carter jumped on the loose
ball. But the offense went three and out when defensive end Simeon
Rice sacked Bledsoe, who held the ball too long, for a 1-yard loss.
Rice sacked Bledsoe twice on the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's protection began to erode midway through the quarter,
getting him so frustrated that he stormed off the field after being
sacked by Rashod Swinger on third and 5 from the 40. Bledsoe was
irate as he went to the sideline, and teammates had to settle him
down.
</P>
<P>
   But things were better on the next series, when Bledsoe
engineered a six-play, 61-yard drive that featured a 19-yard
sideline pass to Vincent Brisby, followed by a 35-yard touchdown
pass to Jefferson. That came on a post route down the middle on
which Jefferson outran strong safety Tommy Bennett, making it 20-0
with 4:45 remaining. Vinatieri's extra point attempt was blocked,
ending a string of 117 straight successes.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who have made second-half adjustments well this
season, had to protect a 20-0 halftime lead. And it didn't appear
they were quite ready to do that at the start of the second half,
as Adrian Murrell went for 31 yards and Brown completed a 22-yard
pass to David Boston to get Arizona's first drive going.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots finally stiffened near the goal line, stuffing
three straight runs and forcing a fourth down. Brown tried to draw
the Patriots offside with his cadence, but the defense didn't bite.
Brown called a timeout and returned to more confusion, when his
offensive line drew an illegal motion call that forced Arizona to
go to Chris Jacke to kick a 24-yard field goal, making it 20-3.
</P>
<P>
   The nail in the coffin came with 14:20 remaining when Bledsoe
flung it downfield to a wide-open Terry Glenn for a 36-yard
touchdown pass.

HITCHCOCK, SELZNICK HOLLYWOOD ODD COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Epstein told people he wanted to make a dual
biography of Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick, everyone
recognized, of course, the former.
</P>
<P>
   And the latter?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of blank stares,'' Epstein said from his home
in Brooklyn. ``But when I said he was the producer of ``Gone With
the Wind'' _ `Oh, sure, I know who he is!' All of a sudden, it kind
of came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Selznick is spinning in his grave. And Hitchcock is
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Masters: Hitchcock, Selznick and the End of''
``Hollywood'' brilliantly captures the complicated relationship
between the two men _ a relationship that produced such classics as
``Notorious'' and ``Rebecca'' _ and how that relationship came to
symbolize the destruction of the Hollywood studio system. The
90-minute film uses key footage from both men's movies, as well as
interviews with those who knew and worked with them, to chronicle
the rise of the director's role in Hollywood _ at the expense of
the omnipotent producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sort of, in one man, I thought, a pretty close
representation of the studio system where the producer is king,''
Epstein, the executive producer of the film, said of Selznick.
``Everyone is under a seven-year contract and they kind of are
horse-traded like cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitchcock comes to represent an entirely new era. He is in
many ways the first director who is also a celebrity. . . . As
successful as somebody like Billy Wilder or Howard Hawks was,
(movie fans) would have no clue who he is. But Hitchcock was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't start out that way. Hitchcock made a name for himself
in England, but yearned to come to America. In 1939, Selznick
signed him and brought him over. Sixty years later, Hitchcock is
far more famous, but not then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, when Hitchcock first came over, David Selznick was
much, much more of a name, and in a lot of ways much more of a
celebrity,'' Epstein said. ``And I think probably, truth be told,
more of a filmmaker, at that moment. At least as Hollywood
perceived filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Hollywood of interchangeable directors, directors
hired simply to carry out the technical details of the producer's
vision. Selznick was busy whipping the cast and crew of ``Gone With
the Wind'' into the shape of that vision and _ perhaps
unfortunately _ it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' was a legendary triumph, both critically
and commercially. Selznick took home the Oscar for Best Picture;
the success validated his megalomaniacal methods of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   He tapped Hitchcock to direct his next feature, ``Rebecca.''
Sparks flew from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble stemmed from the two men's vastly different methods
of making a movie. Selznick liked for directors to shoot everything
_ all the angles, all the scenes, all the takes, everything _ and
then he would piece together the movie he wanted in the editing
room.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock worked a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father literally cut the picture before he shot it,''
Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, said from her California home. ``By the
time he got on the set, he knew exactly what that picture was going
to look like.'' That meant shooting only what was needed, nothing
more _ a method Selznick rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Selznick was far more powerful at the time, and his vision won
out _ literally. ``Rebecca'' won the Oscar for Best Picture, the
only time a producer has won in consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   (Hitchcock didn't go without small victories. Epstein told the
story, which didn't make it into his film, of Hitchcock discovering
that one of the secretaries on the set was a Selznick spy. He
figured out who, and from then on ``only uses the foulest
language'' around her until she broke down and quit.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was the beginning of the end for Selznick. The pressure
of competing with ``Gone With the Win''d's success built until he
stopped making movies; instead, he packaged projects and sold them
to other studios. He lost millions gambling. But he rebounded a bit
after undergoing successful psychotherapy, which he loved because
the visits were like story sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an egotist's dream,'' David Thomson, a Selznick
biographer, says in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, meanwhile, was lent to other studios and began
building a reputation and power. When the time came to make
``Notorious,'' he was on more equal ground.
</P>
<P>
   Selznick's name is nowhere to be found on that movie, but it is
their greatest work together. (In an effort to raise money for his
own rather notorious movie, the ill-fated ``Duel In the Sun,''
Selznick sold ``Notorious'' to another studio, allowing Hitchcock
to produce and direct.)
</P>
<P>
   Selznick came up with many of the most successful parts of the
film, including the party scene. And he instructed Hitchcock and
writer Ben Hecht to rework the ending _ originally, they killed off
Cary Grant's character; in another rewrite they did the same to
Ingrid Bergman's. Selznick wouldn't stand for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's, to me, real collaboration,'' said Epstein, who calls
``Notorious'' ``a nearly perfect movie.'' He added, ``But that's
not being a creator.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, as Selznick floundered and Hitchcock flourished,
the two men were more civil toward one another. In fact, Pat
Hitchcock claims, the two men got along fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as bad as everyone is trying to make out now,'' she
said, ``because now it's a big story. . . . They both had respect
for each other, and that was the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein contends it was much more of a struggle. Whatever the
case, while making his film Epstein found what he thinks of as a
classic Hitchcock joke, which he discovered while studying the
killer Raymond Burr plays in ``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his white hair and he's got his thick glasses and
he's chain-smoking all the time and he's a little overweight,''
Epstein said. ``I'd been looking at all these Selznick pictures and
it just hit me _ this is David Selznick!''
</P>
<P>
   Not officially, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never confirm that it was done on purpose,'' Epstein
said, ``but, at least in my mind, it strikes me as perfect
Hitchcock. That, in a lot of ways, is the essence of his humor and
the essence of his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   And the essence of a relationship that helped change Hollywood
forever. &QL;

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The Patriots played a home game in Tempe Sunday,
which is what happens sometimes when you're on your way to
controlling your destiny and your opponent is on its way to
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the directions the New England Patriots and Arizona
Cardinals seem headed today as the season approaches its midpoint,
and much of that feeling stemmed from Sunday's 27-3 thrashing of
the Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium, a win that sent New England
gliding to its off week with a 6-2 record and a new address:

</P>
<P>
   This address was reflected in many ways, not the least of which
was that a third of the 55,830 people on hand were wearing Patriot
jerseys and cheering every move New England made. Those brave,
sweltering, pale-skinned refugees from the East Coast had much to
cheer about, including a four-touchdown passing day from Drew
Bledsoe, explosive receiving games from Shawn Jefferson and Terry
Glenn, another solid rushing effort out of Terry Allen, and a
defense that limited Arizona to 2.7 yards per offensive play.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say the Patriots are without problems this
morning, but as they survey the AFC East from near the top of the
divisional ladder, what they see is the best a team can hope for at
this point in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own destiny in our hands,'' said six-time Pro Bowl
tackle Bruce Armstrong, who spent many years not only not in that
position but on teams that by now had their destiny decided. ``Even
the Super Bowl year we had to have things happen for us. We needed
to get streaky and have other people get beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we're 6-2. We could have been 8-0, but we could have
been 3-5, too, so I'll be happy with this. It's been years since
this team was 6-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it has. Nineteen, to be exact. Not since Ron Erhardt's
1980 squad have the Patriots rushed off to such a fast start. What
it means is that they not only control their own destiny but will
come off their week of rest with a chance to knock their
competition out in a three-week stretch in which all their
opponents will be playing with lineups weakened by significant
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   While New England has some minor injury problems at linebacker,
its problems pale in comparison to the Jets and Dolphins, who are
both without their starting quarterbacks and hence are struggling
to keep their heads above water. New York's season was finished
long ago, and when New England comes back off vacation it will be a
well-rested team hosting a battered one in the Jets. Difficult as
Bill Parcells always seems to make it on his old team, this is the
perfect scenario for the Patriots to begin a critical stretch of
games.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Jets, the Patriots travel to Miami to try and
avenge the stunning 31-30 loss backup quarterback Damon Huard put
on them, but the Huard they will face is not the same one who so
boggled New England's minds in his debut for the injured Dan
Marino. Huard has struggled since that game and although his team
won again Sunday and is 6-1, there is little chance Marino will be
back by then, and even if he is he will not be the real Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Huard is beginning to suffer as all untested quarterbacks do,
and so is his team's offense. Marino may no longer be the remedy
for that because he is now a 38-year-old shadow, a quarterback not
aging gracefully who survives more by his wits and his defense than
by what his once marvelous arm could do. Miami can win with either
of them because of its defense, but it is a struggle now and will
be Nov. 21, as well.
</P>
<P>
   After that trip to Florida comes one to Buffalo, where the Bills
will be dangerous. But they also likely still will be without their
best receiver, Eric Moulds, who is out 4-6 weeks with an injury.
Without Moulds's deep threat, Buffalo's offense has struggled,
allowing defenses to put more pressure on Doug Flutie. What has
resulted is eight interceptions in Flutie's last three games, and
an offense bogged down without much of a running game all season
now finds itself without much of a passing one either.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance Moulds could be back by Nov. 28, but this
seems to be a season so far in which things are breaking right for
the Patriots, so don't count on it. Sunday was a case in point.
When the season began, this appeared to be a difficult game played
in high heat far from home against a team with a hot young
quarterback and a predatory defense.
</P>
<P>
   But by the opening kickoff, the Cardinals came into this fiasco
without quarterback Jake Plummer, their best offensive weapon even
on his bad days, and with a revamped offensive line in which the
only player in the same position as when the season began was
center Aaron Graham. This allowed New England's defense to harass
backup quarterback Dave Brown into submission and stuff the
Cardinals' running game by attacking the new faces at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   It has been like that since the start of what thus far has been
a dream season that comes only one year removed from a nightmare.
Where last year they were the walking wounded, this season New
England is walking on air.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes into the new year and Vinny Testaverde is lost for
the season without even being hit. Patriots win. Jets die.
</P>
<P>
   The young Colts are improved, but by Week 2 their rebuilt
defense has not yet learned everyone's name, let alone how to play
together. New England rallies. Colts lose.
</P>
<P>
   Then came two gimme putts from the Giants and Browns before the
Patriots' only two losses, games decided, like most in the NFL this
year, by 2 points or fewer. Normally that two-game losing streak
could have turned into a disaster with the arrival of Denver the
following Sunday. New England had not beaten the Broncos since the
Johnson Administration _ Andrew Johnson _ and there would have been
panic in the air and blood on the water under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But little has been normal about this NFL season, and the
Broncos who limped into Foxborough a week ago came with two
straight Super Bowl championships but without John Elway, Terrell
Davis, and Shannon Sharpe. In other words, they came without their
offense, and New England survived _ barely _ thus setting the stage
for a high-octane start to a potentially high-hopes season.
</P>
<P>
   This still all could end in desperation, disaster, or another
mad scramble to the playoffs of course, but this time it should
not. Not after a first half that could not have gone much better
for the Patriots in terms of their record, their health, and the
battered nature of their chief rivals in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   They open the second half of their playoff run with four
division games in five weeks and would seem to have clear
advantages in the first three if all things remain intact _
including the limbs of the New England players. If they do, it will
be up to the Patriots where they end up, just as it was up to them
Sunday how big a victory margin they would post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along if we have our key guys _ and that starts
with the quarterback and the receivers _ we can play with anybody
in this league,'' Armstrong said. ``Today we have them, and they're
still healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   With half a season gone, so are the hopes of his team.

TALLAS BOOSTS GRAHAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rob Tallas knows exactly how John Grahame is feeling
right now. In his first year with the Bruins in 1994-95, Tallas
came into training camp with no contract and dazzled management
enough to win one. He spent that year mostly in Charlotte, in the
East Coast League, and played two games in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Tallas split his time between
Providence and Boston. Whenever there was a decision about who
would be demoted as the Bruins brought in a cast of goaltender
candidates, Tallas was odd-man out.
</P>
<P>
   This season, though, Tallas will be in Boston to play his second
full season in the NHL, behind Byron Dafoe, and Grahame, despite
how well he's performed, will head down to Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you never want to be put in that situation,''
said Tallas. ``He's done everything in his power to show that he
can play and that's all you can ask from a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ironic that Grahame earned his first NHL shutout Saturday
night in a 3-0 victory over the Buffalo Sabres and now faces
demotion as the victim of a numbers game _ Tallas would have to
clear waivers to be sent down and it's obvious some other team
would grab him. With two new teams coming into the league next
June, the Bruins can't afford not to retain Tallas, who is likely
to be exposed for the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he handled himself awesome (Saturday night),''
Tallas said about Grahame. ``There was a lot of pressure in the
game with the Byron situation. He's a calm and relaxed guy. He
needs to know that he did everything right. If that's the case
(that he is demoted), everyone here will pat him on the back and
he'll be back here in no time. He's got a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said there were several times early in his career when he
felt he deserved better. However, because of contractual situations
or waiver considerations, he wasn't always given a reward
commensurate with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember three years ago, it was the same thing when Jim
Carey was here,'' said Tallas. ``I felt I had a great training
camp. I think I won every game. But the numbers really didn't
reflect on the situation and I had to go down and work hard. I'll
talk to John; he's a good guy and he has a positive attitude. It's
hard not to look at it as a step back and you're definitely going
to go down there and be frustrated for a little while, and
rightfully so. Everything he's done up here has been positive since
Day One of training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   As sympathetic as he is, though, Tallas believes he's earned his
stripes. He admits to being insecure while coach Pat Burns was
rotating netminders until Dafoe was signed. Rather than sit out a
few games because of painful injuries (a bad ankle against Los
Angeles and Anaheim, a bad thumb and shoulder against Tampa Bay),
Tallas played because he didn't want to lose his spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to miss games,'' he said. ``That was the biggest
thing. A couple of games, maybe I shouldn't have played. I just
thought I had to play no matter what. I wanted to go out there and
prove to Pat and everybody that my heart is as big as it always has
been. I try to go out there every night and play with every amount
of emotion that I can and I wanted to show that. And I'll do that
at any time of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas didn't bother to fill in Burns with the details of his
ailments. The goalie said when Burns asked if he could play, he
wanted a one-word answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Burns) really knew (the extent of the
injuries),'' Tallas said. ``Every time he asked me, I looked him in
the eye and said, `I'm playing.' I think maybe he didn't want to
know. It was a yes-or-no question and I was giving him `yes' all
the time. I think once he talked to the trainers and realized I had
to go in and get a (cortisone) shot that it was a little bit more
sore. Pat is an old-school guy. He likes guys who will fight
through the weather. I didn't want to take myself out of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dafoe earned the bulk of the workload, and with the
Bruins fighting for a playoff spot, Tallas was on the sidelines
more than he would've liked. When he did get a chance to play, it
was usually in a rough situation with the Bruins playing their
third game in four nights or facing a team that had been sitting
home waiting while the Bruins were wrapping up a long road trip.
Such is the lot of the backup goalie, but Tallas has the mentality
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always looked at the positive in every situation,'' he
said. ``I think at Christmas (last year), I might have had five
games. There are still two more months to go and I have a game in
hand. I got off to an early start and got some games right away and
there will be games coming up and that's healthy for me. I think
one thing that helps, too, is the relationship me and Byron have.
Up to now, we've been rotating, but at this level, we do need a No.
1 goalie and you do need a backup. It's hard to do a rotation
system.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears the rotation is over. It's likely Dafoe will make his
season debut against New Jersey Thursday, or against Atlanta
Saturday at the latest, which means Grahame will be toiling in
Providence by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough time,'' said Tallas. ``But he's 24 years old.
Next year, who knows what is going to happen with expansion, and
there's still a lot of season left here. It's tough but he
definitely has to deal with it. He's done a great job. I can't find
the words to cheer someone up in that situation. I know tears will
be shed, absolutely; it's an emotional sport. But rightly so, he's
done everything he could do.''

COATES: CLOUD ON HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Ben Coates Sunday did not have a reception for
the second game this season and was irate afterward, charging he's
been excluded from the game plan and saying he wants out if he
doesn't receive a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do about it except try to get the hell
out of here,'' Coates said after the Patriots' 27-3 win over the
Arizona Cardinals at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this, the second or third game where I haven't caught a
(expletive) ball?'' Coates said as he packed his bags for the trip
home. ``There's nothing to talk about. If this is the way they want
it, what's there to say? Just release me. Be my guest. Do whatever
you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates has not caught as many passes since Ernie Zampese took
over as offensive coordinator two years ago. Once a favorite target
of Drew Bledsoe, having caught 45 touchdown passes from the
quarterback since 1993, Coates said, ``It's definitely changed.
(Zampese) wants to do things his way, and the tight end isn't that
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be a decoy and run around and allow everyone
else to get open. All I do is block. They can get anybody to block.
Anybody. I have a lot of football left. I haven't slowed down any.
What it is is I just can't do it here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates's anger had been building for some time. After averaging
4.1 catches per game in 1997 and 4.7 in 1998, he is averaging 2
this season. Sunday he had just two balls thrown to him, both into
double coverage. By the end of the game, with the score so
lopsided, Coates was on the bench and Rod Rutledge in the game.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation Coates has been bothered by a sore
left knee and ankle, which were further tweaked when they were
twisted by linebacker Bill Romanowski in a 24-23 win over Denver
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' he said. ``My health has been as good as it's been
in a long time. That's (expletive). I'm sick of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates said he was going to fly home to North Carolina during
the three-day break the Patriots earned with the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe I won't come back,'' he said.

ANDERSON READY FOR FUN-AND-GUN CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ There are fewer than 48 hours left before the
start of the NBA season. The roster is set. Training camp's over.
Ditto the exhibition season. What else can the Celtics do to
prepare, to make certain they advance to the playoffs for the first
time since 1995?
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson said Sunday the key word is mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep this game of basketball . . . something I
enjoy,'' said the starting point guard, ``because all the other
off-court (stuff), and all life has a lot of (expletive) involved
in it. When I come here and I play, this has to be my outlet. This
has to be something I enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he worked with a trainer during the offseason and
is as healthy as he's been since he signed with Portland in 1996.
He said he will attempt to make this year one in which
off-the-court problems don't interfere with winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good group of guys here. All in all, it's a
positive thing,'' he said. ``We just want to win now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk should be music to the ears of third-year coach Rick
Pitino, who guided a team that had gone 15-67 in 1996-97, its worst
record ever, to a 36-46 mark in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted much enthusiasm entering last year, but the
Celtics were a disappointing 19-31 in a strike-shortened campaign,
and among the issues the team faced was a questionable chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot my first year. I didn't learn anything last
year,'' said Pitino, whose team opens its season Tuesday at
Toronto. ``I didn't enjoy it. I didn't learn anything. In fact, it
was not a pleasant year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, what we will learn more than anything else is
that our chemistry has to be great in order for us to, as a young
team, try and make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, former Celtics have come to the aid of the
franchise. Bill Russell worked with the team on establishing a
winning mindset. Dave Cowens was at practice Sunday working with
post players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell, I wish I had around every second, to get inside the
players' heads,'' said Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russell constantly gets them to think of the team, winning
ahead of losing, passing over shooting, rebounding over selfish
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets into their heads, and Dave gets on the court and shows
them things as a post basketball player. And let's face it: Vitaly
Potapenko, Tony Battie, and Danny Fortson are undersized for their
position, and so was Dave Cowens. So, all the little tricks Dave
could pull off as a player he can give insight to their game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics finished 3-5 in the exhibition season. They were
swept in two games by Charlotte and split against Washington,
Atlanta, and Utah. Paul Pierce led the team in scoring in three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said outside of the last exhibition game, a loss to
Washington at the the Springfield Civic Center, the Celtics' shot
selection was good. The team shot 43 percent from the floor in the
exhibition season but finished tied for sixth with Charlotte in
points per game (102.6). Celtics opponents averaged 100.6 points
per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an excellent chance of winning. We're prepared and
we're making strides,'' said Pitino. ``We're going against one of
the most athletic teams in the league with the Toronto Raptors. We
have to match that athleticism on the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, hopefully going into the fourth quarter it will
be a close game, like I think most of our games will be this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Pitino hasn't changed much; he's very demanding.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We don't need to change. We just have to win
games. We have to listen to details better. Rotate quicker. Know
our assignments on defense. Know what plays to run. With our
talent, we can win games, and everything will be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, you can make all the excuses you want. You still
have to win games. If he's going to be demanding, he's going to be
demanding. Winning changes everything.''

BC BOWLED OVER BY WINNING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Boston College coach Tom O'Brien stood in a
hallway outside the visitors' locker room in the bowels of the
Carrier Dome when his defensive coordinator, Frank Spaziani, and
his offensive line coach, David Magazu, wearily approached.
</P>
<P>
   Before he made his postgame comments to the media, O'Brien
paused and hugged both men.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's rare display of public affection illustrated just how
much emotion there was to BC's 24-23 victory over Syracuse Saturday
at the Carrier Dome. It showed just how much it meant to the Eagles
(6-2, 3-2 Big East) and to the men who coach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good win,'' said O'Brien, whose players are off next
week before resuming action Nov. 13 by hosting West Virginia. ``Now
we've got a winning record in October (3-2). We had one in
September (3-0), and now we've got to find a way to get a winning
record in November.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's sixth victory of the season _ and first at Syracuse since
1993 _ guaranteed O'Brien his first winning season with the Eagles
after back-to-back 4-7 campaigns. It also made BC bowl eligible for
the first time since 1994, when the Eagles last had a winning
regular-season record (6-4-1) to earn a berth in the Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   One week ago, the Eagles seemed to ruin their hopes for a
winning record and bowl bid in a 31-28 loss to Miami, but BC
resuscitated its hopes by surviving a topsy-turvy thriller that
wasn't sealed until a final Syracuse drive stalled in the last
minute. BC had taken the lead when John Matich converted a 34-yard
field goal with 2:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Eagles could be headed for any number of bowl
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   BC could be in line for a spot in the Aloha/Oahu Bowl
doubleheader Dec. 25 in Honolulu as an at-large opponent for either
the Pac-10's No. 4 or No. 5 team; the Motor City Bowl Dec. 27 in
Pontiac, Mich., as an at-large team against the Mid-American
Conference champion (Marshall); the Music City Bowl Dec. 29 in
Nashville as the fourth Big East representative, matched against a
Southeast Conference opponent; or, quite possibly, the Insight.com
Bowl Dec. 31 in Tucson against the Big 12's No. 5 team.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles can improve their postseason position with a victory
against a West Virginia squad that first faces the unenviable task
of hosting Virginia Tech after blowing a 13-0 halftime lead in a
28-20 loss Saturday at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the next one,'' said senior linebacker Frank
Chamberlin, who made a staggering 24 tackles, including a
game-saving shoestring grab of quarterback Madei Williams that
stopped him 1 yard shy of converting a fourth-and-13 play on the
Orangemen's last drive. ``We have a winning season, but we're not
finished. We don't feel like that's the pinnacle of our season.''
</P>
<P>
   After surviving a game that was full of as many big plays as
infuriating mistakes, O'Brien gave his players a well-deserved week
of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   It will give senior strong safety George White (hamstring) and
redshirt freshman defensive end Derric Rossy (shoulder) time to
heal from injuries sustained Saturday. In addition, it will give
freshman running back William Green (groin pull), freshman wideout
Keith Hemmings (hamstring), junior linebacker Steve Martin (neck),
junior cornerback D.J. Sutton (ankle), and redshirt freshman
defensive tackle Frank Misurelli (ankle) _ all of whom missed the
trip to Syracuse _ time to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty beat up, we're sore, and we're tired,'' O'Brien
said. ``We need the time off. I'm not sure how much we had left at
the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore DuJuan Daniels got the game off to a roaring start
when he returned the kickoff 100 yards to give BC a 7-0 lead. It
was another in a series of amazing firsts for Daniels, who scored
on his first varsity play in high school at Bishop Chatard in
Indianapolis and, after being switched from cornerback to wide
receiver, scored on his first collegiate play on offense, hauling
in a 64-yard pass from Tim Hasselbeck in BC's 14-10 victory at
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find something else for him to do first,''
O'Brien joked. ``He scores the first time he catches (one) and the
first time he runs a kickoff return. We may have him return a punt
next week. First time he does something, he scores.''
</P>
<P>
   How big was the win?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no clue,'' O'Brien demurred, as he ducked into the
coaches' locker room. ``Let's wait and count 'em up at the end of
the season.''

   BOSTON _ While the Boston College players deserve most of the
credit for their 24-23 win over Syracuse Saturday, coach Tom
O'Brien also deserves some praise.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien faced the monstrous task of getting his team mentally
prepared after last week's 31-28 loss to Miami. How do you convince
a team that blowing a 28-0 lead in the second half makes it a
decent squad? Especially when you are hitting the road against a
Syracuse team that had two weeks to digest a 62-0 loss to Virginia
Tech?
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien asked his team this: If someone had told you that with
three minutes to go in the Miami game the score would have been
tied at 28, how would you have felt? The answer would have been
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien told his team all week it should learn from blowing the
lead, but also that since it could play with Miami, it could do the
same against Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Against Miami, the Eagles played 58 minutes when they needed to
play 60. Against Syracuse, they played an entire game against a
good opponent and won a game almost no one gave them a chance to.
</P>
<P>
   BC has come out flat for games in the past, and O'Brien and his
staff have been criticized for it.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Eagles came out flying, proving they are a Top
25-caliber team. With six wins, they also proved to be bowl worthy
and almost certainly will be playing somewhere in the postseason,
perhaps Hawaii, Nashville, Tucson, or Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The players deserve the praise they are receiving. They just as
easily could have been 8-0 right now.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Brien and his staff deserve as much praise for guiding the
team through turbulent times.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre story of the season, and maybe of the century,
involves Arizona State running back J.R. Redmond. Redmond did not
play in Arizona State's 20-17 loss to Oregon, serving a one-game
suspension because he received what the NCAA ruled were extra
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal there. But these were the extra benefits: Redmond, a
potential first-round NFL draft pick, was dating a student who also
worked part time in the ASU athletic department. During the
courtship, Redmond rang up more than $400 in charges on her cell
phone. His fiancee informed him that was an NCAA violation, and
unless he married her, she would turn him in.
</P>
<P>
   So he did. Now he wants out of the marriage, but his wife has
hired an attorney and is asking for a portion of his potential NFL
earnings as part of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in disbelief,'' said athletic director Kevin White about
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a good theme for the next ``Jerry Springer Show.''
``How I Blackmailed My Husband Into Marrying Me And How I Hope To
Strike It Rich.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is 1-7 after a 28-3 loss to 7-1 Furman. What's
the big deal? Furman is a Division 1-AA team, albeit a very good
one, and it marked the first time North Carolina had ever lost to a
1-AA team. It was also Furman's first win over a 1-A opponent in 14
years . . . Stanford lost its first Pac-10 game of the season when
Washington came from behind for a 35-31 victory. The Cardinal
entered the game ranked 111th (out of 114 teams) in defense and
allowed Washington quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo to have a career
day. He gained 509 yards in total offense, which included 19 of 32
for 302 yards and 1 TD passing, and 22 carries for 207 yards and 2
TDs rushing . . . Kansas and Navy fans can share the misery of
their latest losses. Navy had Notre Dame beaten, but a generous
spot on a fourth-down play gave the Irish one more chance and they
took advantage of it, pulling off a 28-24 come-from-behind win.
Kansas led Nebraska, 9-0, at halftime and was tied at 17 late in
the fourth quarter before losing, 24-17 . . . Southern Methodist
players will wear decals on their helmets to recall two-time US
Open champion Payne Stewart, a 1979 graduate killed in a plane
crash last week. Knowing the NCAA, the Mustangs likely will be
forced to take them off since it probably isn't an approved decal .
. . Coaches always say it takes a solid running game to win. Not so
with Duke. The Blue Devils had a total of minus-5 yards rushing and
still beat Maryland, 25-22. To make matters worse, Maryland's
LaMont Jordan ran for 227 yards and the Terps still lost . . . The
'Canes didn't show up for a first half in the last two games,
against BC and West Virginia, and wound up winning both. Against BC
they overcame that 28-0 deficit; against West Virginia they
trailed, 13-0, at halftime and won, 28-21. Maybe coach Butch Davis
should bring his team to the stadium seven hours before kickoff
instead of the normal 2 1/2-3 when it takes on Pittsburgh next
week.

PATRIOTS DEFENSE HAS LINE ON VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The future is not now for the Arizona Cardinals,
who could not overcome the mistakes of their young offensive line
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can run the ball even this much,'' said Cardinals
general manager Bob Ferguson before the game, spreading two fingers
about an inch apart, ``then we could do OK today. We've got an
entire line of rookies. Either they are legitimate first-year guys,
or they were with us a year ago and didn't play. This will be their
first game together, and we plan to have them as a group for the
next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   They're sure to have better days than the one they had against
the Patriots. The New England defense manhandled them, limiting
Arizona to a total of 166 yards, and never giving the Cardinals a
chance to get in the game once the Patriots claimed a 14-0 lead in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's offensive line was so bad in its first six games it
was completely revamped when the team had a week off.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots felt good about their defensive game plan going in.
They would attack Dave Brown, the Cardinals' backup quarterback who
was working in place of star Jake Plummer, out with a broken finger
on his passing hand.
</P>
<P>
   A defense has to respect Plummer when he plays. He has great
mobility and creativity. Brown does not. He is stationary, and the
Patriots' rushers knew they could find him in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell wanted to force Brown into
throwing situations, then pressure him into making mistakes.
Arizona entered the game with more turnovers (20) than any other
team in the league, and the Patriots wanted to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   New England also anticipated that Arizona would protect Brown by
having him take a three-step drop and get rid of the ball on
shorter pass plays. The way the Patriots got around that was to
have cornerbacks Ty Law and Steve Israel play the receivers tight
off the line of scrimmage, making Brown hold the ball longer than
he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme worked well in the first half. Arizona had just four
first downs and 77 yards of total offense and never got the ball
inside the New England 45.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Arizona is decent, a gambling unit that likes to
attack an offense with blitzes. The Cardinals usually enter a game
with two or three blitzes the other team hasn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Thus they live or die by the sword, and Sunday they cut their
own throats. They got to Drew Bledsoe several times in the first
half, sacking him three times, and he wasn't happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe got his revenge. On each of the first three New
England scoring drives, he made big plays through the air. The play
that set up the first touchdown was a 38-yard pass to Terry Allen
down the sideline to the Arizona 10. The Patriots surprised
Arizona's defense by going to the no-huddle, and operating from the
shotgun formation, on second down, not allowing Arizona time to
substitute. The Cardinals' strong suit on defense is when they
bring in a defensive package with extra backs. Allen is rarely used
on longer pass routes, but he got behind the defender easily.
</P>
<P>
   On their next possession, the Patriots scored again, catching
Arizona gambling. Bledsoe went behind center with no running backs
behind him. He had four wide receivers deployed along with tight
end Ben Coates. At the snap, Shawn Jefferson, set right in the
slot, ran five strides to his right, then broke sharply up the
field. Bledsoe got the ball out of his hand quickly. Cornerback Tom
Knight dived to intercept it and missed. Jefferson caught the ball
in stride heading straight up the field, froze safety Kwamie
Lassiter with a head fake to the right, and ran right past him for
the score.
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, Arizona was cooked. The Cardinals
had been averaging 11 points a game for the previous five weeks and
ranked 29th on offense _ with Plummer in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe dropped another bomb on them in the third period to put
the game away. He floated a 36-yard pass for Terry Glenn to run
under at the goal line, and Glenn stepped into the end zone without
a defender within 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hit-and-miss day for the New England offense, however.
Bledsoe was sacked five times and knocked down at least five more.
Late in the second quarter, after taking his third sack of the
quarter, he was upset when he went to the bench, and he let the
coaches know about it. A couple of teammates moved in to nudge him
away. For a good three minutes he walked up and down the sideline,
venting his frustration.
</P>
<P>
   During the off week, the Patriots should tinker with their
offense to get someone open quicker to allow Bledsoe to get rid of
the ball under pressure rather than taking hits. Entering the
weekend, only Charlie Batch of Detroit had been knocked down more
than Bledsoe. It is something the coaching staff must remedy if the
team is to make a playoff run.

JEFFERSON SEIZES PASSES, NOT PRAISE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ If you were a New England Patriot, the entire day
was fun, fun, fun and Daddy never even threatened to take the
T-Bird away.
</P>
<P>
   And if you didn't know any better, you'd have thought this 27-3
dispatch of the impotent Arizona Cardinals was a home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious the whole day,'' beamed Pete Carroll, now coach
of a 6-2 team. ``It was a tremendous showing by our fans. I don't
know where they came from, but it seemed there were as many
Patriots fans here as Cardinals fans, and certainly they were much
louder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots gave them a lot to cheer about. They built
themselves a comfortable 20-0 halftime lead. The only decent
Arizona offensive thrust turned into an embarrassing field goal.
Drew Bledsoe threw four touchdown passes, three of them certifiably
Long Distance, and two of those to Shawn Jefferson, a.k.a. the
Great Angler.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that Jefferson got himself in the news not too
long ago by latching onto a 488-pound tuna. (No, not him. A real
one.) This makes him the only NFL wide receiver who must be asked
the following question: ``OK, so is it more fun to catch a
488-pound tuna or catch two touchdown passes against the hapless
Arizona Cardinals?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catching the tuna,'' he claimed. ``You're out there with a
chance to see Mother Nature in her rarest form.''
</P>
<P>
   Catching the kind of passes Bledsoe threw Sunday might qualify
as hauling in NFL aerials in some quarterback's rarest form, but
for Bledsoe it was just another routinely great 1999 office visit.
It was his second four-touchdown performance in what is shaping up
to be his greatest season.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was in no mood to gloat, celebrate, or otherwise
acknowledge he had done much of anything. That's very noble, coming
from a man whose three receptions were good for 113 yards and those
two TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown No. 1 came on a third-and-6 at the Patriots 36. The
Cardinals had the foolish notion of blitzing the increasingly
unblitzable Bledsoe, who found Jefferson in some delectable
one-on-one coverage across the middle. Jefferson hauled in a
perfect pass, eluded a halfhearted grab by the safety, and pranced
into the end zohis third TD of the season. At 64 yards it
was his longest touchdown grab ever, and tied for the
second-longest reception of his career (he had a 76-yarder against
the Vikings in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``They were playing a lot of one-on-one today,'' he shrugged.
``We just took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Touchdown No. 2 came on a first-and-10 at the Cardinals 35.
Bledsoe had just connected on a 19-yard pass along the left
sideline to Vincent Brisby. The Cardinals made a replay challenge,
apparently thinking Brisby had not gotten his feet inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, Bledsoe was lofting a perfect pass to a
streaking Jefferson for a nice-'n-easy TD. ``Drew led me
perfectly,'' lauded the 30-year-old nine-year veteran. ``It was a
day of big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was so blase about his performance he was almost able
to sneak out of the locker room without speaking up for himself.
``It was just a break-out day for us,'' he decided.
</P>
<P>
   Was it also a break-out day for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say that,'' he replied. ``It was all about the team.
For me, it was `Been there; done that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more than that to his coach. ``He's just a
fantastic worker,'' said Carroll. ``He had those stitches (having
taken a helmet to the knee against Miami) last week, and he
couldn't practice. So this week he must have decided he was going
to make it all up. He was out there as much as possible _ offense,
defense, everything. I was kidding him about never wanting to leave
the field. I just love the way he approaches the game. To see him
break out like this was kind of a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   After a demanding seven-week stretch in which six games were
decided by 3 points or fewer and the seventh was an aggravating
taffy pull with an expansion team, this affair gave the team a rare
opportunity to stand around the sideline and giggle for the final
five or six minutes. Had to be fun, huh, Shawn?
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't matter to me,'' he insisted. ``I really
don't care how we win, as long as we win. I don't care if we win by
half a point. On Monday morning, people don't ask how you won; they
just want to know whether or not you won. It's not supposed to be
easy. The guys on the other side of the ball get paid, too. Those
guys are not going to lay down because we're the New England
Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, already, we get the point. All you did was run
around, get open, and wait for Bledsoe to find you. It doesn't
matter if you win by half a point or 40 points. And catching a tuna
is an existential experience. That's the Shawn Jefferson story, and
he's sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but he had a lot to do with making the trip from New
England worthwhile for an amazing number of Patriot fans. He may
have been there and done that, but someone should tell him it never
gets old. It's OK with Carroll if he'd like to do it again when the
season resumes against the Jets two weeks from Monday night.

`MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' COSELL'S CLAIM TO FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past week, America has been buzzing about Jim Gray's
interview with Pete Rose, in which the NBC reporter repeatedly
hammered Rose with questions about whether the banned former player
gambled on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had just been named to the All-Century team; Gray quizzed _
or ambushed, depending upon whom you ask _ him right after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking just about debates among baseball geeks.
Gray's tactics have been fodder for editorial pages, radio call-in
shows and the like _ we're talking Actual Big Story here.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time America was so riveted by a sportscaster?
I can't say for sure, but I'd be willing to bet it involved Howard
Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   There was no middle ground with Cosell. You either loved the guy
or hated him. Or, possibly, both _ a 1978 ``TV Guide'' poll named
Cosell both the most liked and most disliked sportscaster in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   So how would Cosell have handled the Rose interview? Perhaps no
one is more qualified to answer than Ross Greenburg, senior vice
president for HBO Sports and the executive producer of ``Howard
Cosell: Telling It Like It Is,'' a one-hour biography of the Mouth
that Roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have asked the first question about the Dowrt (which supplied evidence that Rose bet on baseball), and
whether or not he was finally willing to admit that he bet on
baseball,'' Greenburg said last week. ``But I think Howard probably
would have followed up with a series of questions about whether the
ceremony would create an atmosphere where (baseball commissioner)
Bud Selig would be forced to accept Pete Rose into the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosell being Cosell, he wouldn't have stopped there, Greenburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he would have walked across the field and ambushed Bud
Selig and asked him in follow-up whether Bud Selig would now think
twice about this continued banishment of Pete Rose, or whether he
would induct him into the Hall of Fame on the spot, at the
stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   It's delicious fun to imagine Cosell, his inimitable whine
droning above the din of the crowd, boring in on baseball's
commissioner. But thanks to ``Tell'' ``It Like It Is,'' we don't
have to. This great documentary of Cosell's life includes so much
riveting real-life footage that we don't need to dream up anything
to bolster it.
</P>
<P>
   Just hearing the voice again is a treat. It's a voice Billy
Crystal describes like this: ``Think of a very smart man scolding
you with a bad sinus condition who had a great vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen, who hired Cosell for a role in his movie
``Bananas,'' says, ``If Howard said, `Pass the salt,' or, `I'm
going to get the newspaper,' it sounded like an exciting event.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosell was born in Winston-Salem, N.C. _ something he denied for
years _ but his family moved to Brooklyn when he was 9 months old.
He became a successful union lawyer, but longed to break into the
world of sportscasting. He finally did, but not until his late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Sports was a close-knit world in which athletes and the
reporters who covered them shared an intimacy _ an intimacy Cosell
didn't enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using this tape recorder as a battering ram, he slugged his
way into the group,'' Robert Lipsyte, a ``New York Times''
reporter, says in the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism delayed Cosell's television debut, according to
the film. Perhaps his personal experience with bigotry is what
fueled his attraction to Cassius Clay, soon to be Muhammad Ali.
(Cosell was the first broadcaster to call Ali by his Muslim name.)
</P>
<P>
   Cosell's support of Ali came at a price _ in what seems almost
unbelievable today, Cosell was deounced, sometimes in print, with
the crudest racial slurs. Yet his refusal to back down also gained
him a measure of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the right place in the right time, which I know is a
cliche which he would never use,'' Greenburg said. ``But he was . .
. in an era of revolutionary struggle, and race relations were a
major part of our culture in that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cosell's greatest fame came from ``Monday Night
Football.'' His work with Frank Gifford and Don Meredith has never
been equaled, not on the current version of the show or on any
other sports broadcast. Forget the game _ just listening to the
banter between the two ex-jocks and the big-mouthed former lawyer
was worth staying up late for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, you tuned in to ``Monday Night Football'' and you felt
like every Monday night was a Super Bowl,'' Greenburg said. ``When
was the last time you had that feeling? All anyone does on the East
Coast (now) is wonder what time they can go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't always smooth sailing in the booth. ``Tell
It Like It Is'' includes amazing footage of a 1970 game in
Philadelphia in which Cosell increasingly slurs his speech; by
halftime, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spence, who worked the game for ABC Sports, says he called
the production truck to ask what the problem was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to our producer,'' Spence says, ``and said, `Howard
OK?' And he said, `Jim, Howard's had too much to drink.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cosell claimed to have an ear infection.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his life, Cosell wrote ``I Never Played the Game,'' a
bitter book that ABC's Al Michaels calls ``cruelty in the guise of
candor.'' The interviews with Gifford, whom Cosell slammed in the
book along with Meredith (who declined to be interviewed for the
film), are gripping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough interview for Frank to actually sit down
and do, because of his mixed emotions,'' Greenburg said. ``That was
as candid as you'll ever see Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever really filled Cosell's place in sports
broadcasting, Gray's Rose-colored flap notwithstanding. Greenburg
doubts anyone ever will.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't duplicate Howard,'' he said. ``Unless a human being
can actually become another Howard Cosell, you're in apples and
oranges territory.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Cosell's daughters puts it best:
</P>
<P>
   ``The silence,'' she says at the end of ``Tell It Like It Is,''
``is deafening.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL;

``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

VICTIMS' KIN FLOCK TO LAX FOR INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As federal investigators on Sunday questioned
employees who worked on EgyptAir Flight 990 before it left Los
Angeles, grief-stricken family members converged on Los Angeles
International Airport desperately seeking information about loved
ones who boarded the plane hours before it crashed off the
Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very difficult, anxious time for the family
members now,'' said Bonnita Wirth, an American Red Cross grief
counselor who met with three families at LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three passengers and 11 crew members were believed to
have been on the Boeing 767-300ER when it left LAX for a layover in
New York before continuing to Cairo. At least one crew member was a
regular worshipper at a Los Angeles mosque.
</P>
<P>
   But with few bodies recovered and no confirmed passenger list,
families were clinging to the faintest hope that their loved ones
survived, Wirth said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross and airport officials were unable to provide the 15
people from three families who came to LAX with much information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for the families right now is waiting for
confirmed information and that process can take a very long time,''
Wirth said. ``So it's very difficult for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one person, an EgyptAir contract employee, was known to
have exited the plane at New York's John F. Kennedy International
Airport. He was reportedly cooperative when questioned by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   No cause was immediately determined for the crash. While there
was no early evidence of foul play, FBI agents and Federal Aviation
Adminstration officials questioned ``any employee who had anything
to do with that aircraft,'' as part of standard procedure, said LAX
spokeswoman Nancy Castles. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The local Islamic community mobilized to provide support and
prayers for families who lost loved ones, said Hussam Ayloush,
executive director of the Anaheim-based Council on American-Islamic
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep holding out hope that there will be survivors, but
meanwhile those families will need all the help they can get,''
Ayloush said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Islamic Center of Southern California, more than 200
people chanted ``Allahu Akbar'' _ ``Allah is great'' _ in prayers
for two EgyptAir pilots who attend services at the mosque during
their frequent stays in Los Angeles. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; One of the pilots was Hatem Rushdy, said mosque member Aboubakr
El-Tawansy. He said he had known Rushdy for about five years, since
the pilot helped his daughter on a flight from Los Angeles to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He upgraded her seats because she wasn't breathing well in a
smoking area and was very generous with her,'' El-Tawansy said.
``Since she heard the news she's been crying and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosque members also prayed for another EgyptAir pilot they
believed was on the flight. Members spell his name Mohammed Gamal
El-Battooti, but that doesn't precisely match any names on the crew
list released by EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   El-Battooti was known for dropping by the mosque and also for
his attempts to ban alcohol on EgyptAir in keeping with the
teachings of his faith, said Ahmed ``Jimmy'' Ahmed, a worker at the
mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very friendly and kept in touch with the community,''
Ahmed said. ``He helped most of the people here with flights.''
</P>
<P>
   A family assistance center was set up in Providence, R.I., to
provide information and counseling to family members, and EgyptAir
was arranging to fly people there, Castles said.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir has set up an information line for family members
seeking information on people who may have been passengers on
Flight 990. Call (800) 243-1094.

MOORE DIES IN FONTANA CRASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM GAZZOLO  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Fun and games gave way to tragedy Sunday as CART
driver Greg Moore became the first fatality in the three-year
history of the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Moore died from massive head and internal injures at 1:21 p.m.
after being airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center. The
24-year old driver never regained consciousness after flipping
sideways and hitting the wall while coming out of turn 2 on lap 10
of the Marlboro 500.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays seemed to indicate Moore hit the brakes while
coming up on Mark Blundell's racer and lost control, half-flipping
before hitting the concrete wall sideways and then skidding down
across the track and into the grass infield.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway president Scott Atherton called it: ``The saddest day
in the history of the speedway.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who ironically lost the lead in last year's race coming
out of the same turn on the final lap, was survived by his father,
Ric, a member of his crew, and mother, Donna.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time of the accident Greg was in critical shape,''
said Dr. Steve Olvey, CART's director of medical affairs. ``We gave
him the best chance that we could given the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is the second CART driver to be killed in an accident this
year. Gonzalo Rodriguez died from injuries following his wreck in
practice at Monterey's Laguna Seca Raceway on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   CART president Andrew Craig said there was no thought to
canceling the race. However, instead of holding a victory ceremony
in the winner's circle following the race, there was a short
memorial service held on the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The final 113 laps were run under flags flying at half-staff.
When news of Moore's death was announced to the crowd, some race
fans on the infield could be seen crying.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was an up-and-coming star on the CART circuit. His
second-place finish at Fontana a year earlier propelled him to a
fifth-place finish in the points standings. He was ninth this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg clearly and unequivocally was going to be a champion in
our sport in the near future,'' Craig said. ``There is no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who drove for the Player's Forsythe Racing team, had five
career victories and four poles. He won two races last season and
captured the season-opening race at Miami-Homestead this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian driver almost didn't make the race. He was injured
in a motor bike accident Friday night at the speedway and broke a
bone at the base of his fourth finger. He was fitted with a special
brace and had to take extra practice laps Saturday to determine
whether or not he could race.
</P>
<P>
   He was re-examined again before and after warmup laps Sunday
morning and was again cleared to race. ``The question of his being
able to drive was only on the discomfort he would suffer,'' said
Dr. Greg Baumann, medical director of the California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He very much wanted to drive if at all possible. He had no
problems during warmup. We feel very strongly that the hand was not
related to the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's car was impounded and will be examined to try to learn
what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Craig canceled today's season-ending CART awards
banquet set for Hollywood. However, at the request of the family,
the dinner will go on.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Craig said, ``We will honor our champions in the memory
of Greg.''

`HAUNTED HILL' MAKES RIVALS GIVE UP GHOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moviegoers caught the Halloween spirit as ``The House on Haunted
Hill'' dominated the nation's box office with an estimated $15.1
million at 2,710 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haunted Hill,'' a remake of the 1958 Vincent Price feature
about strangers offered $1 million to spend a night in a former
insane asylum, generated impressive results amid the multiple
distractions of the Halloween weekend. The Warner Bros. release,
with Geoffrey Rush and Famke Jannsen, performed 60 percent above
the $9.1 million debut of ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' during the
same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a cliche to say it, but `The House on Haunted Hill'
was a special treat for us,'' said studio distribution chief Dan
Fellman. He noted that the film is first from Dark Castle, formed
by industry heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis to produce
low-cost horror fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haunted Hill'' attracted mostly customers under 25 who were
split evenly between male and female, according to Fellman. Its
performance, better than expected, helped lift the overall box
office to $66 million, an impressive 20 percent above the same
weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of industry tracker Reel Source,
credited Warner with solid execution of a marketing campaign aimed
at teens and young adults over the last two weeks. ``This
performance also really solidifies the fact the horror market is
doing very well,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The last five major horror films _ ``The Haunting,'' ``The Blair
Witch Project,'' ``Deep Blue Sea,'' ``The Sixth Sense'' and
``Stigmata'' _ have generated well over $600 million in domestic
grosses.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``The Best Man'' finished a
distant but respectable second with $6.5 million at 1,348 theaters
as the comedy-drama, featuring an African-American cast, lost only
28 percent from its opening weekend. ``It's doing good cross-over
business and clearly has a lot of appeal to women,'' said industry
tracker Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's sixth weekend of ``Double Jeopardy'' came in third
with $5.4 million at 2,986 theaters to pass $98 million overall.
The revenge-drama should become the 198th film to top $100 million
domestically this week.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in fourth, DreamWorks' ``American Beauty'' continued to
draw well in it seventh weekend, with $3.9 million at 1,528 sites,
edging Miramax's lukewarm opening of ``Music of the Heart'' with
$3.7 million at 1,349 theaters. Rockwell said ``Heart,'' starring
Meryl Streep in the true-life tale of an East Harlem violin
teacher, might have benefited from opening in a more limited
release to build word-of-mouth among moviegoers about the feel-good
story.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks used such a platform approach for ``American
Beauty,'' which has topped $54 million and is a contender for
Academy Awards nominations. ``Heart'' may be helped by strong early
support for Street to receive an Oscar nomination, and its 51
percent gain in business between Friday and Saturday indicates
word-of-mouth is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers took the rest of the top 10 spots as studios held back
product from what is traditionally one of the slowest moviegoing
weekends. Paramount's ``Bringing Out the Dead'' came in sixth in
its second weekend with $3.5 million at 1,947 theaters to edge 20th
Century Fox's ``Fight Club'' in its third weekend, with $3.3
million at 1,946 theaters, and Disney's ``The Sixth Sense,'' still
strong in its 13th weekend with $3.2 million at 2,051 locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' has drawn $259.8 million after 87 days at
the box office, leaving it just $300,000 short of passing ``Jaws''
as the 12th-highest domestic grosser of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's ``The Story of Us'' continued its fast fade,
dropping to ninth with $3 million at 2,175 theaters in its third
weekend, followed by Warner's ``Three Kings'' with $2.5 million at
1,851 sites in its fifth weekend, pushing its total to nearly $54
million.
</P>
<P>
   Two disappointments lost half their opening weekend audiences in
a battle for 11th, with Destination's ``Bats'' taking in $2.3
million at 2,540 theaters, edging Warner's ``Three To Tango'' with
$2.2 million at 2,234 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But two limited openings for offbeat projects generated
impressive returns, with USA Films' comedy ``Being John Malkovich''
grossing $625,000 at 25 theaters and Miramax's Japanese animated
favorite ``Princess Mononoke'' with $154,000 at eight sites. The
Malkovich comedy is expected to add at least 100 screens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haunted Hill'' will face competition next weekend from
Universal's opening of ``The Bone Collector,'' with Denzel
Washington and Angelina Jolie as detectives on the trail of a
serial killer. Also opening will be Disney's ``The Insider,''
recounting a landmark investigation of the tobacco industry, and
New Line's romantic comedy ``The Bachelor.''
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business crossed the $6 billion mark, about 8
percent ahead of last year.

MOORE'S FELLOW DRIVERS LEFT SADDENED, SPEECHLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HELMS  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ The CART drivers had come to the California Speedway
to crown a champion, not to praise a fallen competitor.
</P>
<P>
   They did both Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Greg Moore was killed after a horrifying crash on the 10th
lap of the Marlboro 500, CART lost one of its most popular drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Fernandez won the race, and Juan Montoya captured the
points championship, but neither driver was in the mood to
celebrate their achievements. They had trouble even talking
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It was a somber scene in the garage area at the California
Speedway as fellow drivers, crew members and fans grieved the loss
of the 24-year-old Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just ...,'' Fernandez said as he struggled to speak
through tears. ``It's just so hard because Greg was such a friend
of ours. We've been racing awhile. We have shared so many great
moments inside and outside of the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was described by friends as an energetic and enthusiastic
person who enjoyed life. Moore had five wins in his CART career,
including a season-opening victory in Miami. He was first among
CART drivers last year in oval events, winning the U.S. 500 at
Michigan and finishing second at the California Speedway. He was
fifth in points last year and 10th overall in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he became the youngest race winner in CART history at
22 years, one month and 10 days when he held off Michael Andretti
to win at the Milwaukee Mile. He was considered one of the
up-and-coming stars in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg was one of the new young tigers of championship car
racing, certain and unequivocally a champion of tomorrow,'' CART
president Andrew Craig said. ``He was talented, competitive,
courageous and fit, everything that is good. He really loved life
and loved having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were not told of Moore's death until after the race,
although it was announced to the California Speedway crowd while
the race was still going on after flags had been lowered to half
staff.
</P>
<P>
   A bouquet of flowers sat outside the Player's-Forsythe truck
that hauled Moore's car to the track. Devastated crew members met
in a hospitality tent behind the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I lost one of the best friends I ever had,'' driver
Dario Franchitti said. ``In the last couple of years, ever since
I've known him, we shared a lot of good times together. He was the
guy I competed the hardest with on the track, and he was the guy
that I had the most fun with away from the track. The guy was going
to be a champion, many, many times over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in shock,'' driver Michael Andretti said. ``I knew it was
a really bad accident, but I had no idea it was this bad. Greg was
a great race driver with tremendous talent, but beyond that he was
a great role model and friend to many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was to be paired with Gil de Ferran next year on a two-car
team for owner Roger Penske.

   MARATHON-SLOWS (Undated) _ The universal symbol of running has
always been the winged foot, an embodiment of the pursuit of speed.
But that emblem has begun to give way to a new symbol _ the penguin
_ that reflects a growing movement of extremely slow runners who
are changing the character of American road racing. Embracing a
kind of slow chic, this new breed of runners emphasizes fun over
achievement, rejecting the traditional asceticism of road racing
for a more relaxed, uncompetitive ethos. They have cheerfully
adopted the penguin for its girth and its waddling gait, and they
amble their way through marathons, stopping not only for a drink
but to dance or cheer or simply take in the flowers. Many members
of this new wave in running will be on display Sunday during the
30th New York City Marathon.

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``K'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WOULD triumph trump tragedy in the end Sunday? No, I think not.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tiger Woods, the once and future phenom, couldn't fully
overshadow the horrors of the week. But give this gifted young man
credit. Woods dug down and lived up to his marquee billing. He gave
his all, which is to say he gave a lot, to deflect attention from
the veil of tears that has gripped the PGA Tour since Payne
Stewart's plane plunged to earth Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very draining week,'' Woods said. ``Man, it's
been tough. I'm thankful it's over. But going out there and playing
was definitely good for me emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger conquered all, Love included. He won again, for the sixth
time in his last nine starts, with a sprint to a $900,000 payday.
Woods' star power, which seems to increase hourly, was already
verging on being larger than life. At Champions Golf Club _ the
latest fast track to feel the golfing wrath of this Tiger, Tiger
burning bright _ it dared to challenge death as well.
</P>
<P>
   Only one guy _ Woods _ could have saved such an out-of-sorts
tournament from mere afterthought status, never mind the gaudy $5
million purse, after Stewart perished.
</P>
<P>
   Only one guy _ Woods _ was sufficiently positioned to give the
final leader board more than cursory significance.
</P>
<P>
   Only one guy _ Woods _ could have turned the season-ending event
into anything more than a teary-eyed memorial to Stewart, one of
golf's most popular, accomplished and, to be sure, stylish players.
</P>
<P>
   It would be, and will forever be, Stewart's week posthumously,
signified by the plus-fours most of the lads (Tiger not included)
donned Sunday. But it was Woods' tournament every step of the way,
just as it has been his own private tour since May.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, given his seven PGA Tour titles in six months, a
feat most recently accomplished _ over an entire year _ by Johnny
Miller a quarter century ago, we can safely speak of Woods in the
same breath as we speak of former greats.
</P>
<P>
   Including the greatest, Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Two months shy of his 24th birthday, Tiger is the youngest
player to notch seven victories in a year since Horton Smith won
eight at 21 _ in 1929. His pace in the majors isn't quite the equal
of the baby Nicklaus, but he has prevailed more frequently overall
than Jack had at the same point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes, if his putts ever begin dropping on a really consistent
basis
</P>
<P>
   Woods came to Houston ranked No. 1 in greens hit in regulation
but only 84th in putts required per round. He ``burned'' a bunch
more cups Sunday, resulting in a modest final-day 69 that still
left the pack four strokes to the rear. Davis Love III placed
second, but not for a moment did he make us remotely suspect he was
a threat despite his closing 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good reason,'' Love noted, ``why Tiger's winning
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Because Tiger is amazingly, astonishingly, incredibly
good.
</P>
<P>
   And getting better. After taking five of his first 15
tournaments as a professional, following a third consecutive U.S.
Amateur championship, he concluded he didn't have solid enough
mechanics to truly make his mark on the game. The subsequent
reconstruction process took a temporary toll _ he went 3-for-43
thereafter _ but it was at the Byron Nelson in the spring when
everything suddenly clicked for him.
</P>
<P>
   He phoned his swing doc, Butch Harmon, and almost screamed into
the phone, ``I've got it!'' Then he went out and shot a 61. He
wouldn't win Dallas, but the inevitable was suddenly upon us. Tiger
has been terrorizing his PGA competition, such as it is, ever
since. Factor in a victory in Germany, and he has taken seven
titles in 10 tournaments entered, including three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   His lead in 1999's cash dash is now nearly $2 million over David
Duval. Rivalry? What rivalry? There is no rivalry anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It has turned into Tiger vs. history. He's lapping the field, as
we suspected he might do. Somehow, Woods is managing to live up to
the most unrealistic of expectations we established for him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with every triumph, those go up, up, up. And how high
is Woods' sky?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said, smiling. ``We'll see. I always felt I
would start to win in bunches because of all the work I've done,
and I'm going to keep paying my dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I want to get to? It's like the Army commercial, I
guess _ to be the best I can be. Over the course of the next 20
years, we'll see what happens. I don't know what that is, but I can
tell you one thing: I will continue to work very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a threat as much as a promise. And it bodes rather
ill for the competitive balance of the PGA Tour entering the new
millennium.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ Erik Williams forgot that in some cases, two points
is better than seven. Deion Sanders forgot to cover his man. And
the Dallas Cowboys forgot it's OK to keep scoring when ahead.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first two were unusual occurrences, but the third has become
all too familiar for the Cowboys, who lost to the Indianapolis
Colts 34-24 Sunday before a crowd of 56,860 at the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for what happened today,'' Dallas running
back Emmitt Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Cowboys (4-3) fell into third place in the
NFC East behind Washington (5-2) and the New York Giants (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   Losers of their last eight non-division road games, the Cowboys
have squandered leads in all three of their defeats this season.
After assuming a 17-3 edge in Sunday's second quarter, they didn't
score again until late in the third _ after the Colts (5-2) had put
up 18 unanswered points to take a 21-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a problem putting four quarters together
or not,'' Smith said. ``Last week, we played well (against the
Redskins). I don't think we had a problem putting four quarters
together last week. The thing we have to learn to do as a team is
be more consistent. We can't play the first half like lights out,
then start off the second half slow and sluggish and let the other
team creep back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when the other team boasts blossoming superstars
Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin Harrison. Manning
completed 22 of 34 passes for 312 yards and one touchdown. Harrison
caught six balls for 85 yards and a touchdown, and James carried 26
times for 113 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offense is one of the most talented I've seen in
years,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   And he should know. It's the first one this year that hasn't
shied away from his side of the field, and the gamble paid off. In
a rarely seen Cowboys lowlight, Harrison put 20 yards between
himself and Sanders, caught a pass and flew 40 yards into the end
zone. The touchdown gave the Colts a 28-24 lead with 14:55 to play
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking right in the backfield, and the guy ran right
past me,'' Sanders said. ``I'm not blaming it on the safety, not
blaming it on nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only one of several unsettling moments for the Cowboys.
The worst came in the third period when Chad Bratzke came around
the right side and sacked Troy Aikman at the Dallas 12. The ball
came loose and bounced toward the Cowboys' end zone. Williams got a
hand on the ball, but instead of falling on it and handing the
Colts two points for a safety, he batted it away from the end zone.
Bratzke came up with it at the Dallas one.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was an easy plunge for James, and the Colts had
their first lead of the game, 21-17, with 8:01 to go in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most unique play I have ever had,'' Bratzke said.
``I got the sack and stripped the ball. I felt a lot of people
around me, so I just tried to knock the ball toward our end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also one series Aikman missed after suffering one of
his four sacks. A helmet-to-helmet collision with Jeff Burris left
him dizzy and blurred his vision. Backup Jason Garrett directed one
drive of minus-one yard while Aikman was administered smelling
salts. Aikman was able to return for the final two possessions of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was remembering the plays and what we were doing,'' Aikman
said, ``so I felt I could go back in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that featured a bit of everything. Sanders
returned the Colts' first punt 76 yards to the Indianapolis two. He
was chased down and caught by Colts punter Hunter Smith, who
Sanders said ``had the eye of the tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was taken off the hook this time, however, because
Emmitt Smith ran for the final two yards on Dallas' first offensive
play, giving the Cowboys a 7-0 lead with 2:02 elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter came a blocked punt, with newly acquired
Dallas special-teamer Lemanski Hall getting to Hunter Smith's next
attempt. Darren Hambrick recovered to give the Cowboys possession
at the Indy 24. Seven plays later, Richie Cunningham booted a
24-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Colts had surrendered 17 points by halftime, their
defense didn't feel like it was getting pounded. The Cowboys had
only one sustained drive, a 13-play, 60-yard possession that
culminated in a four-yard touchdown run by Chris Warren with 10:26
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we spotted them 10 points on the punt return and
the blocked punt,'' Manning said. ``We felt like we could still
score points, and we knew we had to start converting some third
downs. We finally started doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts scored on five of their six second-half possessions,
failing only when they were trying to run out the clock and turned
the ball over on downs. They scored touchdowns on their first three
possessions of the half, then added field goals of 33 and 27 yards
by Mike Vanderjagt, who already had 43- and 30-yarders in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts converted five of 13 third-down plays, while the
Cowboys were successful on only two of nine. And the Colts managed
414 yards of total offense while the Cowboys eked out just 232.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's longest pass was a 22-yarder to tight end David
LaFleur. Manning completed passes of 54, 40 and 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing like a good team this far into the season,''
said Dallas defensive tackle Chad Hennings. ``We haven't been able
to put four quarters together in the three phases, pure and
simple.''

 By RICHARD DEAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Twenty-three of the 29 golfers at the Tour Championship on Sunday
wore knickers in tribute to Payne Stewart, a rival and friend who
died tragically Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Appleby went a step further. Appleby wore Stewart's
clothing for the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one thing that I wore on my body today that was
mine, and you're not looking at it,'' said Appleby, who looked like
Stewart on the Cypress Creek Course at Champions Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was the most recognizable golfer on the PGA Tour because
of his trademark knickers and Ben Hogan-style tam-o'-shanter cap,
which was his tribute to golfers of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Tour players originally were undecided on how to show their
respect for Stewart, who was on board an ill-fated Learjet on
Monday to Dallas and then was to come to Houston to participate in
the Tour Championship. Only the top 30 money-winners were eligible
for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of dressing similiar to Stewart was shared by Tom
Lehman, who ordered the knickers for any of the golfers who were
interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea just popped into my head,'' said Appleby, who resides
in Orlando, Fla., where Stewart lived. ``Why not do it? He'd be
laughing at us thinking he was the only one wearing stuff, and now
he has twenty-some-odd guys wearing it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd think it would be quite funny.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's 27 holes were concluded, Appleby flew home to
Orlando to help console Stewart's wife, Tracey, and attend
Stewart's memorial service Friday before play at the Tour
Championship resumed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby proposed the idea of wearing knickers for Sunday's final
round to several golfers, and the response was positive and
approved by Tracey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Ian Baker-Finch; he said, `Great idea,''' Appleby
said. ``And I asked Tracey what do you think, and she said `Great.'
So I just went upstairs and raided his closet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart's clothes were an almost perfect fit for Appleby,
except the cap was tight.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes were a size 12, and both have a waist of 33 inches.
The outfit Appleby chose to wear had a Scottish look and had blue
socks, shirt and cap with red-plaid pants.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby had plenty from which to choose. The hard part was
deciding on colors and combination, but Baker-Finch served as his
fashion coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable selection,'' Appleby said. ``If you had
them all lined up together it was enough to supply this field for a
whole week.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Appleby's way of honoring Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be him, I can only look like him,'' said Appleby, who
finished tied for 26th in the 29-man field. Sunday. Appleby shot a
final-round 74 for a 285 total, 16 strokes back of winner Tiger
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to miss him,'' Appleby said of Stewart. ``The
public's going to miss Payne Stewart. His difference from the
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss his passion for the game. His fire. And on
the personal side, his family is going to miss him. The memories he
made are going to be talked about for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer Stewart, the sixth-ranked golfer in the world, won
the U.S. Open at Pinehurst and in September was a member of the
winning U.S. Ryder Cup team. Entering the Tour Championship he was
third on the money-earning list and enjoying his finest year as a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby said he did not wear the clothing Stewart wore the
Sunday of winning the U.S. Open out of respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we better not do the U.S. Open color,'' Appleby said.
``We'd leave that with him. That was his swan song. We tried to
come up with a scheme. It's confusing actually because there's too
many to pick from.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby had a special link to Stewart on Sunday by wearing
Stewart's clothes and also has a link with Tracey. Appleby knows
about grieving. In the summer of 1998, Appleby's wife, Renay, was
killed in a bizarre automobile accident in London.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby can fit in Stewart's clothes but he said he could never
emulate Stewart's golf swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt really weird,'' Appleby said. ``It's like walking in
his shoes for one day. I felt like him for one day even though my
swing wasn't as fluid as his and I didn't putt as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long week for the players, who paid their last
respects to Stewart and tried to concentrate on a tournament.
Woods' first-place money was $900,000 of the total purse of $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the guys are happy at least to finish the week on
that note,'' Appleby said. ``I'm glad I did it and I'm glad Tracey
said it was OK.''

ANGELS SETTLE ON STONEMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels will hold a news conference today at noon
to announce they have hired West Covina High graduate Bill Stoneman
as the club's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman, who has been a front office executive with the
Montreal Expos since 1983, was expected to be named GM before the
start of the World Series. Angels president Tony Tavares had
decided on Stoneman, but Walt Disney Co. chairman and CEO Michael
Eisner suddenly decided to get involved in the interview process.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner had Bob Watson, Omar Minaya and Jim Duquette come back
for repeat interviews, and the club also called in White Sox
assistant GM Dan Evans for an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Stoneman ultimately became the club's choice. His experience
with the Expos _ developing quality players despite a significant
lack of funds _ impressed the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It also signifies a change in Stoneman's career goals. In
previous years, Stoneman had turned down inquiries about his
availability as a GM because he didn't want a job with limited
security while his children were growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have an interest in being a GM in the past,''
said Stoneman, who graduated from West Covina High in 1962 and also
attended Mt. San Antonio College. ``I never really pursued it. But
I came to a point in my life where now both of our kids are grown
and living on their own. So really it's only the two of us left.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman will be expected to get to work immediately, with his
first duty to hire a manager. Don Baylor, who was the top choice of
many in the organization, was hired by the Cubs. Chris Chambliss,
the Yankees hitting coach, is a top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman also will have 11 days of exclusive negotiating rights
with pitcher Chuck Finley. After Nov. 11, Finley is free to talk
with all clubs.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Tom Lehman thought it was an idea that had no downside. He found
out different when it came to executing his brainstorm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lehman was the force behind the push to have all the players
wear knickers Sunday at the Tour Championship as a tribute to the
late Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   He was the one who contacted Stewart's clothing company and had
a box of knickers, argyle socks and tam-o'-shanters shipped to
Houston on Friday. Saturday night, most players were trying them on
in the locker room, and it became clear a lot of them were
agreeable to wearing them as a tribute to Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was against it at the beginning of the week,'' Davis Love
III said. ``I didn't think we should put pressure on guys to do
something they didn't want to do. If half the guys did it and half
didn't, they would feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told Tom Lehman when we got out there (Sunday) that this
just feels right. The fans are going to enjoy it. And we'll always
remember this tournament. You can pick out this event on highlights
from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 24 of the 29 players did some sort of
sartorial tribute to Stewart, who wore his outfit throughout
virtually his entire career. The ones who didn't were winner Tiger
Woods, David Duval, John Huston, Carlos Franco and Brent Geiberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of ruined my day,'' Lehman said. ``I felt bad because
some of the guys felt bad for not wearing them. I didn't want some
guys to feel like they were being forced to do something that they
weren't comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it with the best of intentions. It was a symbolic move
from the heart. But it didn't work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was being too hard on himself. The gesture was beautiful,
and it was something fans got a kick out of. And if Stewart had
been there to give his say, he would have been in favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just kind of our way of saying we're not going to
forget you, Payne,'' Lehman said. ``But I understand that different
guys have different ways of doing it. And if it's something that
you're not comfortable doing, we understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has their own beliefs and their own way to mourn,''
Maggert said. ``If you feel awkward about something like that, then
you shouldn't do it. You have to feel right about it. And it's no
disrespect not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those players who chose not to don the knickers, Duval and
Woods explained their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comfort thing in my case,'' Duval said. ``As it
turned out, I wouldn't have been able to wear them anyway because
there were none in there that were my size.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there had been a pair my size, I still would have
chosen not to wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Woods' case, he said his character trait of internalizing
things was the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have an internal resolve, then that's the way you
handle it,'' Woods said. ``I don't need to show it outwardly, the
pain I feel inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for how much I hold Payne in honor. I don't need to do
that. Other players may feel differently, but that's the way I
feel.''

HACKETT WILY ABOUT FOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a 3-5 record, there's not much worth saying
about USC, so a possible quarterback controversy adds a little
diversion from the Trojans' tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   If there really is a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett warned Sunday not to believe what he says
about who will start at quarterback this week. But all indications
continued to point to fifth-year senior John Fox starting for the
first time in two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Hackett said he will make a decision Tuesday between
Fox and current starter Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, Hackett admitted Sunday that he ``sort of''
already decided which quarterback he would select.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not really sure yet,'' Hackett added.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his comments Sunday, though, it sure sounds like Fox is
the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, we've lost four in a row and we're looking for
a spark. We need a shot in the arm of adrenaline,'' Hackett said.
``We need it from somebody. Something needs to happen to this team.
We don't have the spark right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something Hackett might believe he could get by starting
Fox on Saturday against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, he is lying. Remember this quote last year,
after Hackett said Van Raaphorst would start against Washington and
really started Carson Palmer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I lie sometimes. I thought I'd let you guys know that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is remaining a little cautious this week, in part
because he doesn't want to tip off Arizona State. He thinks it
might have made a difference last year against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This situation is hardly as dramatic, but Hackett wants to keep
an edge if he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to stay on the fence here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was being gracious when evaluating Fox's 12-of-25
effort for 226 yards and one touchdown in the 17-7 loss to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rustiness shows up but the excitement and running around
shows up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another change possible at quarterback, although it's
not likely to happen this season. Hackett said he will study the
idea of using the shotgun formation in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   He previously opposed any thought of using the shotgun. But the
question persists after the Trojans allowed nine sacks against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to the concept,'' Hackett said. ``But it's
probably a little ambitious right now. To do it in midseason, with
an iffy quarterback situation and centers who haven't practiced it,
it seems a little ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced after the (Cal) game, the shotgun would have
made a lot of difference. I mean, on first-and-10, we wouldn't be
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC's game against Arizona State on Saturday at the
Coliseum will kickoff at 3:30 p.m. and be televised on Fox Sports
West.... Wide receiver R. Jay Soward (strained hamstring) did not
practice Sunday and remains questionable. Offensive lineman Brent
McCaffrey (ankle) is also questionable.... The perplexing stat for
Hackett was that the Trojans had 18 drives against Cal and not one
started in the Golden Bears' territory.... USC had 13 penalties
against Cal, and four were declined. Four of the penalties were for
blocking in the back.

SLOPPY START DOOMS DUCKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ For several years, no team has stirred the emotions of
the Mighty Ducks more than the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, however, a mysterious lack of intensity and Mikhail
Shtalenkov turned the Pond into a house of horrors for the Ducks
and the 13,896 that suffered through the 3-0 Halloween-night loss.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after beating Washington, the Ducks flatlined their way
through the first period, giving up a shorthanded goal and digging
themselves a hole that former Ducks goalie Shtalenkov kept them in
the rest of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about taking the next step, this isn't what we
wanted,'' Teemu Selanne said. ``Last game we were so happy, now
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did pick up the pace in the second and third periods
and outshot the Coyotes 33-24. But the Ducks never slipped one past
their former backup goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov, who has stopped all 54 shots in two games against
the Ducks, turned away great scoring chances by Paul Kariya,
Selanne, Tony Hrkac and Jim McKenzie in the period. He also had
some help. Defenseman Keith Carney dove to knock away Matt Cullen's
shot at an empty net that would have tied the game three minutes
into the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to help my defensemen, they try to help me,'' deadpanned
Shtalenkov, who is 5-1 with three shutouts against his former team.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov stopped Kariya from point-blank range early in the
third and then watched the Ducks hit the post on back-to-back shots
in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some nights things just go your way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya said the Ducks didn't deserve any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances, but when you aren't doing the little things
right, you aren't going to be rewarded,'' he said. ``When you are
working hard you get the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' power play, ranked No. 1 last season, came into the
game ranked 23rd and certainly did nothing to improve. Anaheim was
0 for 3 with the man advantage and gave up its second shorthanded
goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hrkac couldn't handle Oleg Tverdovsky's pass at the Phoenix blue
line and Trevor Letowski scored on a breakaway at 13:15, slipping a
backhander through Guy Hebert's pads.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (6-6-1-1) are treading water. Anaheim's 14 points in
October equals its best total in the opening month, but that hardly
leaves Kariya feeling satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hovering around .500, and that is not acceptable,''
he said of a Ducks team which has yet to win more than two
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, a lost faceoff led to the goal that all
but sealed the Ducks' fate. Jeremy Roenick beat Cullen cleanly, and
Deron Quint's shot from the left point was deflected through
Hebert's legs at 13:08.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ducks center Travis Green scored an empty-netter with
2:14 to go in the third.

`MNF' OFFERS NATIONAL SETTING FOR SEAHAWKS TO SHOW THEY'RE REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ Only in the NFL _ a sport built on, by and for
television _ can a team's relative worth be measured accurately by
its value to network TV.
</P>
<P>
   All sports have marquee teams that draw the biggest TV interest,
but no sport has a stage like Monday Night Football, ABC's 30-year
institution that by its success altered the game as well as how TV
covered sports.
</P>
<P>
   MNF is so big a deal in jockland that to be excluded is an
embarrassment. Since the event has left the Seahawks off its invite
list since 1992, their appearance Monday night against the Packers
here is mindful of the time the Clampetts loaded up the truck and
moved to Beverly. Hills, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks fans are well versed in the dreary liturgy that the
club has not been to the playoffs since 1988 and hasn't had a
winning season since 1990. All the larger world of pro football
knows is that for most of the last decade, the Seahawks, absent
prime time, haven't registered.
</P>
<P>
   Flatliners. A backwater. A one-headed calf.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night is the debutante ball for the Seahawks. The
runway is the game's most hallowed ground, against the most storied
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay
Packers,'' said Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, ``is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it in comparative context:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Yankees of the NFL,'' said longtime Packers center
Frank Winters. ``You think about the championships both teams have
won. You think of Mantle with the Yankees and Starr with the
Packers. The Packers are also a team owned and loved by its
community. It makes the place extra special.''
</P>
<P>
   To Holmgren's credit, he hasn't issued a football coach's usual
moronic pay-no-attention command regarding the atmospherics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best pure football stadium in the country,''
he said. ``I've tried to tell my players about what a special place
it is. I really want them to soak it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The travelogue is worthwhile; the Seahawks haven't played here
since 1981. Besides, for Holmgren to suggest otherwise would be
stupid, calling into question just why it was such a big deal to
hire him away from here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks haven't played in a game with such trappings in a
long while. For Holmgren, the game is bigger on a level beyond his
return to where he was hailed, and a little bit reviled.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare opportunity to justify, in his first season on the
new job, why he's worth more money than anyone in the NFL not
wearing a plastic hat.
</P>
<P>
   For Holmgren to walk away from what was a great job in this town
took a lot of gumption, something his critics interpret as a
runaway ego. As with colleagues who occupy multiple roles, such as
Miami's Jimmy Johnson and Denver's Mike Shananan, the pressure is
enormous to back up the boldness with results. Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the Packers' home-field advantage and talent
superiority, especially with quarterback Brett Favre _ as well as
the Seahawks' injury absence of center Kevin Glover _ Holmgren and
his assistants have to use the extra time for a Monday game to
outsmart their Packers successors.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night has not been kind lately to Holmgren. In his final
season as Packers coach last year, he lost all three MNF games:
34-27 to Minnesota, 27-20 to Pittsburgh, and 24-22 to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Packers coach Ray Rhodes acknowledged that the time puts the
onus on both staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long week, and the more you see, the more you add,'' he
said. ``It puts an emphasis on game planning. Mike knows everything
this offense is going to do. And vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's up to us (coaches) to make a false key here, or a
false key there, to make things happen. We practice against (the
Seahawks' West Coast offense) every day, so it comes down to game
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation for Holmgren was similar to what he encountered as
Green Bay coach in 1995 when he first met his previous team, the
San Francisco 49ers, where he had been offensive coordinator. His
knowledge of Niners offensive tendencies helped create an upset
victory in an NFC semifinal game in Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Seahawks pull off an upset Monday night in the
showcase game, the implications go beyond the bump in the W column.
They will draw instant national legitimacy for the rest of a season
where rampant parity has left no opponents on the remaining
schedule that can be considered formidable (the non-division foes
are Cincinnati, Tampa Bay and the New York Jets).
</P>
<P>
   A victory is also a handy recruiting tool, since the Monday game
is the only one most NFL players can kick back and enjoy,
particularly those free agents who like to do some early scouting.
</P>
<P>
   A loss, however, means the entire Holmgren acquisition was a
bust, the Seahawks are doomed and Rhodes will be declared a genius
superior to Lombardi and Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   See how intense this Monday night business is?

HUSKIES FORGE NEW, WINNING IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Who are the Washington Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   They're a bunch of accident-prone thrillers who won't take
``no'' for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   They're exciting. They make mistakes. They make one-handed
pickoffs out of thin air. They throw egregious interceptions. They
come back.
</P>
<P>
   Their best player is the guy with the ball in his hands all the
time. Another of their best players is a defensive back who can
make interceptions exactly when the Huskies need them most.
</P>
<P>
   They kick field goals from 47 and 49 yards when Huskies kickers
haven't scored from those spots consistently in years. They look
completely juvenile and mistake-prone one play. Then they spend
yardage-eating drives proving themselves otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Against Stanford Saturday in Husky Stadium, a sophomore named
Terry Tharps kept zig-zagging kickoff returns to the Washington 1
and still the Huskies found a way to go 99 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. Down, 23-12, in the third quarter. You're on your own
1. Your quarterback has a sore butt that at halftime had teammates
wondering if Marques Tuiasosopo could even get out of his chair,
and poof, next thing you know, you're hauling 99 yards downfield
for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, who are these Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   If you had asked anyone that question about eight weeks ago,
it's almost a guarantee that you would have gotten some shrugs of
the shoulders and a few furrowed brows, as if to say: Who really
knows?
</P>
<P>
   It figured to be an experiment requiring dedication and patience
with a premium placed on the future: When the new recruits arrived,
when better athletes showed up, refusing UCLA or Florida State or
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there was the new coach _ villified across the nation
because he is lucky enough to be making huge money.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new staff which had to kick into dangerous
overdrive to catch up on recruiting and scheme devising.
</P>
<P>
   There was a gutsy new starting quarterback completely different
than the classic drop-back passing quarterback last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, last but not least, there was a collection of players who
had spent their entire careers at the University of Washington
wallowing in the post-sanctions era. There was a sluggishness and
stagnation that seemed to slow the players down to three-quarters
time.
</P>
<P>
   And as the team wallowed, everyone from Snohomish to Vancouver
was wondering, ``How is this team going to turn around?''
</P>
<P>
   For awhile there, as the Huskies lost a close opener to BYU and
failed to defend against Air Force's well-oiled option, Rick
Neuheisal attempted to pass off the 1999 Huskies as a ``work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the fourth week, that label seemed decidedly
conservative, especially in the bouyant moments after the Huskies
handily defeated Oregon. The Dawgs had kicked off conference play
with a eye-popping bang.
</P>
<P>
   And now _ with the comeback victory over Stanford, a 4-1 Pac-10
record and all eyes trained on Pasadena _ the 1999 Huskies have so
far exceeded expectations. It should be considered a gift to the
college football-adoring public that this November, the Huskies are
going to play three games that matter.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we put ourselves in a position to win against
BYU, it showed we had some character,'' senior Joe Jarzykna said.
</P>
<P>
   It must be remembered that of all the players Neuheisal and his
staff had to convince, seniors like Jarzynka would serve as the
toughest sells.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Jarzynka sees his playing time diminished and even
as he gets benched for fumbles made after ill-advised punt returns,
Jarzynka professes loyalty to the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the coaching staff has done a great job. It's hard to
come into a new program and deal with a lot of guys you don't know
and be able to gain their confidence. It's a two-way street. You
can't demand respect and not earn it from your players. You can't
expect anything without giving something out. I think we've done a
pretty good job on both sides of earning respect and dealing with
each other,'' Jarzynka said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important things that has happened in making the
Huskies so eager and able to hang in with the new staff and new
schemes, even when they have fallen behind in games, is that every
player is getting a fair chance to earn a spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a little bit of talent, but we also had guys
who've been waiting to play. Some guys were really anxious to play.
People who really wanted to win,'' Jarzynka said.
</P>
<P>
   By letting everyone compete, there is a program-wide aura of
togetherness and competitiveness that now drives these Dawgs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Rick Neuheisal's team. This is the Washington
Huskies. I'm just part of it,'' said Neuheisal, sounding like he
might just as well play free safety as call the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to become the Washington Huskies. Don James came to
fall camp. Jim Lambright came to our banquet. For all the turmoil,
we're still all Huskies. I'm just the guy who decides to go for it
on fourth down.''
</P>
<P>
   To say that Neuheisal and the Huskies are experiencing a form of
``beginner's luck'' would probably earn a person a trip to the Dawg
Pound.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever it is these Dawgs are up to, the winds of change
have whipped up the scent of roses for the start of this important,
anticipated November.

UCLA'S SOLE PURPOSE: BEAT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pac-10 title vanished weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A winning season disappeared Saturday night in the Pasadena
haze.
</P>
<P>
   So did a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   November's here, and the UCLA Bruins have one goal left in this
disastrous season: beat USC. They must wait three torturous weeks
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ineligible for a bowl, but that's not the important
thing,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said after the 33-7 loss to Arizona.
``The important thing is to finish strong. I don't want any
finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get any. Not even close. The Bruins (3-6, 1-5) have
been more unified in defeat than they were in glory. They won 10
games last year, they challenged for a national title and won the
Pac-10, but they could not avoid an offense-defense rift. This
year, as the losses mount, internal conflicts remain dormant.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's a result of UCLA's inexperience. The young players
are not as outspoken _ and not as desperate to win _ as last year's
vocal senior class. Then again, since both units are struggling, no
one has ammunition with which to sling criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be able to stick together,'' offensive tackle
Brian Polak said. ``Maybe this bye week will settle it, clear our
heads so we can concentrate on Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The bye, although welcome, is weeks late. The Bruins needed it
after the Oct. 16 loss to Cal, when a winning season was possible.
At this point, a bye provides the chance to heal their bodies and
clean their psyches, but it's not going to change the season.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains is the postscript, and that comes Nov. 20 in
the Coliseum against the only team in the conference with
disappointment to match UCLA's: The Bruins and Trojans were a
combined 2-8 in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself and the seniors have two opportunities to leave their
mark on UCLA football,'' fullback Durell Price said. ``Yeah, 5-6 is
not a good record, but it's better than 3-8.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bruins' season had come to _ the difference
between three wins and five, the difference between spoiling
Washington's Pac-10 title and winning it themselves, the difference
between hope and belief. UCLA has plenty of the former and little
of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what kind of team we are,'' receiver Freddie
Mitchell said. ``There's a lot of obstacles, and this is one we've
got to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much Toledo can do. He won't _ and shouldn't _
change quarterbacks. He's playing all available freshmen and
sophomores. He can't heal the injured or turn followers into
leaders. He can't change the offense or revamp the defense; it's
too late in the season for major revisions.
</P>
<P>
   All he can do is spend two weeks rebuilding confidence and hope
the Bruins are ready for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If they spend too much time thinking about USC, they'll be
crushed by Washington and won't have anything left for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got two games, and SC will come,'' linebacker Tony
White said. ``We need to focus on Washington. They can embarrass us
if we don't regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Washington game Nov. 13 is expected to start at 12:30
p.m. An official announcement is expected today.

BAKER LIKING HOW HE LOOKS, PLAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You cannot blame Vin Baker if some days he empathizes
with Oprah and Liz and Luther Vandross _ folks with chronic weight
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the Sonics' 6-foot-11 forward, knows his way around a
kitchen. But now, at least, he has a nutritionist to guide him.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had built a reputation as one of the more dominant power
forwards in the game _ until spectators began gawking at his
waistline more than his wicked outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the question.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly question born out of Baker's battle with the bulge
and poor performances last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do you weigh?'' Baker is often asked after long,
sweat-drenching workouts with weights and on the StairMaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me at all. I know how hard I'm working,''
Baker said. ``I didn't turn down (the media) when I was heavy and I
haven't turned down (the media) now. I don't worry about who says
what. The final product, me being on the floor, will be the
tell-all. I can say every day how much I weigh or I'm getting
better. When you see me on the court and you see me playing better
... that's what people want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a new NBA season, Baker is ready to introduce a
meaner, leaner version of himself.
</P>
<P>
   He says his weight is down from more than 270 pounds last season
to 262. His teammates and coaches see reasons for optimism. Aside
from having regained his confidence, he is decisively quicker on
the court.
</P>
<P>
   For Baker, that makes all the difference in the world.
</P>
<P>
   His effectiveness is predicated on being more mobile than most
power forwards and centers. Baker was an all-star when he exploded
past big men, or faced them and drilled a midrange jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   When he was overweight, he lacked versatility and became an
average player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much better than he was last year and he's the strength
of this team,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to get up and down the floor. He's blocking shots.
He's getting rebounds. He doesn't have to hurry his shot as much.
He's just in better condition and playing with more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing fat on Baker now is his wallet. The expectations
that go with helping the Sonics get back to the playoffs are heavy,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Baker signed a seven-year, $87 million contract this summer. The
Sonics made the commitment to Baker even after his worst NBA
season. A recent list in USA Today had Baker ranked 24th,
statistically, among power forwards last season.
</P>
<P>
   He averaged 13.8 points and 6.2 rebounds in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   The team is betting that Baker returns to the form he was in
when it traded Shawn Kemp for him in 1997. Baker averaged 19.2
points and 8 rebounds his first season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's only way of giving the Sonics' some degree of protection
was agreeing to a weight clause. The team can randomly weigh Baker
each month. He will lose money if he doesn't meet a required
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Because muscle is heavier than fat, Baker can carry a few extra
pounds as long as his body fat is reasonably low.
</P>
<P>
   Though Baker's conditioning is not 100 percent, he doubts his
weight will ever be an issue again. He said he developed a new work
ethic with the help of Sonics strength coach Dwight Daub.
</P>
<P>
   Daub worked with Baker throughout the summer. He is at the
Sonics' practice facility to receive Baker well before most players
arrive. A typical day has Baker lifting weights before practices
and games, working on the StairMaster afterward, and running
sometime in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything we've asked,'' Daub said. ``You see
there's a real commitment there. You can tell that he's encouraged
by how his body has reacted. He's in very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker averaged 31 minutes _ more than anyone on the team _
during the preseason for the purpose of conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been hard to do,'' Baker said of the extensive
workouts. ``Once you start seeing results, and you hear people say
you're looking better, it's not hard getting up. I know the goal I
want to reach. And I know the people are depending on me in
Seattle. So getting up and going before practice about 45 minutes
on the treadmill is not hard at all. I can see the difference in my
body and in my play.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, there isn't much emphasis put on preseason statistics.
The case was different for Baker, who searched for positive signs.
Particularly encouraging for the Sonics was how Baker ended the
preseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In the finale, Baker collected 21 points and eight rebounds
against Vancouver. He also sank a buzzer-beating, game-winning
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   At least one teammate had been reassured the night before when
Baker lit up Sacramento (with Chris Webber and Vlade Divac
defending him) for 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, `Is he back?''' Payton snapped at a group of
reporters after the game. ``Shoot, he was an all-star for four
years, then he has one bad 50-game season. I don't see that he ever
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you be surprised he had 31 points? I'm not
surprised. He should do that every night. Shoot, you guys are the
ones who wrote him off after one bad season.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. Baker took the blame for his debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is clear he's taken his comeback personally, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I was a key part of missing the playoffs,''
Baker said. ``And I want to see that I hold up my end of the deal
this year so we can get back into playoff position.''

GALAXY KEEPS ITS COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Looking more winded and desperate than a Dallas team
that supposedly spent most of its energy getting here, the Galaxy
beat the Burn 2-1 on Sunday in the type of game it usually gave
away in the past.
</P>
<P>
   While Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid was figuring his shootout lineup
with less than a minute to play, defender Ezra Hendrickson scored
from an impossible angle. On an attempted cross, he got a gift
deflection off Burn defender Bryan Haynes that rolled inside the
near post with 40 seconds left _ leaving Los Angeles one win away
from the MLS championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of afternoon for the Galaxy, which saw its 1-0
lead erased in the 75th minute by Dallas striker Ariel Graziani _
ending Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman's scoreless streak at 313
minutes in front of 17,372 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But for a change, the Galaxy won a game when it was ripe for an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams find a way to win when they're not playing as well
as they're capable of playing,'' midfielder Danny Pena said. ``Us
not playing well had a lot to do with Dallas. They didn't allow us
to do what we normally do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't matter, this game is about results in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three
Western Conference final series with the Burn. Game 2 is Sunday at
the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, Schmid figured the Galaxy would be able to wear
Dallas down in the second half because the Burn had just finished a
penalty-filled three-game series with Chicago while the Galaxy had
a week off.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how it worked out as Dallas had more chances at the
end with the Galaxy back-pedaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got possession of the ball we turned it over when
normally we don't,'' Schmid said. ``And our decision making wasn't
as sharp as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? ``You know ... it just wasn't one of our best
game's of the season, that's for sure,'' Schmid said. ``Anytime you
get into a game like this sometimes nerves play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (Dallas) looked a little fresher in the second
half, and for some reason we stuttered _ but we got the win anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't allow ourselves to have another game like this.
We need to play better in Dallas and I assure you we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson, who joked that his teammates nicknamed him ``The
Solution'' long ago, was certainly opportunistic.
</P>
<P>
   All he was trying to do was set up someone in front of the goal
when his cross defected off Haynes, rolling past the outstretched
fingers of Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a minute to go I just wanted to make something happen,''
Hendrickson said. ``You don't expect to get rewarded on a cross
like that, but luck play's a big part in this game. Hopefully, we
can take some of this momentum to Dallas with us.''

ALL EYES ON HOLMGREN IN RETURN TO LAMBEAU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ After a seven-year banishment rooted in poor
performances and even poorer ownership decisions, the Seahawks
return to Monday Night Football this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the 10-year playoff drought, the longest in the NFL.
Never mind that the Seahawks haven't had a winning season since
1990. Try and dash the memories of the Behrings' bumbling ownership
and that ill-fated attempt to move the franchise to Southern
California in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The league apparently has.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was Mike Holmgren jumping from the Packers to the
Seahawks, and the fact that his new team just happened to be
scheduled to play his old team at fabled Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITAL) Voila. (END ITAL) The Seahawks suddenly were deemed
ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to feel wanted again,'' said defensive end Michael
Sinclair, the sarcasm laid on thick as he offered a playful grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you suppose it was that got us back on the Big Game?''
added Sinclair, who joins defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy as the
only players still on the roster from the Seahawks' last MNF
appearance in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It's Holmgren vs. his former team.
</P>
<P>
   It's Holmgren vs. the fans in this city, where he returned
winning to a hamlet that modestly calls itself Title Town.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Holmgren vs. Brett Favre, the wild-child
quarterback he nurtured into a three-time league MVP.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Holmgren vs. Ray Rhodes, his former defensive
coordinator who succeeded him as Packers head coach after Holmgren
jumped to the Seahawks in January.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still just a football game between 4-2 teams, each
needing a victory to maintain a share of its division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great matchup and people are going to try to make more
of it than it really is,'' Favre offered in one of those too-late
statements. ``It's us against Seattle. It's not Mike Holmgren
against Brett Favre. But people are going to make it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both need to win this game for obvious reasons, not for
personal satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what the Seahawks need to do to pull off an upset against
the Packers, who are favored by five points and have won 33 of
their past 34 regular-season games at Lambeau:
</P>
<P>
   -- Be aggressive _ This is one of those games where the Seahawks
can't afford to let it come to them. They must force the issue from
the opening kickoff. Score early. Stop the Packers early. Act like
they belong, rather than being invited guests to Holmgren's
homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we have to do is slow down the running game,''
linebacker Chad Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Isn't that just putting the ball, and the game, into
Favre's hands? Despite playing with a sore thumb on his passing
hand, he has led the Packers to three victories in the final two
minutes of games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's second-and-5, you don't know what they're going to
do,'' Brown said. ``If it's second-and-8, they become more
predictable. That allows us to dictate more to them, which allows
you to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Be creative _ The conservative, keep-it-close-until-the-end
approach that Holmgren used in victories over the Bears and the
loss to the Chargers won't cut it this week. Neither will trying to
get into a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks must do things that will surprise the Packers and
knock them back on their heels. It won't be easy, not with Holmgren
knowing the Packers as well as he does and the Packers knowing
Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know each other extremely well,'' Rhodes said. ``I think
the bottom line is going to be the adjustments that they see versus
our defense and vice versa. It's going to be little things like
that that will make the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Be precise _ The Seahawks continue to thrive on turnovers.
The defense has scored twice while setting up two of the offense's
nine touchdowns and a pair of field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Favre will throw into coverage, a daring trait that Holmgren
worked so hard to curtail but which has resurfaced this season.
Last week, the Seahawks got their hands on 15 of Doug Flutie's
passes. Favre will provide them with opportunities for
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Jon Kitna has thrown only two interceptions in 148
attempts _ the primary reason his QB rating of 92.4 tops the AFC.
But both set up touchdowns by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers will make Kitna pay if he is not sharp. They have
intercepted a league-high 15 passes, despite starting rookie
cornerback Mike McKenzie (two interceptions) and using rookies
Antuan Edwards (three interceptions) and Fred Vinson (one
interception) in their nickel package.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't be intimidated _ Even Holmgren acknowledges that his
old team has the league's best quarterback in Favre, the league's
best receiver in Antonio Freeman and one of the league's most
versatile backs in Dorsey Levens.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren also points out what a special place Lambeau is. The
Seahawks have not played there since Nov. 1, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren even admits to being a little anxious about this game
for more than the obvious personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the schedule and you're kind of saying, `Well, you
have a young developing team and you want to go against the big
boys,''' he said. ``That can get you a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to weather the storm early,'' Kitna said.
``I think they might come out and try to shellshock us. We have to
deal with that and then settle in.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Tuesday, the Rodman watch begins again.
</P>
<P>
   As if last night wasn't scary enough when trick-or-treaters were
showing up at your door with yellow hair and a No.73 jersey lookin'
for a handout.
</P>
<P>
   The posture that Phil Jackson will take for now and probably
through the 30 games when Lakers huddle around the .500 mark is
that adding Dennis Rodman won't be an option, but talk to me in
February.
</P>
<P>
   As public opinion mounts outside the Staples Center after
another loss to a Pacific Division foe with an out-of-control
offense, Jax may have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of slitting his wrists at the thought of Rodman's
return, Jerry West tried every other option _ Chris Weber, Tom
Gugliotta, Lorenzen Wright, Charles Oakley _ he came up with
letting loose J.R. Reid, keeping Robert Horry, adding A.C. Green
and John Salley, and is even considering Bison Dele.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to that, how does Rodman look? Pretty good to Jerry
Buss, who might not want to pay Scottie Pippen money but won't make
the discount forward deal again.
</P>
<P>
   _How secure does Jackson feel with his five-year, $30 million
job? He's having a 6,000-square-foot house built for him and the
missis in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Montana Avenue, we're guessing, just to remind him
of his roots....
</P>
<P>
   _Thespians Woody Harrelson, Damon Wayans and David Duchovny have
reportedly committed to playing in a 10-team ``Entertainment
League'' sponsored by the NBA. Supposedly, the games would be
played at an undisclosed gym in L.A. and be closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Something the under-the-cap Clippers might consider in their
next talent search....
</P>
<P>
   _For anyone in the Dodgers management group who hasn't figured
it out, Bob Daly is the new sheriff in town. Or, from his Warner
Bros. days, he's the lethal weapon....
</P>
<P>
   _Fox's backing off from the day-to-day operation of the Dodgers
was one of the smartest things Rupert's boys could do. As was
keeping a majority ownership. Imagine Daly's decision-making duties
with Fox's finances backing it up....
</P>
<P>
   _The Angels have probably lost any chance of bringing in Davey
Lopes, who reportedy goes in for a follow-up interview today with
the Brewers....
</P>
<P>
   _Why hasn't Mike Scioscia's name come up anywhere yet?...
</P>
<P>
   _Remember when Joe Torre used to be with the Angels? Right, as a
broadcaster....
</P>
<P>
   _Although Max Patkin, the clown prince of baseball, passed on at
age 79 over the weekend, the real fun at the ballpark actually died
years ago....
</P>
<P>
   _There's a movement in the Latino community to boycott using
MasterCard because its sponsored Major League Baseball All-Century
team left off Roberto Clemente....
</P>
<P>
   _Add Jerry Rice to the list of sports superstars who should pack
it in in '99....
</P>
<P>
   _The San Jose Clash of the Major League Soccer is changing its
name next year to the Earthquakes, which is what the city's NASL
team went by in the 1980s. Team general manager Lynne Meterparel
explaining why the disasterous name isn't inappropriate: ``It's
part of life here. It creates a community that is prepared, that
works together to conquer the odds. That's exactly what you want to
do with a team on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   So, ya see, earthquakes are a (begin ital)good(end ital) thing. &QL;

HOW THE CRASH HAPPENED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG PADILLA  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Without warning, and seemingly without reason, Greg
Moore lost his life Sunday after his car slid out of control while
exiting Turn2 on Lap 10 of the Marlboro 500 at California Speedway
and broke apart on impact with an infield retaining wall.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's light-blue car slid and began to spin through the
infield grass before crossing an asphalt access road. The left-side
tires dug into another section of turf and the momentum forced the
car into the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Player's Forsythe Racing Mercedes-powered car flipped upside
down while airborne just before it struck the retaining wall. The
car appeared to almost complete a half-turn before the right side
made hard contact with the top of the wall at the base of the
attached catch fence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, the 24-year-old Canadian's fastest recorded
speed was 216.298 mph on Lap3. Taking into account a reduction of
speed after executing Turn2, as well a limited loss of speed from
sliding through the infield grass, Moore still was traveling at
well over 100 mph at the moment of impact.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was almost directly upside-down when he crashed. The car
exploded into pieces as it hit the top of the wall. The driver's
cockpit that contained Moore rolled four times before coming to
rest upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was eerily similar to one that happened to Richie
Hearn just six laps before Moore's fatal wreck. In fact, marks
across the track and through the grass appeared to be parallel,
almost leading to the identical spot of impact on the infield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn made a hard impact with the wall, but unlike Moore, he
appeared to be less vulnerable to injury because his car remained
right-side up.
</P>
<P>
   Even before learning of Moore's fate, Hearn commented that it
didn't take much to cause his accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good run off Turn 2 on (Mauricio) Gugelmin and pinched
in too low,'' Hearn said. ``I caught some bad air and that was it.
There were several cars in front of me battling for position,
making it that much tougher back there.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have been more than a coincidence that both accidents
happened coming out of Turn2. Juan Montoya, who wound up clinching
the points title by finishing fourth, said he was approaching Turn2
with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I had a big scare there (in warmups),'' Montoya
said. ``Right at the end (of the turn) the car just tried to point
in a different direction. I suppose that's what happened to Greg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good because for the race, I was very careful with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The live television broadcast on ESPN did not catch the moment
Moore spun out of control, but switched from a shot of Max Papis'
car to Moore's car as it was rolling over through the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN did not show a replay of the accident, but before the race
ended a video clip was available for download on at least one
Internet Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Moore's wreck, ESPN commentator Parker
Johnstone speculated on the reason for the crash, and his
assessment was similar to Hearn's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get behind a line of cars and the car is perfectly
balanced ... These cars might look pretty sleek, but the tires
produce huge amounts of turbulence,'' he said. ``That's all it
takes to take away your downforce.''
</P>
<P>
   According to CART's 1999 media guide, ``Downforce may create
loads of up to three times the weight of the race car permitting
the vehicle to corner at greater speeds while drivers experience
loads of over five Gs (a lateral load equivalent to more than five
times the pull of the Earth's gravity) in cornering as a result of
the efficiency of ground effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Another contributing factor to the fatal wreck might have been a
broken forefinger and lacerations that Moore suffered on his right
hand the day before the race. Moore was riding a scooter, like most
drivers do when maneuvering through the track's paddock, when he
was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Moore missed Saturday's regular qualifying session, but
convinced CART doctors he was OK by running two laps at 219 mph
during a special qualifying session. Moore was fitted with a brace
on his hand and started last in Sunday's 27-car field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I examined him after the warmup and he was extremely excited
and confident,'' said Dr. Steve Olvey, CART's director of medical
affairs. ``We feel strongly that the hand was not related to the
accident.''

DOES HOLYFIELD HAVE ONE MORE REBIRTH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everyone who saw the first bout between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis on March 13 in Atlantic City, N.J., must
be wondering the same thing about their second matchup on Nov. 13
in Las Vegas:
</P>
<P>
   What could Holyfield possibly do differently that would reverse
what was perhaps the most one-sided draw in boxing history?
</P>
<P>
   The first time, Holyfield, the benefactor of that dubious draw,
simply couldn't get inside to hit Lewis. The big Briton is listed
as having a 2{-inch height advantage _ it looks bigger _ and a
6{-inch reach advantage. He will also outweigh Holyfield by about
30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with Lewis' solid left jab and all-around
ability, rendered Holyfield a frustrated fighter.
</P>
<P>
   So what's Holyfield's plan?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know more about Lennox Lewis than I did in the first
fight,'' said Holyfield, who will be 37 six days after the bout.
``I pretty much know I have to be patient. My game plan is to be a
little bit more precise, mix it up a little more, not wait for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``... My distance (is the key to getting inside). I was either
too far out or too far in. I need to find a happy medium to get my
punches off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough _ perhaps too simple. And if anyone could
pull it off, it's Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, he's been in this position before.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a decision to Riddick Bowe in 1992 to lose the WBA and
IBF heavyweight championships but came back to outpoint Bowe in
their rematch the following year to reclaim his belts.
</P>
<P>
   He was outpointed by Michael Moorer in 1994 to lose the same
championships but came back to pummel Moorer in their rematch in
1997, an eighth-round knockout, to recapture them again.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the first Moorer fight, after which Holyfield said he
had fought with an injured shoulder, he claims he wasn't well when
he fought Lewis. He said he had a heavyweight stomach ache.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like an excuse, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, with most fighters, it's easy to dismiss it as such. With
Holyfield, there's some room to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the hotel, and my stomach was feeling bad,'' said
Holyfield, who had predicted a third-round knockout. ``I went
through the whole act, singing (gospel in pre-fight, psych-up
preparations), hoping everything would just be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to the third round and I hadn't gotten him out, I
had to face the fact that I had to fight when I really didn't want
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``... People have to understand that I had to gut it out and see
what happened. I wasn't willing to give up because I wasn't feeling
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also said the fact Lewis called him a hypocrite for
advocating a pious lifestyle while fathering children out of
wedlock had him fighting angry, a counterproductive state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, coming back against Lewis _ even in perfect physical
and mental condition _ is not the same as coming back against
Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is bigger, stronger and better than Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact Holyfield is pushing retirement age has to become a
factor sooner or later, even with a remarkable physical specimen
like Holyfield. Perhaps his age caught up to him in the first
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, thought to be finished so many times in the past,
insists he has at least one more surprise in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard for me to want to come back if I felt I did
everything right,'' he said. ``I made mistakes. If I minimize the
mistakes, I can win _ handily.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor strategy: Lewis made his own crucial mistake: Like Oscar De
La Hoya did against Felix Trinidad, he fought too cautiously in the
late rounds and allowed his opponent to climb back into the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he learned his lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to step up the pace a little bit more, I need to use my
talent a little more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``... I need to come on strong at the end. I was really
impressed with the way (Shane) Mosley ended his fight (against
Wilfredo Rivera).
</P>
<P>
   ``And I watched the De La Hoya fight. I realized, boy, the
judges aren't looking for you to run around the ring. They're
looking for you to mount some kind of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss-judging: Lewis said he'd like to knock out Holyfield to
take the fight out of the judges' hands.
</P>
<P>
   However, he believes he'll get a fair shake this time if it goes
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're known to have good judges in Las Vegas. All I can say
is I have confidence in them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anniversary: The Rumble in the Jungle, the fight in which
Muhammad Ali knocked out George Foreman 25 years ago last Saturday,
wasn't Ali at his best.
</P>
<P>
   By 1974, Ali was 32 and had already seen his best years.
</P>
<P>
   It had been seven years since he had to give up the championship
for refusing induction into the armed services and about 3{ since
Joe Frazier outpointed him in Ali's first attempt at regaining the
title.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Foreman, so big and strong, was undefeated and
apparently unbeatable. He had destroyed Joe Frazier and Ken Norton,
two fighters who gave Ali so much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Ali was given little chance to win in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he was underestimated. He had the game plan _
``rope-a-dope'' _ and ability to pull off an upset that rivaled his
first victory over Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   He simply leaned against the ropes and deflected most of
Foreman's punches until the champion was exhausted, then knocked
him out in an unforgettable eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his idea (to go to the ropes),'' Angelo Dundee, Ali's
trainer, told The Associated Press. ``I thought he was a dope. I
was cussing him out every round, telling him to get in the middle
of the ring. He told me, `I know what I'm doing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``... I sensed it from the get-go,'' Dundee added in spite of
his doubts about Ali's tactics. ``My guy just had the style to beat
this guy. In this profession, style is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman doesn't disagree, even though the fight was postponed
when he was cut during training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the postponement hurt me. He was always going to
win,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Ali wasn't at his best that night. But he was never
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson tribulations: Mike Tyson's after-bell punch that ended his
bout with Orlin Norris wasn't the most egregious offense in recent
years. And Nevada State Athletic Commission chairman Elias Ghanem's
use of the word ``hoodlum'' to describe Tyson was a bit harsh, at
least as it applies to his latest foible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commission's decision to evict the former champion
from its boxing arenas was appropriate: Trouble follows Tyson
around, and Nevada has had enough trouble for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The move should also benefit Tyson, who will be received
enthusiastically by those who haven't grown weary of his act _ in
New York, England, Germany, wherever.
</P>
<P>
   He's tentatively scheduled to face Shannon Briggs on Feb. 26 at
Madison Square Garden in New York but could also fight on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The latter date would be ideal for a European trip, to get Tyson
as far away from here as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Carlos Hernandez faces Alejandro Jimenez in a
10-round junior lightweight bout Friday at Steven's Steakhouse in
the City of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting will be former Olympian Pepe Reily of Glendale and
Ramon Baez in a 10-round welterweight bout....
</P>
<P>
   Lance ``Mount'' Whitaker had successful surgery on his left knee
and is expected to return to the ring in about three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Granada Hills heavyweight injured the knee during his
victory over Monte Barrett in August. &QL;

RACING PAYS THE PRICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ It was a weird but overpowering tidal wave of grief.
It began with heads bowed in the Players Forsythe Racing garage,
and ended with a stadium in mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew it was a horrific accident. Greg Moore's careening
car seemed almost to vaporize when it slammed into the infield
wall. Debris sprayed. Tires bounded wildly. What was left of
Moore's chassis tumbled four times over the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers gasped involuntarily. You didn't need to be a race
expert, or a doctor, to recognize young Greg Moore was in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, however, he was ``receiving treatment,'' and a news
blackout descended over the track.
</P>
<P>
   A jog to the track hospital yielded little. The helicopter
carrying Moore's body lifted off at 1:41 p.m.; reporters were given
no new information.
</P>
<P>
   A walk back to Moore's garage told much more.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members sat in their firesuits without speaking. Most
stared into space. All seemed deeply shaken.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:56, a Forsythe official called together Moore's crew
members, and they filed into the sky-blue truck-transporter of
Moore's No.99 Mercedes Reynard. The doors slid shut behind them.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:58 p.m., the mechanics and engineers exited the trailer.
Several were weeping. It was clear Moore was beyond their help.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, as the race went on, flags near the
start-finish line were lowered to half staff. A few minutes later,
word of Moore's death, of massive head and internal injuries, was
announced to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers, Moore's best friends at California Speedway, were
the last to know. Most were informed after they crossed the finish
line, 240 laps after Moore, only 24, hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers seemed anguished, and the post-race atmosphere
turned deeply funereal.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Fernandez, winner of the race, had trouble speaking,
stopping several times to choke out words of sympathy and
condolence.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up Max Papis and Christian Fittipaldi fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to kill oursevles,'' Papis said. ``We are not
here for this reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Fittipaldi: ``We are out to put on a good show for the
fans, but we're not out there to give our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Greg Moore seemed to hit drivers hard because he
was so young. And because he was so good.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was not a marginal talent who made mistakes every lap. He
was a rising star marked for greatness. He wasn't supposed to go
out this way.
</P>
<P>
   The reality though, is that motor racing is a lethal sport.
People die. Spectators, crewmen, drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The CART circuit has been lucky, in terms of drivers and
accidents; Moore's fatality was only the fourth in-race fatality in
CART history.
</P>
<P>
   But when cars qualify at an average speed of 235 miles per hour,
when they cling to the track by a gravitational thread, and when a
mistake or an equipment failure happens in the blink of an eye _
eternity is always only a few seconds away.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some modern drivers haven't accepted that. Perhaps a man
needs to be in deep denial to be able to strap himself into a
rocket and expect to have a long, pain-free career.
</P>
<P>
   At 200 mph, a driver has placed himself in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does have the appearance of being a tragic racing
accident,'' said Andrew Craig, CART president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing accident.'' That's motorspeak for ``stuff happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As somber fans filed out of California Speedway, and grieving
drivers and teams packed up, about all they could be sure of was
this:
</P>
<P>
   They will grieve for someone else some other day. That is a
price the sport of motor racing has agreed to pay.

PLAYER NEEDS INNER PEACE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joe Inman packed a new weapon in his bag Sunday
for the final round of the Pacific Bell Senior Classic. It wasn't a
bubble driver, a lob wedge or a long putter. It was perspective,
and boy, did it come in handy on the penultimate hole of the
three-day tournament at Wilshire Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Inman pulled his second shot at the par-4 17th, and it went
screaming into the creek left of the green. As he stood over his
next shot, a tricky 75-foot chip, you could almost see his
three-shot lead evaporating like water in the 85-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the wine-sipping patrons chilling out in the shade of
the sponsor's tent nearby, Inman was the coolest customer of all.
The stirring memorials in the wake of golfer Payne Stewart's death
last week made this very important shot seem pretty insignificant.
As he stood over his ball, Inman told himself, ``Look what happened
to Payne. Chip it and do the best you can. It's not the end of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a peace I've never had before,'' said Inman, who chipped
to within three feet of the pin and stole a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, playing partner Gary Player, couldn't get as good a line
on the game, despite fine counsel from his son and caddy Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Player, who turns 64 today, started the final round three shots
off the lead. With nine holes to play, the usually affable South
African was very much alive in his drive to become the oldest
winner in Senior PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   He missed birdie putts at 10 and 12 by inches and bogeyed 11, 16
and 18 to finish in a tie for 11th. Not that it mattered to the
many people for whom Player is second to none.
</P>
<P>
   On the 10th hole, a man in the gallery approached the golfer's
wife, Vivienne. With a nod to a shy woman hovering nearby, the man
told her, ``My wife absolutely adores your husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Player was arguably the biggest draw in a tournament that
proceeded without oldies-but-goodies Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer
and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Understand: Player wasn't a poor man's stand-in for the absent
stars. One of only four men to have won golf's Grand Slam, Player
stands out in any constellation. He is one of golf's most precious
jewels.
</P>
<P>
   As treasures go, he's perfectly preserved; his 5-foot-7 frame is
as taut as a teenager's, his step as spry as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hooked shots and missed putts multiplied, Player's
posture slumped. At the 18th tee, after bunkering a 5-iron, he
grimaced all the way down the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   He implored Wayne to tell him what he had done wrong on the
shot. Indeed, he told his son he'd give him $100,000 if he could
straighten his swing with a few magic words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took all my strength to be patient with him,'' Wayne said,
sighing, to his mother as they made their way to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Player was nowhere to be seen. He had bolted for the sanctuary
of the locker room, leaving behind not only his family but a few
fans who wanted his autograph, at least one man who wanted a
picture taken with him and a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The group dwindled until only Vivienne, Wayne, a man with a
disposal camera and the reporter remained. They caught up with
Player at the entrance of the clubhouse where he was pacing back
and forth, swigging a beer and muttering under his breath while he
waited for a courtesy car that was late.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and son had the good sense to stand back and give
Player his space. The man with the camera stepped in his path and
Player stopped pacing long enough to have his picture taken. But
that was the extent of his goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   When the reporter approached and introduced herself, one of the
game's greatest ambassadors cut her off. ``Let me suffer in
silence,'' he snarled. ``I feel terrible. Don't you see I'm
suffering?''
</P>
<P>
   That a man on the verge of 64 could score 7-under par over 54
holes on a 6,610-yard layout seemed to inspire awe in everybody but
the man in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Super Senior being in the hunt on Sunday. Isn't that the
most remarkable thing you've ever heard?'' Inman said, shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would have been a great story if Player hadn't
spoiled it. It says here the best birthday present Player could
give himself is an inner peace that's not predicated on his
performance. &QL;

BAFFERT HAS CHANCE TO BREAK LUKAS' RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas, sometimes accused of caring more about
his stats than his horses, will find one of his prized records
under attack Saturday at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Bob Baffert trains contenders in five races and could
threaten Lukas' 11-year-old record of three winners on a single
Breeders' Cup card. But Lukas is in position to play defense _
he'll saddle horses in four of the races where Baffert is
strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The Juvenile Fillies shapes up as a direct showdown, with
Lukas-trained New York starlet Surfside trying to hand
Baffert-trained favorite Chilukki her first defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside is a daughter of Seattle Slew and Flanders. The dam won
the 1994 Juvenile Fillies for Lukas. Is Surfside special to Lukas?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always special when they can run like she does,'' the
64-year-old Hall of Famer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas also plans to enter Cash Run in the Juvenile Fillies; Cat
Thief against Baffert's General Challenge and River Keen in the
Classic; High Yield and Millencolin against Baffert's Forest Camp
and Captain Steve in the Juvenile; and A Lady From Dixie against
Baffert's Silverbulletday in the Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief is 1 for 11 in his 3-year-old season. The win came by
a head against General Challenge in Hollywood Park's Swaps Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the horses you (writers) are all touting very
strongly... he has beaten already,'' Lukas said of Cat Thief. ``He
has some speed, so he should stay clear of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas set the record for victories in a single Breeders' Cup in
1998 at drizzly Churchill Downs with Gulch (Sprint), Is It True
(Juvenile) and Open Mind (Juvenile Fillies). Lukas also saddled
second-place finishers Winning Colors (Distaff) and Steinlen
(Mile).
</P>
<P>
   Weather watch: The Gulfstream track was rated sloppy for
Sunday's workouts, including 6 furlongs in a best-of-the-morning
1:13 by Sprint hopeful Anees and 5 furlongs in 1:02 by
California-bred Sprint entrant Big Jag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to work him on a track like that,'' Big
Jag trainer Tim Pinfield said, ``but they say it's going to rain
(Sunday night), and I would have the same problem (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel exacta: Trainer Bobby Frankel won his sixth stakes in
October, as French invader Public Purse ($4.80) and Star
Performance ran 1-2 in the $150,000 Carleton F. Burke Handicap on
the Santa Anita turf. Alex Solis rode the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Another Baze: Seventeen-year-old Tyler Baze _ of jockeydom's
first family _ earned his first victory on the fifth attempt when
Fleeting Wonder won a claiming race Sunday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Baze is the second cousin of leading Northern California jockey
Russell Baze. His father, Earl, mother, Cammie, and uncle Gary Baze
were jockeys. Gary Stevens is an uncle by marriage.

LAKERS RECHARGED AS OPENER NEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six exhibition games in eight days left the Lakers
weary, and by game six last Thursday, a bit deflated as well. They
lost their last three games, all to Western Conference rivals, and
looked anything but ready for the real season that opens Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   A few days of practice couldn't fix all that ails them, but the
Lakers offered coach Phil Jackson some hope Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the first legitimate practice that we've had since
we started the six games in eight days, where we've come and
practiced up to the intensity level that an NBA team demands,''
Jackson said. ``I was heartened today by the energy the players
came with.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll need it. They open at Utah, against a Jazz team that has
dominated the Lakers the past few years, including a 92-76 pasting
last Thursday to close out exhibition play.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Lakers make their Staples Center debut against
the lowly Vancouver Grizzlies, but the weekend brings a tough
matchup with the Portland Trail Blazers, heavily favored to win the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The lousy exhibition season, which netted a 3-5 record, combined
with the pending season opener refocused the Lakers in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Jackson said. ``I think the fact they're getting
their legs underneath them (helps) too.... Physically, they're
starting to find the strength to be there in a conditioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had couple of good runs (Saturday), but we just didn't
carry the intensity all the way through. Granted, it's 90-degree
days and a different type of atmosphere to play in and coach in
than I'm used to or maybe they are. It still hasn't come to that
level where we feel the intensity this team must play at to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions, decisions: As of Sunday, the Lakers roster stood at
15, and Jackson was mum on how they'll get down to the mandated 12
by today's 3 p.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's broken right hand will put him on the injured
list, but Jackson still had not decided if Travis Knight, nearly
recovered from a sprained ankle, will start the season on reserve
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Lakers probably will cut at least one player
today.

CAN JACKSON MAKE THE DIFFERENCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This year's Lakers savior does not measure
7-foot-1. He is not a teenage phenom. He was not drafted nor traded
for, though it could be said he was a considerable free agent.
</P>
<P>
   It is an annual refrain, the Lakers talk of claiming their first
NBA title since 1988, but this year the reason for their optimism
is not an exciting new player but a very graying coach.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson was hired not to simply improve the Lakers, but to
take them to basketball's Promised Land. A franchise hungry for
another championship now turns to the man who directed the Bulls to
six NBA titles in the '90s and pleads he can duplicate it here.
</P>
<P>
   History says it will not only be difficult but unlikely. In the
52-year history of the NBA, only one man _ Alex Hannum _ has ever
won titles with two different organizations. Lenny Wilkens and Pat
Riley are two current NBA coaches who have won titles but still
search to find another with a different team.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jackson comes to the Lakers, armed with the respect of six
rings and a five-year contract at $6 million per. There was no more
advancing an assistant or hiring a professorial outsider. This time
owner Jerry Buss shelled out the big bucks for for the son of two
Pentecostal ministers and asked him to make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Only, just how much difference can a top coach really have on an
NBA team? What is it actually worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty wins,'' Lakers forward Rick Fox said. ``But it's where
those are coming, the playoffs or regular season? I think this team
on talent alone can win 55 games. But get into the playoffs, as
we've proven the last few years, and we self-destruct.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Lakers guard Ron Harper, who won two titles with Jackson
in Chicago, said he knows what a high-profile coach can mean to a
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth a pot of gold if we can apply what he's trying to
express to us,'' Harper said. ``You can have the best coach in the
world and have a (lousy) team. So it's his job to make us a very
good basketball team. I mean, he's won six NBA rings, but what he
does here will set him apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Add a coach who dominated the past decade with a team
universally perceived as a talented underachiever, and the
expectations are off the charts. It seems the perfect NBA marriage,
but Clippers vice president Elgin Baylor argues for caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you're putting a coach there and putting a
Michael Jordan on that team,'' Baylor said. ``Even though Phil is a
great coach, that's a difference. Nothing is guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson for each of his six titles was Jordan, generally
recognized as not the greatest player of his time and all-time. Red
Auerbach won nine NBA titles with the Celtics, all with Bill
Russell at center, and could never separate his success from his
star. As Harper and others point out, this is Jackson's opportunity
to validate himself as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are all too eager for it to happen. Indeed, with
Jackson the only real significant change to the Lakers, he is at
the heart of those ready to trumpet their return to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plainly came here because felt he could win a title, but
he has asked for patience as the team adjusts to his triangle
offense and he to his new personnel. Veteran players, too,
recognize even giving Jackson a team with the talent of Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant brings no instant invitation to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A coach is not going to mean any automatic victories,'' Lakers
forward A.C. Green said. ``All he can do is take you to the water.
He can teach you and train you and prepare you, and hopefully that
does mean something, but that's not going to be the end result.
It's important you have players who buy into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't presume too much about what's going to happen. We
have a talented team on paper and a new coach with great history.
That should not tickle everyone's fancy to the point they get in
line for a parade. Not now. Hold on a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 seasons before Jackson won his first title, eight
different coaches _ Jack Ramsay, Dick Motta, Wilkens, Paul
Westhead, Bill Fitch, Riley, K.C. Jones and Chuck Daly _ won NBA
titles and ultimately moved to other teams without capturing
another title. Riley, Fitch and Jones did make it to the finals
with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   It plainly isn't always just about coaching. Baylor said you
have to compare the talent those coaches won with to what they
inherited with the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ford became the Celtics coach the final two years of Larry
Bird's declining career. Three years after Bird retired, Ford was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything,'' said Ford, now the Clippers coach.
``Where you are with the athletes you're dealing with, where are
they in the prime of their careers. A lot of things go into making
a winning situation. It doesn't just happen by waving a magic
wand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who played 10 years, said there is no denying a team
recognizes when it has a coach of significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill Fitch came to Boston, I thought he was going to make
a difference,'' Ford said. ``We ended up winning a title and had
large success.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sharman, the Lakers special consultant and coach of the
1972 title team, said a coach who has won before should
automatically get the attention of a young team like the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we've had coaches ... where they didn't have that
much of a reputation, and sometimes the players can take advantage
of that,'' Sharman said. ``If they don't win they can say, `Well,
the system is not right for me or the players.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Phil _ besides that he's an outstanding teacher _
with his reputation and six championships, the players are not
going to be able to say it's the coach's fault, it's the coach's
system that doesn't work. Because we know it does. Now we just feel
we have the best coach available.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the impact of a coach typically doesn't rest upon
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends more on the team than the coach,'' Jackson
said. ``You have a few systems that are really dominant in this
game now. Most typically run similar stuff out on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a unique system of offense we want to work with, so I
think it's more or less what we're doing rather than who's doing
it. History has obviously not been necessarily a precursor of
coaches moving from one place to another to win a championship, but
that doesn't mean that you can't take a system and keep moving and
find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson points out Wilt Chamberlain ran similar systems under
different teams and coaches for his two titles. Those systems were
similar to his triangle, and Chamberlain a player similar to
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have new people in this system eventually,'' Jackson
said. ``Right now I came to bring a change to the system. Not to
bring this team, perhaps as personnel, to a championship. If you
get my distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has a long contract, and added to his success, instant
respect. During an exhibition game against the Jazz last week at
the Pond, when O'Neal was replaced in the fourth quarter, Jackson
waited in front of the scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand here,'' Jackson said, pointing to an area directly in
front of him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal stood exactly there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to look at this guy and say, `Hey, he's won
championships. He's had a great deal of success.' He's going to
have an easier time as far as convincing the players this will
work, whatever system he's going to implement,'' Baylor said. ``If
you've been successful at it, it's much easier to get players'
attention. And that's the key thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It always begins, however, with talent. And plenty of other
teams have talent. Portland is the popular pick to capture this
coming season's NBA title, yet no one suggests Mike Dunleavy is a
superior coach than Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles area, though, Jackson is in the spotlight. He
is the difference-maker, the savior, despite all that history and
the difficult odds of actually pulling it off, particularly in his
first season with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel if we can get everyone healthy and they can
learn this new triangle system quick enough, they have a good
chance at a championship year,'' Sharman said. ``But to be
realistic, it might take all the team half the season to learn this
system. It might be a little difficult to predict a championship
the first year. But it's certainly not out of the question.''

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm not a member of Mensa, due in part to my
adherence to the Groucho Marx rule of organization membership, but
Dave Pressman sent me a copy of the current local Mensa newsletter.
<P>
   It's called the Intelligencer, possibly to remind members that
they are, like, more intelligencer than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the monthly Calendar of Events is a glossary of codes used
with the various event listings. Such as: BYOB means bring your own
beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Some others: LCR (light carpet rules _ no red wine or other
staining substances), PFE (perfume-free event), WBC (well-behaved
children), FE (fictional event).
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing if it's an FE, all the other rules are off; it's
KBFD (Katy bar the fictional door).
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's city election, by the way, is an NFE (non-fictional
event), BYOB (bring ye olde brain), NDDVP (no dead or duplicate
voters, please).
</P>
<P>
   And today's column from this WBC (well-behaved columnist) is
coded NUT (no unifying theme), FE (frictional event), WOAHCSB
(written on a Halloween-candy sugar buzz).
</P>
<P>
   A BAD SIGN, as if 49er fans need another: In the NFL Shop on
Pier 39, William Stern came across a rack of Steve Young and Jerry
Rice 49er jerseys on sale, half-off.  &UR; Go, 24.5ers!  &LR; (That was for
our Mensa friends.)
</P>
<P>
   The sale is glumly appropriate, because Rice has half his old
speed and Young's thinking processes may be marked down 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So preoccupied is everyone with Young's playing (or non-playing)
status that nobody's even talking about the fact that he's engaged
again.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING FISHY: Remember good old Spenger's Seafood Grotto in
Berkeley, born in the 1800s and died of old-aged fish a year ago?
It was supposed to re-open in August after a massive $2 million
renovation. Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Latest word: It will open the first week of December, boasting
$6 mil in renovations. For that kind of dough I hope they're
raising the Titanic and using it as a salad bar.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME BEAT: In the border zone between the P.D.'s Park District
and its Northern District, some thugs were busily mugging the
muggable _ the weak, the elderly, women alone. There were at least
five attacks over a month, including a German woman tourist who was
choked unconscious and robbed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was revived, the woman hit the streets with the cops as
they traced clues and made the bust, the three bad guys confessing
to the series of attacks. Good to see the tourists helping the cops
clean up the city.
</P>
<P>
   CRIME BEAT II: At the Pan Pacific Hotel near Union Square, man
sneaks into underground garage, drives up and out in a shiny new
Jaguar convertible that isn't his.
</P>
<P>
   Eagle-eyed doorman Marlin Pelejo sizes up the situation, yells
to front-drive attendant Angel Lozano, ``Get in your car and follow
that Jag!''
</P>
<P>
   Around corner from hotel, Jag man stops at red light, primps
hair and puts down convertible top. Then he pulls into a station at
4th and Folsom to gas up with a stolen credit card. Lozano calls
cops on his cell phone, and, bless those little technomiracles,
four cop cars arrive, nab stylish scofflaw.
</P>
<P>
   When you've got Marlin and Angel, who needs Nash Bridges?
</P>
<P>
   ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: I get a report from within this very Chronicle
Building that some of the men's rooms have toilet paper printed
with advertising: ``Get the poop on building an online community.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a case of ``Is nothing sacred?'' But I was
hoping we'd at least get through the current millennium without
this sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   TRULY SCARY: The traffic around the greater Metreon area
Saturday afternoon was blood curdling. Lines of cars wound around
entire huge blocks, waiting for parking. It was blocks and blocks
of gridlox, no bagels.
</P>
<P>
   And creeping along with the rest of the log-jammed vehicles:
Muni buses. So those who took Muni to do their civic transit-first
duty suffered along with the sinners.
</P>
<P>
   People eager to have fun, breathe the San Francisco air and
spend money were doing none of the above. They were sucking
tailpipe while nursing rat-in-cage rage.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to take another look at closing Market Street
for the bottom two miles. At least the buses would move, thus
encouraging people to ride 'em. Sebastian Johnck points out that a
sticky Market Street clogs the feng shui of the entire city. Lose
the cars, he says, and we'll see:
</P>
<P>
   ``Walkers waving at happy bike messengers delivering vital
documents safely. The city coming together at the Market Street
Promenade. Beer gardens, European models strutting in elevator
shoes, happy palm trees waving at the European models. That's good
feng shui.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MOURNING for Payne Stewart isn't over in this neck of the
state. Lou Bristol points out that the two major golf events next
year are the Crosby/AT&AMP;T and the U.S. Open, both at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The most-honored golfer at these events is always the previous
year's champion. And in both tournaments, that's Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD SERIES? I sneezed and missed it. All I know is that the
MVP was Pete Rose, and Jim Gray was banned from baseball for life
for betting that TV viewers wanted a rubber-hose interrogation of
Rose.
</P>
<P>
   No salutes here to the Yankees. I will never give my affection
to a Steinbrenner team.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Braves' fans, now they can retire to the privacy of
their own trailers and put that rhythmic up-and-down hand motion to
more productive use.

ANCIENT FISH RAISE MOUNTAIN OF QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
An ugly fish with snapping teeth, found dead in an Indonesian
marketplace two summers ago, is posing a new puzzle for scientists
tracing the faint record of continental mountain-building over
millions of years across the vast Indian Ocean.
<P>
   The fish is called a coelacanth (see-la-canth) known to
biologists as a ``living fossil'' because its remains date back for
at least 350 million years in the fossil record. And scientists
thought it had been extinct for at least 80 million years, until a
living specimen was caught in a fisherman's net off the Indian
Ocean coast of southern Africa some 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, scientists had assumed that the coelacanth's only
habitat was in the deep waters of volcanic caves around the tiny
Comoro islands, which lie between Africa and Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   The coelacanths there have been rarely caught, and they have
long been listed as an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   But two summers ago, marine biologists were astounded when Arnaz
Mehta, the wife of a young Berkeley post-doctoral researcher named
Mark Erdmann, stumbled on what appeared to be a coelacanth in a
fish market on the Indonesian island of Manado Tua off the north
coast of Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
   That fish had been swimming in deep water off the island's
volcanic shore, more than 6,000 miles from the Comoro islands.
Scientists could not understand how it could have shown up in
Indonesia. They even puzzled over its true identity.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann's research project involves studying the ecology of
shrimp species in an effort to protect Indonesia's endangered coral
reefs, and he is no coelacanth specialist. But his friend,
ichthyologist John McCosker of the California Academy of Sciences
in San Francisco, flew to Sulawesi to compare the strange fish with
the coelacanths he had encountered many times on expeditions to the
Comoro islands. They seemed identical.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Similar Fish, Different DNA
</P>
<P>
   Then a team of French biologists sampled the Manado coelacanth
and studied its gene sequences to compare them with the Comoro
fish. They found distinct differences in portions of the DNA in the
two samples.
</P>
<P>
   The French biologists declared that the two fish represented two
distinct species of coelacanth. Using a technique that assumes the
rates in time  &LR; at which the different DNA samples diverged from
each other, they reported that the two populations probably
separated about 1.3 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Comoro creatures bear the scientific name Latimeria
chalumnae, and the French biologists, who had only a single sample,
named the Manado species Latimeria menadoensis.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Caldwell, a Berkeley biology professor and Erdmann's senior
colleague, then flew to Indonesia and brought back another
coelacanth sample frozen in liquid nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell enlisted the help of a University of Texas group headed
by David Hillis that specializes in using DNA analysis as a kind of
``molecular clock'' to estimate when apparently identical fish
species might have diverged long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas scientists estimated the coelacanths from opposite
sides of the world must have diverged into two separate species at
least 5 to 6 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unique features of coelacanths is the lobe-shaped
structure of their paired fins, a characteristic that seems to link
them on the evolutionary time scale to four-footed salamanders,
while other aspects of their bodies seem to relate them to even
more ancient sharks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Fish and Geology
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the two coelacanth species may well have diverged
as long  &LR; far back as 16 million years ago _ a time when the bed of
the huge Indian Ocean was in a state of upheaval, riven by volcanic
activity by the rise and fall of mid-ocean ridges and by the
crashing of the Indian subcontinent against what are now the
Himalayan mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a time when many forms of life around the world
became permanently separated, with each group evolving
independently over the millennia into distinctly different species
_ some adopting totally different body shapes and others
indistinguishable except for their DNA sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Erdmann and his wife are still in Sulawesi, and this week they
will be joined by German scientist Hans Fricke and his two-person
submarine, Jago. Fricke has filmed coelacanths off the Comoros, and
he and Erdmann will explore the steep underwater cliff sides of the
islands off Sulawesi to hunt for still more cave-dwelling
Indonesian coelacanths.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case where the fishes and their ancestors can teach
the geologists a lot about the way continents were formed and
volcanoes erupted a long, long time ago,'' said McCosker, of the
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the new coelacanth species appears in the current
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

BOMB THREAT LAST MONTH DISMISSED AS NOT CREDIBLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration warned air
security personnel in September of a bomb threat against an
unspecified plane leaving from the same US cities as EgyptAir
Flight 990, but government officials said Sunday the threat had
ultimately proved ``not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the alert to airlines and airports Sept. 24 after
someone told several US government agencies that a bomb would
``soon be used'' on a flight departing from Los Angeles Airport or
New York's Kennedy Airport, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   But an aviation official and other government sources said
Sunday that the FAA quickly learned that the individual responsible
for the tip was in jail on a murder charge and had a history of
making wild assertions.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 originated in Los Angeles and crashed into
the Atlantic Ocean after departing from Kennedy International
Airport for Cairo early Sunday. The alert expired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA issued the alert, but they investigated it and found
there were no grounds for it,'' said a State Department official.
``In any case, they're dismissing any connection'' between the
threat and Flight 990, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official said there had been no air
sabotage threats arising from President Clinton's trip to Norway,
which began Sunday. Clinton is in Oslo to discuss the Middle East
peace process with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is also having ceremonies to mark the fourth anniversary
of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   At the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, spokesman Abdel Aleem El
Abyad said no terrorist group had claimed responsibility for
downing Flight 990. ``Nobody has called us. Nobody has called the
Americans to claim anything,'' he said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   El Abyad also said that Egypt's minister of transportation had
already issued a statement saying no foul play was involved, though
he added that it was too early to draw that conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also said there was no evidence that the plane was
sabotaged, though intelligence officers at several federal agencies
began studying the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the lead investigative
agency, appeared to be taking steps to downplay speculation that
terrorism caused the disaster. After the 1996 crash of TWA Flight
800, the NTSB held a series of joint press conferences with the
FBI, which heightened the perception that a criminal act had caused
that crash. Sunday, NTSB officials took the podium alone at a press
conference, even though the FBI is also investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different kind of investigation,'' said Jamie Finch,
an NTSB spokesman. ``With TWA, the question at the very beginning
was whether terrorism was involved,'' and the NTSB shared that
suspicion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said that airlines and law enforcement agencies
receive hundreds of threats to air safety each year, but that most
of them are investigated and dismissed as not credible. Relatively
few threats prompt alerts such as the one the FAA issued Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hundred of those (threats) come every day from people in
prison, nuts on the street, crank calls to local police agencies,''
said Vince Cannistraro, the CIA's former counterterrorism chief,
who led the agency's probe of the 1988 crash of Pan Am Flight 103
over Scotland. He said that only a ``limited number'' of the calls
turn into FAA alerts after investigation by the FBI, the CIA or
other law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Another air security specialist, who works for a Maryland
security firm, said that many threats are so inspecific, mentioning
no airline or time frame, that it is difficult to issue a useful
alert.
</P>
<P>
   The security specialist, who asked that his name not be printed,
speculated that the few facts known so far about the disaster
suggest that a bomb was not involved. A timer seemed unlikely to
this person because Flight 990 was delayed at the New York airport
for nearly three hours after its scheduled departure of 10:30 p.m.
Saturday, EDT. The fact that the plane was at cruising altitude for
some time suggested to this person that a detonator keyed to
barometric pressure also seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials working on the Flight 990 crash would
likely study a set of Egyptian terrorist groups that oppose secular
rule in Egypt and the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, even
though none of the groups has been implicated in the crash in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   The groups include the Eqyptian Muslim Brotherhood; al-Gamaa
al-Islamiya, which is accused of killing foreign tourists in Egypt;
and Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Osama bin Laden, the
fugitive Saudi millionaire who allegedly backed the 1998 attack on
US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro noted that these groups had not issued a threat
against the airliner and have no background in airline terrorism.
``There is nothing in the threat environment that indicates that
this was the result of a terrorist incident,'' Cannistraro said of
the Flight 990 crash.

POIGNANT STORIES MIX WITH GRIEF IN CAIRO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Horror and chaos engulfed the makeshift information
center at Cairo International Airport Sunday as scores of family
members scanned a computer list of the 217 people aboard EgyptAir
Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   From those who had confirmed loved ones were on board the downed
plane, there were tears and cries of anguish. A man with gray hair
was wailing, ``My son. My son. His baby is 6 months old.''
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged woman in a black veil grabbed the list from the
EgyptAir officials, screaming, ``I want to know. I have to know.''
</P>
<P>
   She saw the list, and collapsed. A team of doctors and nurses
attended to her, first with smelling salts, then with what appeared
to be a tranquilizer. In one corner of the room, a family was
weeping and joining in quiet prayers as they read from the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Hishem Mansour saw on the tattered computer list the name of his
cousin, Wala Hanafi, 21, but demanded further, ``Is she dead or is
she lost?''
</P>
<P>
   Some were too terrified even to check the list, not wanting to
see what they feared.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Samek stood in the hallway just outside the room in
Terminal One after seeing that the name of his brother, Khalid
Samek, was on the flight manifest. Crying, he waved off questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is there to say?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Every story from every family seemed to produce tears.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant was the story of Mustafa El Shura, a
well-known professor at Ain Shams University, who had come to pick
up his daughter, Jihen. She was an American citizen who was eight
months pregnant and flying home to give birth to the child in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmud Rashad, the chief manager of the airport who spoke with
El Shura, said, ``It was very sad. He was asking so many questions.
And there are just no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Zein Ahmed, a cook at a diner in Albany, N.Y., had waited for
hours at the Cairo airport to find the news that his cousin, Imad
Suliman, 31, was on board the flight. The victim, whom he described
as ``like a brother to me,'' was a communications engineer in the
Egyptian military who, he said, had been training at a US military
base in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who was in Egypt for a three-week vacation, said his
cousin, Suliman, was very excited about making his first trip to
America. He left behind his wife, their 1-month-old infant son, and
a 16-month-old son.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes were red from crying, and his rapid-fire questions
focused on the location of the crash in the deep waters off
Nantucket where the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time in this location. John Kennedy, TWA
800, Swissair, and now EgyptAir . . . Why is this happening in this
location?'' Ahmed asked. ``There has to be some answer. There are
too many questions in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's leading newspapers in Monday 's editions also keyed in
on the location where the plane disappeared in their coverage. The
front page of Al Ahram had a headline that read: ``The Worst
Catastrophe in the History of Civil Aviation: The plane fell in the
same place as the TWA and Swissair crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Al Waf'd newspaper carried a story headlined, ``The Curse of
the Kennedy Family is Chasing Egyptian planes.''
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan spoke to a crush of
reporters outside the terminal, saying, ``We are trying to make
sure that we give the families all of the information we have and
to be sure they are given all of the assistance we can provide
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was seething anger against the airline among some of
the passengers. The 67-year-old national carrier has never had to
handle a downing of this magnitude and seemed ill prepared for
procedures to assist the grieving, questioning families.
</P>
<P>
   Suhir Hatut, 50, wearing a black dress, had just learned that
her sister, Wafa'a, 56, and brother-in-law, Adel, 56, were aboard
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Through tears, she directed her anger at the airline's chairman,
saying, ``I will take a gun and walk into Rayan's office and shoot
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Ahmed, were more understanding of the confusion
at the airport and less questioning of the airline's competence.
``I wish it was more sophisticated, more developed. But we are a
developing country. I do not have major complaints,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that seemed to be consuming the families was how they
would retrieve the bodies for proper burial. In the Muslim faith,
it is important for the dead to be buried immediately, typically
before sundown the day after death.
</P>
<P>
   Hesham el Shaer, who had just confirmed that his cousin Hussein
Ismael, 33, was on board the flight, said to an EgyptAir official,
``How can we bring him home? . . . My relatives' parents are
killing themselves over this.''
</P>
<P>
   In this religious and traditional culture, most of the victims'
families seemed to turn to faith amid tragedy. Samiha Isaeli had
come to the airport to pick up her sister and brother-in-law at the
airport. They were moving home after 15 years in America, she said.
She arrived thrilled with the idea of bringing them back into the
family fold, only to collapse in tears upon hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is all that survives in this,'' she said. ``Only God can
help you understand.''

EGYPTIAN AIRLINER CRASHES WITH 217 ABOARD

<P>
   BOSTON _ An EgyptAir jetliner en route from New York to Cairo
with 217 people on board went into a terrifying dive, apparently
broke apart, and crashed into the waters off Nantucket early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no distress calls, no clear causes, and no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990 carried 129 Americans, according to Egyptian
government officials, including a group of 54 tourists hoping to
see the Pyramids and other treasures of antiquity. The tour was
organized by a Boston-based company, but none of its participants
were from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included residents of Connecticut, Vermont, Maine,
New York, New Jersey, and several Western states, as well as
citizens of Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and Chile, Egyptian and US
officials said. Two infants reportedly were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   A massive, multinational investigation was launched to determine
why the 10-year-old Boeing 767-300ER plunged into the Atlantic 60
miles southeast of Nantucket shortly after taking off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of any criminal activity at this
time,'' said Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of the Boston
office of the FBI, one of six US agencies working with the Egyptian
government on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed his sympathies for the victims and
their families and said there was no evidence of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we
know something,'' said Clinton, who called President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt to offer condolences and pledge US assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard teams reported pulling one body from the 59-degree
waters during a search-and-rescue mission that began 20 minutes
after the plane disappeared from air traffic control radar screens.
Also recovered were seats, seat parts, a wheel, passports, life
jackets, and two partly inflated life rafts.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee said there were no
burn marks on the life rafts, but cautioned against drawing
conclusions based on that fact. He did not say how the rafts became
inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, four Coast Guard vessels and 11 aircraft
scoured a 36-square-mile ``debris field'' in an area where the
water is about 270 feet deep. Larrabee said the search will
continue Monday. A Navy salvage ship, the USS Grapple, is expected
to join the effort Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 990 took off at 1:19 a.m. Sunday from New York, more than
2 hours after its scheduled 11 p.m. departure. The plane had
arrived late from Los Angeles, its point of origin, because of
inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed normal as the plane cruised at 33,000 feet
during the early portion of a standard trans-Atlantic route,
aviation investigators said. Visibility was nine miles and the
weather was calm.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:47 a.m., ground controllers received a radio transmission
from the airplane that investigators called routine. The plane was
at the eastern end of a military training area known as Whiskey
105, at the edge of US air traffic control radar coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last anyone heard from Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, at 1:50 a.m., ground radar from the Boston
Center Air Traffic Control facility in Nashua, N.H., spotted the
plane at 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 36 seconds, Flight 990 fell to 19,100 feet, a rate
of descent of 23,200 feet per minute. A commercial airline pilot
who regularly flies Boeing 767s called that rate ``catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal rate of descent in that airplane is between 1,000
and 2,000 feet per minute,'' said the pilot, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``Maximum is 6,000, and that is pushing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the radar tapes from the Boston Center
said the plane's transponder stopped working after the 19,100-foot
reading. The transponder is an electrically powered device that
sends critical identifying and flight performance information to
air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several more sweeps of the radar that showed a
strong primary target, and then it breaks up into a cluster of
five'' pieces, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   However, one longtime aviation accident investigator said it is
difficult to make judgments about the plane's last moments based
solely on the Boston Center radar tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we hear about the condition of the bodies we won't know
anything,'' the investigator said. ``The bodies will tell us if the
plane was ditching and making a low-speed landing, came in at a
high speed, or broke apart like TWA Flight 800.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately before the crash, the plane was under the
supervision of controllers at the New York Center for air traffic
control in Ronkonkoma, N.Y. A source there said the last altitude
picked up by that center was 33,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no one else around him, no one was anywhere near
him,'' the source said, adding that all communications were normal
between controllers and the flight crew. ``There was a routing
clearance, some altitude and'' radio ``frequency changes. Nothing
was abnormal. There were no distress calls.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kallstrom, the FBI agent who led the criminal
investigation into the 1996 TWA Flight 800 disaster, said it might
be difficult if not impossible to pinpoint the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the TWA crash it took 2 1/2 months before we knew that
the central fuel tank blew up,'' Kallstrom said. ``This plane is in
much deeper waters, and it's much more difficult to dive in winter.
. . . It could be years before we know anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a warning
about a bomb threat against an unspecified plane leaving from Los
Angeles or Kennedy airports, the same airports used by Flight 990.
But government officials labeled the threat as ``not credible.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned EgyptAir said that in addition to the Americans, the
199 passengers on the twin-engine jet included 62 Egyptians, two
Sudanese, three Syrians, and one Chilean. The plane, nicknamed
Thutmosis II after a pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1450 BC,
carried 18 employees of EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Lewis, chief executive of the Boston-based travel agency
Grand Circle Travel, said the plane was carrying 54 Americans bound
for a two-week trip his company organized to Egypt. Most were from
Colorado, Arizona, and the Pacific Northwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a woman from Maine and her husband, from Vermont,
were believed to be among the passengers. Neighbors said Virginia
Chaplin, 72, of Georgetown, Maine, and her husband, Richard Brokaw
of Vermont, boarded the plane in New York. The couple married last
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Nantucket Sunday, dozens of people stood on windy beaches,
gazing at the ocean, while emergency officials scanned the sea and
shore for debris. Nothing turned up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims gathered Sunday afternoon at the Ramada
Plaza Hotel in New York, the same hotel that hosted the families of
TWA Flight 800 three years earlier. They were met by Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani and consoled by Muslim clerics, grief counselors, and
Red Cross workers.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles International Airport, about 15 people from three
families were anxiously seeking information about relatives on the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can imagine right now, the hardest thing for the
families is waiting for confirmation,'' said Bonnita Wirth, mental
health chairwoman of the Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Escudero, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, said 10 to 20
agents were at the airport, most from an antiterrorism squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the flight ordinary? Was the flight extraordinary? That's
what we're trying to find out,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean in any
way we think it's a terrorist act. There's nothing to indicate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The plane was delivered new to EgyptAir in September 1989 and
had logged more than 33,000 hours in the air during approximately
6,900 flights. Boeing officials reported that the plane was
considered to be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   A workhorse of transcontinental flight, the Boeing 767 has one
of the best safety records of any airplane model. Boeing estimates
that 813 million passengers have flown on 767s since its
introduction in 1982. There were two previous fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23, 1996, an Ethiopian Airlines 767 ran out of fuel and
crashed near the Comoros Islands on the east coast of Africa as it
attempted to land during a hijacking. The crash killed 117 of the
160 passengers and 10 of the 12 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a Lauda Air 767-300ER lost control and crashed after a
thrust reverser _ which redirects a portion of the jet's exhaust on
landing to slow the plane _ deployed as the plane was climbing to
24,000 feet. The plane crashed in Thailand and killed all 223
people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane involved in that accident came off the assembly line
immediately after the plane involved in Sunday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the Lauda Air accident, the FAA ordered the thrust
reversers disconnected. Later, the company designed a new locking
device, and the thrust reversers were deemed safe. The Lauda
aircraft used Pratt &AMP; Whitney 4000 engines, the same type of engine
on EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, the actions taken by the FAA addressed that
particular problem, but who knows,'' said one airline pilot who is
a captain on the 767-300ER. The designation ``ER'' stands for
extended range.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Boeing said he believed the EgyptAir 767 had the
new locking system installed, but was not certain.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, 12 days before Sunday's crash, a hijacker briefly
took control of an EgyptAir flight between Istanbul and Cairo. The
hijacker was captured in Germany and none of the 46 passengers were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent fatal crash involving EgyptAir occurred in 1976,
when a Boeing 707 jetliner crashed on approach to the Bangkok
airport. All 55 people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, there has been pressure recently on the government to
privatize the 67-year-old airline, which has been plagued by
reports of bad service and poor management. The airline has a fleet
of 38 planes and flies to 85 airports around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth major search for a downed airplane in the same
general area during the past three years. TWA Flight 800 went down
off Long Island in July 1996. SwissAir Flight 111 was next,
crashing off Nova Scotia in September 1998. Then the single-engine
plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her sister
crashed off Martha's Vineyard in July.

   ETHNIC-POLITICS-REVIEW (New York) _ Ethnic politics has reached
a level of complexity that is confounding politicians across the
nation. Candidates are being forced to take positions on
complicated issues, pitting the perceived interests of one ethnic
group against the sentiment of the population at large, or dividing
members of these purportedly solid constituencies by generation,
ideology and economic class. These pressures come at time when
ethnic groups that once existed at the margins of politics have
become powerful forces. The Senate race in New York may provide an
intricate roadmap for where ethnic politics in U.S. is heading. By
Adam Nagourney.

   PALESTINIAN-ECON-REVIEW (Ramallah, West Bank) _ A new route for
goods and people between the West Bank and Gaza offers the prospect
of unifying them into one integrated economy, a prerequisite for
building a viable Palestinian state. But new opening has already
exposed the stark cultural and economic contrasts between the two
regions. Now, the poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans

   CENTRAL-ASIA-MUSLIMS-REVIEW (Osh, Kyrgyzstan) _ The appearance
of Islamic insurgents in this remote Central Asian country has not

   WORLD-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Each year, Transparency
International, a non-profit group based in Berlin that specializes
in tracking global thievery, releases a list of the world's most
corrupt countries. But while Transparency's work has been lauded
for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of economic
development debates, some economists say the group's hit-list

in tracking global thievery, releases a list of the world's most
corrupt countries. But while Transparency's work has been lauded
for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of economic
development debates, some economists say the group's hit-list
unfairly tars countries that may be no more corrupt than those
ranked much lower. By Timothy L. O'Brien.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BECH AT BAY: A Quasi-Novel &LR;  By John Updike. Fawcett/Ballantine,
$12. The third, and probably the last, installment in the author's
long-running series featuring the Jewish anti-Updike continues to
satirize the writing life and corporate publishing, though the
changing world has left the aging hero nostalgic and generally at
sea. ``The sentimental, unreal universe of Bech is ... vital to
Updike's literary sensibility,'' James Shapiro wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEEKERS: The Story of Man's Continuing Quest to Understand
His World &LR;  By Daniel J. Boorstin. Vintage, $14. This synoptic tour
of Western religion and philosophy by a former librarian of
Congress and Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar is the concluding
volume of an ambitious trilogy that includes a history of Western
science, ``The Discoverers,'' and of Western art, ``The Creators.''
There's bound to be much to quibble with in this sweeping, secular
overview (written by a liberal humanist), but ``Boorstin reminds us
what intellectual history on the grand scale looks like,'' Michael
Lind wrote last year. He ``has a memory for quotation as
comprehensive as that of any Renaissance humanist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMSTERDAM &LR;  By Ian McEwan. Anchor, $12. This comic morality tale
describes the comeuppances of two self-important Londoners, a
composer and a newspaper editor, whose friendship unravels after
the funeral of a woman with whom they both had an affair. With its
viselike plot and cruel wit, the novel ``is a well-oiled machine''
that is ``entertaining in the mode of earlier nasty British
satirists like Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis,'' William H.
Pritchard wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE CHILD IN TIME &LR;  ($14), an
earlier novel by McEwan about a children's book writer who is
emotionally devastated when his 3-year-old daughter disappears
during a trip to the supermarket. In 1987 the reviewer Rebecca
Goldstein admired the story's ``psychological reality: the
beautifully realized relationships, the tracing of the many-layered
love between father and child, husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURBULENT SOULS: A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family &LR; 
By Stephen J. Dubner. Bard/Avon, $12.50. A former editor and writer
at The Times Magazine chronicles his parents' spiritual journey
from Judaism to Catholicism and his own reverse course as an adult.
The result is an ``intense, acutely observed and ... exigent
memoir,'' Jonathan Wilson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MIDDLEMAN: And Other Stories &LR;  By Bharati Mukherjee. Grove
Press, $12. The immigrants in these tales, whether from Vietnam,
Italy or India, aren't tired, huddled or even poor. ```The
Middleman' is a consummated romance with the American language,''
Jonathan Raban wrote in 1988. ``It is also a romance with America
itself, its infinitely possible geography, its license, sexiness
and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WE DIE ALONE &LR;  By David Howarth. Lyons, $14.95. In 1943, a
Norwegian commando named Jan Baalsrud escaped a Nazi ambush and
fled overland from Norway to neutral Sweden, eluding his pursuers
while surviving frostbite, snow blindness and many other hardships.
This illustrated account of his ordeal ``is high adventure told
with overpowering simplicity and drama,'' Herbert Mitgang wrote in
The New York Times Book Review in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RESERVATION ROAD &LR;  By John Burnham Schwartz. Vintage
Contemporaries, $13. This novel explores the aftershocks of a
10-year-old boy's hit-and-run death, particularly on the delusional
driver and on the child's father, a gentle professor racked by
guilt and bent on revenge. ``Reflective, character-driven as it is,
`Reservation Road' reads like a thriller, swift and complete,'' Kit
Reed wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FASHIONABLE NONSENSE: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of
Science &LR;  By Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. Picador USA, $14. Two
physicists issue a broadside against the misuse of science by
postmodern theorists and a defense of scientific realism against
its relativist enemies. ``Sokal and Bricmont have done reason a
modest service by exposing a species of intellectual quackery,''
Jim Holt wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEANING OF IT ALL: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist &LR; , by
Richard P. Feynman (Helix/Perseus, $13), is a collection of three
1963 lectures in which a Nobel laureate in physics expounds on the
relationship among science, religion and society. ``There's some
splendid stuff here,'' Timothy Ferris wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EDITH WHARTON: An Extraordinary Life &LR;  By Eleanor Dwight.
Abrams, $19.95. With more than 300 period photographs and
illustrations, this biography illuminates the writer's life and
travels, from the gardens of Italy to the cottages of Newport. It
``does much more than take readers touring: It also evokes the
special quality of attention with which Wharton met the world,''
Angeline Goreau wrote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLEFT: And Other Odd Tales &LR;  By Gahan Wilson. Tor/Tom
Doherty, $14.95. These meticulously eccentric stories feature
lonely frogs, vengeful sea gulls and murderous cats _ and those are
just the animal characters. Last year the reviewer Andrea Higbie
said that the author's unnervingly funny drawings ``are definitely
the icing on this devil's food cake of a book.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fighting roadway clamor with Vivaldi
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 3, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since I grasped that presidents lied and schemed, that
sports personalities placed their team loyalties into the hands of
avaricious agents and that seemingly half the dudes in mucho macho
acting roles practiced alternative lifestyles, I have been in
search of a new hero.
</P>
<P>
   I may have found that person.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it turns out to be not a hero but a heroine, if
that feminine noun has not yet been neutered during these
language-bewildering politically correct days.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Kaylor is a county judge in Lakeland, Fla., who faced off
with 15 young men who violated the city's noise ordinance. What
they did to despoil not only Lakeland's laws but the sensibilities
of conventional citizens was to drive down the streets blasting
their car stereos at decibel counts that could be registered on
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   To even have such a law is inane but it apparently was made
necessary by people who have no consideration for others.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Judge Anne could have fined each of them $43. But she
had a better idea, and I will forever admire her for it: ``You do
not have the right to make everyone else listen to what you
consider to be good music,'' she reprimanded them. ``You are going
to listen to three hours of my kind of music, whether you like it
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   She obviously is a fan of Vivaldi because that was their
sentence, although several later said they would rather take their
chances with a traditional court sentence than listen to three
hours of Vivaldi. Nevertheless, they are required to listen to the
three hours, which includes a quartet of ``The Four Seasons''
violin concertos. They also are on 90 days probation, ordered to
pay $25 court costs each and required to purchase a classical CD.
(No, in most circles Bruce Springsteen is not yet considered to be
``classical.'')
</P>
<P>
   Someone needed to put down his/her foot on the highly agitating
practice wherein younger people force their grating music on others
by leaving their auto windows open and their speakers on full
blast.
</P>
<P>
   I have been fighting this in my own way, hardly with the
authority of Judge Kaylor. Since buying an auto with a roof that
opens, I have counter-attacked those who would devastate my hearing
by turning up the sound on the classical CDs in my car.
</P>
<P>
   But I was fighting fire with fire: ``Let 'em have a taste of the
closing moments of Tchaikovsky's `Overture of 1812,' '' I would
erroneously boast. It really didn't work because Tchaikovsky's
arrangements, while offering cannon fire, never included the
numbing, drumming deep bass of today's music.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaylor took a different approach; no cannons, no jumbo
crescendos, just lull them. While her style of sentencing appealed
to me, I would not have chosen Vivaldi as an adequate penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I would have chosen, as harsher punishment, Brahms'
``Double Concerto for Violin and Cello'' or that many-years-ago
junior high school music appreciation class marvel, ``Peer Gynt''
by Edvard Grieg. The tune of the latter is forever embedded in my
memory by teacher's creative ditty:
</P>
<P>
   ``Morning is dawning
</P>
<P>
   and Peer Gynt is yawning''
</P>
<P>
   When I called a friend, a rabid classical music fan, to tell him
about the judge's ruling and that the 15 culprits would have to
listen to Vivaldi at, of all places, the Lakeland police station,
he inquired as to where the pitiable police could go during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would you have made the offenders listen to for three
hours?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Manilow,'' he immediately responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's too cruel,'' I told him.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: There's more than isolationism to GOP's meanness
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House national security adviser Samuel Berger has deplored
congressional foreign-policy votes and meanness in foreign-affairs
funding this year as a new isolationism, but that seems too fine a
word for what looks, in sum, more like simple vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have honest policy differences with the
administration over specifics. Others would have Washington scale
down its international involvements out of worry we are
overextended, a legitimate if doubtful point. But more are using
foreign policy as a way to impeach President Clinton piecemeal out
of pique they couldn't convict him outright.
</P>
<P>
   Rank partisanship was notoriously at play in the Senate defeat
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, forfeiting U.S. arms control
leadership that goes back to the Eisenhower presidency. GOP leaders
agreed to hearings, and just perfunctory ones even then, only after
they had locked up enough votes to reject the pact, in effect
holding the trial after sentence has been pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership continues ceding its bitter Foreign Affairs
Committee chairman, Jesse Helms, arbitrary power over
ambassadorships. Helms earlier killed the nominations of William
Weld (a Republican, mind you) to Mexico and Robert Pastor to Panama
out of political grudges. Now he's barring Carol Moseley-Braun from
appointment to New Zealand. Moseley-Braun, when she was in the
Senate, frustrated Helms's effort to grant the Daughters of the
Confederacy an official federal patent to use the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   Cumulatively, the greatest damage to U.S. world leadership and
interests is in Congress's parsimony. GOP majorities have:
</P>
<P>
   _ Failed to provide funds to hold up our part of the
U.S.-brokered Wye River Accords that restarted Middle East
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withheld funding essential to American participation in Kosovo
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impoverished our program to shield the nuclear facilities,
personnel and weapons of the former Soviet Union from exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withheld funds from efforts to restrain North Korea's nuclear
arms development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Again indulged an anti-abortion amendment that would hamper
U.S. participation in family-planning projects overseas, holding up
payment of our United Nations dues by assuring a presidential veto.
Deadbeat America is close to losing its U.N. vote, even though U.N.
peacekeeping from East Timor to Sierra Leone serves our manifest
interest in international stability.
</P>
<P>
   Is any matter too small to escape abuse? The U.S.-Canadian
Pacific Salmon Agreement ends years of friction, but GOP leaders
have put the accord in jeopardy with anti-environment riders that
risk another presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign operations budget approved by Congress this year
runs at only half of 1985's rate. By increasing our reliance on
military means alone to assert U.S. interests, Congress isn't so
much slipping into neo-isolationism as it is scrapping a working,
companionate internationalism for an unbecoming bully
internationalism.

<P>
   Hard as Hollywood tries to get it right, it often falls back on
the old cliches. The latest offering in this genre is ``Music of
the Heart,'' with Meryl Streep playing the real-life Roberta
Guaspari. Abandoned by her Navy officer husband, she moved her two
small sons and a crate of violins to New York's East Harlem and
talked her way into a job at Central Park East school. Threatened
by budget cuts, Ms. Guaspari conducted her best violin students in
a triumphal concert at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Central Park East is one of the most acclaimed
public schools in the country, a harmonious blend of races and
classes in a rough neighborhood; even middle-class parents beg for
their children to be admitted. In the movie, it becomes a
stereotypical ghetto school with lazy tenured teachers, racial
discord and routine violence, where one stern but courageous
teacher saves the day.
</P>
<P>
   While lauding Ms. Guaspari, Deborah Meier, the founder of
Central Park East, complains that the movie turned a chance to tell
a complex story of a good school nurturing a fellow risk-taker into
a simple tale of good guys versus bad guys.

Hampshire presidential primary but were subsequently driven from
the Republican castle by the establishment forces of Bob Dole. Now
Buchanan is back under a different banner, aiming to mount up on

pleasure, using the occasion of her 52nd birthday to hold a
fundraiser in New York to finance her expected campaign for the
U.S. Senate. An array of Broadway stars, from Joel Grey to Rosie

Clinton, and insults directed at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
Mrs. Clinton's presumed opponent in the contest for the Senate seat
next year.

<P>
   The night raised $1 million for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory

   A Mysterious Flight to Death
</P>
<P>
   Something, possibly something quite small, went wrong on a
Learjet chartered in Orlando, Fla., on Monday by pro golfer Payne
Stewart. It was evidently big enough to disable or kill the two
pilots, but not big enough to stop the airplane from flying 1,400
miles, presumably on autopilot, to a pasture in South Dakota, where
it crashed when one of its engines ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders usually provide clues in crashes, but in
this case the tape was a 30-minute loop, and the plane flew for
about 4 hours without human intervention. It had no flight data
recorder. But investigators still hope for clues from the wreckage,
and from interviews with maintenance workers and fighter pilots who
were scrambled to see what was going on.

   Peron's Heirs Lose Their Grip
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of the flamboyant rule of President Carlos Saul
Menem, Argentines gave a landslide presidential election victory to
the unabashedly uncharismatic mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la
Rua, and his center-left Alianza coalition. De la Rua is not
expected to take Argentina in a direction very different from the
policies of Menem, but his victory broke a decade of dominance by
the Justicialist party founded half a century ago by Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron. More than anything else, the vote for De la Rua
appeared to reflect a popular rejection of the extravagance and
perceived tolerance of corruption by Menem and other Peronist
leaders.

<P>
   In the wake of an embarrassing recall of a controversial
biography of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, St. Martin's Press
editor-in-chief Robert Wallace resigned, saying he did not want to
be associated with such books and had had no control over
publication of this one.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ acquired for a modest $25,000 advance _ was written
by J.H. Hatfield, who the publisher belatedly discovered was a
felon who had been paroled on a charge of plotting the murder of
his boss in a failed car bombing. Wallace quickly landed a job as a

   Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian had just finished answering
questions from members of Armenia's Parliament when five men in
trench coats, some toting Kalashnikov automatic rifles, rushed in.
One emptied his weapon into Sarkisian while others turned on the
audience, firing into the front row where government dignitaries
sat.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended some 17 hours later, eight men were dead,
including the prime minister and the speaker of the Parliament, and
about 40 hostages had spent a terrifying night under siege by
police and a special anti-terrorist team sent from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Why remains somewhat foggy. The five gunmen, led by an Armenian
ex-journalist and ultra-nationalist named Nairi Unanian,
surrendered and released their hostages Thursday morning after
being allowed to broadcast a statement on national television. In
it, they accused Sarkisian and other leaders of destroying the
economy and allowing corruption to rot the government.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, Unanian and two others had been charged with
terrorism, potentially punishable by death.

suicide for the terminally ill.

   The so-called Death with Dignity Act was approved by the
narrowest of margins in 1994 but then, facing a legal challenge,
was reaffirmed by a 60 percent to 40 percent vote three years

acted.

   ``Is Congress really saying that our vote doesn't count, it

 NEW YORK: important constituency.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In truth, Puerto Ricans living in the United States are divided
over whether the island should be independent. The FALN has not
been in the news for years, and many young Puerto Rican Americans
know little about it. And even among those who know of the group,
and support its goal of Puerto Rican independence, there is no
evidence of widespread support for its tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated,'' said Joseph Wiscovitch, a political
consultant who has worked on Hispanic issues for Democratic and
Republican candidates, including Giuliani. ``Some Latinos feel, why
is all this energy being spent on FALN? Why not spend it on
education. You're talking about the silent majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Serrano said he believes there was not much electoral
benefit in his advocating clemency: ``I don't know if that will get
you a lot of votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Hispanics have attracted the most attention of the
nation's politicians. This group of voters is at the leading edge
of the changing dynamics of ethnic politics, outpacing blacks as a
segment of the population, even if they remain, to date, a smaller
part of the electorate, because of citizenship requirements and
age, said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban
Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
Nationally, Hispanics made up 5 percent of the vote last year, up
from 3 percent in 1992. In New York City, they made up 20 percent
of the vote in the 1997 mayoral race, compared to 13 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as a group, Hispanics are increasingly large and diverse, in
terms of country of origin, ideology and economic class. If there
ever was such a thing as a ``Hispanic vote,'' it doesn't exist now.
Hispanic voters, like many ethnic groups, are better informed than
before. There are Spanish-language television networks, radio
stations and newspapers. ``We now have 24 hours a day the ability
to get information in Spanish if we're not conversant in English
yet,'' Serrano said. ``There was a time that you couldn't get to
know the issues because no one was covering them in the language
that we knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Generational differences in the views of ethnic groups are also
emerging. The single burning issue of one generation of immigrants,
which made them vulnerable to easy appeals by politicians, has
become merely one of many concerns for their American children and
grandchildren. In Florida, older Cuban-Americans are as passionate
in their opposition to Fidel Castro as ever; but that bitterness
has not necessarily passed down to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   It was once unthinkable for a candidate in New York to support
the creation of a Palestinian state, and Mrs. Clinton came under
much criticism when she did. But Ms. Cutler, who is Jewish, said
she has found that her own children, while extremely concerned
about Israel, are not at all perturbed by the notion of a
Palestinian state. ``It is subtle, but that is the difference,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a politician respond to this changing dynamic? A
clue can be found in the presidential campaigns, where, not
surprisingly, it can be hard to pass a campaign day without hearing
an Anglo candidate speaking Spanish. At an appearance at a Hispanic
banquet in Washington the other day, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who
has considerable experience in appealing for the votes of
Mexican-Americans, boasted how he did not have to tailor his speech
for this audience, because they already shared his values. He would
not, he said, say anything special to appeal to Hispanics. And
then, without a skipping a beat, Bush recounted how he can't go
anywhere without someone asking him if he is going after the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Por su puesto!'' Bush said, using the Spanish for ``of
course.''

   A Mysterious Flight to Death
</P>
<P>
   Something, possibly something quite small, went wrong on a
Learjet chartered in Orlando, Fla., on Monday by pro golfer Payne
Stewart. It was evidently big enough to disable or kill the two
pilots, but not big enough to stop the airplane from flying 1,400
miles, presumably on autopilot, to a pasture in South Dakota, where
it crashed when one of its engines ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit voice recorders usually provide clues in crashes, but in
this case the tape was a 30-minute loop, and the plane flew for
about 4 hours without human intervention. It had no flight data
recorder. But investigators still hope for clues from the wreckage,
and from interviews with maintenance workers and fighter pilots who
were scrambled to see what was going on.

   After 10 years of the flamboyant rule of President Carlos Saul
Menem, Argentines gave a landslide presidential election victory to
the unabashedly uncharismatic mayor of Buenos Aires, Fernando de la
Rua, and his center-left Alianza coalition. De la Rua is not
expected to take Argentina in a direction very different from the
policies of Menem, but his victory broke a decade of dominance by
the Justicialist party founded half a century ago by Gen. Juan
Domingo Peron. More than anything else, the vote for De la Rua
appeared to reflect a popular rejection of the extravagance and
perceived tolerance of corruption by Menem and other Peronist
leaders.

   NEW YORK _ It once seemed so easy. Toward the end of every
mayoral campaign in New York City, candidates would head to the
Lower East Side where, crowded in by cameras, they would eat a
knish or a pastrami sandwich and talk about how much they loved
Israel. Or toward the finish of a presidential campaign, the
candidates would turn up in the Polish section of Chicago for some
kielbasa, a pro forma denunciation of Soviet domination of Eastern
Europe and more photographs. This was ethnic politics in its most
primal form, an unstated calculation that the most elementary of
gestures _ a visit, a picture, a noncontroversial proclamation or
two _ would produce a payback in the form of the ``Jewish vote'' or
the ``Polish vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are suddenly looking very far away. Ethnic politics,
which was never really as simple as some politicians believed, has
reached a level of complexity that is suddenly confounding
politicians across the nation. That has become especially apparent
these days in what is arguably the first cauldron of ethnic
politics in the United States _ New York _ with its race for the
Senate between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a contest that seems to be providing an intricate road
map of where ethnic politics in America is heading.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, winning the Jewish vote in New York was never just a
matter of eating a Kosher dill, just as capturing the Hispanic vote
in Texas or California required more than the ability to spout a
few lines in Spanish. But these days, candidates are forced to take
positions on all kinds of complicated issues, pitting the perceived
interests of one ethnic group against the sentiment of the larger
population, or dividing members of purportedly solid constituencies
by generation, ideology and economic class.
</P>
<P>
   And these pressures are coming at a time when groups that once
existed at the margins of electoral politics _ most of all,
Hispanic voters, whose clout nearly rivals blacks in some parts of
the country _ have become powerful forces, large in number,
knowledgeable about issues and savvy in working the system. The
idea of such constituencies as single-minded voting blocs,
concerned only with parochial issues and subject to easy
manipulation, is as much of a relic as Tammany Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do tokenism anymore,'' said Lynn Cutler, a long-time
Democratic operative who is now a White House adviser to Vice
President Al Gore. ``I think that maybe in all honesty the way we
did it in the past wasn't respectful. It was like, `I checked that
box. I ate the knish.' There's less single-issue voting based on
ethnic differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat and the ranking Puerto Rican
member in the House, said: ``There was a time when all you had to
do was get up and say a few Spanish words or eat the right Spanish
food and you were an amigo. Now, the issues are much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sophisticated, new environment, it is no longer enough
to take off, for example, on the three-I travel itinerary of
Israel, Italy and Ireland in preparation for a New York campaign.
Not long ago, Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton were forced to choose
between what the Defense Department described as the nation's
security over Puerto Rico and the concerns of local leaders about
the island's safety when the Pentagon said it wanted to continue
bombing practice there. (Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton chose Puerto
Rico.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mrs. Clinton is now pressed to take a position on an
application before President Clinton to grant clemency to Jonathan
Jay Pollard, a former U.S. intelligence analyst serving a life
sentence for spying on the United States. Giuliani has demanded
that Clinton free Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   The most unsettling episode, at least for Mrs. Clinton, came
over the summer after Clinton offered executive clemency to 16
jailed members of the FALN, a Puerto Rican separatist group that
has engaged in terrorism. When he first made the offer, she tepidly
endorsed it, and Republicans charged that the president had acted
to curry support for his wife with Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   As an uproar erupted, Mrs. Clinton withdrew her support for
clemency, and found herself besieged both by Puerto Rican leaders
on one side and Republican critics on the other. For Mrs. Clinton,
it was an unhappy introduction to New York ethnic politics.
</P>
<P>
   What most mystified Mrs. Clinton's Puerto Rican supporters was
why she said anything at all. Once upon a time, it might have made
sense to reflexively adopt a position that many Republicans _ as
well as a few independent political commentators _ argued was the
obvious stance a Democratic candidate should take to capture this
important constituency.

THE FAT WAR: HOPE AMID THE HARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It certainly is easy to get fat in America. Take the room
service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md. If you
order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels,
orange juice, a banana and strawberries _ a meal with at least
1,000 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of
the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average
number of calories year by year. And the percentage of adults who
claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991
to 1998, at about 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a
predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year. More
than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more
than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official
medical measure of fatness. (Overweight is defined as a body mass
index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30. Your body mass
index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of
your height in feet.)
</P>
<P>
   And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with
poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed
to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose
fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust. In a preliminary
study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little
or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually
gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future
could hold more bad news. Others say there may in fact be a magic
bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular
biology. And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective
obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that
has proved so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an
obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating. Every time it
seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more
weight. These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population
gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors
to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise. It also called for
a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths. If the nation can
mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for
obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity
prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and
environmental components analogous to those already in place for
tobacco use,'' the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a
new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat
people lose interest in eating to excess. Perhaps the drugs should
be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some
researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat
people who cannot control their weight.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of
leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as
part of a natural weight control system. As such, it has revealed
molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely
targeted weight loss drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my prediction,'' said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, who is
deputy director of the obesity research center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent
leptin study. ``We are going to be able to turn off appetite
completely _ eventually. The therapeutics will be sophisticated
enough to stop people from eating.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that while there are certainly social and environmental
influences on body weight _ people who live in Southern states tend
to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter _ eventually obesity
will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels. Those who
cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a
pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this
lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of
willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people
were overweight,'' Heymsfield said. ``Seven or eight years ago, the
first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very
important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one
or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular
discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People
were shocked.'' That discovery came when scientists reported that
leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin. The
next year, the hormone was found in people.
</P>
<P>
   At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to
be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat
people and they will get thin. But it turned out that overweight
people make plenty of leptin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a
half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
These people eat voraciously _ one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000
calories at a sitting. When several of these people were treated
with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal
the brain that there is fat on the body.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Animals and people who lack the hormone get no such signal and
they eat continuously.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that leptin would
serve to signal the brain that there is fat on the body rather than
signal the body to get rid of fat, said Dr. Jeffrey Flier, the
chief of endocrinology at the Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution would favor people who could get obese when they
have an opportunity to eat,'' he said. ``Starvation is so much more
of a threat to survival than obesity that it is reasonable to
propose that the role of leptin is as a switch to tell the brain
that you are in danger from food restriction or that you are
okay.''
</P>
<P>
   But leptin is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of leptin has propelled obesity research from a
backwater of scientific activity into one of the major growth areas
in biomedicine,'' said Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of
metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England.
``Once leptin goes to the brain, the next switches in that circuit
really are likely to lead to advances in obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Greenberg, an author with Heymsfield of the new
leptin paper and the director of the program in human obesity at
the the Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center at
Tufts University, cautioned that the research has hardly begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are in obesity is where people were in cholesterol
research 15 years ago,'' Greenberg said. ``They were just beginning
to define the mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heymsfield said the leptin discovery has allowed him to
envision a pharmacological end to obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it, `` he said, ``as the dawn of the molecular era in
obesity therapeutics.''

THE FAT WAR: HOPE AMID THE HARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It certainly is easy to get fat in America. Take the room
service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md. If you
order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels,
orange juice, a banana and strawberries _ a meal with at least
1,000 calories.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of
the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average
number of calories year by year. And the percentage of adults who
claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991
to 1998, at about 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a
predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year. More
than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more
than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official
medical measure of fatness. (Overweight is defined as a body mass
index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30. Your body mass
index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of
your height in feet.)
</P>
<P>
   And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with
poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed
to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose
fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust. In a preliminary
study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little
or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually
gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future
could hold more bad news. Others say there may in fact be a magic
bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular
biology. And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective
obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that
has proved so disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an
obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating. Every time it
seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more
weight. These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population
gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors
to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise. It also called for
a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths. If the nation can
mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for
obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity
prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and
environmental components analogous to those already in place for
tobacco use,'' the journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a
new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat
people lose interest in eating to excess. Perhaps the drugs should
be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some
researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat
people who cannot control their weight.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of
leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as
part of a natural weight control system. As such, it has revealed
molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely
targeted weight loss drugs.
</P>

HEAD START, EVERYONE: TODDLING OFF TO PRESCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   What is the right age for children to start school?
</P>
<P>
   Americans quickly say 5 or 6, but it has only been that way in
the United States for a couple of generations. In France, Belgium
and elsewhere in Europe, 3- and 4-year-olds must attend class. With
new research finding that evidence of early education has a lasting
impact, along with the continued push of women into the work force,
movement for universal preschool is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, superintendent of public instruction in
California, says preschool is ``the next big idea,'' and that by
the end of the next decade, school will be a hybrid of day care and
kindergarten and begin at age 3. Vice President Al Gore has made
the concept a staple of his presidential platform; his rival for
the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley, proposes doubling funds
for Head Start, the government's 35-year-old preschool program for
poor children. The Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, has a $235 million pre-kindergarten program for poor children
in his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody interested in education has got to be interested in
getting there early,'' said Edward Zigler, a child psychologist at
Yale University and a founder of the Head Start program. ``Why is
it that in the first five years of life, which we all know to be
the foundation years, that every family is out for themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 55 percent of American children, from 3 to 5, are in some
form of preschool, with 79 percent in families earning over $75,000
a year and 43 percent in those making under $10,000. The choices
range from costly new programs like Creme de la Creme, which offers
French and tennis to toddlers, to Montessori method and to day-care
centers where television forms the core of a ``curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on pre-kindergarten has more than doubled to
$1.7 billion last year from $700 million in 1991; public enrollment
has risen to 725,000 from less than 300,000. The cost of reaching
every 3- and 4-year-old would be an estimated $30 billion or $5,000
per child.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 42 states have preschool programs, although they serve
only poor children. Georgia, which uses funds from its lottery, is
the only state offering preschool to every child; New York, which
promised universal preschool in 1997, so far has only 30,000
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a tour of France's ``ecole maternelle,'' where
3-year-olds bake pies in science lab and learn to count and read, a
group of educators met in Washington last week to extol the
benefits of preschool for everyone. A recent study by researchers
in North Carolina found that poor black children who received
high-quality day-care from infancy to 5 outperformed their peers
all the way into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would benefit children, it would benefit parents,'' said
Dr. Barry Zuckerman, a Boston University professor of pediatrics,
referring to universal preschool, ``and it's probably an
appropriate societal response to these demographic changes that
we've had. It's literally an evolutionary process.''
</P>
<P>
   Issuing a cautionary note, the Cato Institute, a conservative
research organization in Washington, said the public schools should
not be allowed to expand, since they are increasingly icons of
failure. The benefits of Head Start fade over time, said Darcy Ann
Olsen, an expert on child care for the institute, and the
advantages of nursery school for the middle class have yet to be
proved. She also cited a 1991 federal study showing that 96 percent
of parents were satisfied with their current child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to, who do you trust?'' Ms. Olsen said.
``The advocates trust themselves to make these policies for
millions and millions of children. I think this is a responsibility
for parents. They know their children best.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rector, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said parents would prefer a tax credit, which might
allow them to stay home with their children, rather than a new
government program. Many parents feel guilty about working, he
said, and the movement toward preschool is ``a justification rather
than what's in the best interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some proponents of preschool worry that if government
subsidizes education for toddlers, the market will respond by
paying even less attention to day care for babies.
</P>
<P>
   Kindergarten was controversial, too. Once the province of the
rich when it was introduced in the 1850s from Germany, it expanded
in this century amid worries about immigration and acculturation.
Still, kindergarten has no federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Bettye Caldwell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences, advocates a preschool concept she
calls ``educare,'' in which children would learn letters and
numbers, and social skills like sharing. A well-trained, nurturing
staff would earn salaries equal to schoolteachers (day-care aides'
pay is comparable to that of gas-station attendants).``We can't
think of them as just warehousing or baby-sitting,'' Dr. Caldwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates imagine an extension downward of the
public-school system; others envision a grant those students can
use at private and public colleges. Zuckerman has a more radical
proposal: Why not start school at 3 and end it at 16, enabling
graduates to work or do community service until college?
</P>
<P>
   As Zigler noted, ``There's nothing magic about starting school
at age 5.''

CANDIDATES, TAKING A STAND, MIX POLICY AND PERSONA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ It was once a sure-fire attack strategy in
presidential debates: Candidates turn to their rivals and scold
them for espousing policies that are fanciful, shallow and even
risky. ``Where's the beef?'' asked Walter Mondale, memorably
needling Gary Hart during the Democratic primary campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   No one's asking now. The 2000 campaign has been marked by an
extraordinary (if not mind-numbing) degree of substance. Candidates
have issued more meaty 10- and 12-point plans, earlier in the
season, than ever before in presidential politics. The question is,
will it pay off? Or are the voters more attuned to that elusive and
much-trumpeted concept, character?
</P>
<P>
   The dueling over policy pronouncements by Vice President Al Gore
and Bill Bradley was on display last week at the first televised
debate here at Dartmouth College. They eagerly plunged into a
discussion of the intricacies of more funding for special
education, health insurance for children and protections for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
issued stacks of position papers (his recent education plan was 12
single-spaced pages) to fend off critiques that he is, in the
parlance of his state of Texas, more hat than horse. But he doesn't
talk about them as much, preferring to project a Reaganesque
geniality and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the candidates' handling of issues reveals their
own approaches and personalities. Gore and Bradley built their
Senate careers on mastery of daunting matters like the environment
and tax system overhauls. ``He's equal part dreamer and policy
wonk,'' Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, partly because he prides himself on not sweating the
details, speaks more about grand themes that have served him well
as governor. He is, no doubt, mindful of polls showing that while
most people are not paying much attention to the presidential
contest, those who do seem more interested in the candidates'
personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by being substantive, candidates can achieve other goals.
``There's an implicit presidential aura to presenting six-point
programs,'' said Anthony Dolan, a former speechwriter for Ronald
Reagan. ``There's a subliminal message you send to voters: `I have
the will to govern.''' Some candidates use detailed policies to
prove their bona fides with a narrow group of partisans and
interest groups whose support is crucial in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is another practical explanation for so much substance so
early: Because the primary schedule next year is the most
compressed in history, the entire process is accelerated.
Candidates who wait until January to issue proposals may be
dismissed as too slow _ or imitating their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past, candidates did not have to be so specific
because the parties often set the agenda. During the Cold War, the
prescriptions for dealing with the Soviet Union were starkly
different in both parties. Now that there are fewer differences _
and no overriding, burning issues _ candidates face greater
pressure to define themselves through their distinct plans.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for politicians is they can get tripped up in the
minutiae. Gore, relying on his vast experience in the White House
and in Congress, has emphasized his command of the issues. But
early this year he put out such a blizzard of issue papers that the
Bradley camp ridiculed him for being bogged down in small-bore
matters. He has tried to remedy that recently by mixing the policy
with the personal.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates complain that if they dwell on issues, the media
ignores them and focuses on personality and the horse race anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also learned the down side of serving up too much
detail. Refuting accusations that his proposals lacked heft, he
boasted that he was going further than most politicians in setting
a price tag _ $65 billion a year _ for his plan to make health care
available to virtually all uninsured Americans. But in doing so, he
gave Gore an opening that the vice president happily seized upon
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a big idea.'' Gore said, ``but it's not a good
idea.'' Should Bradley makes it to the Democratic nomination, that
line may well turn up in the Republicans' attack commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers, as well as Bradley's, have urged their
candidates not to be prodded into appearing like policy mavens.
``Yes, a tax plan is important and, yes, an education proposal is
important,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
``But the specific percentage of a proposed tax cut is probably
less important to the average voter than, `Do I agree with this
candidate's overall philosophy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes he can undermine Bradley in the same way President
Gerald R. Ford poked holes in a plan issued by Reagan during the
campaign for the 1976 Republican nomination that called for
stripping $90 billion from the federal budget. The proposal created
a firestorm, with the Ford campaign warning that it would cause
massive cuts in federal programs. The Ford camp issued detailed
breakdowns of how the plan would damage New Hampshire, which holds
the first primary. Reagan was so unnerved by the criticism that he
backed away from it, saying he ``didn't pay attention'' when aides
listed the $90 billion in cuts _ and that he meant his proposal to
be taken only figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides worrying how their opponents will respond, candidates
have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy
proposals at face value. When Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in
1996, issued the economic and political foundation of his campaign
_ a 15 percent income tax cut and a halving of the capital gains
tax _ polls showed that voters did not view it too seriously.
That's because the Dole campaign publicly tinkered with several
alternatives. It did not help that President Clinton's campaign
distributed quotations to reporters in which Dole had belittled the
supply-side economics that was central to his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy emphasis on substance was first notable during the 1992
Democratic presidential run by then-Gov. Bill Clinton, former Sen.
Paul Tsongas and Sen. Bob Kerrey. All sought to demonstrate their
seriousness of purpose. Substance, indeed, was a way for Clinton to
deflect questions about his personal conduct and assure voters that
he knew how to fix the economy. One of his strategists, George
Stephanopoulos, went as far as to say that ``specificity is the
character issue of '92.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, never escaped questions about his integrity.
In the current campaign, politicians who want to succeed him are
again trying to use substance to prove their own character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Clinton was perceived to be a smooth operator, there's
an extra motivation for candidates this year to show that that's
not them,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director for Sen. John
McCain, who is seeking the Republican nomination. ``The way you do
that is by flashing the policy credential. Bob Dole stood up and
said, `I have character.' That's not good enough. Policy is the
prism through which voters judge character.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on substance may seem like a public service. But
the bad news is that the more candidates propose, the more they
overpromise. Clinton had ambitious plans for his national service
program that were scaled back after his election. Chances are, most
of the heady dreams of Campaign 2000 will never be more than
dreams.

   NEW YORK _ East Side, West Side, all around the town,
early-morning television is taking to the sidewalks of New York as
never before _ sidewalks that have become, in effect, sound stages
where cameras can capture the exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans
waving, shouting and reveling in their 15 seconds of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Picture-window studios have become a New York phenomenon.
Network executives say stations in other cities cannot afford to
spend millions on studios the way the networks can, and besides,
New York is the people-watching capital of the world, and the
networks know it. Every aunt or grandmother who tunes in, hoping
for a glimpse of a relative in the background behind Matt and Katie
or Charlie and Diane or, starting Monday, Bryant and Jane, adds to
a show's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks every rule in TV 101,'' said Robert Thompson, a
professor of film and television at Syracuse University. ``You're
not supposed to take the attention off the business at hand, but
when the business at hand needs a little push, the audience
provides a vast and sometimes amusing unpaid cast.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ABC and CBS are trying to catch up to the ``Today'' show
on NBC, which moved to a first-floor studio in Rockefeller Center
in 1994. Ever since, ``Today'' has been showing off its
standing-room-only sidewalk space _ and bragging about displacing
``Good Morning America'' for the lead in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the surest form of television; ABC moved ``Good
Morning America'' into a glass-walled studio in Times Square in
September. ``Today'' remains No. 1, but since ``Good Morning
America'' began showing crowds on the lower level of its two-story
studio and inviting a lucky few upstairs for consumer-affairs
segments, its ratings have risen somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Nov. 1, CBS moves its newly renamed ``Early Show'' to
Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, with world-famous hotels in the
background. CBS is betting that its new studio will help make the
network competitive in the morning for the first time since
``Captain Kangaroo'' went off the air a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the hotels are looking forward to the arrival of
Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayton and their fans. The
Sherry-Netherland Hotel went to court to block CBS' plans,
complaining that the show would lead to overcrowded sidewalks and
noise that could wake late sleepers at the hotel. ``People will be
waving and shouting and creating that fake Beatlemania-like
sensation,'' the hotel said in court papers. A CBS spokesman would
say only that the matter remains unresolved, but that the two sides
have been talking.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have spent heavily to show their viewers New York
up close. NBC spent $15 million; CBS is said to have spent $30
million. MTV also broadcasts from studios with floor-to-ceiling
windows. Its home, across Broadway from the new ``Good Morning
America'' quarters, draws neck-craning fans hoping for a glimpse of
their favorite veejay or, better, their favorite rock star. (The
neck-craning is a must. Unlike the ``Today'' and ``Early Show''
studios, MTV's base of operations is on the second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the success of the `Today' show woke other
television people up,'' said Steve Friedman, who was the executive
producer of ``Today'' when it moved and now has the same job at its
new CBS competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that woke up the networks' decision-makers was
New York's surging popularity as a tourist destination. ``New York
is hot again,'' Thompson said. ```Seinfeld' did this, `Friends' did
this, and they contributed to the idea that New York is the place
to be. There was a sense a few years ago that you wanted to ignore
New York, the symbol of all kinds of collapse, the inner city, the
economy. That's all changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners find themselves peering in the morning shows'
windows because there is not much to do at 7 a.m. The Statue of
Liberty and the observatory at the Empire State Building do not
open until 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   For the folks back home, the streetscape provides an element
that producers consider increasingly important _ ``visual relief.''
Playing peekaboo with passersby gives viewers something more than
just another glitzy set filled with people sitting around talking.
</P>
<P>
   If two's company, Friedman's show will make an early-morning
crowd. But he said the decision to put the hosts in front of glass
was not about imitation. ``The fact is that people expect more out
of television than a studio that's supposed to look like somebody's
living room or dining room and isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart at ``Good Morning America,'' Shelly Ross, said
the new studio provides a pool of people who can go on the show and
or talk with consumer experts about why they buy what they buy or
eat what they eat. ``In the past,'' she said, ``Good Morning
America'' relied on ``handpicked friends of friends of friends''
for such interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But showing crowds on live television is not without risks.
``When you see people holding up one finger, you wonder are they
saying, `You're No. 1,''' Thompson said, ``or are they saying
something else?''

HEAD START, EVERYONE: TODDLING OFF TO PRESCHOOL

   What is the right age for children to start school?
</P>
<P>
   Americans quickly say 5 or 6, but it has only been that way in
the United States for a couple of generations. In France, Belgium
and elsewhere in Europe, 3- and 4-year-olds must attend class. With
new research finding that evidence of early education has a lasting
impact, along with the continued push of women into the work force,
movement for universal preschool is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, superintendent of public instruction in
California, says preschool is ``the next big idea,'' and that by
the end of the next decade, school will be a hybrid of day care and
kindergarten and begin at age 3. Vice President Al Gore has made
the concept a staple of his presidential platform; his rival for
the Democratic nomination, Bill Bradley, proposes doubling funds
for Head Start, the government's 35-year-old preschool program for
poor children. The Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, has a $235 million pre-kindergarten program for poor children
in his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody interested in education has got to be interested in
getting there early,'' said Edward Zigler, a child psychologist at
Yale University and a founder of the Head Start program. ``Why is
it that in the first five years of life, which we all know to be
the foundation years, that every family is out for themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 55 percent of American children, from 3 to 5, are in some
form of preschool, with 79 percent in families earning over $75,000
a year and 43 percent in those making under $10,000. The choices
range from costly new programs like Creme de la Creme, which offers
French and tennis to toddlers, to Montessori method and to day-care
centers where television forms the core of a ``curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spending on pre-kindergarten has more than doubled to
$1.7 billion last year from $700 million in 1991; public enrollment
has risen to 725,000 from less than 300,000. The cost of reaching
every 3- and 4-year-old would be an estimated $30 billion or $5,000
per child.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 42 states have preschool programs, although they serve
only poor children. Georgia, which uses funds from its lottery, is
the only state offering preschool to every child; New York, which
promised universal preschool in 1997, so far has only 30,000
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a tour of France's ``ecole maternelle,'' where
3-year-olds bake pies in science lab and learn to count and read, a
group of educators met in Washington last week to extol the
benefits of preschool for everyone. A recent study by researchers
in North Carolina found that poor black children who received
high-quality day-care from infancy to 5 outperformed their peers
all the way into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would benefit children, it would benefit parents,'' said
Dr. Barry Zuckerman, a Boston University professor of pediatrics,
referring to universal preschool, ``and it's probably an
appropriate societal response to these demographic changes that
we've had. It's literally an evolutionary process.''
</P>
<P>
   Issuing a cautionary note, the Cato Institute, a conservative
research organization in Washington, said the public schools should
not be allowed to expand, since they are increasingly icons of
failure. The benefits of Head Start fade over time, said Darcy Ann
Olsen, an expert on child care for the institute, and the
advantages of nursery school for the middle class have yet to be
proved. She also cited a 1991 federal study showing that 96 percent
of parents were satisfied with their current child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really comes down to, who do you trust?'' Ms. Olsen said.
``The advocates trust themselves to make these policies for
millions and millions of children. I think this is a responsibility
for parents. They know their children best.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rector, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said parents would prefer a tax credit, which might
allow them to stay home with their children, rather than a new
government program. Many parents feel guilty about working, he
said, and the movement toward preschool is ``a justification rather
than what's in the best interest of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some proponents of preschool worry that if government
subsidizes education for toddlers, the market will respond by
paying even less attention to day care for babies.
</P>
<P>
   Kindergarten was controversial, too. Once the province of the
rich when it was introduced in the 1850s from Germany, it expanded
in this century amid worries about immigration and acculturation.
Still, kindergarten has no federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Bettye Caldwell, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences, advocates a preschool concept she
calls ``educare,'' in which children would learn letters and
numbers, and social skills like sharing. A well-trained, nurturing
staff would earn salaries equal to schoolteachers (day-care aides'
pay is comparable to that of gas-station attendants).``We can't
think of them as just warehousing or baby-sitting,'' Dr. Caldwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates imagine an extension downward of the
public-school system; others envision a grant those students can
use at private and public colleges. Zuckerman has a more radical
proposal: Why not start school at 3 and end it at 16, enabling
graduates to work or do community service until college?
</P>
<P>
   As Zigler noted, ``There's nothing magic about starting school
at age 5.''

THE RIGHT DOSE OF SCARE TACTICS TO DISCOURAGE THE WRONG TYPE OF
BEHAVIOR

<P>
   Be afraid. Be very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns that
hope to stop young people from unsafe sex, smoking or binge
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the products of Baby Think It Over, Inc. This company
in Eau Claire, Wis., is best known for its ``simulator'' doll,
RealCare Baby, which gives tl for an ad that was abandoned as too
graphic featured a body on a gurney, with the caption: ``Millions
of college students called home last weekend. Others didn't get the
chance.'' Instead a series of sarcastic ads will show a bottle
labeled ``Binge Beer'' with the headline ``Hitting Colleges This
Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad campaign sponsored last spring by the Michigan
Department of Community Health featured the slogan, ``Binge
drinking. It can make you dead drunk.'' Many churches around the
country stage ``hell houses'' in which teen-agers play the victims
of drunk driving and unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings about such approaches have inspired more nuanced
campaigns. Some colleges like Darmouth College and Montana State
University are publicizing statistics to get across the message
that the majority of students do not routinely drink to excess,
hoping for the effects of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the proponents of programs that rely on peer
pressure suggest that fear appeals simply do not work, Professor
Lawrence Wallack, a professor of public health at the University of
California at Berkeley, says he believes a balance must be struck
when trying to frighten people into healthy behavior. Too little
fear and a message to change behavior may have no impact; too much
fear, and denial may kick in. While acknowledging that scare
tactics might be useful in the appropriate dose, Wallack says he is
still wary of heightening anxiety about health issues without
``showing a safe, easy, quick and manageable way to reduce that
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking campaigns are another area where approaches vary
wildly. The recent tobacco settlement, with its estimated yield of
$1.5 billion for anti-smoking media campaigns over the next five
years, has public health mavens puzzling over the most effective
media strategies. Should the ads rail against the evil tobacco
industry? Should they suggest that smoking is uncool or gross, ``a
tumor-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, puking habit'' _ as an
Arizona ad puts it? Or should ads warn of the greatly enhanced risk
of death or disease, even though some teen-agers may see a certain
cachet in danger and risk?
</P>
<P>
   Social and behavioral research shows that ``some kinds of
communication have some kinds of effects on some kinds of people
some of the time,'' Wallack said. Begun at the beginning of the
decade, California's anti-tobacco ad campaign is the oldest in the
country, but research on its effectiveness is still preliminary.
Dr. Gina Agostinelli, a researcher with the Prevention Research
Center in Berkeley, Calif., said, ``We know very little about the
most basic question: Is tobacco counter-advertising effective?''
</P>
<P>
   California health officials say that vilifying the tobacco
industry executives is one key to changing attitudes. Their latest
round of ads has coupled anti-industry salvos with messages
emphasizing the dangers of secondhand smoke to friends and family.
Although the ads are somewhat tamer today than nine years ago, the
state may still hold the prize for the most gruesome and fearful
anti-tobacco ad ever seen on television. In a spot entitled Voice
Box, a 50-ish woman complains that her addiction has made it
impossible to live without cigarettes; she then takes a deep drag
on her cigarette through a tracheotomy tube in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies such as increasing tobacco taxes, limiting access to
vending machines or prohibiting smoking in public spaces may have
much greater impact than advertising strategies. ``More awareness
and information is good,'' Wallack said, ``but we end up mistaking
part of the solution for the whole solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These campaigns might actually do more harm than good,'' he
said, ``by disproportionately placing the responsibilities on the
individual, neglecting broader social factors and giving people a
false sense that something substantial is being done to address the
problem.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed
as the most prominent measure of the financial health of Corporate
America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the
U.S. economy is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the keepers of the Dow _ the editors of The Wall
Street Journal _ announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable
companies and replace them with younger and better-performing
substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990s that such a thing
had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   To find any comparable rate of change one must return to the
1930s, when the Depression-era economy was suffering a very
difficult upheaval. Now, Wall Street thinks the economy is going
through an upheaval with implications every bit as great _ but much
more pleasant _ for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy, as reflected in the Dow industrials of 20 years
ago, was dominated by companies that made things _ steel, cars,
cigarettes, chemicals, oil and tires. The new Dow is dominated by
companies in far different lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow of the 1970s had three oil companies, two steel
companies, one computer company and no financial firms. The new Dow
has four computer-related companies, three financial behemoths,
just one oil company and no steel makers. It has Walt Disney,
Coca-Cola and McDonald's. But Alcoa is still on the list, and so
are General Motors and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The old
America of heavy industry is still represented, but not nearly as
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the magnitude of the change is that of the four
companies that will join the Dow on Monday, three of them _ Intel,
Microsoft and Home Depot _ can trace their corporate lineage no
further back than 1968. The fourth, SBC Communications, was spun
off by AT&AMP;T (another Dow member) back in 1984 as part of the
antitrust settlement that broke up Ma Bell. The companies they
replaced _ Chevron, Sears, Goodyear and Union Carbide _ all joined
the Dow in 1930 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to underestimate the symbolic power of the Dow. Intel
and Microsoft are emblematic of American dominance in the rapidly
growing personal computer business. That image is better than the
one created in 1985, when McDonald's joined the index, or in 1991,
when USX, the former U.S. Steel, was tossed out to make way for
Disney. Then there was talk that the new America meant hamburger
flippers going to movies.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the changes, Wall Street Journal managing editor
Paul Steiger spoke of making the Dow ``more representative of the
emerging U.S. economy.'' But he also evidently wanted to stick to
blue chips, companies that had proven themselves to be successful.
There are no pure Internet companies in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change in the Dow may reflect more than the speed of
change in the economy. After all, the economy was changing from the
1940s through the early 1980s, even though there were few changes
in the Dow during that period that were not forced by takeovers or
financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is different now is that Dow Jones &AMP; Co. makes
money from fees paid every time investors buy options, futures and
other securities based on the Dow. In recent years, the index has
not risen as fast as its prime competitor, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, which includes 500 major American stocks and has a very heavy
dose of technology stocks and a larger share of the market in stock
index securities.
</P>
<P>
   Had Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications been
part of the Dow since 1997, the index would have been the better
performer. Perhaps such superior performance would have persuaded
more investors to trade the Dow, rather than the S&AMP;P.

CANDIDATES, TAKING A STAND, MIX POLICY AND PERSONA

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ It was once a sure-fire attack strategy in
presidential debates: Candidates turn to their rivals and scold
them for espousing policies that are fanciful, shallow and even
risky. ``Where's the beef?'' asked Walter Mondale, memorably
needling Gary Hart during the Democratic primary campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   No one's asking now. The 2000 campaign has been marked by an
extraordinary (if not mind-numbing) degree of substance. Candidates
have issued more meaty 10- and 12-point plans, earlier in the
season, than ever before in presidential politics. The question is,
will it pay off? Or are the voters more attuned to that elusive and
much-trumpeted concept, character?
</P>
<P>
   The dueling over policy pronouncements by Vice President Al Gore
and Bill Bradley was on display last week at the first televised
debate here at Dartmouth College. They eagerly plunged into a
discussion of the intricacies of more funding for special
education, health insurance for children and protections for
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
issued stacks of position papers (his recent education plan was 12
single-spaced pages) to fend off critiques that he is, in the
parlance of his state of Texas, more hat than horse. But he doesn't
talk about them as much, preferring to project a Reaganesque
geniality and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the candidates' handling of issues reveals their
own approaches and personalities. Gore and Bradley built their
Senate careers on mastery of daunting matters like the environment
and tax system overhauls. ``He's equal part dreamer and policy
wonk,'' Eric Hauser, a Bradley spokesman, said of his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, partly because he prides himself on not sweating the
details, speaks more about grand themes that have served him well
as governor. He is, no doubt, mindful of polls showing that while
most people are not paying much attention to the presidential
contest, those who do seem more interested in the candidates'
personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by being substantive, candidates can achieve other goals.
``There's an implicit presidential aura to presenting six-point
programs,'' said Anthony Dolan, a former speechwriter for Ronald
Reagan. ``There's a subliminal message you send to voters: `I have
the will to govern.''' Some candidates use detailed policies to
prove their bona fides with a narrow group of partisans and
interest groups whose support is crucial in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There is another practical explanation for so much substance so
early: Because the primary schedule next year is the most
compressed in history, the entire process is accelerated.
Candidates who wait until January to issue proposals may be
dismissed as too slow _ or imitating their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past, candidates did not have to be so specific
because the parties often set the agenda. During the Cold War, the
prescriptions for dealing with the Soviet Union were starkly
different in both parties. Now that there are fewer differences _
and no overriding, burning issues _ candidates face greater
pressure to define themselves through their distinct plans.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for politicians is they can get tripped up in the
minutiae. Gore, relying on his vast experience in the White House
and in Congress, has emphasized his command of the issues. But
early this year he put out such a blizzard of issue papers that the
Bradley camp ridiculed him for being bogged down in small-bore
matters. He has tried to remedy that recently by mixing the policy
with the personal.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates complain that if they dwell on issues, the media
ignores them and focuses on personality and the horse race anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also learned the down side of serving up too much
detail. Refuting accusations that his proposals lacked heft, he
boasted that he was going further than most politicians in setting
a price tag _ $65 billion a year _ for his plan to make health care
available to virtually all uninsured Americans. But in doing so, he
gave Gore an opening that the vice president happily seized upon
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a big idea.'' Gore said, ``but it's not a good
idea.'' Should Bradley makes it to the Democratic nomination, that
line may well turn up in the Republicans' attack commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers, as well as Bradley's, have urged their
candidates not to be prodded into appearing like policy mavens.
``Yes, a tax plan is important and, yes, an education proposal is
important,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
``But the specific percentage of a proposed tax cut is probably
less important to the average voter than, `Do I agree with this
candidate's overall philosophy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes he can undermine Bradley in the same way President
Gerald R. Ford poked holes in a plan issued by Reagan during the
campaign for the 1976 Republican nomination that called for
stripping $90 billion from the federal budget. The proposal created
a firestorm, with the Ford campaign warning that it would cause
massive cuts in federal programs. The Ford camp issued detailed
breakdowns of how the plan would damage New Hampshire, which holds
the first primary. Reagan was so unnerved by the criticism that he
backed away from it, saying he ``didn't pay attention'' when aides
listed the $90 billion in cuts _ and that he meant his proposal to
be taken only figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Besides worrying how their opponents will respond, candidates
have to be mindful that voters do not always take detailed policy
proposals at face value. When Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in
1996, issued the economic and political foundation of his campaign
_ a 15 percent income tax cut and a halving of the capital gains
tax _ polls showed that voters did not view it too seriously.
That's because the Dole campaign publicly tinkered with several
alternatives. It did not help that President Clinton's campaign
distributed quotations to reporters in which Dole had belittled the
supply-side economics that was central to his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy emphasis on substance was first notable during the 1992
Democratic presidential run by then-Gov. Bill Clinton, former Sen.
Paul Tsongas and Sen. Bob Kerrey. All sought to demonstrate their
seriousness of purpose. Substance, indeed, was a way for Clinton to
deflect questions about his personal conduct and assure voters that
he knew how to fix the economy. One of his strategists, George
Stephanopoulos, went as far as to say that ``specificity is the
character issue of '92.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, never escaped questions about his integrity.
In the current campaign, politicians who want to succeed him are
again trying to use substance to prove their own character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Clinton was perceived to be a smooth operator, there's
an extra motivation for candidates this year to show that that's
not them,'' said Dan Schnur, communications director for Sen. John
McCain, who is seeking the Republican nomination. ``The way you do
that is by flashing the policy credential. Bob Dole stood up and
said, `I have character.' That's not good enough. Policy is the
prism through which voters judge character.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on substance may seem like a public service. But
the bad news is that the more candidates propose, the more they
overpromise. Clinton had ambitious plans for his national service
program that were scaled back after his election. Chances are, most
of the heady dreams of Campaign 2000 will never be more than
dreams.

MORNINGS, THEY LIKE TO WATCH

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ East Side, West Side, all around the town,
early-morning television is taking to the sidewalks of New York as
never before _ sidewalks that have become, in effect, sound stages
where cameras can capture the exuberance of nose-to-the-glass fans
waving, shouting and reveling in their 15 seconds of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Picture-window studios have become a New York phenomenon.
Network executives say stations in other cities cannot afford to
spend millions on studios the way the networks can, and besides,
New York is the people-watching capital of the world, and the
networks know it. Every aunt or grandmother who tunes in, hoping
for a glimpse of a relative in the background behind Matt and Katie
or Charlie and Diane or, starting Monday, Bryant and Jane, adds to
a show's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks every rule in TV 101,'' said Robert Thompson, a
professor of film and television at Syracuse University. ``You're
not supposed to take the attention off the business at hand, but
when the business at hand needs a little push, the audience
provides a vast and sometimes amusing unpaid cast.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ABC and CBS are trying to catch up to the ``Today'' show
on NBC, which moved to a first-floor studio in Rockefeller Center
in 1994. Ever since, ``Today'' has been showing off its
standing-room-only sidewalk space _ and bragging about displacing
``Good Morning America'' for the lead in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is the surest form of television; ABC moved ``Good
Morning America'' into a glass-walled studio in Times Square in
September. ``Today'' remains No. 1, but since ``Good Morning
America'' began showing crowds on the lower level of its two-story
studio and inviting a lucky few upstairs for consumer-affairs
segments, its ratings have risen somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Nov. 1, CBS moves its newly renamed ``Early Show'' to
Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, with world-famous hotels in the
background. CBS is betting that its new studio will help make the
network competitive in the morning for the first time since
``Captain Kangaroo'' went off the air a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the hotels are looking forward to the arrival of
Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayton and their fans. The
Sherry-Netherland Hotel went to court to block CBS' plans,
complaining that the show would lead to overcrowded sidewalks and
noise that could wake late sleepers at the hotel. ``People will be
waving and shouting and creating that fake Beatlemania-like
sensation,'' the hotel said in court papers. A CBS spokesman would
say only that the matter remains unresolved, but that the two sides
have been talking.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have spent heavily to show their viewers New York
up close. NBC spent $15 million; CBS is said to have spent $30
million. MTV also broadcasts from studios with floor-to-ceiling
windows. Its home, across Broadway from the new ``Good Morning
America'' quarters, draws neck-craning fans hoping for a glimpse of
their favorite veejay or, better, their favorite rock star. (The
neck-craning is a must. Unlike the ``Today'' and ``Early Show''
studios, MTV's base of operations is on the second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the success of the `Today' show woke other
television people up,'' said Steve Friedman, who was the executive
producer of ``Today'' when it moved and now has the same job at its
new CBS competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that woke up the networks' decision-makers was
New York's surging popularity as a tourist destination. ``New York
is hot again,'' Thompson said. ```Seinfeld' did this, `Friends' did
this, and they contributed to the idea that New York is the place
to be. There was a sense a few years ago that you wanted to ignore
New York, the symbol of all kinds of collapse, the inner city, the
economy. That's all changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners find themselves peering in the morning shows'
windows because there is not much to do at 7 a.m. The Statue of
Liberty and the observatory at the Empire State Building do not
open until 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   For the folks back home, the streetscape provides an element
that producers consider increasingly important _ ``visual relief.''
Playing peekaboo with passersby gives viewers something more than
just another glitzy set filled with people sitting around talking.
</P>
<P>
   If two's company, Friedman's show will make an early-morning
crowd. But he said the decision to put the hosts in front of glass
was not about imitation. ``The fact is that people expect more out
of television than a studio that's supposed to look like somebody's
living room or dining room and isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart at ``Good Morning America,'' Shelly Ross, said
the new studio provides a pool of people who can go on the show and
or talk with consumer experts about why they buy what they buy or
eat what they eat. ``In the past,'' she said, ``Good Morning
America'' relied on ``handpicked friends of friends of friends''
for such interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But showing crowds on live television is not without risks.
``When you see people holding up one finger, you wonder are they
saying, `You're No. 1,''' Thompson said, ``or are they saying
something else?''

THE RIGHT DOSE OF SCARE TACTICS TO DISCOURAGE THE WRONG TYPE OF
BEHAVIOR

<P>
   Be afraid. Be very afraid.
</P>
<P>
   This is the message at the heart of public health campaigns that
hope to stop young people from unsafe sex, smoking or binge
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the products of Baby Think It Over, Inc. This company
in Eau Claire, Wis., is best known for its ``simulator'' doll,
RealCare Baby, which gives tl for an ad that was abandoned as too
graphic featured a body on a gurney, with the caption: ``Millions
of college students called home last weekend. Others didn't get the
chance.'' Instead a series of sarcastic ads will show a bottle
labeled ``Binge Beer'' with the headline ``Hitting Colleges This
Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad campaign sponsored last spring by the Michigan
Department of Community Health featured the slogan, ``Binge
drinking. It can make you dead drunk.'' Many churches around the
country stage ``hell houses'' in which teen-agers play the victims
of drunk driving and unsafe sex.
</P>
<P>
   Misgivings about such approaches have inspired more nuanced
campaigns. Some colleges like Darmouth College and Montana State
University are publicizing statistics to get across the message
that the majority of students do not routinely drink to excess,
hoping for the effects of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the proponents of programs that rely on peer
pressure suggest that fear appeals simply do not work, Professor
Lawrence Wallack, a professor of public health at the University of
California at Berkeley, says he believes a balance must be struck
when trying to frighten people into healthy behavior. Too little
fear and a message to change behavior may have no impact; too much
fear, and denial may kick in. While acknowledging that scare
tactics might be useful in the appropriate dose, Wallack says he is
still wary of heightening anxiety about health issues without
``showing a safe, easy, quick and manageable way to reduce that
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking campaigns are another area where approaches vary
wildly. The recent tobacco settlement, with its estimated yield of
$1.5 billion for anti-smoking media campaigns over the next five
years, has public health mavens puzzling over the most effective
media strategies. Should the ads rail against the evil tobacco
industry? Should they suggest that smoking is uncool or gross, ``a
tumor-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, puking habit'' _ as an
Arizona ad puts it? Or should ads warn of the greatly enhanced risk
of death or disease, even though some teen-agers may see a certain
cachet in danger and risk?
</P>
<P>
   Social and behavioral research shows that ``some kinds of
communication have some kinds of effects on some kinds of people
some of the time,'' Wallack said. Begun at the beginning of the
decade, California's anti-tobacco ad campaign is the oldest in the
country, but research on its effectiveness is still preliminary.
Dr. Gina Agostinelli, a researcher with the Prevention Research
Center in Berkeley, Calif., said, ``We know very little about the
most basic question: Is tobacco counter-advertising effective?''
</P>
<P>
   California health officials say that vilifying the tobacco
industry executives is one key to changing attitudes. Their latest
round of ads has coupled anti-industry salvos with messages
emphasizing the dangers of secondhand smoke to friends and family.
Although the ads are somewhat tamer today than nine years ago, the
state may still hold the prize for the most gruesome and fearful
anti-tobacco ad ever seen on television. In a spot entitled Voice
Box, a 50-ish woman complains that her addiction has made it
impossible to live without cigarettes; she then takes a deep drag
on her cigarette through a tracheotomy tube in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Strategies such as increasing tobacco taxes, limiting access to
vending machines or prohibiting smoking in public spaces may have
much greater impact than advertising strategies. ``More awareness
and information is good,'' Wallack said, ``but we end up mistaking
part of the solution for the whole solution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These campaigns might actually do more harm than good,'' he
said, ``by disproportionately placing the responsibilities on the
individual, neglecting broader social factors and giving people a
false sense that something substantial is being done to address the
problem.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average has long been viewed
as the most prominent measure of the financial health of Corporate
America. Maybe now it should be seen as a barometer of how fast the
U.S. economy is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the keepers of the Dow _ the editors of The Wall
Street Journal _ announced plans to boot four perfectly respectable
companies and replace them with younger and better-performing
substitutes. It was the third time in the 1990s that such a thing
had happened. All told, 11 of the 30 stocks in the Dow are new in
this decade.
</P>
<P>
   To find any comparable rate of change one must return to the
1930s, when the Depression-era economy was suffering a very
difficult upheaval. Now, Wall Street thinks the economy is going
through an upheaval with implications every bit as great _ but much
more pleasant _ for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy, as reflected in the Dow industrials of 20 years
ago, was dominated by companies that made things _ steel, cars,
cigarettes, chemicals, oil and tires. The new Dow is dominated by
companies in far different lines of work.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow of the 1970s had three oil companies, two steel
companies, one computer company and no financial firms. The new Dow
has four computer-related companies, three financial behemoths,
just one oil company and no steel makers. It has Walt Disney,
Coca-Cola and McDonald's. But Alcoa is still on the list, and so
are General Motors and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. The old
America of heavy industry is still represented, but not nearly as
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the magnitude of the change is that of the four
companies that will join the Dow on Monday, three of them _ Intel,
Microsoft and Home Depot _ can trace their corporate lineage no
further back than 1968. The fourth, SBC Communications, was spun
off by AT&AMP;T (another Dow member) back in 1984 as part of the
antitrust settlement that broke up Ma Bell. The companies they
replaced _ Chevron, Sears, Goodyear and Union Carbide _ all joined
the Dow in 1930 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to underestimate the symbolic power of the Dow. Intel
and Microsoft are emblematic of American dominance in the rapidly
growing personal computer business. That image is better than the
one created in 1985, when McDonald's joined the index, or in 1991,
when USX, the former U.S. Steel, was tossed out to make way for
Disney. Then there was talk that the new America meant hamburger
flippers going to movies.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the changes, Wall Street Journal managing editor
Paul Steiger spoke of making the Dow ``more representative of the
emerging U.S. economy.'' But he also evidently wanted to stick to
blue chips, companies that had proven themselves to be successful.
There are no pure Internet companies in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of change in the Dow may reflect more than the speed of
change in the economy. After all, the economy was changing from the
1940s through the early 1980s, even though there were few changes
in the Dow during that period that were not forced by takeovers or
financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is different now is that Dow Jones &AMP; Co. makes
money from fees paid every time investors buy options, futures and
other securities based on the Dow. In recent years, the index has
not risen as fast as its prime competitor, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, which includes 500 major American stocks and has a very heavy
dose of technology stocks and a larger share of the market in stock
index securities.
</P>
<P>
   Had Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications been
part of the Dow since 1997, the index would have been the better
performer. Perhaps such superior performance would have persuaded
more investors to trade the Dow, rather than the S&AMP;P.

   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ In jeans and T-shirts, each carrying a
small gym bag, a group of young Gaza men drew taunts and stares as
they wandered the streets here Friday evening in a fruitless search
for work. ``They told us we were ruining Ramallah,'' said Adham
A'jour, 22, taken aback by the hostility. ``People in the West Bank
should be more understanding of our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadi Achmed, his companion, concurred: ``I felt that they hated
us the way that they were looking at us. If they come to Gaza, we
will treat them the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two 22-year-olds were among the first of several hundred
Gazans to travel a two-lane road to the rocky uplands of the West
Bank last week, an hour's drive but still an eventful journey.
Cousins embraced for the first time since Israel closed its borders
to most Gazans six years ago. Young day-trippers eyed their first
mountains. And Palestinian peace negotiators hailed the belated
fulfillment of a promise extracted from Israel by President Clinton
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``safe passage'' route for goods as well as people
holds out the promise of unifying the West Bank and Gaza into one
integrated economy, a prerequisite for building a viable
Palestinian state. But in a place like Ramallah, the bustling
administrative center of the Palestinian-governed West Bank, the
sudden appearance of Gazan visitors aroused undisguised
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Although people here welcome the theoretical prospect of
Palestinian unity, the new opening has already exposed the stark
cultural and economic contrasts between the two regions. Now the
poorer, more religious and less educated Gazans will compete for
jobs with the more settled and secular urbanites of the West Bank.
This could mean unwelcome sacrifices for the West Bank, and could
trigger resentment and envy among the Gazans.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Gaza hovers above 17 percent, double the rate in
the West Bank. And the median age in the Strip is just 14, compared
to 17 in the West Bank. In southern Gaza, the poorest and most
densely populated Palestinian region, per capita spending is $2.50
a day, far below the still-modest $6.00 average around Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In taxis and shops throughout the West Bank, people have been
whispering about the changes these newcomers might cause in the job
market,'' noted Daoud Kuttab, a political columnist in Ramallah.
``They are afraid that the Gazans will accept lower wages than are
being paid now, and that many employers will be tempted to exploit
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent economists say West Bankers are right to be worried.
Hisham Awatani of the Palestinian Center for Research and Studies
in Nablus contends West Bank wages will inevitably drop if Gaza
job-seekers can freely relocate. And with access to porous West
Bank borders, Gazan immigrants will also compete for high-paying
construction jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw what happened to Germany after unification,''
Awatani said. ``There is often an economic price to be paid for
political goals.'' That price won't be paid by economists or
government planners, however.
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic, an economic merger of a million Gazans and
nearly 2 million West Bankers requires bridging a cultural chasm.
The West Bank is worldly, secular, educated and entrepreneurial,
while the closed, ingrown economy of Gaza mirrors the insular,
religious, walled-in refugee society that fostered it. Despite
family ties and a shared Palestinian nationalism, these are two
quite different places.
</P>
<P>
   Even their legal systems remain separate and distinct. In the
West Bank, old Jordanian laws still prevail, with Ottoman and
Napoleonic underpinnings. Gaza is governed by a hybrid Egyptian and
British legal code, though a parallel Islamic court network there
is fast extending its role.
</P>
<P>
   Compounded by geographic separation, this central Palestinian
fault line is at least as profound as the much-analyzed rift
between secular and religious Israelis, with great potential for
political tension as Gaza and the West Bank become intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gulf, though, is economic. And it has steadily
widened over the past six years, as Israeli border closures and
transit restrictions caused Gaza commerce to contract by 40 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   If the regional economies merge, as safe passage theoretically
permits, Gaza's per capita income of roughly $1,200 and the West
Bank average of $1,700 would gravitate toward a common mean,
economists say. Gaza's living standard should rise more than the
West Bank's would fall, but the short-term impact on West Bankers
could still be acute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This transitional pain is worth the long-term gain, many
Palestinians argue. The unemployed youth of Gaza are not only the
most serious economic problem confronting the Palestinian
Authority; they are its greatest political challenge, since they
provide rank-and-file support for the Authority's militant Islamist
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The average Gaza family has six children; population growth is
an explosive 4.3 percent. Gaza desperately needs an economic safety
valve that Israel is unwilling to provide: the only day laborers
permitted into Israel are on a carefully screened list of married
men over 30. And Israel is now unexpectedly suggesting that its
restrictions on Palestinian goods and labor could be tightened
further.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Labor governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,
the vision of a peaceful, mutually advantageous relationship with
an autonomous or independent Palestinian neighbor always presumed
some kind of free trade area, with open movement of goods, labor
and capital. In 1994, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed
on a five-year customs union, lifting most hindrances to internal
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This free-market approach to peacemaking was one of the few
legacies of the Rabin era to be embraced by Benjamin Netanyahu's
right-wing administration. But now Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
has long wanted legal and physical barriers between Israelis and
Palestinians, is urging consideration of ``economic separation''
too.
</P>
<P>
   This new notion of separation appears to go well beyond tariff
walls. The Barak government said last week that it was exploring
the legalization of 100,000 or more undocumented workers from East
Asia and Central Europe. Peace negotiators had long assumed that a
final settlement would be an opportunity to replace this illegal
foreign work force with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians dismiss such talk as a bargaining ploy,
intended to remind Yasser Arafat of his would-be state's dependence
on Israeli investment and commerce. Israel is the lopsided
beneficiary of trade with the Palestinians, selling $1.5 billion
yearly but importing just $250 million, so it has no commercial
motive for protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   But even barring complete Israeli-Palestinian separation, there
are almost infinite gradations of integration. And any new Israeli
barriers will force the West Bank and Gaza even closer together.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, unification should be good for Palestinian
business. Palestinian planners have long complained that Israel's
separation of Gaza from the West Bank made their market too small
to entice serious investors or breed competitive exporters.
Integration should give a quick boost to some local companies:
Cold-pressed Palestinian olive oil could outsell Israeli varieties
in Gaza, while Gaza citrus may replace Jaffa oranges in Hebron
market stalls. But family firms in both Gaza and the West Bank will
also face pressure from more efficient rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Messrs. Barak and Arafat enter final status talks, they
must devise formulas for the further knitting together of Gaza with
Ramallah and Nablus and Hebron. The initial Palestinian experience
with safe passage will help determine how fast and far unification
will proceed _ and how eagerly it will be embraced by the
Palestinian majority on the West Bank.

   Unemployment in Gaza hovers above 17 percent, double the rate in
the West Bank. And the median age in the Strip is just 14, compared
to 17 in the West Bank. In southern Gaza, the poorest and most
densely populated Palestinian region, per capita spending is $2.50
a day, far below the still-modest $6.00 average around Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``In taxis and shops throughout the West Bank, people have been
whispering about the changes these newcomers might cause in the job
market,'' noted Daoud Kuttab, a political columnist in Ramallah.
``They are afraid that the Gazans will accept lower wages than are
being paid now, and that many employers will be tempted to exploit
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent economists say West Bankers are right to be worried.
Hisham Awatani of the Palestinian Center for Research and Studies
in Nablus contends West Bank wages will inevitably drop if Gaza
job-seekers can freely relocate. And with access to porous West
Bank borders, Gazan immigrants will also compete for high-paying
construction jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all saw what happened to Germany after unification,''
Awatani said. ``There is often an economic price to be paid for
political goals.'' That price won't be paid by economists or
government planners, however.
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic, an economic merger of a million Gazans and
nearly 2 million West Bankers requires bridging a cultural chasm.
The West Bank is worldly, secular, educated and entrepreneurial,
while the closed, ingrown economy of Gaza mirrors the insular,
religious, walled-in refugee society that fostered it. Despite
family ties and a shared Palestinian nationalism, these are two
quite different places.
</P>
<P>
   Even their legal systems remain separate and distinct. In the
West Bank, old Jordanian laws still prevail, with Ottoman and
Napoleonic underpinnings. Gaza is governed by a hybrid Egyptian and
British legal code, though a parallel Islamic court network there
is fast extending its role.
</P>
<P>
   Compounded by geographic separation, this central Palestinian
fault line is at least as profound as the much-analyzed rift
between secular and religious Israelis, with great potential for
political tension as Gaza and the West Bank become intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gulf, though, is economic. And it has steadily
widened over the past six years, as Israeli border closures and
transit restrictions caused Gaza commerce to contract by 40 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   If the regional economies merge, as safe passage theoretically
permits, Gaza's per capita income of roughly $1,200 and the West
Bank average of $1,700 would gravitate toward a common mean,
economists say. Gaza's living standard should rise more than the
West Bank's would fall, but the short-term impact on West Bankers
could still be acute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This transitional pain is worth the long-term gain, many
Palestinians argue. The unemployed youth of Gaza are not only the
most serious economic problem confronting the Palestinian
Authority; they are its greatest political challenge, since they
provide rank-and-file support for the Authority's militant Islamist
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The average Gaza family has six children; population growth is
an explosive 4.3 percent. Gaza desperately needs an economic safety
valve that Israel is unwilling to provide: the only day laborers
permitted into Israel are on a carefully screened list of married
men over 30. And Israel is now unexpectedly suggesting that its
restrictions on Palestinian goods and labor could be tightened
further.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Labor governments of Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres,
the vision of a peaceful, mutually advantageous relationship with
an autonomous or independent Palestinian neighbor always presumed
some kind of free trade area, with open movement of goods, labor
and capital. In 1994, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed
on a five-year customs union, lifting most hindrances to internal
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This free-market approach to peacemaking was one of the few
legacies of the Rabin era to be embraced by Benjamin Netanyahu's
right-wing administration. But now Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who
has long wanted legal and physical barriers between Israelis and
Palestinians, is urging consideration of ``economic separation''
too.
</P>
<P>
   This new notion of separation appears to go well beyond tariff
walls. The Barak government said last week that it was exploring
the legalization of 100,000 or more undocumented workers from East
Asia and Central Europe. Peace negotiators had long assumed that a
final settlement would be an opportunity to replace this illegal
foreign work force with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians dismiss such talk as a bargaining ploy,
intended to remind Yasser Arafat of his would-be state's dependence
on Israeli investment and commerce. Israel is the lopsided
beneficiary of trade with the Palestinians, selling $1.5 billion
yearly but importing just $250 million, so it has no commercial
motive for protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   But even barring complete Israeli-Palestinian separation, there
are almost infinite gradations of integration. And any new Israeli
barriers will force the West Bank and Gaza even closer together.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, unification should be good for Palestinian
business. Palestinian planners have long complained that Israel's
separation of Gaza from the West Bank made their market too small
to entice serious investors or breed competitive exporters.
Integration should give a quick boost to some local companies:
Cold-pressed Palestinian olive oil could outsell Israeli varieties
in Gaza, while Gaza citrus may replace Jaffa oranges in Hebron
market stalls. But family firms in both Gaza and the West Bank will
also face pressure from more efficient rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Messrs. Barak and Arafat enter final status talks, they
must devise formulas for the further knitting together of Gaza with
Ramallah and Nablus and Hebron. The initial Palestinian experience
with safe passage will help determine how fast and far unification
will proceed _ and how eagerly it will be embraced by the
Palestinian majority on the West Bank.

   OSH, Kyrgyzstan _ The appearance of Islamic insurgents in this
remote Central Asian country in recent weeks has not only shocked
regional leaders and their Russian and Chinese neighbors. It has
also awakened the world to a troubling new phenomenon: the
existence of a floating army of religious fighters who are roaming
this part of the world in search of regimes to overthrow.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan is one of eight new nations that emerged in Central
Asia and the Caucasus following the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. The region is poor, unstable and populated mostly by Muslims.
It sparkles as a glittering prize for religious zealots.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters who appeared here in mid-August, like most of the
armed bands that have emerged in Central Asia recently, have their
roots in Afghanistan. They have now apparently withdrawn back to
bases there and in neighboring Tajikistan, freeing hostages they
had seized. No one believes, however, that they will lay down their
weapons or give up their dream of bringing the whole region under
religious rule. Their zeal poses a serious threat to stability in a
vast area that stretches from Turkey's eastern border all the way
to China.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even as civil war continues in Afghanistan, religious
violence has broken out not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in three
other parts of this volatile belt. In Chechnya, which is officially
part of Russia, fundamentalists are leading a violent campaign for
independence. An apparently even more radical group is fighting in
the neighboring republic of Dagestan, which is also nominally under
Russian sovereignty. Further east, along the border that separates
India and Pakistan, the province of Kashmir is at temporary peace
following a bloody conflict this year in which Muslim radicals
played a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the religious militancy that is spreading through
Central Asia and the Caucasus may be traced back to the U.S.
campaign to drive Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the 1980s.
During that campaign, the CIA spent hundreds of millions of dollars
training religious fighters and buying them modern weapons. Now
they are using those skills, and in some cases those weapons, to
topple what they say are godless regimes.
</P>
<P>
   These religious militants want to fight wherever they believe
they can do God's bidding. They have attracted thousands of young
people who have no strong convictions, religious or otherwise, but
who know no trade other than war and who fight for a wage. Drug
gangs, realizing the importance of controlling trade routes through
the region, also eagerly contribute fighters.
</P>
<P>
   This odd collection of warriors is sponsored by a murky network
of religious and political visionaries. The Saudi millionaire Osama
bin Laden, whom the United States blames for last year's attacks on
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and who now lives in
Afghanistan, is only the most visible.
</P>
<P>
   Part of these militants' strategy has been to build mosques and
pay to educate impoverished young people across the Caucasus and
Central Asia. But now they are beginning to foment little wars.
They are probing for places where they can win battles, and believe
they have found some in Chechnya, Dagestan, Kashmir and here in the
Fergana Valley, the heart of Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   These militants consider Kyrgyzstan only a secondary target, at
least for now. Their proclaimed goal is an Islamic state in
Uzbekistan next door. When they retreat, they move back to bases
not only in Afghanistan but also in Tajikistan, where warlords have
as much control as the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Osh, one of the main towns in the Fergana Valley, people
are bewildered and frightened by the idea of insurgency. Most
people here are Muslims. But their tolerant and permissive brand of
Islam has little in common with the radicalism of those who are up
in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is very dangerous for all of Central Asia,''
said Bakyt Beshimov, a former president of Osh University who now
represents this region in the Kyrgyz Parliament. ``Part of the
danger is that these militants are being supported by religious
forces and governments abroad. The other problem is the terrible
social situation in this region, which makes people ready to
support radical alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   People across this region have seen living standards plummet
since the Soviet Union disintegrated. Once they enjoyed guaranteed
jobs, education and health care for all and pensions for the
elderly. Now most are in poverty, with little prospect for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people live in terrible circumstances, the slogans of
fundamentalists are very attractive,'' Beshimov said. ``They are
telling people to fight against the political regimes that are the
source of their difficulties. They say they have the formula for a
better and fairer society. It is very tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   Western powers have been slow to focus on this isolated region,
and Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev said in an interview that he
relies on China to crack the whip. ``They have to care,'' he said.
``They have Xinjiang.''
</P>
<P>
   Xinjiang is China's westernmost province. Its population is
mainly Muslim, and its people feel little loyalty to Beijing. They
are restive, and radicals among them have set off bombs that some
outsiders believe are the beginning of a separatist campaign. So
far there is no indication that militants in Xinjiang have made
contact with ``the Afghans,'' as Islamic fighters who have fought
in Afghanistan are called. But it is tempting to see the Caucasus,
Central Asia and Xinjiang as ripe targets for a nascent religious
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the feeling in the West, that all of this is
happening very far away,'' said Askar Aitmatov, an advisor to
Akayev. ``But religious fundamentalism is a big force. It is a
challenge for the entire world.''

   WASHINGTON _ When the United States gave up its colonial
ambitions and handed over the Philippines to the Filipinos in 1946,
President Harry S. Truman sent the living symbol of U.S. power in
the Pacific _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur _ to do the deed. When
President Richard M. Nixon returned Okinawa to Japan in 1969, he
dispatched a man capable of teaching even Japanese politicians a
thing or two about mixing business and politics: Vice President
Spiro Agnew.
</P>
<P>
   So here's the delicate diplomatic question of the moment for
President Clinton: Who will lead the U.S. delegation to the formal
handover of the Panama Canal in December?
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet that Vice President Al Gore can think of better
ways to occupy his time than posing for a photo-op surrendering the
canal and the huge U.S. military installations around it.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the White House have mused about sending former
President Jimmy Carter. After all, he was the president who signed
the two treaties in 1978 to hand back the canal zone after 96 years
_ and the one who assured the world that if things go bad in
Panama, the U.S. military still has the unilateral right to regain
control.
</P>
<P>
   When Panama's new president, Mireya Moscoso, visited Clinton
recently to urge him to show up himself for the ceremony, Clinton
said he was still thinking about it. (The Panamanians want to hold
the ceremony in mid-December, after belatedly realizing that on the
actual date of the transfer _ Dec. 31 _ people around the world
will be busy with other celebrations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say there's some ambivalence around here
about whether the president should go,'' one White House official
said. It's no surprise. Giving up territory is never exactly
popular; Queen Elizabeth II stayed as far away from Hong Kong as
possible during the handover to China in 1997, sending Prince
Charles instead.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Panama, the pain of surrendering 364,000
acres is eased by the fact that the main argument made by opponents
of the treaty in 1978 _ that America was paving the way for
Communist naval power to be extended out from Cuba _ seems a bit
farfetched today.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there is suddenly talk in the Senate of new threats
to the canal, which handles five percent of world trade. Isn't
Fidel Castro still in the neighborhood? And a host of conservative
lawmakers have complained that the Hong Kong-owned company that
runs the canal's container ports, where cargo is handled on the
Atlantic and Pacific sides, could help China seize control of the
canal. Congress just finished hearings on the issue, replete with
secret testimony from the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba and China have strong economic interests in Panama, but
do not pose a threat to the security of the canal at this time,''
Gen. Charles Wilhelm, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, told a
Senate committee. In fact, the Pentagon doubts the Chinese have the
naval power to take Taiwan, a bit closer to its shores.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Panamanians thrilled with how the handover has worked
out? Not exactly. Some politicians in Panama were clearly hoping
that the United States would pay big money to lease back the bases,
a business strategy that didn't count on the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   After lengthy negotiations, the Clinton administration said no
thanks. So that leaves Panama with a canal that is expensive to run
and a big party in December _ to which Washington has yet to send
an RSVP.

</P>
<P>
   For the last five years Transparency International, a nonprofit
group based in Berlin that specializes in tracking global thievery,
has released the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking the
world's most corrupt countries.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the group declared Cameroon, Nigeria, Indonesia,
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Honduras, Tanzania, Yugoslavia, Paraguay
and Kenya as the world's most graft-ridden countries, populated by
public officials who are much quicker to take bribes than their
counterparts in countries like Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But while Transparency's work has been lauded by economists and
other analysts for helping to make corruption a centerpiece of
debates about economic development and public policy, critics say
the group's hit list unfairly tars countries that may be no more
corrupt than those ranked much lower on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, say critics, the media is so quick to latch on to top 10
lists that agencies like Transparency International have an obvious
incentive to present their information that way to score public
relations coups. All the attention generated by the Corruption
Perceptions Index, and criticism that it tended to highlight poor
countries without noting the role that industrialized countries
play in fomenting corruption abroad, led Transparency to introduce
yet another ranking last week _ the Bribe Payers Index.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worries people have had is that the ranking is very
misleading,'' Rafael di Tella, an economics professor at Harvard
Business School and one of Transparency's outside advisors, said of
the Corruption Perceptions Index. ``Transparency International has
become a slave to the success of the index and it doesn't want to
address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as di Tella and others see it, is that the data
used to analyze corruption _ surveys, for example, of business
executives' perceptions _ are so fuzzy that huge margins of error
exist when assigning a numerical yardstick to graft.
</P>
<P>
   Johann Graf Lambsdorff, a German statistician responsible for
orchestrating Transparency's numbers into a coherent whole, says
critics of the list unfairly imply that his methodology is faulty
when, in fact, the only issue is how the results of Transparency's
surveys are presented. Even so, Lambsdorff says he is comfortable
with his group's list.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ranking is easier to convey information to a large public,
like a football ranking,'' said Lambsdorff, a professor at
Goettingen University. ``We can clearly say that Denmark is cleaner
than Germany and Germany is cleaner than Botswana. But in between
there may be some problems _ saying that Kenya is cleaner than
Tanzania, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely the problem, say critics , pointing to
Bolivia's presidential election in 1997 as an example of the list's
far-reaching influence. The former dictator Hugo Banzer won the
presidency that year on an anti-corruption platform bolstered by
the release of Transparency's rankings shortly before the election
_ rankings showing that corruption in Bolivia was worse than in
many of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Lambsdorff says Transparency cannot avoid having such an impact
because elections are occurring in many countries when their
rankings are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep on stressing that these are perceptions, not hard
facts,'' said Frank Vogl, Transparency International's
vice-chairman and co-founder. ``You always have this problem of how
to present the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the list has stirred dissent within the group's own
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency's index was good when there were no other numbers
available but we need to go further now,'' said Luis Moreno Ocampo,
a prominent anti-corruption crusader in Argentina who is a member
of Transparency's advisory council. ``The issue is not which
country is worse than another, the issue is how to solve the
problem. We need to track where the money is going and who is
stealing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno has been working with the World Bank to come up with new
methods of measuring and presenting data on corruption. Daniel
Kaufmann, a senior manager with the World Bank, says grouping
countries in broad categories _ rather than ranking them _ is the
fairest way to shine a spotlight on corruption. ``The idea that
Transparency International had is brilliant and now we all want to
be more rigorous and circumspect when we analyze corruption,'' he
said.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE LUNCH MENU, BUT IT'S YOUR CHILD'S REPORT CARD

   ROME _ The first parents meeting of the year at my child's
Italian public school started off with a warning. We all hunched
anxiously over tiny first-grade desks as the teacher rose from her
chair and stated solemnly, ``I have bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' strike, typhoid and no textbooks were some of the
potential crises that rushed through my head. But what the teacher
was worried about drew a gasp of horror from the other parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your children are not eating,'' she said sternly. ``Some of
them don't even touch their second course.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows Italians are obsessed with food. My mother is
Italian, I spent many childhood summers in Rome and Tuscany, so I
was well acquainted, I thought, with the importance of cooking
pasta al dente, the moral imperative to throw out day-old
mozzarella, and never to go swimming less than two hours after
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But even I was unprepared for how a food-centric nation handles
education. When my daughter started kindergarten last year, I was
surprised to find a huge chart posted on the door, marked with what
appeared to be grades. On closer inspection, the chart turned out
to be a scorecard of the day's lunch achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, next to each child's name, the teacher marked down
what she ate, and how well.
</P>
<P>
   EMMA: Primo (first course): Pasta con pomodoro (pasta with
tomato sauce). Tutto. Ottimo. (Ate all. Excellent.)
</P>
<P>
   Secondo (second course): Scaloppine di Vitello. (veal scallops)
Meta. Molto bene.(Half. Very good.)
</P>
<P>
   Contorno (side dish): Patate bollite e fagiolini (boiled potato
and beans.) Poco. Bene. (A little. Good.)
</P>
<P>
   Dolce (dessert): Pera cotta (stewed pear). Niente. Maggiore
impegno. (None. Needs work.)
</P>
<P>
   Fraud and corruption scams are to Italian newspapers what sex is
to British tabloids. Almost every day, somewhere in Italy there is
a scandal over rigged lotteries, sports ``doping,'' or ingenious
forms of municipal graft. But the one kind of scandal guaranteed to
make the front pages has the word ``mensa'' in it. They are not
referring to the high IQ club. Mensa, in Italian, means school
cafeteria, and any story that suggests that children are being
cheated of their culinary due unleashes mass hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   In September, 13 people, many of them high-ranking city
administrators, were arrested in Milan after a local catering
company was found to be providing substandard food to city-run
hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the Milan story broke, parents who had not once mentioned
the war in Kosovo gathered in angry groups outside our school,
militantly ready to storm the school kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son brought home an apple that I swear was bruised,'' one
mother said urgently. ``How do we know they are not buying
second-rate produce and pocketing the profits?''
</P>
<P>
   The school held an emergency meeting to address those concerns.
I have yet to talk to another mother about reading skills or
after-school programs. We do occasionally gather over espresso at
the cafe next to the school to debate the school cook's ability to
produce a satisfying ``suppli di riso.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is not a society preoccupied with learning disabilities,
ritalin and attention deficit disorder. Here, ADD stands only for
appetite deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Romans have a healthy contempt for all public officials, but no
city administrator is more pilloried than Fiorella Farinelli, the
supervisor of Rome's public schools (though Walter Tocci,
vice-mayor in charge of traffic, is a close second). Last year,
Mrs. Farinelli decreed a meatless day in honor of Linda McCartney,
the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney; she was a vegetarian
and animal rights activist who had just died of cancer. The
indignation from parents was so fevered I wrote an article about
it.
</P>
<P>
   When I interviewed Mrs. Farinelli, she explained that this was
nothing. Once, when she tried to introduce perch to school menus,
she was questioned in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers in Rome want their children to eat pasta with meat
sauce, meat and french fries, and ice cream,'' she said wearily.
``Only that will make them feel certain their children are
eating.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, I have been lucky enough never to get an urgent summons
from the school about a broken bone or high fever.
</P>
<P>
   But once, early on, I was on assignment in Venice when my
husband got a panicked call from Emma's kindergarten teacher,
asking him to come over right away. His Italian wasn't very fluent,
so as he raced over, he called me on my cell phone to urge me to
catch an earlier flight home. I did. The emergency was, of course,
food-related. Emma, who at the time still didn't speak Italian,
wept when the cafeteria lady sprinkled parmigiano on her pasta and
she refused to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   It should go without saying that the school day begins with
``merenda,'' the Italian word for snack, except that it is not
considered optional. Mothers are expected to provide their children
every morning with a fresh slice of pizza bianca to tide them over
until lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, the kindergarten teacher distributes apples
and slices of bread and nutella, a chocolate and hazelnut spread.
(Child obesity rates in Italy are increasing, but they are lower
than in the United States, 22.5 percent vs. 25 percent to 27
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months, I have assimilated. When I get home from work,
I never ask my child what she did in school. Like every other
Italian parent, I remove the soiled cloth napkin from her book bag
and ask, ``What did you eat for lunch today?''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Figuring out what retired farmers do
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ It's harvest time. Starting at sun-up,
tractors pulling
</P>
<P>
   wagon-loads of corn go rumbling past my front door headed for
the elevator a block away. Sometimes, if there's a line waiting to
be weighed and unloaded, they'll turn the corner beside my bedroom
and go around the back way to join the lineup in the bank parking
lot, across the street from the co-op.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of folks got their feathers in a ruffle when the new bank
moved to town and bought up land next to the railroad right-of-way,
including the gravel path where the farmers wait their turn on the
scales. Some of us were particularly unhappy when the 60-foot
spruce the village always decorated with aluminum pie tins and
Christmas lights was chopped down.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out okay. The bank told the farmers to keep on
doing what they were doing and even put up a sign asking folks on
bank business not to block the farmers' wagons during harvest. And
some committee or other planted a new Christmas tree in the log
yard next to the Sunoco station. It's pretty tall now and looks
real festive decorated for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Farm communities are hard-working places, I have discovered.
Farmers are out before dawn, well before most of us in town have
even rolled over for an extra 40 winks. And after supper, when the
village is settling down to homework and reruns of MASH, the fields
around us are dotted with what look like giant fireflies but are
really the powerful headlamps on the tractors lighting the way so
the farmers can work another acre or two before calling it a day.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I had coffee with a few of my retired buddies at
the cafe - two or three farmers, a couple of railroad men, a
chemist, and a partially-retired heating and air-conditioning
contractor who often hangs out at one of his company's job sites
just to be sure his son is doing it right. They're a pretty laid
back bunch, particularly now that they)re not punching a time
clock. A few even have time for hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guys fish all summer long and up until there's ice
on the docks. A couple even have boats. Three or four hunt. In
fact, just last week Charlie broke his leg when his stand fell out
of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   But not a single one of the retired farmers I know hunts or
fishes. I got to wondering why. Cal says it's because all of his
life, ever since he was old enough to feed chickens or water the
livestock before climbing on the school bus, time has mattered. It
was never something he had the luxury of wasting by sitting around
with a fishing pole in one hand and a lukewarm brew in the other.
</P>
<P>
   In winter when the lake freezes over, the diehards like Elmer
and Charlie go
</P>
<P>
   ice fishing, but not the farmers. While the railroad man and the
chemist are
</P>
<P>
   out putting up a shanty and boring holes in the ice in hopes of
catching something other than pneumonia, Amos is out in the barn
helping his son repair
</P>
<P>
   a bent axle or a broken plow.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are just not geared for wasting time. Amos says he and
his wife had been married 16 years before they ever felt they had
time for a vacation. Cal says it wasn't the time but Amos was just
too cheap to spring for a weekend at Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Amos complains because his wife won't bake him pies anymore. She
says he doesn't work hard enough to burn the fat. Cal says his
wife's `honey-do' list is so lengthy he can't figure out how
anything ever got done around the house when he was still in the
fields.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, while Elmer and Charlie are grumbling about how
tough it is to clean up their boats and find a cheap place to store
them, Amos and Cal are shaking their heads over corn prices - $1.60
a bushel, down by half.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits die hard.

 &HT;    Children need support to deal with bullies
 &HT;    By Dr. Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In last week's column, I began a discussion of bullies,
including signs of being bullied and characteristics of bullies and
their victims. In this week's column I would like to discuss things
that parents can do to help the victims of bullying.
</P>
<P>
   An important point to remember is that often bullying occurs
without the knowledge of parents and that many victims are very
reluctant to tell adults about their problems with bullying. They
have been threatened and intimidated into silence by the bully.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the parents of a child who is being bullied you may
want to consider the following approaches to help your child:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you suspect that your child is the victim of bullying, ask
him or her directly. Then listen and encourage your child to talk
about his/her feelings. Take your child's complaints seriously,
because you may uncover more serious grievances or perhaps stop the
problem from becoming more serious if the bullying is in the early
stages.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the bullying is occurring at school, alert the school
immediately and ask officials to make sure your child is safe. If
there is bullying taking place outside of school, arrange for
interventions to stop this negative activity immediately. Working
with other parents in the neighborhood, setting up supervision in a
playground area where bullying may be taking place, finding out
more about the company your child is keeping can all be valuable in
the intervention process.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help develop your child's social skills and confidence in the
context of a positive social group. Teach your child how to say
``no'' to another child's unacceptable demands and then turn around
and walk off. Demonstrate assertive vs. submissive responses
through demonstrations with your child.
</P>
<P>
   Do not encourage physical retaliation, as this may escalate the
situation further and can produce disasters and harmful results.
Remember, not all provocative behavior must be acknowledged, and
simply turning away from the bully is often sufficient to stop the
undesirable behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If you child is the victim of a bully, consider professional
assistance if the problems persist. Victims of bullies suffer in
many ways, including becoming the perpetrators of violence in an
attempt to deal with their pent-up rage and hostility as a result
of having been bullied over time.
</P>
<P>
   Awareness and involvement on the parts of parents with regard to
bully-victim problems is essential in changing this very
undesirable set of behaviors.

 &HT;    What seemed like cakewalk is about to get messy for Bush, Gore
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ A funny thing is happening on the way to
anointment.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the drive-through ATM candidate, is driving off
Republican candidates who could help get him nominated and/or
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, the automatic Democrat _ some would say automated _ has
another Demo model sharing his showroom, and party regulars are
looking it over.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not prepared to answer this, but: Is it possible that
invincibility could be the downfall of both?
</P>
<P>
   Surely not. Surely Bush and Gore will face each other in the
general election. They have amassed too much cash and name backing
not to.
</P>
<P>
   But they may get the scare of their lives in so doing. And at
some point they will curse Dame Invincibility for making things _
difficult?
</P>
<P>
   The case of Gore and Democratic challenger Bill Bradley is the
perfect example of what can be wrong with having too much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   We can't know what Gore was thinking when prospective Democratic
challengers dropped away: Richard Gephardt, Jesse Jackson, Bob
Kerrey. Maybe Gore felt elation and relief. On the other hand, when
the very-solid Bradley stepped to the line, Gore instantly might
have gotten wistful for a crowded field, for a nettlesome Paul
Tsongas, a Tom Harkin, a John Kerry. Come one, come anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the more Democrats in the race, the more diluted
would be the ABG, or anybody-but-Gore, vote (more accurately, it's
the anybody-without-a-hint-of-Clinton's-aftershave vote.)
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Bradley is a mighty threat to Gore. Make no mistake.
And the New Hampshire primary looms like none other. Though he
trails nationwide, the ex-New Jersey senator leads Gore in New
Hampshire, according to a Quinnipiac College poll. Should Bradley
win Feb. 1 in New Hampshire or make it close, Gore's invincibility
will be out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, the monstrous mountain of cash he's amassed is the
equivalent of having canceled half a dozen primaries, so rapidly
has it winnowed the Republican field. But that's not all good for
the Dub.
</P>
<P>
   As William Safire points out, having Elizabeth Dole on the
primary ballot was a way of splitting support of those GOP
moderates who see Bush as a question mark and who now might turn to
John McCain. Similarly, having Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander
jettisoned from the ballot means more face time for Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Having lots of names on primary ballots would have helped Bush
in dividing and conquering his GOP doubters. Now McCain is standing
as Bush's chief threat on an electability scale, while Forbes hangs
around to spend with dispatch and cast doubts about the front
runner.
</P>
<P>
   But the real curse of Invincibility, as pertains to the end
result of this whole exercise, may be in the Reform Party, where
contenders like Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump or maybe Ross Perot
again stand to siphon votes away from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that a Reform candidate would hurt Gore and Bush
equally is hogwash. The Reform Party remains a refuge for the AWM,
the angry white male vote. A pivotal portion of that vote went to
Perot in 1992. Gore (or Bradley) would not expect to have any of it
in 1999. But Bush is _ was _ counting on every one.
</P>
<P>
   That Trump and Buchanan (and maybe Perot) appear ready to debate
and draw lots of attention to themselves means one of the two will
acquire stature and visibility among angry white males.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush hadn't appeared so invincible, Buchanan would have hung
around to pester him in the GOP primaries, not bolt to bleed
crucial ABG, AWM votes from Bush in the general election _ or to
make Trump look like Lancelot by contrast.
</P>
<P>
   What's a candidate to do? Even when invincible, sometimes you
just can't win.

   EL REY OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. After a successful run as host of
National Public Radio's ``Talk of the Nation,'' Ray Suarez has
landed a dream job at the ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. This
move cements Suarez's position as one of the top journalists _ not
to mention Latino journalists _ working on national news programs
in the United States. In addition to his nose for news, keen
intellect and topnotch interviewing skills, Suarez will bring a
multicultural perspective that can surely benefit television news.
Katharine Diaz profiles Suarez in this excerpt from Hispanic
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   FROM HAITI TO AMERICA IN SERVITUDE. People who do not live in
South Florida probably have not heard of Charlyne _ the name the
Miami Herald gave to a 16-year-old girl in Pembroke Pines. She is a
restavec _ the Creole term for the turn-of-the-century institution
of involuntary child servitude in Haiti. More than a decade ago,
monied Haitian immigrants nationwide secretly imported the restavec
system to the United States. South Florida has the highest number
of restavecs in America. Restavecs get less attention in the United
States and elsewhere than do black slaves in the African nation of
Sudan, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. The Florida Department of
Children and Families is just now waking up to its responsibility
to protect these youngsters. ``The problem, of course, is that a
restavec, like the black slave of old, is an invaluable piece of
property, and, in most cases, those involved will remain silent,''
Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   BURYING THE FACTS ON YOUTH VIOLENCE. Ever since the Columbine
High School shooting in April, Congress has been under increasing
pressure to do something about gun control and youth violence. The
Senate and the House passed separate versions of a new
juvenile-crime bill in the spring, and Republican leaders of both
houses are nearing agreement on a compromise. A national coalition
of children and youth organizations is worried about provisions in
both bills that would do away with dozens of court consent decrees
that have forced state prison systems to segregate juveniles from
adult prisoners. Also, both bills would allow federal prosecutors
to try youths as young as 13 as adults, increase mandatory
sentences and do away with confidentiality provisions in juvenile
courts. Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports.
</P>
<P>
   WE ONLY WANT WHAT WAS OURS TO BEGIN WITH. A kettle will be
returned to the Ho-Chunk people when all the legal documents are in
order, writes columnist Karen Lincoln Michel. It's a cast-iron
vessel that when covered with deerskin serves as a ceremonial drum
kettle used in Native-American Church religious rites. ``Quite
generous of the Wisconsin State Historical Society to give back the
sacred item to the rightful owner after holding it for more than 40
years,'' she writes. How would other churches react to their
religious paraphernalia being collected, catalogued and put on
display with a hodgepodge of items from other cultures? This week,
Michel reports on the kettle and other items that are being
returned to their rightful owners thanks to Native American Grave
Protection and Repatriation Act.

   EL REY OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. After a successful run as host of
National Public Radio's ``Talk of the Nation,'' Ray Suarez has
landed a dream job at the ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. This
move cements Suarez's position as one of the top journalists _ not
to mention Latino journalists _ working on national news programs
in the United States. In addition to his nose for news, keen
intellect and topnotch interviewing skills, Suarez will bring a
multicultural perspective that can surely benefit television news.
Katharine Diaz profiles Suarez in this excerpt from Hispanic
magazine.

   FROM HAITI TO AMERICA IN SERVITUDE. People who do not live in
South Florida probably have not heard of Charlyne _ the name the
Miami Herald gave to a 16-year-old girl in Pembroke Pines. She is a
restavec _ the Creole term for the turn-of-the-century institution
of involuntary child servitude in Haiti. More than a decade ago,
monied Haitian immigrants nationwide secretly imported the restavec
system to the United States. South Florida has the highest number
of restavecs in America. Restavecs get less attention in the United
States and elsewhere than do black slaves in the African nation of
Sudan, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. The Florida Department of
Children and Families is just now waking up to its responsibility
to protect these youngsters. ``The problem, of course, is that a
restavec, like the black slave of old, is an invaluable piece of
property, and, in most cases, those involved will remain silent,''
Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   BURYING THE FACTS ON YOUTH VIOLENCE. Ever since the Columbine
High School shooting in April, Congress has been under increasing
pressure to do something about gun control and youth violence. The
Senate and the House passed separate versions of a new
juvenile-crime bill in the spring, and Republican leaders of both
houses are nearing agreement on a compromise. A national coalition
of children and youth organizations is worried about provisions in
both bills that would do away with dozens of court consent decrees
that have forced state prison systems to segregate juveniles from
adult prisoners. Also, both bills would allow federal prosecutors
to try youths as young as 13 as adults, increase mandatory
sentences and do away with confidentiality provisions in juvenile
courts. Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports.
</P>
<P>
   WE ONLY WANT WHAT WAS OURS TO BEGIN WITH. A kettle will be
returned to the Ho-Chunk people when all the legal documents are in
order, writes columnist Karen Lincoln Michel. It's a cast-iron
vessel that when covered with deerskin serves as a ceremonial drum
kettle used in Native-American Church religious rites. ``Quite
generous of the Wisconsin State Historical Society to give back the
sacred item to the rightful owner after holding it for more than 40
years,'' she writes. How would other churches react to their
religious paraphernalia being collected, catalogued and put on
display with a hodgepodge of items from other cultures? This week,
Michel reports on the kettle and other items that are being
returned to their rightful owners thanks to Native American Grave
Protection and Repatriation Act.

   FROM HAITI TO AMERICA IN SERVITUDE. People who do not live in
South Florida probably have not heard of Charlyne _ the name the
Miami Herald gave to a 16-year-old girl in Pembroke Pines. She is a
restavec _ the Creole term for the turn-of-the-century institution
of involuntary child servitude in Haiti. More than a decade ago,
monied Haitian immigrants nationwide secretly imported the restavec
system to the United States. South Florida has the highest number
of restavecs in America. Restavecs get less attention in the United
States and elsewhere than do black slaves in the African nation of
Sudan, writes columnist Bill Maxwell. The Florida Department of
Children and Families is just now waking up to its responsibility
to protect these youngsters. ``The problem, of course, is that a
restavec, like the black slave of old, is an invaluable piece of
property, and, in most cases, those involved will remain silent,''
Maxwell writes.

   BURYING THE FACTS ON YOUTH VIOLENCE. Ever since the Columbine
High School shooting in April, Congress has been under increasing
pressure to do something about gun control and youth violence. The
Senate and the House passed separate versions of a new
juvenile-crime bill in the spring, and Republican leaders of both
houses are nearing agreement on a compromise. A national coalition
of children and youth organizations is worried about provisions in
both bills that would do away with dozens of court consent decrees
that have forced state prison systems to segregate juveniles from
adult prisoners. Also, both bills would allow federal prosecutors
to try youths as young as 13 as adults, increase mandatory
sentences and do away with confidentiality provisions in juvenile
courts. Columnist Juan Gonzalez reports.

   WE ONLY WANT WHAT WAS OURS TO BEGIN WITH. A kettle will be
returned to the Ho-Chunk people when all the legal documents are in
order, writes columnist Karen Lincoln Michel. It's a cast-iron
vessel that when covered with deerskin serves as a ceremonial drum
kettle used in Native-American Church religious rites. ``Quite
generous of the Wisconsin State Historical Society to give back the
sacred item to the rightful owner after holding it for more than 40
years,'' she writes. How would other churches react to their
religious paraphernalia being collected, catalogued and put on
display with a hodgepodge of items from other cultures? This week,
Michel reports on the kettle and other items that are being
returned to their rightful owners thanks to Native American Grave
Protection and Repatriation Act.

IT'S HARD TO GET VOTERS FOCUSED ON STATE CHARTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Proponents of a new Texas Constitution are
right. Most Texans are tired of trying to decipher a dozen or more
constitutional amendments every other November and have found
something else to do on Election Days in odd-numbered years.
</P>
<P>
   Going to their kid's soccer game, watching the leaves fall or
even cleaning out the garage are deemed more worthwhile pursuits
than deciding, among other things, how universities can invest
money, how many constables a county can have or what kind of
insurance a school district can buy.
</P>
<P>
   Local races and issues may boost turnout in Houston and San
Antonio, but Election Day elsewhere will slip, sight unseen, past
millions of nonvoting people of voting age.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide turnout is expected to be less than 10 percent of
registered voters, true to recent form for an election in which
constitutional amendments are the only statewide issues.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking hope wherever they can find it, some advocates for a new
constitution suggest that Texans, by boycotting the polls, are
silently expressing support for a new charter. Texans, they hope,
have finally had it with an antiquated, 123-year-old document that
already has been amended 377 times to try to keep pace with
changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, though, people are simply saying that they don't
want to be bothered with voting for amendments that they don't want
to take the time to understand. Many Texans don't even know that
there is a constitutional amendments election, since this year's
crop of 17 proposals has generated only minimal controversy and
minimal publicity.
</P>
<P>
   If a groundswell of public support for a new constitution is
forming, it wasn't detectable in Austin earlier this year, when two
of the Legislature's most influential members _ state Sen. Bill
Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, and state Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo
_ offered their colleagues the opportunity to vote on a new state
charter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ratliff's and Junell's clout and persuasive talents as
chairmen of the Legislature's budget-writing committees, their
proposal, which would have modernized the constitution and made
some significant changes in state government, went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   And hardly anyone outside Austin noticed _ or cared.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers simply approved one of their periodic ``cleanup''
amendments to remove obsolete language from the constitution _
Proposition 3 on the statewide ballot _ and 16 other, more
substantive changes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for an occasional high-profile issue, such as a proposed
pay raise for legislators _ which isn't on the ballot this year _
constitutional revision is just too arcane and too boring to grab
the attention of most people, even if the issues involved can
ultimately affect their pocketbooks or the quality of public
services.
</P>
<P>
   The public disinterest plays into the hands of numerous elected
officials, public institutions and special interest groups that
have special favors and protections built into the present
constitution and actively resist efforts to rewrite it.
</P>
<P>
   Also working against Ratliff's and Junell's effort this year was
Gov. George W. Bush's coolness toward it. Legislators who may have
been interested in rewriting the constitution knew that they
couldn't do so without disrupting the legislative harmony that Bush
insisted upon in anticipation of his presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can be key to any revision attempt. Gov. Dolph
Briscoe's opposition was instrumental in defeating the last major
attempt at a constitutional overhaul in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas probably should have a new constitution, such a
change is not essential, and a serious constitutional rewrite won't
happen anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   If it ever does, it will require the support of many factions,
led by a popular governor, to sell a new charter to the Legislature
and the voters.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of stars will have to line up just right too.
</P>

   ``En charge!''
</P>
<P>
   With his rallying cry, technician Bruno Duguay throws a switch
to power up a 50-foot generator on the laboratory floor. A display
on the instrument panel ticks off the mounting charge one kilovolt
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It will take three or four minutes before the generator's
voltage climbs high enough to transfer to the electrodes. In the
glass-walled control room, Duguay and half a dozen colleagues are
supercharged with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that lightning never strikes the same place twice. But
the folks here can make it strike the same place 100 times a day.
That place is the high-voltage laboratory run by Canadian power
giant Hydro-Quebec, one of the world's premier facilities for
studying the most shocking electrical phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The short, straight lightning bolts that dart between the lab's
electrodes are a highly domesticated version of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Duguay reaches across the instrument panel to sound a warning
blast out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention! Ca va claquer!'' (``Look out! It's going to
spark!'')
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, when he pushes a black button on a gray box, the
crack of an arc lights the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sound-and-light show,'' says Bruno LaFontaine,
lead scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine's group is in the vanguard of international efforts
to tame lightning _ to trigger the strikes and guide them away from
power lines and installations, thus saving electric utilities
millions of dollars a year in outages and damaged equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting laser beams at thunderclouds, the lightning tamers
hope to channel a discharge toward a relatively safe location
before Mother Nature does worse. It's one of those really cool
ideas that seems better suited to science fiction than science.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for La Fontaine's work does nothing to dispel that
impression. Located in the Montreal suburb of Varennes, the
windowless high-voltage lab resembles an alien monolith from
``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the decor is more ``Lost in Space'': pale-blue 150-foot
walls bathed in stark gray light, ceramic towers girded by thick
silver rings, silver domes made up of small round plates like the
compound eyes of an insect.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes used in the lightning experiments complete the
sci-fi effect. Instead of slender rods, there are two circles of
loose wire mesh suspended from the ceiling like huge trampolines,
one hanging about 20 feet above the other. When sufficient charge
flows to a rod descending from the upper electrode, an arc of
current jumps between their centers.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine is demonstrating his latest findings to French
collaborator Anne Bondiou-Clergerie of the Office National d'Etudes
et de Recherches Aerospatiales in Chatillon
</P>
<P>
   Bondiou is an expert on the physics of lightning formation,
which is still poorly understood, she says, even two centuries
after Ben Franklin flew a kite in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes start in thunderheads when the strong thermal
updrafts that build the towering clouds cause water droplets and
ice crystals to collide, creating positively and negatively charged
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These particles separate by weight and form electric fields
within the cloud as well as between the cloud and the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fields get amplified around water droplets, creating
electric currents called streamers that coalesce like the
tributaries of a river, forming even more strongly ionized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   These conductive channels propagate downward until a discharge
jumps the gap between the channel and the ground. Then a wave of
current surges upward through the small channel. Bondiou and other
experts call this final, visible stage the ``return stroke.'' The
rest of us call it lightning, and it can carry current of up to
300,000 amperes (household current rarely exceeds 50 amperes).
</P>
<P>
   Lightning rods ground strikes because their pointy edges produce
amplified electric fields that can induce an arc before the
electric field in the cloud grows strong enough to break down
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, electrical energy doesn't discriminate between
inexpensive metal rods and tall, sharp points on valuable
voltage-sensitive equipment. That's why nearly every structure in
the high-voltage lab is protected by rounded surfaces: These
Jetson-esque rings and domes prevent the generation of unintended
local discharges.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine's goal is to provoke controlled discharges. His
simulations re-create the charged field of a thundercloud: The rod
represents the ionized channels that descend from a cloud, and the
lower electrode represents the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the lab experiments include another element definitely not
found in nature: a state-of-the-art titanium-sapphire laser whose
light is beamed up from the floor and through a hole in the center
of the lower electrode. A brief pulse of focused light knocks
electrons off molecules in the air, blazing a conductive trail for
the discharge to follow. Ideally, the laser pulse triggers a
discharge and guides its path.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can tell right away whether they've succeeded in
creating a laser-guided arc: Whereas an unguided discharge is
crooked, like a natural lightning bolt, a guided discharge is
perfectly straight, like a beam of laser light.
</P>
<P>
   ``En charge!'' Duguay calls out, and the group prepares for
another strike.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using lasers to coax lightning strikes has been
around for decades, and Russian and Japanese scientists have long
conducted outdoor experiments with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanotivated by their vulnerability to low-altitude
winter thunderstorms that sweep across the Sea of Japan and strike
nuclear power plants on the west coast of the main island _ have
taken the lead in triggered-lightning research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, north of Osaka, a group headed by Shigeaki Uchida of
the Institute for Laser Technology successfully triggered two
outdoor strikes using carbon-dioxide laser beams focused at the tip
of a 150-foot tower. Radar detectors picked up variations in the
electric field from an approaching storm, indicating that a
lightning strike was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 100-millisecond gap between these preliminary
breakdown signals and the discharge, but the Japanese laser can
generate a channel of charged particles in microseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laser is a thousand times faster than the lightning strike
itself,'' Uchida says. ``With one shot of laser, we neutralized the
whole thundercloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent lightening tamers admit that it may take at
least a decade before their work sees practical application.
</P>
<P>
   And with another sharp crack, another bolt of perfectly straight
lab-grown lightning hits home.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.'' And
although the phrase can be annoying, she's literally correct. What
my eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm
seeing can be two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively
create what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past
experiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when
we do it can come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,
you'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.
</P>
<P>
   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference
between seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see
accompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist
Vilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on
the left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and
the spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,
except flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is
above _ like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now stare at the circles while telling yourself that the light
comes from below: The images will reverse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Try are two other experiments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Extreme _ yet unconscious _ cases of active perception occur
all the time, because the brain continually adjusts for our
movement and that of what we are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   To see this, hold your left hand in front of you, thumb sticking
up, and move it back and forth horizontally. Watch your thumb. Now
hold your thumb still and scan your eyes quickly back and forth.

   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.'' And
although the phrase can be annoying, she's literally correct. What
my eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm
seeing can be two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively
create what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past
experiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when
we do it can come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,
you'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.
</P>
<P>
   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference
between seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see
accompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist
Vilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on
the left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and
the spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,
except flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is

   ``En charge!''
</P>
<P>
   With his rallying cry, technician Bruno Duguay throws a switch
to power up a 50-foot generator on the laboratory floor. A display
on the instrument panel ticks off the mounting charge one kilovolt
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It will take three or four minutes before the generator's
voltage climbs high enough to transfer to the electrodes. In the
glass-walled control room, Duguay and half a dozen colleagues are
supercharged with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that lightning never strikes the same place twice. But
the folks here can make it strike the same place 100 times a day.
That place is the high-voltage laboratory run by Canadian power
giant Hydro-Quebec, one of the world's premier facilities for
studying the most shocking electrical phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The short, straight lightning bolts that dart between the lab's
electrodes are a highly domesticated version of the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Duguay reaches across the instrument panel to sound a warning
blast out on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention! Ca va claquer!'' (``Look out! It's going to
spark!'')
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, when he pushes a black button on a gray box, the
crack of an arc lights the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sound-and-light show,'' says Bruno LaFontaine,
lead scientist on the project.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine's group is in the vanguard of international efforts
to tame lightning _ to trigger the strikes and guide them away from
power lines and installations, thus saving electric utilities
millions of dollars a year in outages and damaged equipment.
</P>
<P>
   By shooting laser beams at thunderclouds, the lightning tamers
hope to channel a discharge toward a relatively safe location
before Mother Nature does worse. It's one of those really cool
ideas that seems better suited to science fiction than science.
</P>
<P>
   The setting for La Fontaine's work does nothing to dispel that
impression. Located in the Montreal suburb of Varennes, the
windowless high-voltage lab resembles an alien monolith from
``2001: A Space Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the decor is more ``Lost in Space'': pale-blue 150-foot
walls bathed in stark gray light, ceramic towers girded by thick
silver rings, silver domes made up of small round plates like the
compound eyes of an insect.
</P>
<P>
   The electrodes used in the lightning experiments complete the
sci-fi effect. Instead of slender rods, there are two circles of
loose wire mesh suspended from the ceiling like huge trampolines,
one hanging about 20 feet above the other. When sufficient charge
flows to a rod descending from the upper electrode, an arc of
current jumps between their centers.
</P>
<P>
   La Fontaine is demonstrating his latest findings to French
collaborator Anne Bondiou-Clergerie of the Office National d'Etudes
et de Recherches Aerospatiales in Chatillon
</P>
<P>
   Bondiou is an expert on the physics of lightning formation,
which is still poorly understood, she says, even two centuries
after Ben Franklin flew a kite in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning strikes start in thunderheads when the strong thermal
updrafts that build the towering clouds cause water droplets and
ice crystals to collide, creating positively and negatively charged
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These particles separate by weight and form electric fields
within the cloud as well as between the cloud and the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fields get amplified around water droplets, creating
electric currents called streamers that coalesce like the
tributaries of a river, forming even more strongly ionized
channels.
</P>
<P>
   These conductive channels propagate downward until a discharge
jumps the gap between the channel and the ground. Then a wave of
current surges upward through the small channel. Bondiou and other
experts call this final, visible stage the ``return stroke.'' The
rest of us call it lightning, and it can carry current of up to
300,000 amperes (household current rarely exceeds 50 amperes).
</P>
<P>
   Lightning rods ground strikes because their pointy edges produce
amplified electric fields that can induce an arc before the
electric field in the cloud grows strong enough to break down
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, electrical energy doesn't discriminate between
inexpensive metal rods and tall, sharp points on valuable
voltage-sensitive equipment. That's why nearly every structure in
the high-voltage lab is protected by rounded surfaces: These
Jetson-esque rings and domes prevent the generation of unintended
local discharges.
</P>
<P>
   LaFontaine's goal is to provoke controlled discharges. His
simulations re-create the charged field of a thundercloud: The rod
represents the ionized channels that descend from a cloud, and the
lower electrode represents the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the lab experiments include another element definitely not
found in nature: a state-of-the-art titanium-sapphire laser whose
light is beamed up from the floor and through a hole in the center
of the lower electrode. A brief pulse of focused light knocks
electrons off molecules in the air, blazing a conductive trail for
the discharge to follow. Ideally, the laser pulse triggers a
discharge and guides its path.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can tell right away whether they've succeeded in
creating a laser-guided arc: Whereas an unguided discharge is
crooked, like a natural lightning bolt, a guided discharge is
perfectly straight, like a beam of laser light.
</P>
<P>
   ``En charge!'' Duguay calls out, and the group prepares for
another strike.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of using lasers to coax lightning strikes has been
around for decades, and Russian and Japanese scientists have long
conducted outdoor experiments with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese _ motivated by their vulnerability to low-altitude
winter thunderstorms that sweep across the Sea of Japan and strike
nuclear power plants on the west coast of the main island _ have
taken the lead in triggered-lightning research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, north of Osaka, a group headed by Shigeaki Uchida of
the Institute for Laser Technology successfully triggered two
outdoor strikes using carbon-dioxide laser beams focused at the tip
of a 150-foot tower. Radar detectors picked up variations in the
electric field from an approaching storm, indicating that a
lightning strike was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 100-millisecond gap between these preliminary
breakdown signals and the discharge, but the Japanese laser can
generate a channel of charged particles in microseconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The laser is a thousand times faster than the lightning strike
itself,'' Uchida says. ``With one shot of laser, we neutralized the
whole thundercloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most ardent lightening tamers admit that it may take at
least a decade before their work sees practical application.
</P>
<P>
   And with another sharp crack, another bolt of perfectly straight
lab-grown lightning hits home.

direction of the nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Your brain didn't command your eye to move in such a way, so it
couldn't compensate for the nudge. When it saw motion on your
retina, it wrongly assumed the world had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: EYES WIDE SHUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Active perception can also work against us, giving too much
credence to what we expect and not enough to what we actually
witness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one study showed that women forgave attractive
children more quickly than unattractive ones, even for identical
transgressions. Most of us expect good-looking kids to be better
adjusted than homely ones.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you find yourself dismissing something new
because it doesn't fit with your experiences, give your eye a very
gentle nudge. When the room jumps, remember that we actively
construct our perceptions.

   My wife is fond of saying, ``It's all in your head.'' And
although the phrase can be annoying, she's literally correct. What
my eyes actually see and what my brain decides to tell me I'm
seeing can be two very different things.
</P>
<P>
   We never experience raw reality. Instead, our brains actively
create what we perceive from a blend of external stimuli, our past
experiences and our expectations. We rarely notice this, but when
we do it can come as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you drink a glass of milk thinking it's Coke,
you'll be shocked when your taste buds take over.
</P>
<P>
   An optical illusion can be another indication of the difference
between seeing and perceiving. Consider the shaded figures (see
accompanying slide showing circles), developed by psychophysicist
Vilyanur Ramachandran. Most people would say that the circles on
the left are spheres, while those on the right are cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But turn the page upside down: Now the cavities are spheres, and
the spheres are cavities. These images are actually the same,
except flipped. Our brains assume that any unseen light source is
above _ like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now stare at the circles while telling yourself that the light
comes from below: The images will reverse themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Try are two other experiments:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 1: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Extreme _ yet unconscious _ cases of active perception occur
all the time, because the brain continually adjusts for our
movement and that of what we are looking at.
</P>
<P>
   To see this, hold your left hand in front of you, thumb sticking
up, and move it back and forth horizontally. Watch your thumb. Now
hold your thumb still and scan your eyes quickly back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the image of your thumb moves across your
retinas, but only in the first case do you perceive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of motion doesn't necessarily arise from an image
moving across your retina, as you might expect. Instead, it is
controlled by the brain. When the brain knows the eyes are moving,
it nullifies the resulting shift in background to prevent you from
thinking that your environment is moving.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPERIMENT 2: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. To throw this tidy arrangement into chaos, disrupt the
communication between the brain and the eyes. Very gently nudge one
eye as you read this. The text should lurch in the opposite
direction of the nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Your brain didn't command your eye to move in such a way, so it
couldn't compensate for the nudge. When it saw motion on your
retina, it wrongly assumed the world had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDEBAR: EYES WIDE SHUT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Active perception can also work against us, giving too much
credence to what we expect and not enough to what we actually
witness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one study showed that women forgave attractive
children more quickly than unattractive ones, even for identical
transgressions. Most of us expect good-looking kids to be better
adjusted than homely ones.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you find yourself dismissing something new
because it doesn't fit with your experiences, give your eye a very
gentle nudge. When the room jumps, remember that we actively
construct our perceptions.

COLOMBIAN MEDIA EMPHASIZING UPLIFTING NEWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Concerned that saturation coverage of
guerrilla attacks, murders and economic woe will scare off
advertisers and readers, major Colombian newspapers, magazines and
television stations are seeking out sunnier stories.
</P>
<P>
   This month, El Tiempo, the nation's largest newspaper, published
a 48-page special section called ``Rabiosamente Optimistas,'' or
``Rabidly Optimistic,'' that spotlighted people who are bullish on
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   To lighten the mood, television news teams have added attractive
women to read the latest gossip.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a monthly newspaper in the city of Medellin that
ignores the nation's troubles altogether. The Spanish-language
publication has an English title _ Good News From Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the trend is driven by commercial rather than civic
motives. Newsrooms, however, have been flooded with letters, phone
calls and e-mail messages praising the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the worst of times, people want us to show them something
good,'' said Pilar Calderon, assistant editor of the newsweekly
Cambio, which distributes a sister publication called Cambio Buenas
Noticias, or ``Cambio Good News.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, bad news in Colombia was a bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters made their reputations by investigating Pablo Escobar
and other flamboyant drug lords who waged a brutal campaign against
the state by setting off car bombs and killing police officers.
Escobar was killed in a police manhunt in 1993, and the Cali cartel
leaders were jailed two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Though Colombians were appalled by the violence, editors say
that readers rarely tired of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that on Sunday, if we had a piece on Pablo Escobar and
his land holdings, we would sell a ton of newspapers'' said Gonzalo
Guillen, an editor at La Presna, a Bogota daily that closed two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the mood of readers has shifted amid a growing
sense that the nation's troubles are here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Marxist guerrillas, who have been fighting for 35 years, are
stronger than ever and now operate in 40 percent of the
countryside. More than 1.5 million Colombians have been displaced
by the war. Kidnappings are at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Colombia is extremely negative,'' Calderon
said. ``The other day, I sat down with a few journalists to talk
about how many of our friends had been assassinated and buried. We
counted 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the malaise is Colombia's worst recession since the
1930s. Unemployment tops 20 percent, and the economy may shrink by
4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak outlook has hurt circulation and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis has put people in a very different mood
compared to 10 years ago,'' said Francisco Santos, news editor of
El Tiempo. ``People are so fed up that they want to read about
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A citizen-organized campaign recently called on Colombians to
boycott newspapers and TV newscasts because they were too negative.
Advertisers complained that their products were being associated
with violence.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, major television stations broadcast reports
of violence only in black and white as a gesture of solidarity with
the nation's peace movement.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Celis, an El Tiempo editor who calls himself a
die-hard idealist, came up with the idea for a 14-page special
section on Colombians with a positive outlook. Businesses jumped at
the chance to buy space in a forum stressing good news, and the
section expanded to 48 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Celis acknowledged that the media and advertisers have a common
interest in promoting an upbeat mood. El Tiempo's ``Rabidly
Optimistic'' section was published shortly after the newspaper
opened two new printing plants and a television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are convinced there are no solutions, they are not
going to buy anything,'' Celis said. ``Businesses need a mood of
optimism for people to consume.''
</P>
<P>
   The El Tiempo supplement included stories on high-profile
Colombians like Microsoft Vice President Orlando Ayala and rock
star Shakira as well as local heroes, such as a Bogota carpenter
who had lost both hands in an industrial accident but still managed
to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   Cambio, which has published four ``good news'' supplements this
year, has focused on the reconstruction of the coffee-growing
region of western Colombia that was devastated by a January
earthquake as well as environmental projects and campaigns against
government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the El Tiempo supplement was immediate. During a
brief interview at the newspaper's offices last week, Celis
received two phone calls from readers thanking him for his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Colombia still survives, it's not because of its political
leaders or those who defend their ideas with guns, but because of
the 28 million Colombians who only show up in the press when they
publish an odd supplement about optimism,'' said Daniel Samper, an
author and the brother of former President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Ponsford, editor of the weekly magazine Cromos, said
that good news has become politically correct. ``It looks good, and
they get a lot of ads,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At El Tiempo, reporters and editors try to get uplifting
articles into the newspaper every day, Santos said. Tracking such
stories down, however, requires patience.
</P>
<P>
   Cambio reporter Jose Manuel Reveron said that people in Cali,
one of the cities hit hardest by the recession, were puzzled when
he recently inquired about positive developments there.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, La Prensa tried to run a regular good-news
column. But Guillen said the idea was scrapped due to the lack of
legitimate stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things here are so messed up that it could be considered news
if the police don't rob a bank or if the stoplights work,'' Guillen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are going to get tired of false optimism,'' he
said. ``To say that yesterday people went to work and that the
bread-maker made bread is stupid journalism.''

HISTORIANS PONDER SOME FASCINATING WHAT-IFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (``What if? The World's Foremost Military Historians Imagine What
Might Have Been''; edited by Robert Cowley; Putnam, $27.95.) 
 
By LEE CEARNAL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History is replete with days when fate changed horses. Consider
where the world would be today if:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disease hadn't wracked the Assyrian forces as they besieged
Jerusalem in 701 B.C., allowing the last remaining group of Jews _
and their religion _ to survive.
</P>
<P>
   _ The winds had favored the Spanish Aug. 7-8, 1588, in the
English Channel, Philip II's armada had smashed the British fleet
and his army had invaded and subjugated England.
</P>
<P>
   _ A dense fog hadn't enabled George Washington and his trapped
army to escape from Brooklyn Heights in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other provocative ``counterfactuals'' are the topic of
the intriguing ``What If?,'' a compilation of essays by 34
distinguished historians written for Military History Quarterly and
edited by Robert Cowley.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contributors are some of the most prominent historians
of the day: John Keegan, Thomas Fleming, David McCullough, Stephen
Ambrose and Cowley.
</P>
<P>
   Each essay testifies to the fact that history hangs by a thread.
Similar alternative scenarios are employed by military schools to
teach how the principles of war (mass, movement, surprise, etc.) _
no matter how well-followed _ can be made irrelevant by weather,
disease, happenstance and whim.
</P>
<P>
   In positing the consequences of history taking a different turn
at each point, the essays all assume the trends at the time would
have continued in a more or less straight line. That is, that no
Jews would have survived the siege of Jerusalem to keep the flame
alive, that Spain would have continued to be the pre-eminent world
power, and that no one would have replaced a captured George
Washington and the colonies would not have been able to field
another army.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this assumption is questionable indeed.
Nevertheless, these essays are valuable in that they illuminate the
importance of what did happen and thus help define the points at
which the world turned.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other what-ifs:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the loose confederation of Greek city-states had not
defeated a much stronger Persian fleet at Salamis in 480 B.C. Much
of the culture of the West would have been stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Robert E. Lee's ``lost order'' had not been found by a
Union soldier, enabling the North to win a narrow victory at
Antietam. Had Lee won, the South might have been formally
recognized by England and France, and gone on to win the war.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Hitler had invaded the Middle East instead of the Soviet
Union. He would have secured a limitless supply of oil (and
deprived the Allies of it) and saved his army from a debilitating
defeat in the snows of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the death of Alexander at the battle of the
Granicus River in 334 B.C. (as very nearly happened), a victory by
Napoleon at Waterloo (which could very easily have happened), an
Allied defeat at Normandy on June 6, 1944, and a Japanese victory
at Midway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, considering how things actually turned out, the natural
instinct when reading of such close calls is, ``Whew, dodged a
bullet there.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again, if things had been different and Philip's armada
had prevailed, George Washington had been forced to surrender or
Lee had won at Gettysburg, the posited counterfactuals would have
been the opposite, and a reader's reaction might well have been ...
exactly the same.

ALLENDE'S EXPERIENCE AND LATEST NOVEL PROVE POSSIBILITIES OF LIFE
IN CALIFORNIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America has always been the land of new beginnings, a place
where immigrants cast off the miseries and failures of the past and
reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   California, more than any other part of the country, seems to
whisper persuasively that promise of starting over. Ask the
thousands of young men who hotfooted it there when gold was
discovered at Sutter's Mill in 1848. Ask Chilean-born novelist
Isabel Allende, who moved to Northern California in 1986 and has
lived there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration, transformation and the price of passion all figure
in Allende's new novel, ``Daughter of Fortune'' (HarperCollins,
$26), most of which is set in Gold Rush-era California.
</P>
<P>
   Allende is one of those rare writers who has a true following.
Her fans don't settle for reading one of her books; they read them
all.
</P>
<P>
   It's telling that everything she's published _ from her debut
novel, ``The House of the Spirits'' (1985), through more recent
nonfiction titles such as ``Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses''
(1998) _ remains in print.
</P>
<P>
   Allende's been traveling to promote ``Daughter of Fortune''
since December and won't be finished until February. The book is
No. 1 in Germany and the Netherlands and was on the best-seller
list in Spain for nine months. It's big in Australia and,
naturally, in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel since 1993's ``Infinite Plan, Daughter of
Fortune'' took seven years to research. What piqued Allende's
interest initially was learning that San Francisco, today such an
urbane, sophisticated city, was founded during the Gold Rush by
``scoundrels and bandits and madams.'' Allende lives in San Rafael,
in Marin County north of San Francisco. She does her writing in
nearby Sausalito, in a small Victorian house that has at various
times been a brothel, a church and a chocolate-chip cookie factory.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing exactly what she was going to do with the
material, she plunged into histories, memoirs, diaries and letters
of the Gold Rush period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a place of diversity and adventure, the land where
you would really start a new life,'' Allende says. ``I think that
was the greatest attraction, more than the gold. ... It was a no
man's land, with gold and no rules _ you could make up the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Chile, where class divisions continue to be fairly
rigid, she liked the anarchic spirit of the Gold Rush. That grubby
miner might be an aristocrat down on his luck; bandits sometimes
dressed like lords.
</P>
<P>
   The novel begins in the Chilean port city of Valparaiso, where
an infant is left, apparently abandoned, on the doorstop of a
middle-class English trader, Jeremy Sommers, and his sister Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Eliza, as the girl is named, grows into a spirited if sheltered
teen-ager who falls in love at first sight with Joaquin Andieta, a
proud but poor young clerk for Jeremy Sommers' trading company.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers give vent to their passion with the predictable
result: Eliza gets pregnant. Before learning the news, Joaquin
embezzles money from his employer and takes off for California _
gold has been discovered there. Eliza, facing disgrace at home, has
no choice but to pursue her beloved, and with the help of a young
Chinese doctor, she stows away in the bowels of a ship heading for
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She loses her baby on the voyage, but she and Tao Chi'en arrive
in Northern California in time to join the thousands of others from
all over the world in the race for riches.
</P>
<P>
   Since virtually the only women in California at the time were
prostitutes, Eliza must disguise herself as a man as she and Tao
search for the missing Joaquin, who seems to have transformed
himself into a much-feared Mexican bandit known as Joaquin Murieta.
</P>
<P>
   As this summary suggests, ``Daughter of Fortune'' is part love
story but mostly adventure story, and the straightforward narrative
is packed with historical events. Allende isn't shy about unloading
the fruits of her research.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main characters are fictional, the things they see
and experience have a basis in fact. There really was, for example,
an elusive bandit named Joaquin Murieta. Allende has Tao embark on
a campaign to save young Chinese prostitutes held in killingly
brutal conditions. The conditions really were as bad as described,
Allende says.
</P>
<P>
   Having a young woman pass as a boy is no hoary literary device.
There were many cases when women donned a male identity to survive
in an overwhelmingly masculine world, she says.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Allende tells of a Chilean businesswoman who hits
upon the idea of packing a ship with ice and carrying fresh fruits
and vegetables all the way from South America to San Francisco.
That too is based on fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't possibly invent something like that,'' she says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gold Rush was a time of extremes,'' she continues.
``Extreme violence and greed and conquest, but also freedom,
adventure, idealism. Many utopians went to California because they
had the idea that the societies they could not found in Europe they
could found in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Chileans and Peruvians joined the Gold Rush, few
stayed, largely because Anglos adopted laws that made it virtually
impossible for non-Anglos to get secure title to their claims,
Allende says.
</P>
<P>
   Love _ first love in particular _ is the engine that sets the
plot in motion. Rose ends up exiled to Chile because she has an
affair with an opera singer in England. Eliza's torrid relationship
severs her from her adoptive family and sets her on the roller
coaster of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the cataclysm of my first love,'' Allende says.
``It lasted two years, and it was just awful _ it was like being a
lunatic for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last, but her relationship with current husband
William Gordon is going strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first night in William's house, when I came
just to visit, and I had a feeling I could invent a new version of
myself, just for this man. I think the United States offers that to
immigrants. That's the attraction.''

TRAITING UP: WHAT IF YOU COULD HAVE THE TRAITS OF YOUR CHOICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was the couple who advertised they would pay $50,000
for an egg from a tall, athletic, college student with high scores
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the fashion photographer on the Internet who
offered to auction models' eggs to buyers willing to pay up to
$150,000 in hopes of having a beautiful child. (OK, so some
observers now say that was just a ruse to attract visitors to his
pornography site. He did make the offer.)
</P>
<P>
   And that got us to wondering. What if you could pre-select the
specific traits your heart desired?
</P>
<P>
   Want the brains of Stephen Hawking? You got 'em. The body of
Arnold Schwarzenegger? It's yours! The athletic ability of Michael
Jordan? The musical ability of Beethoven or the Beatles?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment the monumental ethical problems of such a
world gone mad and dream a little. What might you pick if you pluck
any genetic trait from any person on earth?
</P>
<P>
   We asked a handful of folks. Here's what they said:
</P>
<P>
   - Paige Pryor, a high school student at Blue Valley Northwest
High School, wanted only two things: ``I think if (Sports
Illustrated cover girl) Heidi Klum had Rosie O'Donnell's
personality, that would be the all-around perfect person,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   - Julian Craig, a graduate student at the University of Kansas,
was a little more particular. He wanted the face of model Tyson
Beckford, the body of Hercules, the brains of W.E.B. DuBois, the
sense of humor of Robin Williams, the athletic ability of Sandy
Koufax, the musical ability of R&AMP;B artist R. Kelly and the
compassion of Toni Morrison.

   Dianne Donnici, a hairstylist from Kansas City, gave reasons for
all her selections. She'd be thrilled to have the face of ``Days of
Our Lives'' actress Kristian Alfonso (``she's got a different look
to her that's really, really pretty''), the legs of Tina Turner
(``they're long and slim and they've got good tone''), the hair of
Heather Graham as she wore it in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' (``her hair was really long and beautiful and shiny. I
mean, it was just awesome. Power hair! We were all ready to go get
extensions after that movie''), the arms of Jennifer Aniston
(``they're still tiny. They look real feminine, but you can tell
she's been working out''), the musical ability of Madonna (``I love
how her voice sounds, and her style''), the athletic ability of a
Laker Girl, the sense of humor of Adam Sandler and the brains of a
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that people are unique, her friend, Erin Reese, a
student at Rockhurst College, made completely different choices.
She went with the face of Meg Ryan (``her face is very animated,
very cute.''), the legs of Naomi Campbell, the hair of Portia de
Rossi (who plays Nelle on ``Ally McBeal''), the arms of Angela
Bassett, the musical ability of Courtney Love, the athletic ability
of volleyballer Gabrielle Reece, the sense of humor of MTV's Tom
Green (``he has a real weird sense of humor; I don't think a lot of
people understand it'') and the brains of a rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there was Richard Carter, a salesman from
Warrensburg, who would give anything to look like Harrison Ford in
his Indiana Jones period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``I look like Don Knotts in his
Barney Fife period.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's other wants?
</P>
<P>
   He'd like the feet of the late ballet star Rudolf Nureyev (``he
was strong and graceful, and I'm so awkward''), the brain of Albert
Einstein or Albert Schweitzer (``they thought on a completely
different plane than the rest of us''), the writing ability of
William Shakespeare, the musical ability of Eric Clapton, the voice
of Nat King Cole (``perfect'') and the athletic ability of, well,
best to let him explain it:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want,'' he said, taking at least five minutes to write it
out on a napkin, ``a combination of Maurice Green's legs, Jim
Brown's heart, Wayne Gretzky's talent, Michael Jordan's desire,
Bill Russell's character, Wilt Chamberlain's dominance and Babe
Didrickson Zaharius' versatility. Everybody else could go home
then. I'd win it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa there, Richard. Back to reality. We're still figuring out
whether we can buy genetic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   What if instead of getting the supermodel's beauty, you end up
looking like her short, bald great-grandpa? And what if instead of
the running back's athletic ability we get the klutziness of his
nerdy bookworm uncle?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes we can engineer our genetic destiny might do
well to heed the wisdom of George Bernard Shaw. As the story goes,
a woman once came up to Shaw and remarked that since he was smart
and she was beautiful, they should have children.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's retort:
</P>
<P>
   ``What if they get my looks and your brains?''

NO-WINE SITUATIONS: SOME FOODS CAN INCUR THE WRATH OF GRAPES 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Red wine with meat, right? White wine with fish ... .
</P>
<P>
   That's the ``rule'' most commonly associated with wine and food,
although in these days of innovative chefs and creative
wine-and-food pairings, almost anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine with fish? You bet, especially if it's grilled salmon
and a smoky, silky pinot noir (or red burgundy). White wine with
beef? Why not? A big, full-bodied white burgundy (or chardonnay)
and a grilled piece of fine beef _ or pork _ and you're there.
</P>
<P>
   Foie gras and sauternes? Fabulous. Stilton and vintage port?
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, today almost anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Except artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   And many times, chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the foods that good cooks and chefs have
trouble pairing with wines. Whether it's the herbal bitterness of
an artichoke, the grassiness of asparagus or the high acidity in
chocolate, sometimes a dish simply doesn't match up with a wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artichokes? I'd stay away from them,'' says Mercer A. Mohr,
executive chef at the Omni Hotel's La Reserve in Houston.
``Brussels sprouts, too. Any vegetable that has a bitter aftertaste
is difficult to match with wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ruppe, owner/chef of his eponymous restaurant near
downtown, agrees. ``Artichokes are tough. Some foods just blow wine
out of the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cox, owner/chef of Mark's, also says artichokes are a
difficult match, as is asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Keating, executive chef at the Four Seasons' DeVille in
downtown Houston, takes the opposite tack. ``I'd like to blow away
that myth about artichokes. A sauvignon blanc or a white `meritage'
(white Bordeaux blend) can go with artichokes _ the flavors don't
fight that much.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you can drink a wine with artichokes, what would it be?
``The tougher the food, the simpler the wine,'' says Robert Del
Grande, owner/chef of Cafe Annie. ``I'd drink a rose with
artichokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people to whom food is both a passion and a
vocation will tell you there are no taboos associated with matching
wine with food _ even artichokes. Monica Pope, owner/chef at
Boulevard Bistrot, says that even though vinaigrettes and sauces
can cause wine-food headaches, ``I go by the theory that there is
no food that won't go with some wine, even if it's something very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   She says that even with a ``literal marriage of opposites, there
is something indisputable about why those two are together _
something connects them.'' Running a restaurant, she says, ``We
deal with connecting flavors to devise a successful special
(combination), and the wine is really an extension of our work.
Bridging the artichoke to the wine can be done by choosing certain
other flavors in the sauce or other elements in the dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Asparagus is another food commonly considered no friend to a
glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Asparagus is rough, but again, an acidic, grassy-style
sauvignon blanc (such as a Sancerre or a New Zealand sauvignon
blanc) can be a winner,'' Keating says.
</P>
<P>
   You can pair a wine with asparagus, says the Houstonian's
executive chef, Jim Mills _ just not a red wine. ``With a Vouvray
(an off-dry chenin blanc) or a big sauvignon blanc, it'll work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Mitchell, executive chef at the Rainbow Lodge, also likes
a sauvignon blanc with asparagus. ``It can go pretty well
together.''
</P>
<P>
   A particular nemesis for Mitchell has less to do with flavor
than temperature: soups. ``Sometimes it's hard to pair a hot liquid
with a liquid that's cold or even room temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   Other vegetables can also raise a red flag when matched with
wine. For example, Mills says, the woodiness of shiitake mushrooms
conflicts with the tannins in red wine. ``There's this funky
chemical reaction,'' he says. And he's also leery of eggplant.
``It's one of my pet peeves. It can have a very big flavor, and
that messes with wine. Of course, the more you cook it, you don't
notice it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Most chefs agree that vegetables are much harder than meats to
match with wines. Most cooked meats have their wine marriages:
cabernet sauvignon, or red Bordeaux, with beef; a red Rhone or a
zinfandel with lamb; lighter reds such as pinot noir with game
birds.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. A trend
these days is cooking beef jammed with cracked black peppercorns.
In that case, beware, says Del Grande _ that's a serious spice hit.
But you can match it with wine, although a cabernet may not be the
way to go. ``With some foods, you need less serious wines _ like an
Australian shiraz or a grenache, because they're flexible. Cabernet
is like the prow of a ship _ it just stays on course.'' And beef
and cracked pepper isn't even on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Another particular meat that can raise culinary eyebrows is ham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too salty,'' says Mitchell. ``Wine seems to give ham a
metallic taste.''
</P>
<P>
   But, says Del Grande, ``I love ham; we always have some kinds of
ham here at the restaurant. I would drink a wine like a nice,
fruity grenache with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's not the food or wine but the styles that
conflict, especially with the most popular wine, chardonnay. Says
Ruppe, ``A big fat, buttery chardonnay with a lightly poached sole
and light cream sauce doesn't work, because the food needs a wine
with more acidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohr agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chardonnay is a great before-dinner drink, but taking
chardonnay to the dinner table doesn't always result in a good food
match. If the dominant impression of the chardonnay is crisp and
citrusy, then it can match well with several foods. But if the
chardonnay is buttery and creamy, food pairings are much more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Spices are often what really make foods both interesting and
flavorful. But those same spices are also what can spell doom for a
glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very spicy foods need a quencher, like beer or water _ not
wine,'' says Del Grande, no stranger himself to the spice rack.
</P>
<P>
   Cox agrees about spices. ``A little can go a long way _ the food
can mask the wine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot spices, like chilies, don't match with most wines,'' says
Keating, ``especially tannic red wines like cabernet or Bordeaux.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell reacts gingerly when trying to match wines with ...
ginger. ``It usually stands alone, as a flavor. It doesn't even go
with gewurztraminer (a spicy white wine of Alsatian origin) because
of the spicy heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spice that generally doesn't curry favor with wine is
... curry. But there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curries are OK if they're matched with something sweet,'' says
La Reserve's Mohr, mentioning Vouvray, the often off-dry French
chenin blanc. ``But watch out _ curries can cover up the wine if
they are too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenin blanc is Mitchell's choice for curries, too, as is
gewurztraminer. Ruppe opts for riesling or sauvignon blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Keating named one food that seems so obvious, yet mention is
rarely made of it in connection with wine: eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard-cooked eggs fight with wine because of their sulfur
content. But if the dish has egg yolks mixed in, then maybe a
chardonnay or white burgundy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dessert souffles are based on eggs, of course, and can be quite
sweet. Cox says he usually avoids serving wines with very sweet
desserts. ``We tend to go with cordials, liqueurs or cognac rather
than sweet dessert wines.''
</P>
<P>
   Caviar is a dish that is popularly associated with champagne.
Yet many wine-and-food buffs say the saltiness of the fish roe can
make champagne taste metallic. Options: ice-cold vodka or ice-cold
beer.
</P>
<P>
   While Keating advises against pairing shellfish and cheese, he
also says that cheese and champagne don't work together. ``And I
have generally stayed away from chocolate and champagne, but the
more I travel, the more I could make a case for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate appears to light the furnace with chefs when it comes
to matching it with wine. ``Champagne works better with fruit than
it does with chocolate,'' says Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Ruppe minces no words. ``One of the worst combinations is
chocolate with a sauternes or a late-harvest riesling (very sweet
dessert wines) _ it'll jar the teeth right out of your mouth. Port
is better with chocolate, but a dry red wine is dangerous unless
you have the right red wine and the right chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pope says that ``people love chocolate with cabernet,''
Del Grande says he prefers chocolate with ... coffee. ``It's a
great combination!''
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford truffles, you can afford to try any kind of
wine with them. But watch out, say those who work with them _ and
wine _ on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the truffles are real perfumey, wine doesn't work that
well,'' says Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truffles are a hard match with wine,'' says Cox. ``You have to
be very careful not to overpower the truffle flavor, because the
truffle is a flavor in itself. You don't want the two to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another strong flavor is blue cheese, and it elicits strong
reactions from chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue cheese is tough,'' says Del Grande. ``Be careful: The
harsh flavor can stay on your palate for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating votes the same ticket. ``Steer clear of dishes at the
start of a meal that have an intense blue cheese, because then your
palate's history. Wine? What wine?''
</P>

   In the world of music videos, stylists used to be anonymous
entities _ when they existed at all. As music videos become an
integral part of an artist's marketing message, the music-video
stylist has assumed an ascendant position, helping to craft the
public image that will sell those records and inspire fans all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might see a fashion look from the video shoot incorporated
for the CD,'' says Mike Fish, fashion marketing director of Spin
magazine. He points to the white fashion theme in the Backstreet
Boys video ``I Want It That Way'' that was then carried over into
the ``Millennium'' record.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos are ``an artistic marketing endeavor,'' Fish says.
So much so, he adds, that ``you will hear a denim company say that
an artist is helping sell a particular pair of overalls'' when it's
seen by fans in the artist's video.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Wilbekin, editor of Vibe magazine, says stylists ``know
what's hot on the street and what's hot in Paris and Milan, and
they're able to translate the images for the artists _ whether it's
sexy or fun or thuggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is a primary forum for the work of stylists. Wilbekin
says that ``esthetics are so important to hip-hop that artists have
put a lot of money into marketing their image. It's a cultural
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Blevins, fashion editor of Rolling Stone, concurs. ``Music
artists have realized that they have to look so good in these music
videos, and they've got to wear the latest Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. The
audience is looking up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fish points to Gavin Rossdale of Bush and his penchant for
wearing contemporary designers like Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men would look to him for style direction,'' he says.
And pop sensation Ricky Martin has become ``the poster child for
Giorgio Armani. He makes the clothes come alive,'' Fish adds.
</P>
<P>
   The current interest in music videos is such that MTV actually
has a behind-the-scenes show called ``Making the Video,'' which has
featured Jennifer Lopez, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Puff Daddy, with
future shows scheduled on Sugar Ray, Garbage and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the video-styling realm, street fashion coexists with
designer couture and custom designs. Vintage pieces are the icing
on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lieberman, 31, who has worked in videos for
singer/actress Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Everlast, Wyclef Jean
and Pras, says the starting point for any video stylist is the
director's treatment. But that only goes so far, adds Lieberman:
``The bigger the artist, the less the director can say about their
image. Jennifer (Lopez) has a clear idea of what her image is, but
by the same token they (artists) would never be able to do it
without us. A stylist acts as the artist's eyes and ears and
differentiates what Jennifer's going to wear from what Foxy Brown
would wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman describes Lopez's look as ``high-fashion, sexy couture
infused with a little bit of street.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lopez favors such sexy, top-drawer designers as Versace,
Gucci and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with Donatella. We also work with Prada.
Everybody wants to dress her,'' Lieberman adds.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman shops designer lines for clothes, she also works
on custom looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work a lot with Puffy and the majority of his stuff is
custom,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend these days is adaptability,'' says Lieberman, using
Everlast as an example. Musically, she says, ``he's hip-hop, he's
funk, he's blues, he's rock, so we'll take the fly Gucci leather
jacket with some Enyce or Polo black jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Style-wise Everlast ``is pretty much straight-up street _ a
little bit of white trash and a little bit of hip-hop. We used a
lot of Triple Five Soul, Ecko Unlimited, Structure. It's raw, it's
spiritual, it's deep and it's street,'' Lieberman says.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasizes that ``the most important thing with my artists
is we don't like to look like we're trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The average budget on Lieberman's jobs has been between $10,000
and $20,000 but have been as high as $35,000 to $40,000 for the
``Puffy level.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets have risen, she says, because ``everybody in R&AMP;B wants
to be in fur and leather and jewels, and that costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   June Ambrose, 28, is another top stylist in the music video
field who works with Puff Daddy. She's also part of the triumvirate
known as the Mode Squad (pronounced like the old TV series) that
includes Roger McKenzie, 29, and Andrew Caesar, 27. Their resume of
music videos reads like a roster of the top hip-hop and R&AMP;B acts:
R. Kelly, Missy Elliot, Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Busta Rhymes and
Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for an interview, Ambrose is the picture of high-fashion
chic. She wears a Gucci jeans-jacket and boots with her skirt and
finishes off her look with a pink pashmina scarf and Fendi baguette
bag. She started styling about nine years ago, ``when artists only
wanted to wear black, brown and gray,'' she says. ``I put Jay-Z
into his first Armani suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash-forward to 1999 for the Hype Williams-directed video
``Something Wet'' with Busta Rhymes and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was for Busta to look like a terminator,'' Ambrose
says. ``We used silver mylar that looks like chrome. I was inspired
by Thierry Mugler and science-fiction magazines. The dancers were
supposed to look like raindrops or amoebas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose says that ``because we spend so much money on it, the
music video has incorporated many film elements.'' She cited
Japanese animation as an important influence. ``Music videos should
take you out of reality,'' she maintains. ``I always tell my
clients, `It's not about you; you're playing a part. When you go
home you can be yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mode Squad often uses designs from Ralph Lauren,
Prada, Versace, Armani, Gucci and Gaultier, it is increasingly
doing more custom looks for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to deliver something to my clients that's not been seen
before _ we're sketching and creating it from the core. We can
easily pull Versace and Gucci, but just being a high-fashion
stylist is boring. With Hype Williams, we work on the evolution of
hip-hop fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose and the Mode Squad, because of their high-profile work
and success rate, have been instrumental in turning stying into a
real profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with music videos that have an $80,000 clothing
budget. It's a lot of pressure for the stylist because you
basically have to deliver a marketing tool to the record company,''
Ambrose says. ``Styling has become a newfound phenomenon. We're not
just personal shoppers; it's artist development.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylist John Baptiste, 28, is the fashion editor for XXL
magazine and has his own company called Baptised Inc. He used to
work for record labels Sony, Motown and RCA doing radio promotion,
and has styled videos for Wu-Tang Clan and SWV.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black Sean John jeans-jacket, denim RLX snowboarding
pants and an Avirex watch, he radiates a street vibe _ which
translates into his styling choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use clothing, I avoid the big labels,'' he says,
because, ultimately, he's more concerned with communicating the
concept of the video. His budgets have ranged from $400 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wu-Tang video, the look was inspired by the film ``The
Matrix,'' which Baptiste saw four times. He had just four days to
create the padded leather costumes with set-in muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan native Wendy Schecter, 35, has been a stylist for 15
years. ``I had been picking out people's clothes since I was 8 and
I found out at 19 that I could get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first video was Debbie Gibson's ``Only in My Dreams,'' after
which she spent two years doing low-budget hip-hop videos. Her last
video was for Luscious Jackson, which was directed by filmmaker
Tamara Davis (``Gun Crazy''). She has also styled videos for Sting
and Santana and was responsible for Courtney Love's dramatic
high-fashion makeover when she showed up at the Academy Awards in a
white Versace gown.
</P>
<P>
   Schecter approaches each artist and each situation differently.
For Santana, Schecter says, ``Carlos had these beautiful jackets
from the '40s and we put together looks around them.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that ``people that wind up becoming celebs _
there's something about them, there's a spark. I like to find that
spark and develop it into something magnificent and personal or the
thing they didn't know they wanted yet. It's me helping them flesh
out their fantasy; it's the objective eye helping them realize
their vision.''

   ``You might see a fashion look from the video shoot incorporated
for the CD,'' says Mike Fish, fashion marketing director of Spin
magazine. He points to the white fashion theme in the Backstreet
Boys video ``I Want It That Way'' that was then carried over into
the ``Millennium'' record.
</P>
<P>
   Music videos are ``an artistic marketing endeavor,'' Fish says.
So much so, he adds, that ``you will hear a denim company say that
an artist is helping sell a particular pair of overalls'' when it's
seen by fans in the artist's video.
</P>
<P>
   Emil Wilbekin, editor of Vibe magazine, says stylists ``know
what's hot on the street and what's hot in Paris and Milan, and
they're able to translate the images for the artists _ whether it's
sexy or fun or thuggish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop is a primary forum for the work of stylists. Wilbekin
says that ``esthetics are so important to hip-hop that artists have
put a lot of money into marketing their image. It's a cultural
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Blevins, fashion editor of Rolling Stone, concurs. ``Music
artists have realized that they have to look so good in these music
videos, and they've got to wear the latest Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. The
audience is looking up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fish points to Gavin Rossdale of Bush and his penchant for
wearing contemporary designers like Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young men would look to him for style direction,'' he says.
And pop sensation Ricky Martin has become ``the poster child for
Giorgio Armani. He makes the clothes come alive,'' Fish adds.
</P>
<P>
   The current interest in music videos is such that MTV actually
has a behind-the-scenes show called ``Making the Video,'' which has
featured Jennifer Lopez, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Puff Daddy, with
future shows scheduled on Sugar Ray, Garbage and Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the video-styling realm, street fashion coexists with
designer couture and custom designs. Vintage pieces are the icing
on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lieberman, 31, who has worked in videos for
singer/actress Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Everlast, Wyclef Jean
and Pras, says the starting point for any video stylist is the
director's treatment. But that only goes so far, adds Lieberman:
``The bigger the artist, the less the director can say about their
image. Jennifer (Lopez) has a clear idea of what her image is, but
by the same token they (artists) would never be able to do it
without us. A stylist acts as the artist's eyes and ears and
differentiates what Jennifer's going to wear from what Foxy Brown
would wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman describes Lopez's look as ``high-fashion, sexy couture
infused with a little bit of street.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lopez favors such sexy, top-drawer designers as Versace,
Gucci and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very closely with Donatella. We also work with Prada.
Everybody wants to dress her,'' Lieberman adds.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman shops designer lines for clothes, she also works
on custom looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work a lot with Puffy and the majority of his stuff is
custom,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend these days is adaptability,'' says Lieberman, using
Everlast as an example. Musically, she says, ``he's hip-hop, he's
funk, he's blues, he's rock, so we'll take the fly Gucci leather
jacket with some Enyce or Polo black jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   Style-wise Everlast ``is pretty much straight-up street _ a
little bit of white trash and a little bit of hip-hop. We used a
lot of Triple Five Soul, Ecko Unlimited, Structure. It's raw, it's
spiritual, it's deep and it's street,'' Lieberman says.
</P>
<P>
   She emphasizes that ``the most important thing with my artists
is we don't like to look like we're trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The average budget on Lieberman's jobs has been between $10,000
and $20,000 but have been as high as $35,000 to $40,000 for the
``Puffy level.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets have risen, she says, because ``everybody in R&AMP;B wants
to be in fur and leather and jewels, and that costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   June Ambrose, 28, is another top stylist in the music video
field who works with Puff Daddy. She's also part of the triumvirate
known as the Mode Squad (pronounced like the old TV series) that
includes Roger McKenzie, 29, and Andrew Caesar, 27. Their resume of
music videos reads like a roster of the top hip-hop and R&AMP;B acts:
R. Kelly, Missy Elliot, Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Busta Rhymes and
Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for an interview, Ambrose is the picture of high-fashion
chic. She wears a Gucci jeans-jacket and boots with her skirt and
finishes off her look with a pink pashmina scarf and Fendi baguette
bag. She started styling about nine years ago, ``when artists only
wanted to wear black, brown and gray,'' she says. ``I put Jay-Z
into his first Armani suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash-forward to 1999 for the Hype Williams-directed video
``Something Wet'' with Busta Rhymes and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was for Busta to look like a terminator,'' Ambrose
says. ``We used silver mylar that looks like chrome. I was inspired
by Thierry Mugler and science-fiction magazines. The dancers were
supposed to look like raindrops or amoebas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose says that ``because we spend so much money on it, the
music video has incorporated many film elements.'' She cited
Japanese animation as an important influence. ``Music videos should
take you out of reality,'' she maintains. ``I always tell my
clients, `It's not about you; you're playing a part. When you go
home you can be yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the Mode Squad often uses designs from Ralph Lauren,
Prada, Versace, Armani, Gucci and Gaultier, it is increasingly
doing more custom looks for its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to deliver something to my clients that's not been seen
before _ we're sketching and creating it from the core. We can
easily pull Versace and Gucci, but just being a high-fashion
stylist is boring. With Hype Williams, we work on the evolution of
hip-hop fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose and the Mode Squad, because of their high-profile work
and success rate, have been instrumental in turning stying into a
real profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with music videos that have an $80,000 clothing
budget. It's a lot of pressure for the stylist because you
basically have to deliver a marketing tool to the record company,''
Ambrose says. ``Styling has become a newfound phenomenon. We're not
just personal shoppers; it's artist development.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylist John Baptiste, 28, is the fashion editor for XXL
magazine and has his own company called Baptised Inc. He used to
work for record labels Sony, Motown and RCA doing radio promotion,
and has styled videos for Wu-Tang Clan and SWV.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black Sean John jeans-jacket, denim RLX snowboarding
pants and an Avirex watch, he radiates a street vibe _ which
translates into his styling choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use clothing, I avoid the big labels,'' he says,
because, ultimately, he's more concerned with communicating the
concept of the video. His budgets have ranged from $400 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the Wu-Tang video, the look was inspired by the film ``The
Matrix,'' which Baptiste saw four times. He had just four days to
create the padded leather costumes with set-in muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan native Wendy Schecter, 35, has been a stylist for 15
years. ``I had been picking out people's clothes since I was 8 and
I found out at 19 that I could get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first video was Debbie Gibson's ``Only in My Dreams,'' after
which she spent two years doing low-budget hip-hop videos. Her last
video was for Luscious Jackson, which was directed by filmmaker
Tamara Davis (``Gun Crazy''). She has also styled videos for Sting
and Santana and was responsible for Courtney Love's dramatic
high-fashion makeover when she showed up at the Academy Awards in a
white Versace gown.
</P>
<P>
   Schecter approaches each artist and each situation differently.
For Santana, Schecter says, ``Carlos had these beautiful jackets
from the '40s and we put together looks around them.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that ``people that wind up becoming celebs _
there's something about them, there's a spark. I like to find that
spark and develop it into something magnificent and personal or the
thing they didn't know they wanted yet. It's me helping them flesh
out their fantasy; it's the objective eye helping them realize
their vision.''

   Ali MacGraw is stepping into a new role: accessories designer.
And while that may seem like a stretch for someone who achieved
movie-star status for roles in such classic films as ``Love Story''
and ``Goodbye Columbus,'' the actress actually spent the first six
years after college working in the fashion industry _ first, as
Diana Vreeland's assistant at Harper's Bazaar, and later as a
stylist to the fashion photographer Melvin Sokolsky.
</P>
<P>
   Her collection of luxurious handbags and pashmina shawls shows
that she hasn't forgotten what she learned then. The pieces feature
traditional Indian designs in strong colors, from rich fuchsias and
bonfire reds to vibrant aquas and warm greens, and many of the
looks are inspired by her passion for exotic travel.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw got involved in this venture in much the same way she
got her start in acting--by chance. Back in the '60s, an agent
spotted her photo in a Chanel bath oil advertisement and urged her
to test for film parts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, she landed the starmaking role in the film ``Goodbye
Columbus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I became an overnight success. It was thrilling, yet
terrifying at the same time. I come from a very practical
background, and the glamour that success brought was unfamiliar to
me,'' she says. But she was a quick study, and swiftly became
Hollywood's girl-of-the-moment, marrying Robert Evans, head of
production at Paramount, and later, Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw, who's now living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, decided to
start her business after a conversation with Veena Advani, a master
embroiderer who has worked for such designers as Isaac Mizrahi and
Oscar de la Renta.
</P>
<P>
   The two became business partners, and named the company Ali
MacGraw Milagro _ milagro means miracle in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   MacGraw is quick to point out that her collection isn't intended
to be trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a slave to fashion,'' she says. ``I'm just doing what
I love. Indian textiles and designs are very hot right now, but I
will continue doing them even when the fashion world has moved to
another area of the world. I'm fascinated with the culture of India
and its sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The handbags vary in shape from soft silk shoulder-strap pouches
with tassel accents to more structured, sophisticated clutches.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is available at Jeffrey, New York; Neiman Marcus;
Browns in London, and Savannah, Santa Monica. Prices range from
$350 to $1,100 for the beaded bags and $600 to $1,200 for the
pashminas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an adventure for me,'' MacGraw says. ``And the most
important part is to enjoy the whole process of it, not just the
outcome. Even if this collection isn't a success, I know 21
girlfriends will have the best presents.''

   ACCRED: A hearing in federal district court determines whether
the state's move to unaccredit the KC School District stands. If
the district fails in its quest to block the state's action, the
district will file an appeal in Jackson County Circuit Court and
possibly other legal action. U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple could
decide he has no standing in the case because the state is no
longer a party to the desegregation case, or he could restore the
state as a defendant in the case on the grounds that a decision to
withdraw accreditation could lead to a more segregated school
district. That could force the state to compromise with the
district. Photo. Phil O'Connor and Kevin Hoffmann.

   TRAGEDY: It's been a hellacious couple of weeks for the Jackson
County Medical Examiner's office, when the bodies of seven kids _
victims of murder or abuse//neglect _ came in for examination:
Pamela Butler, killed by a stranger; an accidental drowning
attributed to neglect; two Bass boys starved to death; Jacob Dube
shot by his stepfather; and two toddlers beaten to death.
Typically, Jackson County records only 3 or 4 abuse//neglect deaths
a year, but in this one period, they dealt with five. The other
two, of course, were homicides. Trying for mugs of all victims.

   ZOO. In what was once a treeless valley outside Salina, Kan.,
self-made millionaire Charlie Walker has used a chunk of his
fortune to create the Rolling Hills Refuge Wildlife Conservation
Center, a 45-acre zoo that opened to the public last week. The
animals (rhinos, lions, white tigers, orangutans, giraffes) are
impressive, and the landscaping (more than 3,000 trees planted) has
created a prairie oasis. They expect to attract at least 150,000
visitors annually. We'll also take a look at Walker, a truck stop
operator, and what made him want to build the place. Tom Perrin.

MEXICO'S RULING PARTY CHANGES WITH THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Berlin Wall crumbled, the Soviet Union
collapsed and Mexico, too, is changing at the edge of a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   That is the comparison made by a Mexican official to
characterize the unprecedented changes in the 70-year-old
Institutional Revolutionary Party, the longest ruling party in the
world, as it heads to an unprecedented primary election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is many Mexicans are not convinced there is a new
and improved PRI, and they suspect a fixed election.
</P>
<P>
   The test will be in the turnout on Nov. 7, when voters choose
the PRI's presidential nominee from among four candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are times of change and renovation,'' said longtime
party insider Fernando Gutiirrez Barrios, in charge of overseeing
the PRI's internal revamping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the end of a millennium in which humanity believes
everything must change. The Berlin wall fell and the Soviet Union,
too,'' Gutiirrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the party was founded in 1929, the outgoing president
selected his successor after consulting with party leaders. The
practice is called dedazo, which is Spanish slang for the big
presidential finger signalling a heir.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI successor, in turn, has always beat opposition
candidates. An efficient, well-financed, mammoth PRI machinery that
reaches into all echelons of society has ensured that victory,
often through fraud and influence-peddling.
</P>
<P>
   But in times of free trade and globalization, when world opinion
counts in financial markets, the PRI this year saw the need for
change, a radical shift Mexicans have been loudly clamoring for
this past decade.
</P>
<P>
   On the initiative of President Ernesto Zedillo, the party
announced this year an open, U.S.-style primary to elect the PRI
presidential nominee to run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Of Mexico's three main parties, the PRI is the only one having
such an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1916, Mexico has moved in evolutionary fashion, rather
than a revolutionary fashion,'' said George Grayson, a professor of
government and a Mexican analyst at William and Mary College.
``While this may not be Jeffersonian democracy in its purest form,
the PRI primary represents a huge advance over the dedazo.''
</P>
<P>
   Four party veterans are running for their party's nod, but the
race has evolved into a two-man contest and many Mexicans believe
one is the choice of Zedillo, the ``official candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The man is Francisco Labastida, 57, a congenial, subdued
economist who until earlier this year was secretary of the
interior, a powerful post that usually precedes the PRI's
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is the man to beat next Sunday, and the only one with
that chance is Roberto Madrazo, the brash, 47-year-old former
governor of Tabasco state who has caused a stir within the party
because he has taken the business of the primary quite seriously,
official candidate or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madrazo has taken off like a Roman candle,'' said Grayson, who
recently concluded a study of the primary for the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However, Madrazo has had to fight the image, dissiminated by
Labastida's campaign, of being a close associate of ex-President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who left the country in economic
shambles in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he has been linked to wealthy businessman Carlos Hank
Gonzalez, who embodies the old PRI guard resistant to
democratization and market reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Grayson said even though Madrazo is running about
10 points behind Labastida in most recent polls, he could stage an
upset if there is a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The number of believers aren't high. In a recent Louis Harris
poll, only 36 percent of Mexicans said they thought the primary
would be clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I vote? I don't like any of the four candidates and
besides, it is all fixed so Labastida will win. He is the
president's man,'' said one housewife buying groceries at a
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who didn't want to be identified, nevertheless
admitted she was leaning toward Labastida because he seemed the
most honest.
</P>
<P>
   The other two candidates, former PRI leader Humberto Roque
Villanueva and former Puebla Gov. Manuel Bartlett, are seen as dark
horses. But they, too, have thrown their full effort into the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   After the newspaper Reforma reported last week that the governor
of Chiapas, Roberto Albores, urged state and local party lawmakers
to promote the vote for Labastida, Madrazo and Roque cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   And they demanded to the PRI that Labastida be disqualified from
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Not much chance of that.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said Albores was ``|sanctioned''| privately, but the
perception remains among the three candidates and much of the
public that Labastida is the president's man.
</P>
<P>
   He said about a dozen other party officials have been
``|sanctioned''| for openly promoting Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Zedillo reiterated that he had no favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not before, not during, nor in what remains of this process
have I had, will I have, a preferred candidate,'' Zedillo told
national party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is expecting at least 6.5 million to vote in the
primary. Fewer than that would be a great disappointment, Gutierrez
said.
</P>
<P>
   The question many are asking now is what will happen when
Labastida wins? Will Madrazo surrender or protest?
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts here believe Madrazo will remain within
the comforting PRI fold and work out a cushy deal for himself. Life
outside the party has not been advantageous for many of its
deserters.

<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Beefcake'' Thom Fitzgerald's documentary-and-drama
about the world of ``male physique'' magazines and films in the
1950s is odd in tone, both sweet and sour. This subterranean world
is viewed mostly through the lens of Bob Mizer, a sweet-seeming
photographer who captured the images of buff young men, naked or
near-naked, for an audience that would have to wait years for any
more openly homosexual culture to grow up. But Mizer's arrest and
trial for running a prostitution ring is also covered, adding
darker tints to the pastel nostalgia. (Unrated) (Jim Sullivan) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!!! ``Being John Malkovich'' A refreshingly original comedy
that riffs on celebrity and consumer culture and the proverbial 15
minutes of fame. John Cusack plays an impoverished puppeteer who
discovers a portal into the head of John Malkovich and starts
selling admission for 15-minute intervals. Malkovich goes along
with it all, a good sport who enhances his own cool quotient under
the direction of Spike Jonze, whose fun with the film's skewed
metaphysics posits the universe as God's own pinball machine. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Grandfather'' Slow-moving but solidly made Spanish period
piece, carried by Fernando Fernan-Gomez's magnificent old
impoverished aristocrat who still roars like a lion, especially
when he discovers that one of his beloved granddaughters wasn't
fathered by his late son. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Julien Donkey-Boy'' To Harmony Korine falls the
distinction of making America's first Dogma 95 film, in line with
the edgy back-to-basics esthetic of Denmark's New Wave. It focuses
on a family for whom dysfunction would be a step up. Sometimes the
dynamics are fascinating; sometimes their emotional nakedness makes
you squirm, especially those involving Ewen Bremner's schizophrenic
Julien. Some improvised sections fall flat, others impale you on
their raw urgency. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Music of the Heart'' The title sounds corny, but Wes Craven's
dramatization of the true story of Roberta Guaspari _ who beat both
the odds and arts-funding cuts to teach East Harlem public school
pupils how to play the violin _ is one of the few films that can
wholeheartedly be called uplifting. Meryl Streep is grittily
convincing as the determined teacher, as well she must be to occupy
the screen alongside Guaspari's real-life students. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!!! ``Princess Mononoke'' The crowning achievement of Japan's
leading animator, Hayao Miyazaki, this is a magical epic with a
reverence for nature rarely seen in Western films, animated or
otherwise. There's plenty of action in this myth of the retreat of
the forest gods before encroaching humans in medieval Japan, some
of it violent and brutal. But the grand and mystical presence of
nature as a healing force is what stays with you. The story
involves a fierce young princess who runs with the wolves, a young
warrior on a quest, and a formidable woman with a ``civilizing''
but humane agenda. (PG-13)

KEN BURNS'S `FAMILY DRAMA' ON WOMEN'S HISTORY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ As with his films, there is an easy, flowing
lyricism to the way Ken Burns speaks _ except when he wants to
underscore a point. Then his words collide in a sudden stampede.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Burns is talking fast because he has a bone to
pick with that fickle amnesiac we call posterity. He believes the
subjects of his new PBS documentary, ``Not for Ourselves Alone: The
Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony,'' are largely
unknown today, their pioneering efforts on behalf of women's rights
largely forgotten. Burns finds this inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two women led the largest social transformation in
American history _ and nobody knows about it!'' he exclaims. ``If
it were two men, there would be marble monuments in Washington with
cherry blossoms around them.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely, his interlocutor ventures, the general public is
familiar with the achievements of Anthony, at least? Burns fires
back: ``She's a failed dollar coin: That is what people know.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns is a man on a mission. Yes, he is aware of the irony
embedded in the fact that he and coproducer Paul Barnes are men
whose mission is to reclaim from semi-obscurity two women who shook
the very ground of 19th-century America by creating the women's
rights movement, leading it for a half-century, and paving the way
for women's suffrage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Burns insists on the universality of this story _ which he
calls ``history running on all cylinders, as important and dramatic
as the Battle of Gettysburg'' _ and contends that it transcends the
gender of the teller. ``We all share this past in common,'' he
says. ``This is a family drama. It does not feel separate to me in
that way. . . . I am sure that I will get something wrong, and the
mistakes we made we will take full credit for, whatever they are,
but I don't think they are gender-related.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, takes a breath, finishes: ``You know, this is just a
good story.''
</P>
<P>
   That it is. Today, in what Burns calls our ``post-feminist media
culture,'' it's become fashionable to take for granted the gains
won by the women's rights movement. But ``Not For Ourselves Alone''
is an eye-opening reminder of the way things were, a memory map
leading us back to the world Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.
Anthony struggled to change.
</P>
<P>
   `Cult of true womanhood'
</P>
<P>
   When they first met, in 1851, women did not have the right to
vote or to own property in America. They could not testify in
court. They were usually denied custody of their children if they
divorced. The notion of equal pay for equal work did not exist.
Until a few years earlier, women had been prohibited from attending
college, and even if they become one of the very few to graduate
from college, they were expected to fulfill only submissively
domestic roles, as dictated by the ``cult of true womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton and Anthony began to change all that. They forged a deep
friendship and partnership that survived innumerable obstacles and
setbacks _ not to mention their radical differences in background,
demeanor, and lifestyle. Stanton was born in Jonestown, N.Y., to a
wealthy family; she possessed a native ebullience and an outgoing
personality, and bore seven children during a lengthy marriage.
Anthony was the child of financially struggling Quakers in Adams,
Mass.; she was driven by an unwavering intensity of purpose that
made scant room for a personal life, and never married.
</P>
<P>
   But together, they were political dynamite. Stanton was a writer
and theorist of great power and eloquence _ ``She writes as well as
Emerson,'' maintains Burns _ while Anthony was a tireless lobbyist
and campaigner who traveled incessantly from town to town on behalf
of women's suffrage. They came to believe that the right to vote
was the cornerstone from which all other women's rights would flow,
so they talked, wrote, agitated, and strategized ceaselessly toward
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need them both; we all need them both, not just women.
They're great characters in American history,'' says Burns. ``You
can't have Jefferson without Hamilton. They are both aspects of the
same Washingtonian genius. These two women come and provide us with
what we all needed to get this work done.''
</P>
<P>
   However, neither would live to see the fruits of their lifelong
labors. Stanton died in 1902, at 86, Anthony four years later, also
at 86. It was not until 1919 that Congress passed a constitutional
amendment _ lifted verbatim from the one drafted in the 1870s by
Stanton and Anthony _ that granted women the right to vote. The
next year, in 1920, the 19th Amendment was ratified, and that year,
more than 8 million women went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The seed for ``Not For Ourselves Alone'' was planted in 1988,
when Burns was working on the television documentary that would win
him national fame, ``The Civil War,'' with Barnes as his editor.
``Paul was reading this great book, a biography of Stanton, and
every day at lunch he is telling me: `This is a great story,' ''
recalls Burns. Initially, they planned to make a film about just
Stanton, but then concluded that the friendship between her and
Anthony was so rich and important that the film should focus on
both of them.
</P>
<P>
   A national viewing event
</P>
<P>
   As with previous Burns documentaries like ``The Civil War''
(1990) and ``Baseball'' (1994), ``Not For Ourselves Alone'' has the
potential to become a national viewing event that refocuses our
attention on an essential part of our history. Already, it has been
embraced by women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been urging their memberships to do viewing
parties,'' Burns says proudly. ``What has been happening in the
last couple of months is that we have been hearing that this is
happening all across the country: Women are getting their
daughters, their mothers, their husbands, their sons, and they are
going to watch it on the 7th and 8th with everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's recapitulating a lot of that enthusiasm when `The Civil
War' came out, which was a surprise, when conventions would stop
their evening programs so everybody could go back to their hotel to
watch `The Civil War.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the nine years since he created a genteel sensation with
``The Civil War,'' Burns has produced one epic documentary after
another to tell more parts of the story of America. They include
the 18-hour masterpiece ``Baseball'' (Burns promises that ``When
the Sox win the World Series, I will do the last episode'' of
``Baseball''); ``Thomas Jefferson'' and ``Lewis and Clark: The
Journey of the Corps of Discovery,'' both in 1997; and last year's
``Frank Lloyd Wright.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary style Burns first employed on 1982's ``Brooklyn
Bridge'' _ involving the copious use of archival photographs, a
gallery of expert talking heads, and a narrative approach to
history _ today is imitated not just on his home territory of PBS
but also on The History Channel and the A&AMP;E channel. Many young
documentarians _ including Burns's brother, Ric _ have gotten their
start at Florentine Films, Burns's production company based in
Walpole, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Burns has created an intellectual empire so vast that
historian Stephen Ambrose has said: ``More Americans get their
history from Ken Burns than any other source.'' An unusual
achievement for a filmmaker who as a young man dreamed of being the
next John Ford or Alfred Hitchcock, and who to this day insists
that ``I don't have any credentials in history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still a filmmaker, not a historian,'' says Burns. ``I
choose history the way Cezanne chose oil as opposed to watercolors.
It's just a place to practice my art and craft.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the acclaim for Burns have come some brickbats,
principally from critics who have mocked his style _ with its
mandolin music and sonorous narration _ as self-indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am what I am,'' replies Burns. ``I have developed my own way
of asking questions of history, and in my own way I am solving the
problems that those questions raise. . . . I am sure there's an
element of truth to it, . . . but I can't be somebody that I am
not. . . . There are lots of rhythms in life and in nature; there
are fast rhythms and there are slow rhythms, and whatever cadence I
have found is my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Loss and melancholy
</P>
<P>
   When it is suggested there is an undertow of melancholy in his
films, Burns does not dispute it. He points to a deeply personal
reason that only recently became apparent to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's part of my psychology,'' he says. ``I think that
all of it, as Stanton points out, is about loss. My mother died
when I was 11 years old. I recently realized that, to some extent,
I was keeping her alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The lingering effect of his mother's death revealed itself in a
conversation with a friend. According to Burns, the friend said to
him: `` `What do you think you do for a living?' I said, `What do
you mean?' And he said, `Well, you wake the dead. Who do you think
you are really trying to get back? You make Thomas Jefferson,
Abraham Lincoln, and Jackie Robinson real for us _ but who do you
think you really want to get back?' And I started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly realized that at the heart of this may be a
melancholy, but if you see the films, they are also about joy and
the human spirit. There is not a film that I have made that has not
had an aspect of a higher purpose to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrators and commentators of ``Not For Ourselves Alone''
are women, and Burns and Barnes relied on an all-female advisory
board. Burns says he was not averse to showcasing a male historian
as one of the film's talking heads, but he found that men
specializing in women's history are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Burns believes ``history is not really about the
past,'' but rather about ``the present-day consideration of what
went before us,'' he is clearly hoping many young women will be
inspired by ``Not For Ourselves Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, basically we live in the culture of `Victoria's
Secret,' '' he says. ``Women are being pushed and strangled and
cajoled into a kind of acquiescence to some of the demands now. We
don't have an Equal Rights Amendment! I am the father of two
daughters, and they still make certain choices because they are
women, and I want them to see this film and go, `Wow, I don't have
to make that decision not to do something.' That's very important.
Very important.''

`INSIDER': SELLING A JOURNALISM DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lowell Bergman isn't exactly a movie buff. He doesn't go to many
films, and he walks out on a high percentage of those he does
catch. But he gives a hearty thumbs-up to ``The Insider,'' Disney's
much-hyped tale of tobacco-industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand
and the tortuous battle to get ``60 Minutes'' to air the interview
that cost him his family, his bank account, and nearly his sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat through it. I didn't get restless,'' Bergman says. ``And
it wasn't just because Al Pacino was playing me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the ``60 Minutes'' producer who fights to get a reluctant CBS
to air Wigand's devastating indictment of the tobacco industry,
Bergman is a major protagonist in a movie that could be named ``The
Insider'' for another reason. It has the media elite's insular
fraternity in a tizzy. The buildup to the film's Friday opening has
consisted of grumbling by ``60 Minutes'' star Mike Wallace and
executive producer Don Hewitt _ who are depicted as initially
caving into corporate pressure to spike the Wigand interview _ that
Disney (which owns rival network ABC) did a hatchet job on their
reputations. As the movie makes clear, the Wigand interview finally
ran on ``60 Minutes'' in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a great story. It's not a true story,'' says Betsy
West, CBS vice president for prime-time news.
</P>
<P>
   Says Wigand: ``The fidelity to actual facts is exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA, Page C8 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid the early buzz about possible Oscar nominations, The
Washington Post declared that ``The Insider'' could spark a ``war
between giant corporate mega-powers'' CBS and Disney. The New York
Times's Frank Rich called it ``the most high-profile screen account
of big-time brand-name journalism since `All the President's Men.'
'' The current Time magazine devotes an astounding five pages to
the ``Insider'' versus ``60 Minutes'' controversy. And Monday the
prestigious Columbia Journalism School hosted a discussion, with
Bergman as one of the panelists, on the topic ``Hollywood and
Journalism: Uneasy Partners?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' is an ambitious Hollywood effort to examine
journalism. ``The issue of the censorship of television news is
being presented to a mass audience,'' says Bergman, who now teaches
at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It's not in a
journalism review or alternative publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Media scrutiny mixed
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the rub. When the big screen has tried to
scrutinize the morals and methods of its media bretheren, the
results have been decidedly mixed. Some films, like ``The Front
Page'' (1931) or ``Network'' (1976), are classics. Others, like
``The Killing Fields'' (1984) and ``Quiz Show'' (1994), win
critical acclaim but don't connect with a broad audience. And some,
like ``Absence of Malice'' (1981) or ``The Mean Season'' (1985),
fade into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hollywood history suggests that the intelligent and
stylish ``Insider'' will have to overcome a daunting pattern: The
more excited the journalistic community gets about a movie, the
less likely the public is to flock to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these things do well,'' says media and cultural critic
Jon Katz of such films. ``This movie is really about a conflict
between a producer and a TV show. It's one of those classic media
brawls that media critics have an orgasm over. But the public
doesn't give a hoot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're intrinsically fascinating in the media,''
adds West, speaking of journalists. ``But we do get involved in
some fascinating stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' directed by Michael Mann (``Heat,'' ``The Last
of the Mohicans''), does have something of a traditional white
hat/black hat tale to tell. Pacino's Bergman is a fiery bastion of
journalistic integrity teaming up with the brave and battered
Russell Crowe (as Wigand) to challenge both the tobacco industry's
efforts to silence Wigand and the amorality of CBS bean-counters
who don't want to risk tobacco's wrath by giving Wigand his say.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I don't think it's just about journalism,'' says
Wigand, who now runs the Smoke-Free Kids foundation in South
Carolina and who was recovering from an auto accident this past
week. ``If you look at this, you walk away (thinking) here is big
tobacco trying to intimidate. . . . They go after individuals to
keep the truth from coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume (moviegoers) are going to identify with Russell Crowe
because I think he does such a complex job of presenting an average
American,'' adds Bergman. ``Average people are the heroes in our
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that such popular TV shows as ``Law and Order'' often
feature stories of courageous witnesses who are cultivated and then
hung out to dry by the authorities, Slate magazine film critic
David Edelstein says, ``I think Americans will definitely respond
to the idea of a whistleblower who's co-opted by media forces who
ultimately don't stand by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edelstein also sees ``The Insider'' as ``a big unwieldy
piece of work,'' one that injects confusing issues _ including
journalistic ethics _ into the melodrama. And many observers say
that the movie and media cultures don't mix well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists are from Pluto and Hollywood producers are from
Jupiter,'' says media analyst Tom Rosenstiel, explaining that
journalists are paid to haggle over details while filmmakers favor
sweeping morality plays.
</P>
<P>
   Often, as in the case of films like ``The Killing Fields'' and
1982's ``The Year of Living Dangerously,'' journalism is just a
backdrop to a gripping adventure tale. As Edelstein notes, ``it's
like no one gave a damn'' about New York Times correspondent
``Sydney Schanberg's dark night of the soul in `The Killing
Fields.' All they cared about was (his loyal assistant) Dith Pran
getting out'' of the bloody nightmare that was Cambodia in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' not only eschews such dramatic plotlines. It
tackles the tricky task of providing a bird's-eye view of the
journalistic sausage factory, with lots of attention to TV editing
sessions, reportorial tricks, strategic leaks, and confidentiality
agreements. Though ``All the President's Men'' managed to make
old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting watchable, Wayne State
University film studies instructor Richard Ness wonders ``how you
get people excited about watching guys taking notes and going
through library cards? (You need) a balance of commercial appeal
and journalistic ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Inherent risk
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when the public holds a distinctly jaundiced view
of media behavior, any film that examines journalistic morality as
closely as ``The Insider'' is inherently risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the popular legal fiction of a John Grisham, Hollywood
treatments of media ethics ought, at best, be seen as a rousing
impetus to go out and read the print sources that contain the
broader, more nuanced story,'' says University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign instructor Robert Baird, an expert on the movies'
treatment of the media.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting, however, that those print sources _ such as
the American Journalism Review and the Columbia Journalism Review _
appeal to niche groups that are tiny slivers of the mass audience
that most movies aim for.
</P>
<P>
   When these media observers cite their own choices for the best
journalism films, a common theme emerges. The ``Front Page'' remake
``His Girl Friday'' (1940), with its near-farcical depiction of
cynical and clubby journalists, ``had reporters' numbers way back
when,'' says Edelstein. Ness, who has written a book cataloguing
almost 2,200 films in ``which journalists influence the plot,''
loves ``Ace in the Hole.'' That dark 1951 drama, in which a
sensation-seeking reporter delays the rescue of a man trapped in a
cave in order to milk the story, foreshadowed today's tabloid
culture. And Katz mentions ``Network'' and ``Broadcast News''
(1987), two films that viciously skewered television and ``captured
the loss of values in the media . . . not the inner workings of the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, it didn't matter so much whether the journalists
were good guys or bad guys just as long as they _ and their
profession _ were drawn broadly enough to connect viscerally with
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ness says movies have traditionally sent ``a mixed message about
the profession.'' He cites Kirk Douglas's role as the slimy
reporter in ``Ace in the Hole,'' alongside Humphrey Bogart's
portrayal of a courageous crusading editor in 1952's ``Deadline
USA,'' as examples of how two contemporaneous films could feature
such divergent takes on journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Relating to the press
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether movies about journalism are successful or not tends to
correlate with how people relate to the press,'' says Rosenstiel.
``The height of depicting the press as heroic came in the '70s. By
the '80s or '90s, the journalists don't have lines. They're not
people, . . . they're wires and cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not one of those times, Rosenstiel adds, when people
feel good about the media. Thus it makes sense that in the '70s,
``All the President's Men'' cast superstars Robert Redford and
Dustin Hoffman as heroic Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein _ while in 1999, the surprise comedy hit ``Dick''
lampooned Woodward and Bernstein as bickering, egomaniacal
bumblers.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how the public will feel about the media after
``The Insider'' is as complex as the movie itself. In it, CBS
corporate types give journalism a bad name, Wallace comes off as a
complicated if laughably pompous character, and the self-conscious
crowing at ``60 Minutes'' about its reputation and standards may
tarnish some of the program's luster. Other characters _ like a New
York Times reporter who has a Pacino leak fall into his hands, or a
Wall Street Journal editor who can't figure out whether to do a
hatchet job or puff piece on Wigand _ are likely to trigger
ambivalent responses.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the movie has to hope its fate is tied not to those
players, but to the viewers' gut reaction to the Pacino and Crowe
team and their faceoff with the tobacco industry. If that comes
across as the defining story line, ``The Insider'' could catch
fire. If the film plays as a journey to the netherworld of big
media machinations, it could be a dim memory by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big-time coastal media is the most narcissistic culture on
earth,'' says Katz. And the new movie ``is essentially about the
internal workings of a big TV show. In my mind, that dooms it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say what it will do to other people,'' says Wigand.
``For me, it is an intense emotional experience. It keeps you on
the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 31 minutes.''

THE TRUTHS ARE STILL SURFACING ABOUT STUART CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps never before in his career has former Boston police
commissioner Francis ``Mickey'' Roache come under such heavy media
criticism as he is now enduring over charges that he recently
``revised'' the history of the Carol DiMaiti Stuart murder case.
</P>
<P>
   But a rediscovered tape recording, made during one of his
appearances before a youth group in January 1992, proves that
Roache is not changing his tune now, just to help himself win a
third term on the City Council. The tape shows that eight years ago
he said, for all to hear, that Willie Bennett was never a prime
suspect in the Stuart murder _ just as he is saying now.
</P>
<P>
   Roache recently generated considerable attention when, on the
10th anniversary of the case, he told the Globe's Peter Canellos
that, in the days after the murder, law enforcement officials knew
that Bennett was probaby not the man who shot the Stuarts while
they sat in their car on a street in the Mission Hill neighborhood
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, an African-American known to have a criminal record,
was never in danger of being indicted, Roache said in an interview
published Oct. 20. In fact, he said, the investigation ``was going
the other way'' _ even as officials let Bennett's name be floated
publicly as the probable or possible shooter, and as then-District
Attorney Newman Flanagan ordered Bennett's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the Globe's article appeared, Roache
came under a barrage of criticism from the media and others.
Questions were raised as to why he came forward with this view of
Bennett only two weeks before the City Council election.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign aide, Brian Wallace, said Roache gave the interview
only because he promised to give it on the 10th anniversary after
refusing a request for an interview on the fifth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the importance of Roache's comments, recall the
events of fall 1989. A shocked city heard and read media reports of
a wounded Charles Stuart telling police that a black man shot and
killed his wife, and wounded him, as they were driving home from a
childbirth class at a nearby hospital. The case dominated the news,
as police searched the city's black neighborhoods for the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was arrested by Flanagan's office on warrants unrelated
to the Stuart case. He stopped being a suspect only after Charles
Stuart's brother came forward to present evidence that Stuart
actually murdered his wife and wounded himself. Stuart then
apparently committed suicide, plunging to his death from a bridge
over the Mystic River.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than be self-serving, Roache's recent remarks merely
reflect what he said to a 1992 event called ``Rap With The Top
Cop'' forum attended by some 400 youths, most of them
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Donahue, who keeps hundreds of events he recorded during
his days as a sound engineer for the mayor's Office of Business and
Cultural Development, found the 1992 tape, which contains the
comments plus a few others regarding the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Youths attending the forum at the UMass-Boston gymnasium asked
Roache _ who was police commissioner during the Stuart case _ about
it. He responded: ``If you remember, I didn't make any comments
about that arrest in 1989, because the DA was running the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I felt that Willie Bennett was not in jeopardy of
being indicted or being arrested for the murder. The warrants
served on Bennett were for unrelated crimes,'' Roache continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our homicide unit was ordered (by Flanagan, he said later) to
go out to Mission Hill and several other locations to serve a
warrant. I knew that day there would be a perception that Willie
Bennett would be viewed as the possible person involved. We did not
want to serve those warrants. We knew Willie Bennett was not
involved. But you will never know that, won't believe that, until
20 years from now, when somebody has the guts and courage to write
the real story.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Roache said Flanagan had the
authority under general statutes to take over the Boston Police
Department's homicide unit. William Celester, a deputy
superintendent at the time, and an African-American, confirmed that
the DA's office took control of the unit and sent the detectives to
issue warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Roache also told the youth forum that, during the height of the
case, he followed up on reports that police were breaking down the
doors of blacks' homes, particularly in Mission Hill, in search of
Bennett. Roache said he told the city's corporation counsel to call
Doris Bunte, then head of the Boston Housing Authority, to ``check
the damage'' in the Mission Hill public housing development.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what the response was? You've all been led to believe
hundreds of doors broken down, windows. Anybody want to guess how
many doors broken, how many windows broken? None. Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roache told the forum eight years ago, he was afraid that
riots would break out during the case, because of the way the black
community was targeted. ``I ran out of the office and spent the
entire day and entire evening in Mission Hill,'' he said, ``knowing
that this city was in trouble.'' He credited African-American
community leaders such as Don Muhammad for helping to prevent the
city from exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Roache acknowledged Friday that ``we, as police, were extremely
aggressive in the Mission Hill area that night, particularly in the
initial investigation, because we were trying to obtain information
to find the assailant.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The African-American community suffered and felt a
lot of pain because they were being painted as the group that may
be involved in that horrible, horrible crime. I had no control over
that. I hope that will never happen again in a million years.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis ``Mickey'' Roache has been consistently honest with a
case that began 10 years ago in brutal dishonesty.

NAMING THE PERIODIC TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did they come up with the names of the elements on the
periodic table?
</P>
<P>
   P.B., Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The rule for naming elements is simple. You find it, you name
it, with the approval of the International Union of Physical and
Applied Chemistry. Just don't name it after yourself. That's
considered tacky.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be an Einstein to figure out where they got
the name for Einsteinium. Several more of the recently discovered
elements honor famous scientists. There's Glenn SEABORG-ium, Neils
BOHR-ium, Enrico FERMI-um, Alfred NOBEL-ium, Pierre and Marie
CURI-um, and perhaps most notably, Dmitri Ivanovich MENDELEYEV-ium.
</P>
<P>
   Russian chemist Mendeleyev and German physicist Julius Lothar
Meyer recognized that certain properties of elements occur in
patterns. Element 2, Helium, for example, is similar in chemical
behavior to Neon (10), Argon (18), Krytpon (36), Xenon (54), and
Radon (86). Scientists call that periodicity. It was a great way to
organize the elements. Thus, the periodic table.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, it's much simpler to number an element than name
one. The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus of
the element's atom.
</P>
<P>
   Place names show up periodically on the table. Germanium,
Europium, Francium, and Americum, are some of the obvious ones.
Maybe you didn't know that copper is based on the Latin Cyprum for
Cyprus. Or Gallium for the Latin Gallia, for France. Or that
Hafnium _ surely you've heard of good old 72, Hafnium _ is based on
the Latin Hafnia (Copenhagen).
</P>
<P>
   Ytterby, Sweden is the place name category winner. It's the root
of four element names, Yttrium, Erbium, Ytterbium, and Terbium.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium, Neptunium, and Plutonium are based on planets.
(Seaborg, who discovered Plutonium, gave it the symbom Pu instead
of Pl, as a joke.)
</P>
<P>
   Mythology is big. Palladium comes from the Greek goddess of
wisdom Pallas. Thorium is for the Scandinavian deity Thor. Tantalum
is for the Greek mythological king Tantalus. He even gets his kid
in there. Niobium is for Niobe, Tantalus' daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Many elements are named for their properties. Hydrogen for the
Latin hudor (water), and gennan (generator), Bromine for the Greek
bromos (stench), Iridium for the Latin iridis (rainbow). Have you
ever smelled heated sulfur? Then you may appreciate why it's named
the way it is. Sulfur is the Latin word for brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   Radium puts out energy rays. It's named for the Latin for ray -
radius. Actinium emits energy rays too. But the Curies had already
taken the Latin word for ray. So Actinium is based on the Greek
word for ray - aktmos.
</P>
<P>
   Some names don't seem that elementary. The element you thought
was named for Superman's home planet, Krypton, in fact comes from
the Greek kryptos (hidden). Cobalt comes from the German kobold
(evil spirit), Xenon is the Greek word for stranger, and Thallium
comes from the Greek word thallos (young shoot). Antimony comes
from the Greek anti (opposed to) and monos (solitude). An element
that doesn't want to be alone?
</P>
<P>
   Then there is fun with Ununnilium - un (one) un (one) nil (zero)
for element 110; Unununium - un (one) un (one) un (one) for element
111; and the ever popular Ununbium. You guessed it...112. Perhaps
the physicists who discovered those and earned the right to name
them need to spend a little more time outside of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, those Ununs are still known by their nothing numerical
names because they haven't been officially named. Nor have elements
107 up to 118, discovered in lab experiments only within the past
couple years. (116 and 118 were discovered just a few months ago at
the Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory.) Maybe they could call
one of them Y2K-ium, and the other one MILLENNIUM-ium.

MAINERS DIVIDED IN STEPHEN KING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY AND JENNA RUSSELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGOR, Maine _ On June 19, while he turned his attention away
from the road to his wayward Rottweiler, Bryan Smith's van drifted
onto the side of Route 5 and slammed into the most famous man in
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few days, as Stephen King underwent a series of
operations for grave injuries, journalists made much of the clash
of celebrity and random misfortune. Headlines announced ``Celebrity
Provides No Shield From Misery'' and ``Accidents Happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's anonymity ended at the moment of impact. Five months
later, as the case wends its way through the court system halfway
across the state, public interest in the accident is still running
high enough to tie up talk-radio phone lines. King bought the van
that hit him, in part to keep it out of the hands of
memorabilia-seekers who began making inquiries ``within a short
time after the accident,'' said his lawyer, Warren Silver. NBC's
``Dateline'' is working through the courts to obtain a copy of the
original 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always completely amazed by the huge interest that people
have in Stephen,'' Silver said. ``He's a wildly popular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The klieg-light attention has come as a surprise to a lot of
peripheral figures in the case, but none more than Smith. Since he
was indicted Sept. 30 on the felony charge of aggravated assault,
which could carry a prison term of 10 years, Smith has charged that
he is being treated harshly ``just because it's Stephen King.'' And
last week, Smith's attorney, John Jenness of Paris, Maine, filed a
motion requesting a change of venue for the trial, arguing that the
aura of fame surrounding King in Oxford County has made it
impossible for his client to get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford County assistant district attorney, Joseph O'Connor,
says the charges are harsh because Smith's driving was extremely
irresponsible. With jury selection not due to start until next
spring, he said, it's too early to decide whether Oxford County
jurors are biased. In any case, he said, it would be difficult to
find a place where King was not well-known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, where are you going to change the venue to?''
he said. ``Timbuktu?''
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy poured into Bangor from around the world during the
weeks after the accident. But since then, as information about
Smith, and the incident, has come out, people in King's hometown
have had time to fine-tune their opinions _ in sometimes surprising
ways. Scott Bryson, 23, said he and his friends were surprised by a
newspaper report that Smith turned around ``for three or four
seconds.'' After he saw that, he agreed with King's position that
the state should take away Smith's license.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Watson, 30, who cooks in a downtown restaurant, said
King's request had turned his sympathy into exasperation. He sees
Smith _ who has a long series of traffic violations _ as a ``little
guy'' who has ``paid (his) penance'' and should be allowed to put
his life back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Steve has gone overboard,'' Watson said. ``He came up
because he wanted to get away from the big city, but what he's
doing is big city.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have tried to gauge public opinion in the wake of the
assault charge have been surprised at how suspicious Mainers are of
favoritism. Of the 50 letters the Bangor Daily News received on the
subject after the indictment, four out of every five thought Smith
was being treated unfairly, said Bruce Kyle, the paper's assistant
editorial page editor. And when Charles Horne, news director of the
Bangor talk radio station WVOM, opened up phone lines on the
subject, he was ``a bit surprised'' at how wary Mainers were that
King would be favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question that the tide of opinion was against the
charge,'' Horne said. ``What a lot of people were saying was Bryan
Smith made the mistake of hitting a celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers said they weren't surprised to see Mainers react
this way, and chalked it up to the state's deep-running populism _
what one attorney termed the ``underdog effect.'' Judy Potter, who
teaches trial law at the University of Maine, said she wouldn't be
surprised if Mainers ``bent over backwards to make sure they
weren't'' treating Smith unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of this backlash, many said, was the charge of
aggravated assault _ a statute that can cover either intentional
assault or extreme recklessness. David Q. Whittier, a criminal
defense attorney who is former president of the Maine Bar
Association and the Oxford County Trial Lawyers Association, said
he had seen only one or two motor vehicle accidents draw that
charge in the course of his 30-year career. O'Connor, the Oxford
County assistant district attorney, said the charge was harsh
because Smith had showed unusual recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of another case like this, where someone in
broad daylight on a dry, sunny day goes off the road and hits
another person,'' he said. ``It could have been anybody's son or
husband or brother.''
</P>
<P>
   King is still struggling to recover. Only last week, he had a
metal device called an ``external fixator'' removed from his leg.
In with NBC, King says that he has struggled so much with writing
since the accident that he is not certain he will publish another
novel.
</P>
<P>
   Jenness, Smith's court-appointed attorney, argued in an Oct. 18
motion that King, a wealthy philanthropist, carries undue influence
in Oxford County. Jenness singled out as prejudicial not only media
coverage of the case, but also the $240,000 in donations that King
gave to the two area medical centers and a rescue service that
treated him after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Jenness did not return repeated phone calls for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said King _ now recovering in his Bangor home from broken
bones and a collapsed lung _ had contributed to those institutions
in the past and had no thought of contributing to bias. Silver said
it was part of Smith's strategy to suggest he was being railroaded
because of celebrity bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true. I think that Mr. Smith does try to create that
image,'' he said. ``Mr. Smith will stand on his own merits. I do
not think he is being railroaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Silver and O'Connor said they felt that any Maine jury
would be able to distinguish between what it heard in the courtroom
and what it heard in the media. But, O'Connor added, it is the
media that have made this case unusual by lavishing breathless
attention on a routine investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no question that if the victim in this case
was a 10-year-old kid or a 64-year-old woman, if it was John Q.
Nobody, it probably would have made a paragraph on the back page of
the newspaper,'' O'Connor said. ``And I mean the local newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the presence of a celebrity creates a bias, it is not
always clear what direction it will go in, said Kevin Reddington, a
Brockton, Mass., defense attorney who defended Red Sox first
baseman Mo Vaughan in a 1998 drunk driving charge. He said if he
was involved in a lawsuit, he would just as soon be unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Most people assume celebrities receive preferential treatment,
but ``it's the exact opposite,'' he said. ``Maybe there might be
some type of admiration tinged with a feeling that this might be a
way to bring someone down a peg or two.''

MCCAIN TESTS `CANDOR CAMPAIGN' ACROSS N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CONWAY, N.H. _ Cindy McCain is a reluctant political
spouse and, recently, a pretty good sport. She stood in for her
husband, John, at a town hall meeting when a Senate vote sent him
back to Washington. She bought an insulated winter coat for January
in New Hampshire. And she went on national television to tell again
of her past addiction to painkillers, which was bound to come up
anyway in this presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But she drew the line at the tale of Marie, the Flame of
Florida, the exotic nightclub dancer who, John McCain wrote in his
new memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' set his heart on fire when he
was a hell-raising, rule-breaking Navy flyboy in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want our kids hearing about their dad and some Flame
of Florida while we were driving in the car,'' said Mrs. McCain,
the mother of four school-age children. ``They won't, because the
book on tape is abridged.''
</P>
<P>
   The audiotape editing of McCain's best-selling memoir may be the
only thing that is abridged about the Arizona senator's unorthodox
quest for the GOP presidential nomination. Weaving a history of
Vietnam War valor with details of a rambunctious youth, McCain
presents himself as a man of vigor and a political maverick, a man
of achievement who has made his share of mistakes, a man of charm
who is also famously impatient and hot-tempered, even with
potential allies.
</P>
<P>
   It is what his aides like to call ``the total candor campaign,'
a strategy calibrated for the post-Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of politicians who weasel around and govern
by the polls,'' McCain, a three-term senator, said while on a
recent swing through New Hampshire, his 19th campaign visit to the
first-primary state. Voters want to forget the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, McCain said, and elect a ``principled, strong leader,''
even if it isn't somebody they always agree with or even admire in
every way.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may be on to something. New polls show him moving up to a
solid second place in the GOP field and steadily gaining ground on
Governor George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner. Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center, said McCain benefits from one
of his survey's most important post-impeachment findings: Voters
care much more about a candidate's reputation for honesty than
about a candidate's personal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people say they don't care if a candidate smoked
dope or took antidepressants,'' Kohut said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A candidate doesn't have to be squeaky clean as long as voters
get a sense he will play it straight as president and do what he
says he will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Baldwin, who runs Gold Leaf Frame and Gallery here, said
McCain reminds him of President Truman. ``I don't like everything
McCain says, but I respect him because he says what he thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is straightforward, often to the point of bluntness. It
is a trait that has burnished his public appeal but has also
alienated many within his party.
</P>
<P>
   He has a reputation in the Senate for shooting from the lip
first and apologizing later. Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska
Republican, whom McCain counts as one of his few friends in the
Senate, said McCain ``had needlessly stepped on toes'' because he
is passionate on issues and doesn't care if he is popular.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bluntness came out at a recent ``eggs and issues''
breakfast in North Conway, when he attacked colleagues in Congress
who, he said, have been ``corrupted'' and ``kept in lifetime jobs''
by the influence of special-interest money. It came out again in
Concord, when he disagreed with a questioner who, he said, had her
facts wrong on the death penalty. It came out last week, when he
got angry and accused Bush's campaign of planting a negative story
about him in The New York Times highlighting the high-decibel
temper McCain says he has under control.
</P>
<P>
   But most vividly, it has come out in the way this presidential
candidate has put his personal life and bad-boy past into print and
on parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd thought seriously about it, I'm not sure I would have
put Marie, Flame of Florida, in the book,'' McCain said with a
grin, and a look that seemed to reflect vivid memories of the
girlfriend who once shocked his refined Navy friends by cleaning
her fingernails with a switchblade. McCain autographs dozens of
copies of the book every day, and that story is in it.
</P>
<P>
   By ``chronicling my imperfections,'' McCain may be trying to
inoculate himself against personal-life revelations in the media
that might distract or damage a presidential campaign. And by
asserting that he would not be a ``credible, plausible'' candidate
without full disclosure of his past, he is also setting himself
apart from Bush, who has dodged the question of cocaine use and has
been vague about youthful indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's openness about his scampish early days also
distinguishes him from other presidential candidates _ Al Gore,
Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Orrin G. Hatch, Alan Keyes _ who grew up
more Boy Scout than bully and as adults display unfailing good
manners and advertise their family values. The Oxford-educated Bill
Bradley suggests in his memoir, ``Life on the Run,'' that he read
more books than sowed wild oats as a professional basketball star
(though he admits to having sowed some).
</P>
<P>
   It's already part of the legend that McCain graduated close to
last in his class at the Naval Academy because he was insubordinate
and shirked his studies. He partied too much during pilot training
and crashed three planes. He divorced his first wife, Carol, who
waited five and a half years for him to return from a Hanoi
prisoner-of-war camp, and married Cindy, who was wealthy, part of a
prominent Arizona family, and half his age. He was one of five
members investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee in 1990 for
meeting with federal regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, a
rich Phoenix developer and campaign contributor. The committee
found no wrongdoing by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   At a private dinner last year, he told a tasteless joke about
Chelsea Clinton and Janet Reno that was reported in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain why I do things that are stupid, senseless,
and cruel, but I know to apologize when I do it,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Bond, a longtime Republican activist, recently sent $1,000
to McCain's campaign, even though he is supporting Bush. ``John's
is such a refreshing voice,'' Bond said. ``Here is a person who has
admitted to having feet of clay, who had a less than stellar
academic record, personal behavior that was less than stable, a
failed marriage, and his political integrity questioned on the
national stage,'' Bond said. ``Yet, each time he corrected the
course, restored his self-esteem, and came out a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he has learned from his mistakes, and has grown with
critical life experiences, not just his cruel and crippling
captivity in North Vietnam, but also the Keating investigation, his
wife's drug use, and the lonely, risky business of trying to gore
Capitol Hill's sacred cows, including the tobacco industry and the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an imperfect person, and I'm not proud of it. But even
imperfect people can aspire to noble causes, to do the right
thing,'' McCain said, adding that his father and grandfather, both
Navy admirals and war heroes, ``weren't knights in shining armor,
always slaying dragons, but they were committed to the cause of
their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The compelling family story of men at war is a fixture of
McCain's campaign. When the candidate isn't referring directly to
honor, courage, and duty as essential qualities in a president, his
aides put it on display in the form of a faded photograph of McCain
as a rugged, young naval aviator _ square-jawed, thick-necked,
handsome _ blown up to poster size.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's a man's man. His whole life has been built around the
macho rule of the military, and he's a macho guy,'' said Orson
Swindle, who has been a close friend of McCain's since the two were
POWs in Hanoi. ``How do you measure a man? Not by whether he could
resist yielding under threat of torture and death, but whether he
has been in the crucible and come back to fight again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did come back from the war wanting to make up for lost
time, and he still is impatient. Dashing into an L.L. Bean outlet
store in Concord, McCain bought a sweater, a jacket, and two pairs
of shoes in 10 minutes, and tried them on for size only when his
wife insisted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not much different in the Senate. Some Republican senators
who have tried to work with him on his signature issue, campaign
finance reform, describe the experience as frustrating and
exasperating because, they say, McCain has no patience for details
and won't heed suggestions or listen to dissent. Only four senators
have endorsed his presidential bid so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his passion, but he is truly one of the most
difficult people I have ever tried to work with,'' said a GOP
senator who did not want to be quoted by name. ``If you don't agree
with him, he will blast you.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Johnson, a former Democratic mayor of Phoenix, says he
knows what it's like to cross McCain. ``Until you've seen his
temper, you wouldn't believe it,'' said Johnson, who once got into
a heated argument with McCain that nearly came to blows. ``McCain
not only explodes; he holds a grudge and looks for vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain admits he gets angry, but he says the temper that got him
in trouble as a young man is in check. His opponents ``expect me to
get mad, they expect me to get angry,'' McCain said. ``But I won't
blow my top. It's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think it is only a matter of time before the candidate who
gets bored giving canned speeches, thrives on candor, cajoles the
media, and enjoys an occasional locker-room joke will again be
sorry for something he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't the scripted Dole or Bush campaign, and John could
really screw it up,'' Bond said. ``But that's the beauty of John
McCain _ he just lets it all hang out.''

SAXOPHONIST HAS BEEN BRANCHING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Murray gets on a roll, his tenor saxophone
locks on to the rhythms of the earth. His notes cascade with an
unerring yet unpredictable flow, first with a volcanic fury, then
with a breeze, a sigh. He blows in phrases, each sentence complete.
Yet before marking that punctuation, his lines follow so jangled a
path, radiate in so many directions, they seem impossible to
resolve _ until, somehow, they are resolved, at which point, with
scarcely a breath, a new sentence, a new mystery, begins.
</P>
<P>
   The question puzzling many jazz fans in recent years: Whatever
happened to this guy?
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s, Murray staged his
musical-fireworks shows on a regular basis. He put out what seemed
like an album a month, led a half-dozen bands (duos, trios,
quartets, octets, big bands, funk groups), played sideman in
several more (most notably the World Saxophone Quartet). In New
York, you could see him play every Monday night at the Knitting
Factory, and only slightly less often at other clubs around town.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, he disappeared, flew off to Paris and Dakar,
joined up with Guadeloupean ka drummers, Djembe percussionists,
African rappers. A flurry of rumors circulated: He was fed up with
the Wynton-ized New York scene, he had tax troubles, he was fleeing
former wives or girlfriends. Whatever his reasons, went the
widespread whisper, Murray _ barely past 40 _ had given up the
ship, had abandoned not only America but jazz.
</P>
<P>
   He would still toss out the occasional tease. Last fall, he led
a big band and strings through some riveting arrangements of Duke
Ellington and Billy Strayhorn compositions. Now and then, with no
fanfare (who even knew he was in town?), he sat in on late-night
jam sessions at St. Nick's Pub in Harlem. Earlier this month, he
brought his octet to the Iridium, one of Manhattan's most upscale
jazz clubs, to play his arrangements of John Coltrane's music (a CD
of which will be issued, on the Justin Time label, later this
year).
</P>
<P>
   Some fans wondered: Could this be the start of a comeback, a
return to roots?
</P>
<P>
   Murray laughs at the question. As far as he's concerned, he
never left.
</P>
<P>
   He is sitting in his favorite Japanese restaurant in midtown
Manhattan a few hours before his Iridium gig begins. ``There's this
whole New York-centric thing,'' he says, shaking his head, ``this
idea that if it's not happening here, it's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not see me here, but I play someplace, with one of
my bands or another, every weekend. All summer, we did this
Ellington thing. I flew the big band across the Atlantic at least
12 times. If they couldn't make it, the octet did it. I talk with
people every day on the telephone. I know what's going on in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why did he leave the country? ``Because I met a woman, fell
in love, and we had a baby,'' Murray says. ``She lives in Paris, so
that's where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Valerie Malet, was the chief assistant for the
biggest jazz organization in France, a government-subsidized group
that works with young people _ mostly African immigrants _ in the
impoverished suburbs of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Murray met her on one of his bands' European tours. He
frequently conducts seminars when he tours, and in Paris, he got
particularly involved in Malet's group, organizing workshops,
combining the African pop music they knew with jazz standards and
some of his own compositions. He took the best dozen students to
Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Senegal, and linked them with young
musicians he had organized in similar workshops there.
</P>
<P>
   That link led to the Fo Deuk Revue, Murray's
Afro-Caribbean-funk-pop fusion band, which has toured widely, put
out two albums, and _ coinciding as it did with his romance and
subsequent move to Paris _ led many of his stateside followers to
conclude he'd left the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray insists, ``I'm just branching out. People try to keep
you in their box, they don't want you to branch out. But I don't
want to play with'' _ here he goes into a singsong speech pattern _
``this same quartet, these same three guys, that same riff, we're
going to make that same turnaround that same way. I don't want to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never stopped doing what I'm doing. I'm a jazz musician.
How can I stop playing jazz?''
</P>
<P>
   As Murray sees it, the change in scenery has done him nothing
but good. ``In New York, the phone is always ringing. . . . I have
more time in Paris to do research, read books. I have more time to
practice, too. I rarely practice less than two hours a day. I write
arrangements every day for a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also currently organizing his next African project, in
Cameroon. ``They have a history of brass bands,'' he says. ``I'll
arrange traditional songs they know, with a jazz influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, I'm not sitting in a bar trying to learn French
and talking to everybody passing by. I'm over there working, every
day. I have problems sleeping because my brain keeps going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coltrane tribute is not a project he would have undertaken a
few years ago, for a variety of reasons. When Murray came of age on
the horn, in Oakland in the 1970s, tenor saxophone players tended
to model themselves after Coltrane or the other modern titan, Sonny
Rollins _ but rarely both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody I knew was Coltrane-crazy, but I went the other way,
with Sonny,'' Murray recalls. ``I refused even to study Coltrane.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this split stemmed from the clash in loyalties that
erupts whenever two players compete for the crown, whether in jazz
or baseball. Part of it involved a radically different approach to
the main business of jazz _ improvisation. Coltrane elaborated on
the harmony of a tune, twisting and extending its chords to their
ultimate limits and building new chords, and variations on those
chords, on top of that. Rollins explored the melody, taking it
apart and piecing it back together in endless combinations, probing
the essence of a song.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on melody
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``avant-garde'' musicians of his generation, Murray is
distinctive for how deeply he burrows into song forms. Few horn
players since Ben Webster blow a ballad more soulfully; even
Murray's more out-there excursions remain anchored to a melodic
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, melody is everything,'' he says. ``Lots of time, you
have guys play squeaks and squawks _ it's not connected to
anything. Everything I play is inside the structure. Every note has
to mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another reason for Murray's hesitation at approaching
Coltrane. ``I always felt a lot of people hit the wall because of
Trane,'' he says. ``It was clear why they got into it. Coltrane
created his own lexicon, he was the future. Here you are, sounding
like an automobile _ he's got a spaceship going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you're flying a spaceship, navigation becomes a
different sort of art and, if you lose your grip for a second, you
get stuck in a rut's orbit or crash and burn into the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken me this long _ I'm 44 years old _ to feel confident
enough to take on his music without its obliterating me as a
player,'' Murray says.
</P>
<P>
   He started by studying transcripts of ``Giant Steps'' and
``Countdown,'' Coltrane's toughest solos, and playing along with
the records. ``Listening to him is one thing,'' Murray says,
``playing it is another. Getting into Trane's mind _ that man's
computer was wired different from anybody's I'd ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he arranged harmonies, counterpoints, call-and-response
riffs for the rest of the octet. Then they rehearsed, improvising
further as their grasp of the material tightened.
</P>
<P>
   One night at the Iridium, as the octet plowed into the ethereal
first movement of ``A Love Supreme,'' Murray slipped into the zone
_ the one that modern jazz often aims for but rarely occupies _
where melody and harmony merge, the notes off the horn vaporize
into pure passion, pure velocity, and the band's staggered cadences
meld into the form of pure rhythm. It was Rollins transposed over
Coltrane. It was David Murray _ it was jazz _ at their most
electrifying.

FIREBIRD 
A Memoir 
By Mark Doty 
HarperCollins, 200 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no passage better captures the humor and heartbreak of
Mark Doty's vivid, exquisite memoir, ``Firebird,'' than his
recollection of an incident when he was 10. When his friends decide
to put on a play, Doty's contribution is his rendition of Judy
Garland's classic ``Get Happy.'' With a red chiffon scarf and black
cane, he doesn't just sing the song, he seems to channel Garland,
``amphetamine bright and glittering on the inside, too,'' belting
out every word ``as if I were born knowing it.'' He is joyous and
daring, full in places where he had long felt emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   His big finish is interrupted by his mother's knock on his
bedroom door. He tries to explain the scarf, the jaunty sway of his
hips, how he will perform this number for their neighbors. No, she
says, you will not sing this song for anyone. His mother ``says
with a hiss, with shame and with exasperation, Son, you're a boy.
''
</P>
<P>
   In that moment, he knew something had irreparably broken between
mother and son. For her, ``his dissolute future spreads out in
front of her like an oil slick: shameful, worthless, sick. For
Doty, it is a ``watershed between childhood and something else. I
have been ushered into the world where adults live; I have been
warned, have been instructed to conceal my longing.''
</P>
<P>
   Longing pulses through the bittersweet heart of this moving
memoir by Doty, an award-winning poet. This is his second memoir,
the first having been the achingly beautiful ``Heaven's Coast,''
which concerned his life with, and the AIDS-related death of, his
longtime partner, Wally Roberts. As with that book, it is not so
much Doty's experiences that elevate ``Firebird.'' It is the
extraordinary lilt of his words, each chosen with great care, which
make even ordinary moments _ such as the hidden meanings a young
boy coming to terms with his sexuality could find in Petula Clark's
1965 hit ``Downtown'' _ become fresh and indelible.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the 1950s and 1960s, Doty had a childhood that often
seemed a blur of addresses. His father's work for the Army Corps of
Engineers often meant the family was rustled from one state to the
next _ Tennessee, Arizona, Florida, California. Such rootlessness
would be difficult for the happiest of families, but it was
especially tough for the Doty household, which was far from
blissful. Even as a child, Doty was aware of the distances between
himself and his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Though his mother was ``often quite tender to me, there is
something about her which precludes ease,'' he writes. ``That's the
signal characteristic of our relation: intimacy without ease.'' As
for his father _ ``aftershave, boxer shorts, milk of magnesia in
blue bottles'' _ they ``simply lack connection. He's a force on the
horizon, but a distant one.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Mark is closer to his sister, Sally, a bawdy type who
represents freedom and possibilities. She listens to rock 'n' roll
and, much to the chagrin of her parents, cuts her long blonde hair
into a boyish DA. Then one day Doty is told, ``Your sister has to
get married.'' He's too young to understand that she's pregnant,
but this he knows: Sally is getting out. Writes Doty: ``Maybe my
sister's trapped in something she doesn't want, certainly in
something she isn't old enough to manage, but she's found a way to
take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually so does Doty, but it isn't easy. He's bookish,
unathletic, and increasingly estranged from his classmates. Worse
still is his mother's alcoholism, which would eventually kill her.
Yet he is saved time and again by the alchemy of art _ dance,
music, the rhythm of words. This memoir borrows its title from Igor
Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite, Doty's favorite symphonic piece.
Doty casts himself as the same kind of mythic bird, always rising
from the dust and ashes to grasp onto something wondrous and
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Some memoirists attempt to reinhabit their childhood minds, with
wildly varying results. (Frank McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' is one
of the standout successes.) Doty does not. He is always the
narrator walking through his own life, the man gazing upon the
child. This method allows Doty to observe himself, sometimes with
devastating scrutiny. It imbues this book with greater honesty, and
makes his observations _ such as remembering himself as a ``heavy
little sissy in glasses'' all the more poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firebird'' is not merely a coming-out story, though Doty's
burgeoning homosexuality is certainly part of the equation. It
really concerns the creative birth of a poet _ one whose collection
``My Alexandria'' won the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award _
and a man polished by hardship, including an ill-fated 9-year
marriage. By book's end, it seems that Doty finds the bad memories
as precious as the good ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live the stories we tell; the stories we don't tell live
us,'' Doty writes. ``To tell a story is to take power over it.''

UNEARTHING KING PHILIP'S WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUDBURY, Mass. _ Eric Schultz is walking past gravestones, on a
search deep into New England's past, to the time when the early
harmony between the British settlers and Native Americans ended,
disastrously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about here,'' says Schultz, gesturing toward a patch of
ground in the middle of the Wadsworth Cemetery. ``That's where they
were buried, stacked in a square, and covered with stones to
protect them from wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz points to a spot where three Colonial officers and 26
militiamen were killed by Nipmuc Indians and their allies during a
fierce, three-day firefight in April 1676.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudbury Fight and myriad other clashes of what became known
as King Philip's War are chronicled _ and clearly mapped _ in a new
book by Schultz and fellow amateur historian Michael Tougias.
</P>
<P>
   While the warfare was a landmark event of the era, it has
received scant attention in American histories, rating at best a
sentence or two. But that is changing. Schultz and Tougias's book,
``King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten
Conflict,'' is one of three dealing with the war to appear in a
two-year period. It joins Jill Lepore's ``The Name of War,''which
won the prestigious Bancroft Prize for 1998, and ``King Philip's
War,'' a scholarly account by James D. Drake to be published by the
University of Massachusetts Press in January.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the Schultz-Tougias book that brings the many battle
sites across southern New England to light, as best they can be
determined from the evidence left from an age of wilderness, and
it's a useful guide to the curious.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' leader was Metacom, or King Philip, as he was known
by the colonists. In the kind of ironic twist often found in
history, he was the son of Massasoit, who had helped the Pilgrims
during their early years at Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, relations between the native Algonquin people
and the ever-increasing numbers of colonists soured. Angered by the
unchecked spread of settlements, Philip began attacking them in
June 1675.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 months that followed, 25 towns _ more than half the
Colonial settlements of New England _ were destroyed and at least
10 percent of the Colonial population killed. But the Indian losses
were even greater, mainly from disease and starvation. Many of the
survivors were sold into slavery. And the settlers emerged
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudbury battle was the high-water mark for the Indians, says
Schultz: ``It was their finest victory, and very cleverly
planned.'' They lured the militia up the slope of Green Hill behind
the field that is now the cemetery _ in the direction of two
fortified garrisons _ but then set the hillside brush afire to
drive the militiamen down into the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
An unusual scholar
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Schultz seems in some ways the opposite of a
historical scholar. He's a high-tech CEO at Sensitech, a firm that
creates programs to monitor perishable goods as they're
transported. But history is his passion, and was his major at Brown
University before he attended Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   He started researching the war eight years ago, when he took a
year off from work following the birth of his first child.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz grew up near one of the major sites of King Philip's War
_ Anawan Rock, in Rehoboth, Mass., where the Wampanoag leader
Anawan was captured in August 1676, effectively ending the war in
southern New England _ just four months after the Indian victory at
Sudbury and two weeks after Philip himself was killed at Bristol,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I took the school bus right past Anawan Rock,''
Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the frustration he experienced while reading a 1906
recounting of the war that that inspired him to research it _ and,
in particular, its historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the kind of person who likes to see, touch, walk the
places I read about,'' Schultz says, ``like walking the field at
Gettysburg.'' But, he says, ``I couldn't find the places where
events happened from what was in the book. So I went off myself and
started compiling and mapping the sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he says, he'd start with a local historian. ``In
every town, I'd find someone who knew the local site. And if the
historical marker was in the wrong place, they'd know where it
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Schultz's year off was over, he had three-quarters
of a book written. ``I figured I'd pick away on it,'' he says,
``maybe finish it up the next time I had a career change.''
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, Schultz read an item about the publication of
a novel by Tougias and dropped him a note. Tougias, like Schultz,
has a ``day job'' _ at Liberty Mutual _ but has written a series of
books describing nature walks in New England. After writing a
historical novel about the war, ``Until I Have No Country,'' he had
thought about doing a guidebook to the sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Covering the same ground
</P>
<P>
   ``Our paths had probably crossed in the woods,'' Tougias says.
``But with our notebooks in our hands, we wouldn't have even
noticed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tougias replied to Schultz's note, and the two met and
agreed to collaborate on a book that would tell the history of the
war through its sites, with accounts of what happened at each and
detailed maps of the major ones.
</P>
<P>
   Finding them was not all that easy, Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler's Surprise, an Indian victory on the scale of the
Sudbury Fight, occurred in what is now New Braintree in August
1675. But exactly where is uncertain. The stone marker off Route 32
reads ``Somewhere within 1/2 mile . . . ,'' and historians, Schultz
says, ``have been debating the possibilities for years. There's
good evidence for each one, but no clear winner.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are sites like that of Beer's Ambush in
Northfield in September 1675, which has been clearly marked. ``You
can walk right along the route the militia took that led them into
the ambush site,'' Schultz says.
</P>
<P>
   Precise identification and mapping of the sites is not just
useful for readers who may want to visit them, but also important
in understanding the tactics and the opposing sides. The Colonial
militia, at least in the early months of the war, marched into
battle _ and often into ambush _ like British regulars, while the
Indians used the terrain both to set up ambushes and, as at
Sudbury, to score a victory.
</P>
<P>
   While his and Tougias's book is not intended ``to prove a
thesis,'' Schultz says, he remains struck by ``how two cultures
almost overnight became so violently and so brutally at war with
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   And after all the years of being virtually forgotten, he says,
``it is begging to be reinterpreted.''

CONDUCTOR KNUSSEN BRINGS COPLAND, SENDAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the proudest traditions of the Boston Symphony Orchestra
is the composer-conducted concert. Ravel, Prokofiev, and Stravinsky
conducted their own works in historic Symphony Hall events, and in
more recent years so have Sir Michael Tippett, Sir Peter Maxwell
Davies, Witold Lutoslawski, and Oliver Knussen.
</P>
<P>
   Knussen returns this week for an unusual alternative version of
one of the most popular works of the repertory, Copland's
``Appalachian Spring,'' and the local premiere of one of his own
most successful works: ``Where the Wild Things Are,'' a one-act
opera he wrote in collaboration with Maurice Sendak, the famous
writer and illustrator of children's books. In a way, the piece
will be coming home, because its history began at Tanglewood in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Knussen, one of the musical world's great talkers, came on the
phone from his home in London early last week to talk about the
opera and its story. ``It was the heady summer that the French
composer Olivier Messiaen was at Tanglewood, so that's why I was
hanging around. One night I was at a concert in the Shed, and a man
came up to me and asked if I were interested in writing an opera. I
said, `Well, sort of,' and I had actually been thinking about it.
He suggested we meet for lunch the next day because he had some
things he wanted to show me. I thought he was a potential
librettist _ his name was Mitchell Miller, known as Mike, the son
of Mitch Miller, a children's-book illustrator who had been
encouraged by Maurice Sendak.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussen, who turned 23 that summer, had been regarded as the
greatest hope for the future of English music since the premiere of
his First Symphony, when he was 15. ``As we sat in the cafeteria,
Mike took a bag and emptied the complete works of Maurice Sendak
onto the table. He told me that Sendak wanted to make an opera out
of his book `Higglety-Pigglety-Pop' _ I thought it was a wonderful
gesture for Mike to bring the work of someone else to my attention.
He suggested that I call Sendak. I knew who Sendak was, because I
had been hanging out at the Book Store up in Lenox. I'm a
generation too old to have grown up on the Sendak books, but I had
seen these extraordinary creations in the store, and knew his
position in the illustrating world. I thought that calling him up
would be a little like a composer calling up Leonard Bernstein and
saying, `Hey, I'm here.' But one day the phone rang, and it was
Sendak.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the conversation, Knussen reports, was a test.
``What's the best children's opera ever written?'' Sendak asked.
``I came back with the smart-aleck answer, which turned out to be
the right one _ the second act of `Boris Godunov,' with
Mussorgsky's fantastic characterization of the tsar's children and
their games. We started out sketching a libretto for `Higglety,'
but at that time I didn't write any music.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Sendak was approached by the Theatre de la Monnaie in
Brussels, which was interested in turning ``Where the Wild Things
Are'' into an opera. ``We had talked about this book,'' Knussen
says, ``but we had decided it was too much of a visual thing. But
when this inquiry came, Maurice said, `Why don't we have a go, and
see if we can do something?' So we blocked it out, and over the
next two years I wrote it. What made it difficult to do is that the
story is mostly pictures, with very few words, so Maurice had to
build up the text, and I had to spell out the pictures in
orchestral terms. The score lasts just under 40 minutes, but it is
248 densely packed pages that represented a colossal effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Knussen's works, ``Where the Wild Things Are'' had
a difficult birth. The composer had not yet finished the opera at
the time of the first performance in 1980, so the premiere had
``holes'' in it. And, Knussen says, ``the event was what we
politely call `not a success.' The Brussels school kids were the
noisiest on the planet, and not a note of the music could be heard
over the incredible din. The dry-ice machine ran amok, so nothing
on the stage could be seen through the smoke. The opera was
performed in Flemish and in French, but you couldn't make out a
single word, so later performances were preceded by a professional
storyteller reading the book, originally a six-minute exercise
which got longer and longer every night, until it turned into `War
and Peace.' ''
</P>
<P>
   News traveled fast that the opera was ``not a success,'' so a
planned concert performance in London was canceled. The resourceful
composer, like many of his predecessors, got busy and ``extracted a
concert suite with some scissors and glue. I called it `Songs and a
Sea Interlude,' which I did with the BBC Symphony in 1981 _ this
was the first time I actually heard the music. As a result the
concert performance was reinstated, and then the Glyndebourne
Festival came onto the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after Knussen had rewritten about half the score,
``Where the Wild Things Are'' ran for more than 20 performances at
Glyndebourne, on tour, and in London's National Theater. It was
recorded and translated to video, and, Knussen says, ``the history
of the piece began.'' The original production, with sets and
costumes by Sendak, was widely seen (in America it was done in New
York, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Los Angeles). It has also
been performed in Germany in productions not designed by Sendak.
``I didn't see those German productions, but the photographs of one
of them looked as if it had been designed by Magritte, and everyone
was dressed in tight leather. By now, I have also done the opera
many times in concert, and it works extremely well that way because
the orchestra plays so active a role in it. I composed everything
with Maurice's drawings right in front of me, and the music
wouldn't exist without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussen and Sendak went on to create another opera out of
``Higglety-Pigglety-Pop,'' which was designed to go on a double
bill with ``Where the Wild Things Are,'' but its creation was
attended by even more difficulties. So far, it hasn't built up a
comparable performance history. But that may change; Knussen has
recorded both operas for Deutsche Grammophon with the London
Sinfonietta, and the performances await release. Sendak has heard a
rough cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He semed to be very moved by it,'' Knussen says. ``It's no
secret both operas had a difficult start. It took me forever to
write them, and they were performed in various stages of
completion. But now, in their modest way, they seem to be coming
into their own, particularly `Where the Wild Things Are,' and
that's probably tremendously satisfying for him. I think Maurice is
a tremendously musical person, and I learned a tremendous amount
from him _ how you can cast a net of references very wide, provided
you've got your feet on the ground, and know who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In his capacity as conductor, Knussen has become the most
significant advocate of Copland's music since Leonard Bernstein.
``I'm afraid Copland has become one of the great underrated
composers, and the more underrated he gets, the more important I
think he is. The elegance and discipline of his music stands the
test of time more and more, and it's still growing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalachian Spring'' was originally composed for a chamber
ensemble to accompany Martha Graham's choreography. Later Copland
expanded the scoring for full orchestra, but omitted some episodes
of the original ballet; in 1954, he orchestrated some of the
omitted passages for the Philadelphia Orchestra. Knussen is going
to conduct that version. ``The lesser-known passages are mostly the
music for Merce Cunningham's original role in the ballet, and it is
quite outside the style of the rest of the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussen has long been a sought-after conductor; his Deutsche
Grammophon recordings of neglected 20th-century works are among the
most distinguished being produced  &UR; today &LR; . About half the 20 discs
he has made have been released; among those in the can are an
Elliott Carter disc (the clarinet concerto and the Symphonic
Triptych), a Mussorgsky/Stokowski record (``I pride myself on my
good taste,'' Knussen says), the two Schoenberg one-act operas, a
Peter Lieberson record, and a Busoni CD. ``Next year I'm going to
do Henze's Eighth Symphony and some music by Julian Anderson, a
spectacularly gifted young British composer who is worth fighting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussen says he has been ``dormant'' as a composer for the last
couple of years, though he did replace an entire scene of
``Higglety-Pigglety-Pop'' before recording it. He is working on
pieces for Peter Serkin and the London Sinfonietta, and on a Fourth
Symphony for the New York Philharmonic. ``In various forms, that
has been in my notebooks for about eight years. I wanted to get it
out before 2000, but I'm not going to make it until next year. It's
another one-movement symphony, my fourth, and, I feel sure, my
last. Then I will be moving into other areas _ only I don't know
yet what they are!''

HOWARD COSELL'S LEGACY IN   THE TELEVISION WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his zeppelin-like cigars, an even larger ego, and a
limitless supply of bombast, Howard Cosell harrumphed his way to
the top of the sportscasting world in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out he had his eye on a more prestigious prize. In
an HBO documentary Monday night, Peter Jennings reveals (with a
barely suppressed smile) that Cosell ``told me for years that he
should have been the anchorman for the ABC Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, that ambition would have been laughable. But it
would be harder to laugh at today. For the strange and perhaps
unsettling reality is that while much has been written about
Cosell's impact on sports broadcasting, it is the news-oriented
hemisphere of the television world that bears Cosell's mark most
distinctly.
</P>
<P>
   Look around the tube. The cult of the outsized personality begun
by Cosell _ the notion that the interviewer is the star, whose
opinions and charisma outshine the guest _ has come to define
television. From Sam Donaldson to John McLaughlin to Chris
Matthews, from Geraldo Rivera to Larry King to Bill O'Reilly, it's
in vogue to strain for a Cosell-like aura of unpredictability and
contrarianism _ and for a voice no one can ignore or forget.
</P>
<P>
   There is another, broader development that can be indirectly
traced to Cosell: the transformation of prime time from the
exclusive bailiwick of entertainment to a place where news packaged
as entertainment increasingly holds sway.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with Cosell's influence on what makes a successful
television personality. Like Cosell, who died in 1995 at age 77,
today's media stars know the attention-getting value of
controversy, and consequently seem as willing to be hated as loved.
During his heyday, one survey rated Cosell both the most liked and
the most disliked sportscaster in America. However, one suspects
that the poll he valued most (and that Rivera et. al. would covet
most) was the one revealing that his name recognition stood at a
staggering 96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His spirit of brash self-promotion coupled with genuine
journalistic enterprise is also reflected in ambitious young TV
reporters like ABC's John Stossel, who recently launched a regular
``20/20'' segment whose title Cosell would have liked: ``Give Me a
Break!''
</P>
<P>
   The key word in that title is ``Me.'' The projection of self was
the essence of Cosellism _ ``I think Howard saw himself as much of
an entertainer, as much of a celebrity, as the people he was
covering,'' one of his former bosses remarks in the documentary _
and it is the essence of the new media persona.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Barbara Walters is a major figure in this shift as
well. Her influence on the personality-driven journalism favored by
the current TV generation has been profound. But it was Cosell who
fused egocentricity with a tough-talking candor that have become
the twin hallmarks of contemporary media heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Cosell's trademark boast was that he alone was ``telling it like
it is,'' and it was often true. When Frank Gifford once protested
that he was being too tough on a football team, Cosell retorted:
``If we see it, Giff, we've got to say it.'' That could be the
credo of the best of the news-oriented talkshow stars, such as
Matthews, host of CNBC's ``Hardball,'' who refuses to let his
guests off the hook as tries to blast through the prevailing
Beltway cant.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this description of Cosell by a former colleague: ``He
was frankly sort of bored with the mundane essence of sports. He
loved the larger issues of conflicts, politics and human drama.''
Now substitute the word ``policy'' for ``sports.'' Couldn't that
quote fit any number of contemporary talk-show hosts?
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the freewheeling news-talk arena, national sports
broadcasts are still dominated by ex-jocks who subscribe to a
speak-no-evil ethos, or announcers who seldom venture a criticism
of the athletes they plainly worship. The hellfire that rained down
last week on NBC's Jim Gray after he badgered Pete Rose on gambling
issues derived partly from Gray's ham-fisted approach, but part of
it may have been the public's shock at seeing a sportscaster
actually confront an athlete. Gray apologized to viewers the next
night; it is difficult to picture the defiant Cosell doing the
same.
</P>
<P>
   It's become increasingly common for TV reporters, anchors and
talk-show hosts to play themselves in movies, blurring the line
between journalism and showbiz. Cosell was ahead of that curve,
too. Back in the early '70s, when Woody Allen was still making
funny movies rather than stilted exercises in pseudo-profundity,
Cosell made a hilarious cameo appearance in Allen's ``Bananas.'' He
paved the way for Larry King, who has cropped up in more movies
lately than Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was announcing, interviewing, or reporting, Cosell
never had any problem throwing off the constraints of objectivity,
and he saw the value of wrapping himself in a good cause. To his
eternal credit, he championed the cause of Muhammad Ali. For much
of 1998, Geraldo Rivera threw himself with Cosellian fervor into a
more dubious cause: the defense of President Clinton against
efforts to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all this is the transformation of prime time from pure
entertainment to news-as-entertainment, a shift that Cosell helped
make possible.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Monday Night Football'' debuted in 1970, prime time
belonged almost entirely to sitcoms, dramas, and variety shows.
There was only one newsmagazine on the air, CBS's then-young ``60
Minutes.'' Network entertainment divisions ruled the nighttime
roost; the news and sports divisions had to settle for time slots
in the early evenings and and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   However, with Cosell as its star for the next 13 years, ``Monday
Night Football'' earned blockbuster ratings and became a national
phenomenon. It also established a beachhead for nonfiction TV
programs from which there was no turning back. It proved networks
didn't need to rely on sitcoms and dramas alone to succeed in prime
time, as long as nonfiction programs were dressed up with snazzy
production values.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the technological bells and whistles of the football
telecasts upped the ante, and set the standard, for the news
divisions. It was no accident that the architect of ``Monday Night
Fooball,'' ABC Sports president

   PERSONAL INJURIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Turow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 403 pp. $27. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When people invoke the thuggish proposal in Shakespeare's
``Henry VI'' to kill all the lawyers, chances are they mean to put
personal-injury attorneys at the top of the hit list. These are the
guys, according to stereotype, who see a cash cow in every tragedy
_ who would make a relative wear a neck brace for a stubbed toe if
it would raise the ante. But they're also the ones who fight for
the little people against the Darth Vaders of the insurance
business (albeit for a third of the cut). So leave it to Scott
Turow to recognize an enticingly murky moral situation within the
not-so-hallowed halls of our legal system. In ``Personal
Injuries,'' he has made his anti-hero a likable PI lawyer with an
inner code as mutable as a chameleon at twilight. The villains, if
they'll stay still long enough to be ID'd, are the supposed icons
of integrity wearing black robes _ judges on the take, in other
words, and hardly above killing the lawyers who try to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Presumed Innocent'' made him America's erudite Grisham
more than a decade ago, Turow has centered each of his elaborate
legal thrillers upon some classic moral conundrum: the collision
between private love and public honor; avarice and sacrifice;
personal honesty and professional scorn. His skill has been in
imagining characters of emotional complexity whose human failings
have enormous consequence _ jealousy writ large as homicide;
betrayal offering the first loose thread of a widening scandal. In
``Personal Injuries,'' he has envisioned this mare's nest of
intrigue with legal sophistication and narrative tension. But
Turow's creative gifts are too often eclipsed by his analytic ones
in this novel; it's simply a matter of death by detail. For all its
intelligence and painstaking legal accuracy, ``Personal Injuries''
can be as wearying as studying torts on a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all the time, thanks to two indelibly realized
characters _ a lawyer and an undercover FBI agent _ who steal the
show from the pallid gang of thieves. The first is Robbie Feavor,
the snake-oil protagonist who in the opening pages of the novel is
busted by the IRS for concealing money. Robbie is privy to bigger
things, which is why the US attorney is present at the raid. With
his lawyer and lifelong friend, Mort Dinnerstein, Robbie has been
paying off some of the top judges in Turow's fictional Kindle
County. The highest on high, and the most untouchable, is one
Brendan Tuohey _ former police officer, legendary pol, and
presiding judge of the Common Law Claims Division, where all
personal-injury cases are heard. He also happens to be
Dinnerstein's beloved uncle, and the Irish patriarch who played
paterfamilias to Robbie's own fatherless youth.
</P>
<P>
   Which ought to make this a drama of great emotion, since its
crux _ the sins of the father, and all _ rests on Robbie's turning
confidential informant for the state. Agreeing to wear a wire while
he makes the money drops, Robbie finds himself the star player in a
veritable roadshow of lawyers, guns, and money _ a judicial sting
orchestrated to such fine pitch that the state even brings in fake
lawyers to try fictional cases before the judges under suspicion.
Their best plant, for our purposes, is the other wonderful
character of the novel: an FBI agent posing as Robbie's paralegal,
Evon Miller, who also happens to be a Quantico firearms instructor
and former Olympic hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   The legal labyrinths revealed by Operation Petros are deftly
navigated by Turow, though they hardly make for mesmerizing
narrative. More problematic is an unevenness in character
dimension; in some ways, ``Personal Injuries'' is simply too
complicated to be very deep. This particularly applies to the bad
guys, who mostly come across as scantily imagined blackguards,
whatever their individual moral failings. Tuohey himself remains
utterly unknowable, at best an amoral apparition, while his
lower-court judges _ ranging from a Southern black man with a chip
on his shoulder to a soft-centered alcoholic woman _ all lend
themselves to one-sentence personality profiles. This lightness of
attention robs the novel of a certain emotional staying power: We
know the rascals are criminal and even dangerous, but they don't
seem very real, and therefore not very threatening _ more like bad
outtakes from ``Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Turow has concentrated his empathic sights on the likes
of an oily rogue with a well-concealed and tender heart, as well as
the conflicted young female agent who agrees to spot him for the
feds. Robbie's charismatic optimism barely conceals his troubles at
home, where the wife he adores lies dying from the last awful
stages of Lou Gehrig's disease. Evon, who's spent her career and
most of her life shielding herself from getting too involved with
anyone, finds herself caught in the tailspin mutability of
undercover work, caring for Robbie even as she disdains him. Both
characters, especially Evon, are intricate enough to draw us
through their story, even when it resorts to a kind of
write-by-numbers formula of the white hats in pursuit of the black.
</P>
<P>
   Because really, how long can you rework this genre, even
intelligently, before you simply start sounding like yourself all
over again? And Turow sounds tired here, at least when he's
relinquished the personal turmoil of his best characters for the
demands of dramatizing the judicial sting. He's also set up a
credibility problem by telling his story from the first-person
point of view of Robbie's lawyer, George Mason. This means that
Mason must explain his own impossible omniscience, which extends to
Evon's inner thoughts and private dialogue, by saying he learned
all this later from lengthy conversations with everyone involved.
Turow could have solved his dilemma by cross-cutting between (say)
Mason's and Evon's voices, or even Mason's and a third-person
narration; as it is, the story continually grates when it gets into
territory surmised or imagined by Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But these are literary failings, none of which ever kept a
certain kind of writer off the best-seller list. Turow has made his
mark over the years by corralling the depravity of the human
condition within the ironic parameters _ scuffed mahogany and
burned-out idealists _ of the judicial system itself. The plot of
this novel is based on a similar judicial sting that took place in
Chicago in the 1980s, which Turow, as a practicing lawyer, helped
to try.
</P>
<P>
   So he may have his own lesson to learn in ``Personal Injuries,''
which is that the facts of law are no more compelling, or
demanding, than the laws of fiction.

RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WON'T GEAR DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether hard-rock music causes violence became a national issue
again after the rioting at the close of Woodstock '99 in August.
Rage Against the Machine, a band that boasts revolutionary messages
as well as high decibels, was blamed _ along with other heavy-amped
bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit_ for helping to incite the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It's a notion that Rage guitarist Tom Morello finds ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a horrific youth-bashing that went on in the wake of
Woodstock,'' Morello says. ``The vilification of young people
gained a lot of momentum in this post-Columbine era, and it really
came to a head in the aftermath of Woodstock. But it ignores the
hard facts, which are that adults are much more likely to commit
violent crimes than young people are. And yet there's still the
belief that if young people listen to this music, it's going to
lead them into a pagan frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morello is dismayed by the reported sexual assaults at Woodstock
(``Those are crimes and at Rage shows, we do not allow that to
happen _ we have stopped many a show to point out and cuss out
perpetrators''), but otherwise he understands why part of the crowd
ran wild and inflicted property damage at the end.
</P>
<P>
   He says the damage was caused by youths being ``milked the whole
time'' by high concession prices at what was ``not a particularly
fan-friendly event.'' It wasn't the music. It was the structure of
the event, he says, adding that Rage Against the Machine's purpose
has always been to expose unjust authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine can basically stand for any illegitimate
authority,'' says Morello. ``Whether that is in your home or your
community, workplace or school, or in your country or beyond its
borders, it deserves to be raged against.''
</P>
<P>
   An angry message
</P>
<P>
   It thus comes as no surprise that Rage is still raging on its
new album, ``The Battle of Los Angeles,'' due out Tuesday. Unlike
Korn and Limp Bizkit, which both have cartoon elements, Rage
Against the Machine is a socially conscious juggernaut; instead of
locker-room humor, the band's concerns are trying to free Mumia
Abu-Jamal (a former Black Panther convicted of killing a police
officer in Pennsylvania in what Morello believes was a frame-up),
or extolling the Zapatista rebels of Mexico, or singing the praises
of ``Guerrilla Radio'' _ the title of the group's current, red-hot
radio single.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lyrics, Morello acknowledges that Rage is not even
``on the same continent'' as Korn and Bizkit, ``though we tend to
get lumped together because we have some things in common'' _
meaning loud, metal-rap music. ``But I like those bands and I think
there is some unapologetic rocking quality to both of them which is
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the anger in Rage's music, it's heard in new, slam-bam
songs ``Born as Ghosts'' (about ``the school as a tomb''), ``Ashes
in the Fall'' (with Rage rapper Zack de la Rocha decrying
fascists), and ``Calm Like a Bomb'' (about the ``rhyme of the
unheard'' in Third World countries). In the latter, de la Rocha
declares: ``There's a right to obey and a right to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't that be construed as inciting violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were things shared by Thomas Paine and Thomas
Jefferson,'' Morello states. ``To say that people have the right to
resist oppression is not a new idea under the sun. There is solid
historical precedent. You have to look no further than the Founding
Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just politics
</P>
<P>
   Given such views, does Rage feel isolated in  &UR; today &LR; 's rock
mainstream? There was a time when bands were more political as a
rule, but  &UR; today &LR; 's era of MTV silliness is not that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really isolated. I don't think we look at it like that,''
says Morello, whose group performs at the Worcester Centrum Centre
Nov. 30. ``We don't sit around moping because there are not other
bands in the Top 10 who have a similar ideological bent. We just
follow our convictions. But in a band like Rage, it's not just the
politics. It's the rock that matters, too. And we happen to rock in
a most convincing way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for many listeners, Rage's sound is unparalleled. De la
Rocha, a Chicano from Irvine, Calif., yells his lungs out on anthem
after another, building tension, then releasing it with primal
screams. The rhythm section of drummer Brad Wilk and bassist Tim
Commerford (now called Y.tim.K) rocks without the aid of drum
loops. And Morello has become a guitar god who, though weaned on
the likes of Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Kiss's Ace Frehley, has a
totally unique style of siren-like screeches and grinding,
pummeling effects that ``sound like a combination of a rhino and a
lawnmower,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has just become my voice on the instrument. That is how I
hear music now. It just spills out,'' he concludes. ``I have kind
of weaned myself away from a lot of the rock cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Rage is surprised to have done so well with its
metal-rap crossover sound and uncompromising lyrics. Since
releasing its first album, in 1992, Rage has rocked and shocked the
mainstream with such tunes as ``Killing in the Name,'' ``Bullet to
the Head,'' and its popular, amped-up cover of Bruce Springsteen's
``Ghost of Tom Joad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're surprised,'' Morello says. ``We thought our rock
would alienate the hip-hoppers and our hip-hop would alienate the
rockers and that the way we looked would alienate a lot of others,
and what Zack was singing about would leave everyone else out. And
we were wrong about all four.''

TUBERCULOSIS STRATEGY BORN OF TWO DOCTORS' DEVOTION

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a spring day in 1995, a relief worker for Partners in Health
flew from Peru to Boston. He was coughing terribly. Doctors later
diagnosed him with tuberculosis and began their treatment with
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Seven weeks later he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results revealed that his strain of the disease couldn't be
cured by four common anti-TB drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston health care community worried that the worker's
illness would trigger an outbreak, but fortunately it never
occurred. But the tragedy also propelled Partners in Health, begun
by Drs. Paul Farmer and Jim Yong Kim, back to Peru to find the
source of the multidrug-resistant TB _ and then figure out how to
treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years later, their effort not only has saved the lives
of about 100 people in Lima who had the disease, but they hope it
saves tens of thousands more around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the World Health Organization and others at
the center of global TB control had been saying that if you were
poor in the Third World and you contracted multidrug-resistant TB,
there was nothing to be done. Most would die. Drugs were too
expensive and treatment too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lima, Partners in Health proved otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Following a meeting with global TB experts last week in New
York, including WHO officials, Partners in Health's Peru
prescription _ an intensified regimen in which additional drugs are
given to people over a longer period of time _ will be adopted in
pilot projects in drug-resistant TB ``hot spots'' such as Russia,
Latvia, and Kazakhstan. Comprehensive programs there and elsewhere
in the world, however, won't start until caregivers secure hundreds
of millions of dollars in additional funding.
</P>
<P>
   That hunt for money is now under way by Partners in Health
co-founders Farmer and Kim, who are taking their pitches to
foundations established by the barons of the 20th century:
Rockefeller, Soros, Gates, Kellogg, and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy, which is to give patients up to seven drugs
daily for up to two years, appears to be 85 percent effective, and
costs between $300 and $4,000. That's far less than what treatment
costs for TB in the United States and other developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Kim's efforts represent a huge leap from the group's
beginnings in 1987, when Partners had no paid staff and a one-room
office in Cambridge, Mass.. Now, they have a $3 million budget, 300
paid workers (most of them in Haiti and Peru), and they are the
co-directors of the program in infectious disease and social change
at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the group expanded its delivery of health
care from the countryside of Haiti, to the slums of Peru, to the
mountains of Chiapas, to the streets of Roxbury, Mass., and to the
prisons of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled to all those places guided by a single principle:
every person should have equal access to health care. That
philosophy springs from Roman Catholic liberation theology, which
says it's imperative to give preferential options for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it O-for-the-P,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Kim, both 40, met as Harvard medical students,
arriving in Cambridge on roads that wouldn't normally intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was born in North Adams, Mass., and his schoolteacher
father and mother took him and five siblings through a years-long
adventure in the South, settling once in a bus-turned-house in
Florida that had been used as a roving clinic to immunize people
against tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, born in Seoul, immigrated at the age of 4 with his family
to Dallas. His father was a dentist and his mother a neo-Confuscian
philosopher. They settled the family on the banks of the
Mississippi River, in Muscatine, Iowa, a place that Mark Twain
loved for its crimson sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, they interned and completed their residencies
together at Brigham and Women's Hospital, earned medical degrees
and doctorates in anthropology, and teamed to form Partners in
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Partners, almost from the start, has been directed by five
people in all: Farmer; Kim; writer Ophelia Dahl, daughter of writer
Roald Dahl; philanthropist Thomas J. White, a Boston builder; and
Todd McCormack, a businessman. It now includes a new generation of
Harvard-trained medical scholars, all about 30 years old: Mercedes
Becerra, Jennifer Furin, Carole Mitnick, and Sonya Shin.
</P>
<P>
   The group's first focus was Haiti, the poorest nation in the
Western Hemisphere. There, they established a community health
center in the village of Canges. Farmer liked to call work in Haiti
``an area of moral clarity,'' because, he said, service to the
destitute and sick was ``morally, speaking, a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the community-based projects in Chiapas, Mexico; Lima,
Peru; and Boston. The latter is a $500,000 annual project called
Soldiers of Health, a partnership with a local group that helps
residents navigate and gain access to the health care system, even
if Brigham and Women's Hospital is just a subway stop away.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis, often tagged ``ebola with wings,'' because of its
lethality and because of its ease of spreading through air, has
become more entrenched and more difficult to treat in the past
decade, as inefficient control programs have helped create new
strains of drug-resistant TB. TB now kills more than 2 million
people a year, more than AIDS/HIV, or malaria, or any other
infectious disease. No vaccine exists. No new drugs have been
developed in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   It passes from person to person with a sneeze or a cough, the
tiny bacteria inhaled or ingested. A person sick with TB will
infect, on average, about 10 others a year. And once the TB bug
settles in someone's lungs and starts destroying them, it can move
to the brain, liver, kidney, and spine, setting off a fight between
the bug and a person's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Multidrug-resistant TB is much more complicated and expensive to
cure. But Farmer and Kim explained how they attacked the problem in
Peru to a group of TB control experts at a meeting in Cambridge
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came very skeptical about what these guys had
to say,'' said Dr. Howard Hiatt, former dean of Harvard's School of
Public Health and now professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School. ``They were blown away by what they heard. Imagine going
into an impoverished community in Peru and attacking a problem that
the experts said was insoluble and coming out with nearly 90
percent cure rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiatt believes that Farmer and Kim, in particular, ``are really
the ones responsible for this worldwide decision to address the
problem of MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB). It's not only for
humanitarian reasons, though that's what motivates Farmer and Kim,
but for practical reasons. As long as it exists, it's a threat to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The two longtime friends, Farmer and Kim, aren't shy about
articulating their fervent beliefs about the need for equal access
to health care for the poor. Sometimes that rankles others,
sometimes that wins them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmer challenged me,'' said Dr. Arata Kochi, director of
WHO's global tuberculosis program, referring to the meeting called
by Hiatt. ``Farmer said, `What are you going to do about MDR-TB?' I
told him we don't have the data yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kochi said there was a clash in perspectives: ``They see a
patient from a very individualistic perspective. We look at it from
a public health perspective, where we have to make priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no ill feeling from the meeting, he said,
adding, ``We need these kinds of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Kim say that they see matters from both humanitarian
and practical perspectives, even if their top priority is the care
of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   The jump into fighting drug-resistant TB worldwide comes with
substantial risks. One is financial. The group has been long
supported by White, the Boston builder, who is in the process of
giving out his last millions. Now it must find new sources of
funding. Hence, the appeals to the foundations of the barons. If
they don't secure funding in the next few months, they may be
forced to scale back their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is taking on too much. But they both have no doubt
their focus will remain the same _ O-for-the-P, as they like to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked about moving beyond Haiti and Peru, we decided
that we should do it, but only if we had a chance to impact on
international policy,'' Kim said. ``What we hope is that MDR-TB may
be the way of pushing forward this option for the poor movement. To
us, those with drug-resistant TB are among the most outcast, the
most marginalized people in the world. We will always remain
grounded in the experiences of the poor.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since midsummer, a nasty intestinal bug called shigella has
sickened hundreds of adults and children in western Massachusetts
with its customary misery of abdominal cramps, nausea, and bloody
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Shigella bacteria, which can spread through lax handwashing and
are sometimes found in food, rarely kill, and common antibiotics
like ampicillin and sulfa drugs usually knock them out. But when
doctors prescribed these antibiotics for the current outbreak, they
were disturbed to learn that the drugs didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started getting calls from pediatricians saying the kids
weren't getting better,'' recalled Dr. Donna Fischer, a children's
infections specialist at Bay State Medical Center in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Lab tests revealed that this particular strain of shigella was,
like an increasing number of bacteria today, resistant to the
first-line antibiotics that once killed them. Now, doctors in the
Springfield, Mass., area had to switch to more powerful
antibiotics, like augmentin and ciprofloxacin. It made treating the
outbreak ``a little more difficult and expensive,'' said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one skirmish in the great global battle pitting
medications once dubbed ``miracle drugs'' against wily bacteria,
which have often learned to outmaneuver them. Decades of too-casual
use and inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for colds or other
viral illnesses have enabled many disease-causing bacteria to
develop resistance to many of the drugs, and in some cases, to
nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   When antibiotics are overused, they create conditions under
which a few mutant bacteria that evade the drug can reproduce and
flourish. These resistant strains replace the normal bugs, and they
also can pass their traits to other microbes.
</P>
<P>
   This potentially disastrous trend has been worsening year by
year, but until recently, hadn't prompted much action. ``We have
failed to see the true dimensions of the problem,'' said Dr. Stuart
B. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine infectious disease
specialist who has been sounding the alarm for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jesse Goodman, a Food and Drug Administration official who
co-directs a federal interagency task force on antibiotic
resistance, said the problem is so serious that in intensive care
units of big hospitals ``we may have only one, or in some cases, no
effective licensed products to treat certain infections.'' And he
continued, ``in the community (outside hospitals), where tried and
true and inexpensive therapies may have worked for many, many
years, we may now have to use more expensive agents'' or ones that
have drawbacks, like side effects such as rashes, vomiting, and
muscular pains.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a counterattack is under way. Medical organizations here
and abroad are launching campaigns to promote more responsible use
of antibiotics. Pharmaceutical companies _ which 10 or 15 years ago
viewed antibiotics as a dwindling market because many infectious
diseases seemed to have been conquered _ have begun developing new
drugs that they hope will hold the fort against the superbugs, at
least for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   One such drug, Synercid, was rushed through approval by the FDA
this year for use against life-threatening infections by a bug
called enterococcus faecium. Even before approval, the FDA allowed
Syndercid to be used on an emergency basis for hospitalized
patients with enterococcus infections that were invulnerable to
vancomycin, a last-ditch antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is
developing a novel drug called daptomycin that's shown it can kill
vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in animals.
</P>
<P>
   Another new drug, still in the pipeline, is called Zyvox. If it
is approved, it will be the first antibiotic with a new way of
killing bacteria in the United States in 35 years; it's previously
been used in Europe and targets a part of the bug's life cycle that
hasn't been attacked before.
</P>
<P>
   And Tufts' Levy has jumped into the antibiotic fray himself,
forming a company along with Harvard's Nobel prize-winning
biologist Walter Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Their first project is to revive the potency of tetracycline, a
venerable antibiotic that has lost much of its power. ``Our goal is
to bring about a renaissance of tetracycline,'' which was
discovered in 1947 and was for decades a safe, reliable workhorse
antibiotic. The refurbished drug is in animal testing now.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston company, called Paratek, has won the confidence of
Glaxo, the pharmaceutical giant, which is putting up $95 million to
collaborate with Paratek in its effort to bring a rejuvenated
tetracycline to market, as well as other antibiotics yet to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Antibiotic Paradox,'' Levy relates one of the
earliest examples of the lifesaving power of penicillin. In the
early 1940s, a tragic fire in Boston's Cocoanut Grove nightclub
killed more than 400 people, but more would have died, Levy writes,
had the federal government not released some supplies of penicillin
to treat the survivors of the fire, who were at great risk of
lethal infections from severe burns. Penicillin was still a
top-secret drug, reserved for military use only. But during the war
and afterwards, penicillin took the spotlight as the first of the
``wonder drugs'' _ and for years it was available without
prescription, encouraging overuse of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotics halt infections by attacking some key structure or
event in the bacteria's life cycle, preventing it from reproducing.
But over time, bacteria exposed to rising levels of antibiotics
often adapt, evolving through mutations a strategy for foiling the
antiobiotic's assault.
</P>
<P>
   Levy discovered in the 1980s the clever evolutionary trick by
which some bacteria became resistant to tetracycline. The
antibiotic normally works by entering the bacterium through its
cell wall and jamming a genetic mechanism necessary for the cell to
reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Through years of exposure to tetracycline, though, some of the
strains developed tiny pumps in their cell walls. So now, when the
antibiotic entered the cell, it was immediately pumped out again,
like sailors bailing out of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   Paratek's scheme for thwarting the resistant bugs is to
bioengineer tetracycline with a molecule that blocks the pumps so
they can't remove the tetracycline. And, the scientists found,
these modified tetracycline versions also neutralize a separate
resistance mechanism deeper in the cell.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the more that antibiotics are used, the more they
seed their own destruction _ the ``paradox'' of Levy's book. By
some estimates, half the antibiotic prescriptions in the United
States each year are unnecessary; they're given for viral
infections against which they're ineffective, for example. In other
cases, patients stop taking antibiotics as soon as they feel
better, a dangerous practice because partially resistant bugs can
survive and add to the pool of resistant organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Giving antibiotics to farm animals in their feed is another
source of resistance, and one that the FDA, after years of urging
by activists like Levy, is scrutinizing. The agency has pubished a
proposed regulatory framework for reducing the drugs' use in
agriculture, said the FDA's Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, most troubling, are signs that resistant bugs once found
only in hospitals, brewed in intensive care units by the
unavoidably high use of antibiotics there, are making their way
into the outside world. In August, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported that four children had died since
1997 in Minnesota and North Dakota from common infections that had
become drug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who had previously been healthy, contracted
infections from staphylococcus aureus _ a leading cause of hospital
infections _ that couldn't be killed by methicillin, the drug
normally used to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those patients could have been treated with vancomycin, but it
was assumed you didn't get antibiotic resistant organisms outside
the hospital,'' said David K. Stone, managing director of Liberty
Tree Advisors of Acton, which follows the pharmaceutical industry.
``They were initially treated with antibiotics that weren't
effective, and by the time it was recognized'' it was too late to
save the young patients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly sharp worry is that vancomycin itself may become
ineffective against staph aureus infections, leaving no drug to
combat this common bug. The staph bacteria live harmlessly on the
skin of most people, but a break in the skin or another injury can
enable them to invade the heart, bone, and bloodstream with lethal
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the most widespread resistance problem involves
streptococcus pneumoniae, the germs that cause bacterial pneumonia,
ear infections, and meningitis. When pneumococcus invades the
bloodstream, it can be quickly lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, there were 60,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal
infections, ``and one-quarter were not susceptible to penicillin,''
said Dr. J. Todd Weber, senior medical officer at the CDC, adding
that one in seven of the cases involved pneumococci that were
resistant to three different classes of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Synercid, the new drug against vancomycin-resistant enterococci,
seems potent but hasn't yet been proven to reduce deaths from the
resistant bugs. In any case, Levy says, Synercid, while filling an
important need, ``is only a partial answer.'' For already, in
clinical trials, bugs resistant to Synercid have already appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, the FDA official, says that the need will continue
``for many different drugs and strategies'' to fight the resistance
problem. Some measures are as simple as more conscientious
handwashing, to reduce the spread of germs, to high-tech vaccines
that may prevent many infectious diseases that now are treated with
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   At present, he said, antibiotics old and new ``have saved many
lives, but given the nature of how microbes evolve, we can't rely
on any one drug or class of drugs to solve the problem.''

ECONOMIC SANITY FROM GORE, MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ From very different perspectives, John McCain
and Al Gore show they understand the fundamental lesson of the
1990s: Prosperity and a fiscally sensible federal government go
hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and George W. Bush, however, have some learning to
do. It's not too late for them, but in preaching to the core of
their constituencies, they risk the foundations of that prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of direct comparison in a still-nascent
campaign, Gore was right to pounce on Bradley for a health
insurance proposal that has gaping holes in it and that risks a
return to high-interest rates, stagnation, and flat incomes for
working families.
</P>
<P>
   And while McCain was dealing with a missing opponent for the
second week in a row, his jeremiads against the ruinous impact of
special interests on the government's skewed priorities displayed a
tough-minded conservative who is trying to show voters that
opposing those interests is the key to achieving conservative goals
like tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There is politics connected to the positions McCain and Gore are
taking, the right kind. Both are pitching at the roughly one-third
of New Hampshire's electorate that isn't partisan and tends to be
relatively upscale and well-educated. In the pivotal primary here,
these independent voters comprise as much as 20 percent of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, they are an important part of Bush's
front-runnership. And they have been the core, especially the males
among them, of the surge that has propelled Bradley to at least
parity with Gore. But they are notoriously fickle, and any notion
that prosperity is imperiled by a politician's campaign proposals
is more than enough to induce second thoughts or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the blarney and style points, last week's joint
appearances of the Democratic and Republican candidates briefly
linked the presidential campaign with the current budgetary mess in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back years of true (as in no borrowing of Social
Security funds) surpluses _ the first since the Eisenhower years _
a supposedly conservative Congress has begun returning to the old
habits of borrow and spend, and compounding the sin by disguising
it with preposterous gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   This matters greatly for the same reason it mattered that the
deficit era gradually ended in the '90s. The less government needed
to borrow, the more was available in the private sector for
productive, noninflationary, job-creating investment. And the less
government borrowed, the less pressure on the budget was exerted by
previously swelling interest payments on a ballooning national
debt. And the less that happened, the longer the economy enjoyed
the solid stimulus from lower interest rates. The wise guys call it
the virtuous cycle. But if the government starts misbehaving again,
that can easily work in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, everybody in Washington and on the campaign trail
is misleading the public. The allegedly at-hand era of surplus
rests on an extremely weak reed _ the assumption that spending
limits agreed in the budget deal two years ago will be enforced.
These would require truly deep cuts in basic domestic programs,
starting now. In case you've noticed, not even a conservative
Congress has started making those cuts, and even many Republicans
believe it shouldn't. Hence all the dishonest gimmicks to hide
their absence.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, meanwhile, supports easing those
limits, but to keep the books in order assumes that an increase in
cigarette taxes will cover the gap. In case you've also noticed,
that tax increase is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus, in short, could be an illusion. And that's why it
matters that McCain and Gore have put maintaining honest balance
ahead of their campaign proposals as a priority.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, cost figures that at first did not accompany his
major proposal were supplied. And one idea (universal preschool)
was scaled back to make it fit. McCain is even tougher. He would
finance military add-ons with swipes at Pentagon boondoggles he has
specifically identified. To make tax cuts for people possible, he
would junk the special-interest goodies that ate up half the vetoed
tax bill Congress passed last summer. That's why he's a campaign
finance reformer.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley has consumed by his arithmetic $800 billion of the
prayed-for trillion-dollar surplus with just three proposals so
far, the giant being universal health insurance. And with no
specific cost-containment measures for this explosion in demand, at
least two outsiders (one at Harvard, one at Emory) have insisted
that his cost estimate is low by fully half.
</P>
<P>
   And all you need to know about Bush is that he supported that
crackpot tax bill, all $792 billion of it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think it's any accident that Bradley and Bush are
preparing speeches outlining their thinking about the economy. So
far, they've got it backwards. Claiming to be bold won't reduce the
ranks of the uninsured, but it could threaten their jobs. And Bush
Mush may mask a lazy weathervane of a politician. Boring is better,
especially if it preserves progress.

AIRLINE SHUTTLE RULES NOT THE TICKET FOR COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Smith knows air travel is full of unpredictability, but
this much he thought he knew: Pay in advance for a flight, and the
airline is guaranteeing you a seat or compensation if it can't put
you on board.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's expectation turned out to be wrong when dealing with
the US Airways Shuttle, one of two shuttle services that fly from
Boston to New York and Washington, D.C. He found that with this
service, the concept of ``first-come, first-served'' is the only
one that really counts. A prepaid ``reservation'' doesn't mean
anything in the traditional sense.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's other shuttle carrier, Delta Air Lines, which charges
roughly the same prices as the US Airways Shuttle, says it promises
a seat to all ticketed passengers, even those arriving within a few
minutes of departure. Delta officials say anyone denied a seat gets
a free ticket and room on the next flight.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's recent mix-up with US Airways caused him and his wife,
Marcia, six hours of hassles one recent night, and nearly forced
them to make on-the-spot arrangements for an overnight stay in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this one, I was out of my mind,'' said Smith, 61, a
financial officer who lived in Needham, Mass. for 30 years before
moving recently to Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   At first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the evening of
Oct. 10, when the Smiths went to Logan Airport for an 8:15 p.m.
shuttle flight, the last of the night, to Washington's Dulles
Airport, near their new home.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had a written confirmation of their reservation for
the flight and, having paid at least 14 days in advance, each got a
$134 round-trip fare, about one-third of the full fare.
</P>
<P>
   Like other consumers, they appreciate the convenience of shuttle
services that operate every day with flights generally every hour
or every other hour and with reduced rates for weekend, off-peak,
and advance-purchase customers.
</P>
<P>
   When the Smiths arrived at the gate well before departure time,
their relaxed evening turned frantic: The gate agent told them no
seats were left. The agent said all seating was first-come,
first-served, the first notice the couple had that their tickets
guaranteed no seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I protested this cavalier approach, I was informed that I
could book the first flight out the next day,'' Stephen Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as agents offered the next-day flight and no sleepover
accommodations, they also reminded the couple to be there bright
and early because the US Airways Shuttle never guarantees a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he later learned from fellow travelers that two US
Airways shuttle flights earlier that evening had been canceled,
causing those passengers to bump many customers, like him and his
wife, booked for the 8:15 p.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   After much arguing with gate agents, he and his wife got on the
shuttle scheduled for 8:15, which did not leave until after
midnight. They ended up at their home around 2 a.m. the next day.
Smith said he and other travelers never got a satisfactory reason
why the plane was delayed for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the nonreservation issue gets worse. US Airways had
imposed a $75 penalty when Marcia Smith, earlier in the month, had
to cancel a shuttle ticket because of a change in plans. He said
she ``ended up paying $75 to cancel a flight that she didn't have
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the penalty, which he originally thought was
reasonable, now seemed outrageous. He likened it to a restaurant
owner charging a penalty for a reservation no-show, even though the
owner never saved a table for that person anyway.
</P>
<P>
   David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways based in
Arlington, Va., acknowledged that a prepaid ticket is no guarantee
of a seat, only the ability to secure a lower fare. He said
ticketed passengers _ whether they paid months in advance or that
day _ compete equally for seats once the gate opens an hour ahead
of departure time.
</P>
<P>
   Castelveter confirmed that a $75 penalty is charged to
passengers with advance-purchase tickets who make changes to the
itinerary or cancel. The only exception is that US Airways does
allow passengers to fly ``stand-by'' on the same day for a
different flight and will waive the fee.
</P>
<P>
   William Crumbley, managing director of the Delta Shuttle, said
``we hold that promise sacred'' that any ticket holder or walk-up
passenger is guaranteed a seat on the next shuttle, even if they
have to pull out an extra plane for only a few passengers. He said
Delta fulfills that promise 95 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   An infuriated Smith said US Airways ought to write out its
shuttle rules for customers like himself, so they can know when a
flight's rules differ from the standard practice. No such brochures
exist, and even our phone calls to US Airways ticket agents
produced different answers to the same questions.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Castelveter, such a shuttle-rules brochure is unlikely
given the complexity of the task. ``We'd issue a book,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   Bypass long-distance fees
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So many readers were interested in prepaid calling cards as a
way to avoid those onerous fees and charges showing up on
long-distance bills that we thought we'd provide updates on a
couple of other options.
</P>
<P>
   Calling over the Internet is one of our favorites. A computer
isn't necessary; you just have to dial some extra numbers. With
most companies, you dial an access number (local or toll-free),
punch in a pin number, and then dial the number you are calling.
The call is carried over the Internet and then routed on to the
local phone system wherever you are calling. You prepay for calls
with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   We've tried and liked Net2Phone Direct from IDT Corp. of
Hackensack, N.J. (877-627-4663), which charges 4.9 cents a minute
any time when a local access number is used and 7.9 cents a minute
using a toll-free number. Best of all, there are no extra fees or
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has its version called Connect'N Save (800-345-0995). It
charges 7.5 cents a minute any time using a local access number and
15 cents a minute with a toll-free 800 number. George Kelly of
Scituate has been using Connect'N Save since February and loves it.
``Sure it's a few extra numbers to dial, but I'm the kind of guy
who will drive around the corner to get a lower price,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Edgar Dworsky told us about Bigzoo.com, a Web
site offering a prepaid calling card without the card. Bigzoo
charges 3.9 cents a minute for all calls inside the United States
except Alaska and Hawaii, and uses regular land lines instead of
the Internet. Neither we nor Dworsky has tried Bigzoo, but the Web
site is intriguing.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   --Airline credit rules. A reader discovered, to her dismay, that
a credit voucher for an unused airline ticket was good for only one
year. Her voucher had expired and was now, she learned, useless.
``Can an airline establish such a rule?'' she asked. The answer is
yes. A federal transportation official said airlines are allowed to
establish any time restrictions on unused tickets.

IF ANYONE KNOWS DIETS, IT'S DEE DEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our all-purpose advice columnist's correspondence is clogged
with messages from anguished readers desperate for diet advice.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee knows the source of their panic. Last week, a special
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association reported
that more Americans are fatter than ever. It urged a national
antiobesity campaign to encourage us to quit pigging out and get
moving, for our health's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee, who has been on every diet known to woman _ and to man
too _ feels obliged, if not completely qualified, to respond to her
readers' cries for help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have been following ``Oprah's Cake and Cookies Diet,''
featured in a recent issue of the weekly tabloid Star, but I seem
to be gaining, not losing. Am I doing something wrong?
</P>
<P>
   _ Vexed, Gulfweed, R.I.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed you are. You have fallen for yet another fad diet. Why
not do as Dee Dee does? Eat one doughnut three times a day, drink
nothing but Diet Coke, and go to bed when you feel hungry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fat-melters. Sugar-busters. High this. Low that. None of these
new diets works for me. After I study all the details about what
I'm supposed to eat and when I'm supposed to eat it, I'm so
confused and frustrated I order in an extra-large pizza with
everything on it (except anchovies) and forget about dieting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discombobulated, Ducksmere, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee agrees that most diet plans are distressingly
complicated. You will probably be amazed to learn that science has
made a connection between how much you eat and how fat you are. So
try eating half what you normally do. Actually, in your case, you
may want to halve that amount yet again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   I have been following the diet outlined in the popular book
``NeanderThin: A Caveman's Guide to Nutrition.'' Recently I learned
Neanderthals have been extinct since the late Pleistocene era,
which I believe was some time ago. Is this what I can expect if I
stay on the diet?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrought-up, Passepartout, Maine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The caveman diet won't render you extinct, but the daily
exercise regimen, described as the ``equivalent of tracking down
and killing a woolly mammoth,'' could prove wearing over the long
haul. Dee Dee suggests you try an equally insane but less-strenuous
plan, perhaps the new ``blood-type'' diet, or that old standby,
eating naked in front of a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each time I fall off yet another crazy diet, I am tempted to try
a program of sensible eating and exercise. But I never do, because
I cherish the hope that some easy way to lose weight is just around
the corner. Am I fooling myself?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bemused, Full Circle, Conn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. Some researchers believe there may be a diet ``magic
bullet'' in our future. But will you _ and will Dee Dee _ live long
enough to see it? Perhaps, if we eat moderately and exercise
faithfully. But is it worth the terrible sacrifice?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I lost 50 pounds and wrote a book about it, ``The Joy of
Hunger.'' The basic concept involves learning to love feeling
hungry all the time. Unfortunately, I hate feeling hungry and I
have gained back the 50 pounds and then some. My book tour starts
next week. Should I come clean and cancel my appearances?
</P>
<P>
   _ Chagrined, Lobscouse, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why start being honest now? Remember, you're a diet book author.
Dee Dee advises you to wear black and brazen it out.

TOPPLING THE TABOO ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edmund Gordon recalls appearing at a conference of fellow
educators six years ago and bringing up a fact he took to be
self-evident: Blacks don't do as well as their white peers on a
host of academic measures, even blacks with affluent and
well-educated parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nearly chased out of the room,'' recalls Gordon, a
retired professor at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first time anyone had seen the data revealing
a gap between black and white achievement. But to talk about it
publicly was a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Today, not only are educators everywhere talking and writing
about it, but also minorities themselves are leading the
discussion. To acknowledge the so-called ``achievement gap'' no
longer guarantees being branded a racist.
</P>
<P>
   So why is the taboo lifting?
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it is the frenzy of new high-stakes tests, which are
becoming a graduation requirement in most states. The results,
broken out by race and income, are made public, published in
newspapers, and used by Realtors to determine the value of
neighborhoods. Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci is among those
promising to use them to rank schools in a sort of public hall of
shame. When the gap is in cold hard type for the world to see, it
is hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the courts' rejection of affirmative action has made
talking about why certain minorities don't achieve at the highest
levels a more pressing issue; top colleges want to see more
minorities doing well early on, so that they don't need racial
preferences when they apply to college.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference is the minority voice.
</P>
<P>
   Before the College Board issued a report this month urging a new
focus on raising minority achievement, black parents in 14
comfortable suburbs across the country had created a network to
identify the reasons behind the gap, and come up with promising
strategies to close it.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort is being widely watched because it gets at the most
perplexing question: Why are blacks in integrated, well-off towns
like these _ Shaker Heights, Ohio; Evanston, Ill.; Amherst _ still
so far behind whites in the same schools, when their parents make
the same amount of money, and have the same education? In fact, as
the College Board noted, black children whose parents attended
college score only about as well on nationwide reading and math
tests as white children whose parents didn't finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jeff Howard, director of the Lexington-based Efficacy
Institute, publicly urged his fellow minority parents to support
the controversial state MCAS test, calling it their best
opportunity to focus on closing the achievement gap. The quality of
their children's lives, he implored, depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We members of the minority community have not wanted to talk
about these issues,'' acknowledges Gordon, who heads a College
Board task force on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this discussion now is a recognition that if we don't
emphasize these issues, we're really going to be lost. In the 21st
century, the folks who can't reason, can't think critically, are
really going to be left out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand the historical discomfort when you
consider the tenor of discussions about race and achievement over
the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Thernstrom, who with her husband, Stephan, documented
the achievement gap in their 1997 book ``America in Black and
White,'' traces the uneasiness to the 1965 report written by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan that identified a vicious cycle of poverty and
fatherlessness in the black family. Moynihan, retiring next year
from the US Senate, was a policy adviser to President Johnson back
then.
</P>
<P>
   As Moynihan himself later recalled to a columnist, ``All hell
broke loose.'' The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. worried that
opponents of the Civil Rights Act would wield the report as proof
of some sort of innate laziness among blacks. Moynihan himself was
chased out of the administration, denounced for his ``racist
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the whole question of black culture off the table for
years,'' says Thernstrom, whose next book, also with her husband,
is about the reasons for the achievement gap. ``You couldn't talk
about the fact that these kids are coming into kindergarten so far
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap came to be more evident in the late 1980s, notes L.
Scott Miller, a College Board researcher, with the flood of new
East Asian immigrants, who tended to score in the highest levels of
achievement. This pushed up the averages, and made it more obvious
that blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately represented in
the lowest levels. In the 1990s, the non-Asian minority achievement
gap actually began to widen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was the fear that talking about this would somehow
imply that blacks were simply genetically less intelligent _ a view
echoed in ``The Bell Curve,'' the 1994 book by Richard Hernstein
and Charles Murray. While widely discredited, the book highlighted
a basic paradox: By shying away from talking about the achievement
gap, there was no hope of understanding why it existed, leaving the
public free to conclude that Murray and Hernstein were right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps driven by outrage about the book, many minority
researchers began investigating why blacks and Hispanics don't do
as well as whites. At the same time, says Adelaide Sanford, a
member of the New York State Board of Regents, ``We began to see
the test scores that showed a pattern of low-performing schools. If
we could talk about low-performing schools, rather than
low-performing children, that began to remove some of the
discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like those involved in the College Board task force
say they have more to learn. But they have begun to identify some
plausible reasons for the gap: Black and Hispanic students who do
well in school talk about being discouraged by their peers who
accuse them of becoming ``too white''; teachers admit to having
lower expectations for blacks, discouraging them from taking more
challenging courses; certain traditions, like college education or
having books in the home, don't run as deeply among more
newly-affluent black and Hispanic families as they do among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Even in today's more candid atmosphere, raising such
possibilities can still feel risky. Suggesting, say, that blacks or
Hispanics don't have enough books in the house or don't read to
their infants enough risks patronizing, moralizing, blaming. Eugene
Cota-Robles, who cochairs the task force with Gordon, acknowledges
that he has heard some complaints of this in focus groups already.
</P>
<P>
   But discomfort, he says, is no longer a viable option; staying
silent only risks condemning minority children to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Howard _ whose Efficacy Institute helps try to bridge the gap in
school systems in several cities, including Boston _ says there is
still not nearly enough discussion about the gap among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Winnetka or Newton, you don't have any black
parents in those communities talking about this,'' Howard says.
``The solution is for leadership to make a connection between
proficiency and citizenship for the 21st century. We have to make
clear what the mission is.''

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE UNDERWORLD SETTLEMENTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing here on the cusp of the new millennium, peering back at
the predictions of the last half century, one can't escape an
obvious conclusion: Some dastardly time bandit made off with our
future.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the dazzling modern amenities that were supposed to have
arrived by now.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater settlements. Domed cities. Space colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Automated highways. Hover trains. Endless energy.
</P>
<P>
   Smart homes and smarter offices. Robot maids. Even universal
health care.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the predictions proffered in the last half century for
life by the year 2000. And they weren't the pipe dreams of
harebrains and crackpots, but the best guesses from supposed
specialists: engineers and scientists, futurologists,
technologists, and professional trend-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   But just as in Michael Crichton's ``Westworld,'' somewhere,
something went wrong . . . wrong . . . wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to forecasting the future, two maladies commonly
distort the gaze: too little imagination or too much.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of the former is Charles Duell, who in 1899, as
commissioner of the US Office of Patents, opined that ``everything
that can be invented has been invented.''
</P>
<P>
   A more common failing, however, is an excess of imaginative
power. Futurologists, tingling with a love of technology and a
sense of endless possibilities, are particularly susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York World's Fair of 1964-65, the undersea city was
one of the promised marvels in General Motors' popular Futurama II.
At about the same time, Alister Hardy, an Oxford marine biologist,
declared that in 20 years, men would be using aquatic tractors to
cultivate crops on the sea floor, while divers would stay for days
in permanent undersea habitations.
</P>
<P>
   Others looked toward the heavens, found the sky illimitable, and
promptly got lost in space.
</P>
<P>
   Now predicting is not rocket science _ but rocket scientists
have long been predictors. We would have a manned station on the
moon by 1984, Wernher von Braun foretold in 1964; 50,000 people
would live and work in space by 2000, thought Robert Truax, another
rocket pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Futurologist Roy Mason figured 1989 was a more accurate date for
that, while Timothy Leary, then a professor at Harvard, felt man
would begin a massive migration to High Orbital Mini Earths, or
HOMES, in 1995, by which time Drew University professor Williams
Wescott expected we'd have satellite factories producing goods and
bouncing solar power to earth via microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur C. Clarke, the prolific science and science-fiction
writer, foresaw a manned lunar base by 1995, while science writer
Trudy Bell predicted the Soviets (remember them?) would colonize
the moon by then.
</P>
<P>
   A mere moon colony? Why, Gerald Feinberg, a Columbia University
physicist, said we'd build an artificial planet by 2000 _ and see
the birth of the first extraterrestrial tots.
</P>
<P>
   How to transport goods to space? Nothing as fanciful as ``Beam
me up, Scotty,'' certainly. How about the space elevator, a device
that would operate on a cable running, like a giant beanstalk, up
through the clouds to a geosynchronous satellite?
</P>
<P>
   That was a nostrum Clarke tried to popularize in the 1970s and
'80s. ``Clearly, if a satellite can remain poised forever above the
same spot on the equator, then, in principle, it should be possible
to lower a cable from orbit to Earth, performing an Indian rope
trick 36,000 kilometers high,'' he wrote. Cagily vague on the time
line, he said it would happen ``50 years after everyone stops
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   One who was not chuckling was inventor and designer Buckminster
Fuller, who noted that as early as 1951 he had proposed a man-made
space ring encircling the earth above the equator. To travel, one
would simply ascend to the ring-bridge, wait for the earth to turn
below, and then drop back to the desired location.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller's fecund imagination also saw the virtual reinvention of
the land-based city under climate-controlling domes. New York City
was a likely candidate, he said, as was East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That idea caught the fancy of other wool-gatherers, and Robert
Kenedi, a Scottish professor of bioengineering, predicted those
environmentally controlled towns by 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's time line for future progress, outlined in 1964, gives
some idea of the perils of prognostication. A half decade out, he
was doing pretty well, missing by only one year with his estimate
when he predicted a manned lunar landing by 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But what of his fusion delusion: power by combining atom nuclei
by 1990? Any number of more cautious soothsayers thought 1995 to
2000 was a likelier date, and Clarke later revised his estimate to
that date for commercial application.
</P>
<P>
   What to do while we wait for the promise of unlimited power?
</P>
<P>
   Enter, stage north, the huge chunks of glacial ice that,
futurologists Marvin Cetron and Thomas O'Toole predicted in their
1982 book, ``Encounters with the Future,'' would be towed south to
remedy the severe water shortages they foretold for the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Those icebergs, declared the diving duo, would also ``be used as
floating islands where the country can locate breeder power
reactors, using the melting glacial ice to cool down the reactors
while they produce enough electricity to light up entire coast
regions.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, once the breeder went bust and the cold-water-fusion craze
of 1989 turned out to be the scientific equivalent of a misplaced
Alka Seltzer bubbling away in a beaker, hope for power too cheap to
meter receded to more distant days.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have we eliminated hurricanes and typhoons, as Roger
Revelle, director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
thought we would. And if we're to have complete weather control by
2010, as Clarke thought, science had best get busy in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Futurologists took to the road with their predictions. Automated
highways were much in imaginary vogue, and we're not talking a
simple ``smart pass'' here, but systems in which drivers would
surrender their cars to remote roadway control, and let the central
computer set the speed.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about malfunctions? No need to be. By 1995 at the
latest, Sperry Corp. futurist Earl Joseph said, a new car would
have computerized collision-avoidance hardware to keep it
``virtually accidentless throughout its life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for steel wheels on steel rails? Gone the way of the horse
and buggy. The hovercraft subway was the wave of the future, with
cars that cruised on an air cushion, said Christopher Cockerell.
(As inventor of the hovercraft, Cockerell can perhaps be forgiven
his self-interested optimism.)
</P>
<P>
   And for cross-country travel, there was Rand physicist Robert
Salter's ``planetron,'' an underground mag-lev train that would
zoom from New York to Los Angeles in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And there was going to be plenty of time for travel. Life was
supposed to become more leisurely, not more hectic. ``There will be
shorter workweeks, 32 hours a week by 1990 and 25 hours a week by
2000,'' wrote Cetron and O'Toole. A common idea, the truncated
workweek, and the reasons were obvious: computers and robots.
</P>
<P>
   As office help, these machines were supposed to be
microelectronic Radar O'Reillys. Mention a meeting and a topic, the
authors confidently predicted, and your computer would log the
appointment, find the address, calculate your travel time, assemble
a dossier of relevant information _ and remind you when promptness
required your departure.
</P>
<P>
   Keyboards would become a thing of the past, replaced by ``direct
speech communication'' with your machine, predicted computer expert
Malcolm Peltu.
</P>
<P>
   And technology wasn't just for the workplace. Writing in the
1960s, British engineering specialist Meredith Thring envisioned,
within 20 years, a ``robot slave'' that could ``carry out half a
dozen or more standard operations (for example, scrubbing,
sweeping, and dusting, washing-up, laying tables, making beds).''
</P>
<P>
   In more modern predictions, add shoveling the snow, cutting the
grass, cooking meals, and acting as a sympathetic companion to the
elderly. (``Please Pro-vide Me With More In-for-ma-tion About Your
Lin-e-ar De-scen-dants One Gen-e-ra-tion Re-moved.'')
</P>
<P>
   Others thought robots would become so smart they'd teach our
children, whip us at Scrabble, and be nominated for a Pulitzer
Prize. And, horror of microelectronic horrors, perhaps eventually
they would grow so haughty about their obvious superiority that
they would subject us to cyber-tude and cyber-snubs. (That's a role
Gen X has graciously agreed to assume while we wait upon
technology.)
</P>
<P>
   Society's past difficulty with prognostication has not
discouraged a new crop of futurists. ``Predictions for the Next
Millennium,'' a 1998 book surveying some of today's best-known
citizens, is full of the same sort of notions: spaceships, robots,
orbiting cities, colonies on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, we will have to make do. So if you're living in
a not-so-smart home, muddling along without a mechanical maid, and
driving a car or taking a subway not so very unlike those of a
decade ago to an office where you're endtap-tap-tapping on
the same old keys of yore, well, feel free to lament your lost
future. And remember the words of Yogi Berra: ``It's tough to make
predictions, especially about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Editor's note: Information for this essay was drawn from a dozen
books about the future or futurology, including, prominently, ``The
Book of Predictions,'' ``1984 and Beyond,'' ``Encounters with the
Future,'' and ``Futurehype.''

IOWA TO PUT INTERNET VOTING TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ Chet Culver is the blond-haired son of a US
senator, a promising political star who is going to cause a
sensation here Tuesday at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Culver isn't running for election. He is running the
election process itself. And the newfangled way he's doing it is
making some people shudder.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Iowa history, voters this year can cast
their ballots over the Internet, part of an experimental program
that could lay the foundation for electronic balloting in all 50
states. As the youngest secretary of state in the country, Culver,
33, is a leading champion of the techno-strategy, which he hopes
will ultimately ``get more young people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Culver's test is entirely benign, with voters using Internet
connections alongside their polling stations, and only after they
have already cast ballots the traditional way. What is unnerving
some political scientists is a related idea being debated
nationwide: letting people elect officials over the Internet from
home.
</P>
<P>
   Because while an e-vote might attract a notoriously disengaged
young crowd, the physical act of voting still captures the
imagination of older advocates of civic life. To those who take it
seriously, showing up at the polls is a treasured form of
democratic expression, one that took two wars and six
constitutional amendments to secure for everyone 18 and over.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that clicking a computer mouse suggests a
monumental act. Skeptics worry that people voting remotely over the
Internet at home in pajamas, or while on the phone at work, might
be as casual about picking a president as they are about surfing a
Web site. At the same time, about half the country still has no
mouse to click.
</P>
<P>
   ``It redistributes the balance of power,'' said John Streck,
whose graduate research at the University of Iowa involved Internet
voting. ``Certainly, it would add to convenience and add potential
for  voting blocs, but what would be the hurdles put in
place? Who's got access to the Internet? On Indian reservations,
it's still only 50 percent penetration of telephones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sort of thing where, if you don't know much about it,
it sounds wonderful,'' said Lorrie Faith Cranor, a senior technical
staff member at AT&AMP;T Research Labs, who wrote her doctoral thesis
on Internet elections. ``The more you learn about it, the more you
realize there are potential problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem right now is technology; a full-scale
national election over the Internet would simply be impossible with
the systems currently on hand, Cranor said. As a result, some
half-dozen technology units, including one at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, are racing to develop a system that would
work.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not only scope but also security: ensuring that
voters remain anonymous and at the same time preventing voter
fraud. In Iowa, that will be accomplished by a two-step system.
First, voters receive a personal identification number, which they
enter when they log in to vote. Then, the vote is encrypted and
sent via the Internet to a computer clearinghouse, where it is
``read'' anonymously _ ``like putting it in a trash compactor, and
what comes out is the tabulation,'' says Jim Adler, whose company,
VoteHere.net, of Kirkland, Wash., is running the pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Such advanced research is being fueled by growing interest among
public officials frustrated by dwindling numbers at the polls. In
1996, a full 100 million people eligible to vote did not do so,
election specialists said, and in 1998 only 15 percent of people
between the ages of 18 and 24 voted.
</P>
<P>
   At least three states concerned with low voter turnout are
considering tests similar to Iowa's, and two states, Washington and
Virginia, have already conducted theirs, which they considered
successful, with no security breaches. California has commissioned
the most comprehensive study on Internet voting yet. Even the US
Department of Defense is hoping to ``rock the vote.'' In August,
military officials announced that some 350 military personnel will
be able to send ballots back to their home states via the Internet
in the 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given how low voter turnout is, it is hard to say that the
ritual of going and standing in line at the polls is any longer
anything that attracts people to voting,'' said Alan Brinkley, a
history professor at Columbia University. ``I suppose one could
argue that what one would see would be the diminishing of the civic
quality of voting. . . . .But there are already many ways people
can vote without going to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Internet voting are not suggesting that the
polling stations should be eliminated _ at least not anytime soon.
Culver envisions ``having both options available at the precincts''
in Iowa so busy people can drop in at any site in their voting
district, a convenience format akin to absentee voting. Adler
agrees that ``there is a good reason people like going to the
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a community there,'' Adler says. ``But there is also
a community on the Internet. We really think it's going to be an
adjunct and not a replacement for voting booths.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such confidence, simply adding the Internet to the list
of voting devices may not be as easy as it sounds. Although states
are charged with running their own elections, civil rights laws
dating to the 1960s give the US Justice Department the power to
intervene when a voting bloc is denied equal access to the polls.
In several states, Justice officials are required to approve even
minor voting law changes to guard against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The US Commerce Department estimated in 1998 that only 26.2
percent of American households with computers actually used the
Internet. Of those, an overwhelming number were white. As a result,
the Federal Election Commission determined this September that ``it
is highly unlikely that the Department of Justice would preclear
any law implementing widespread Internet voting at the present
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the phenomenal growth of Internet usage . . .
access . . . must be made available to all Americans in order for
it to play a significant role in the democratic process,'' the FEC
paper said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet as businesses move increasingly on line, and with
thousands of Americans joining the Internet each month, it is hard
to imagine politicians leaving the constituency untapped.
</P>
<P>
   Culver certainly isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He promised the Internet initiative from the beginning of his
political career, declaring in a 1998 campaign speech that he would
start ``exploring the use of technologies, such as the Internet,
e-mail, and digital signatures, which will allow Iowa citizens and
businesses better access to state government.'' Culver, a Democrat,
insists the platform helped him win _ although he had a helpful
family legacy in his father, former Iowa Senator John Culver.
</P>
<P>
   Culver moved swiftly to fulfill his promise, revamping the
secretary of state Web site and launching a personal ``get out the
vote'' tour in 55 counties throughout the state. On the road, he
said, he discovered something even worse than low voter turnout:
vacant ballots. Voter apathy was so severe, he said, no one wanted
to run for the seats.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was convinced: ``It's time to be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which in 1972 launched its first-in-the-nation
presidential caucus to counter a tide of voter alienation, seems
receptive to the idea of experimenting with municipal elections.
Last month, a Cedar Rapids newspaper editorial headline warned that
Internet voting ``cheapens the value of the vote.'' But the thrust
of the piece was that voters themselves were the problem. It
demanded: ``How much farther must we stoop to make sure no citizen
is forced to expend any effort to vote?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A master switch somewhere to turn on every personal computer
might be nice,'' the editorial concluded. ``Sure says a lot about
the value we place on our right to vote, doesn't it?''
</P>

20 YEARS LATER, FORMER REVOLUTIONARIES ARE REFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ Twenty years after Iranian student radicals stormed the
US Embassy here and took 56 Americans hostage, the anti-American
murals on the walls of the compound are being freshly repainted to
commemorate the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   To many who led the Nov. 4, 1979, assault, there is irony in the
walls of the old embassy, home now to an Iranian Revolutionary
Guard military academy. The young revolutionaries have become
Iran's graying intellectual reformers who believe it's time now to
reconcile with the United States, not repaint static slogans of an
anti-Western orthodoxy they see as anachronistic.
</P>
<P>
   Leading what they call ``the second revolution,'' they are now
challenging the crushing puritanism of the Islamic clerical
conservatives. And they are again challenging forces within those
walls _ not Americans in the US State Department, but Iranian
teenagers fresh out of the Revolutionary Guard academy who become
the conservative clerics' muscle in the battle over Iran's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes history makes fun of us,'' says Abbas Abdi, 41, with
a shrug of his narrow, stooped shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Abdi, wearing a thick shock of black hair, was one of
the masterminds of the taking of the embassy. Now he is a balding
journalist for the liberal newspaper Sobh-e-Emrooz, and an
articulate spokesman for the yearning for change and a democratic
form of Islamic rule expressed by reformist president Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading reformer who was among the handful of student
leaders who planned and executed the embassy takeover is Mohammed
Ibrahim Asghar-Zadeh. There are flecks of gray in his neatly
trimmed beard, and he is, at age 41, a managing director of the
Iranian National Steel Co. Now he favors tweed sports jackets and
is proud of his recent election to Tehran's influential City
Council as a reform leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to breathe,'' Asghar-Zadeh says, sitting in
his plush office. ``For Khatami to succeed he has to achieve his
economic program. The US is strangling that. And if Khatami is not
allowed to succeed, the fight for civil society will collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Both former revolutionaries are now strategizing for candidates
in parliamentary elections scheduled for February. The elections
are shaping up to be a definitive battle between Khatami's
reformers and the hard-line Islamic clerics.
</P>
<P>
   To the hard-liners, the two are apostates who have lost their
way, turning to Western values that run counter to the goals of the
Islamic revolution. But to a growing majority, especially among
youth and women, they are the vanguard of a movement that
recognizes it is time to renounce revolutionary excesses and open
Iran to what they call ``civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men have paid a price for their beliefs. Abdi spent nine
months in prison in 1993 when he made his first statements
supporting change in Iran. He was sentenced to solitary confinement
in Tehran's infamous Evin prison, where, in the early years, many
who were deemed counterrevolutionary were hanged. In 1998, his name
was placed on a ``death list'' established by the intelligence
ministry. Five people on that list were assassinated by an
intelligence ministry death squad late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Asghar-Zadeh has been repeatedly threatened as well. Late last
year, he was physically attacked by conservative students after he
spoke at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi's shy demeanor and mild manner seems worlds away from the
wrath of fury that he and his fellow students unleashed in the
early days of the Islamic revolution. He seems to embody the
writhing change in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his transformation, Abdi met in July with Barry
Rosen, a former embassy hostage who is now an administrator at
Teachers College of Columbia University. The meeting was part of a
cautious reevaluation underway in Iran of the hostage taking. Abdi
says he is not seeking forgiveness but wants to reach an
understanding with his former captives of how they were all
``brought to that particular point in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdi does not disavow the taking of the hostages, but he openly
recognizes the suffering it caused the individuals and hopes that
Iran and the United States will reach a form of rapprochement.
``The majority of the goals of the revolution have been fufilled,''
he says. ``What took your country 200 years, took us 20. And we are
proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took the embassy, it was a necessary action in the
context of the time. We were reacting to despotism,'' Abdi says.
``Now it is time for a different course. Now it is time for us to
build a society based on what we have learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Abdi and Asghar-Zadeh came to the forefront of the student
movement from poor backgrounds. They had been able to attend
university because of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's effort to offer
free public education in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And they both saw that their traditional, religious background
was the strongest framework for opposition to the shah, who was
brutally suppressing religious communities and the clerics who were
speaking out against him. They were zealous supporters of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who would become absolute ruler in February
1979, when the shah's rule crumbled. (Khomeini died in 1989.)
</P>
<P>
   The two men were both leaders of a committee of students from
three universities. They began planning a taking of the US Embassy
_ getting blueprints of the layout from sympathetic Iranian staff
inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   The capturing of the embassy was fairly spontaneous and took on
a life of its own, remembers Asgar-Zadeh: ``In less than 24 hours
we were transformed into a professional organization of hostage
takers. We were not at all like that; it was not the goal of the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman carried steel cutters under her chador to cut the chains
that padlocked the wrought-iron gates, he remembers. Then when the
gates burst open, a rush of approximately 400 students charged the
embassy. None of them were armed, he said. They ripped the steel
grates off windows and poured in through a basement window. There
was virtually no resistance from the Marines in the compound and
the United States seemed remarkably off guard.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi showed a collection of photos the students took the first
morning inside the building, an archive of the decisive moment in
Iran's history. In one, a smashed and tattered picture of President
Carter lies in a pool of water, and shredded documents are strewn
everywhere in the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Other photos show students with images of Khomeini around their
necks, students wearing the styles of the 1970s, V-neck sweaters,
big collars, bell-bottoms. Abdi points to faces and struggles to
remember them: ``He is in advertising, he runs a paper company, he
is a schoolteacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to hold the hostages for only several days to
protest Carter's fateful decision to admit the shah to the United
States for medical treatment, both men say. But when the United
States did not back down, the hostage-taking became Khomeini's way
to consolidate power in a fractious revolutionary time.
</P>
<P>
   The taking of the embassy has become canonized in the history of
the revolution. Conservatives consider anyone who challenges it or
wishes to rethink its impact a counterrevolutionary. Here, that can
easily mean a prison sentence. It can easily mean death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are some who cautiously express their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Fariborz Rais-Dana, 50, a prominent economist and author, was a
mentor to the student radicals. He was 30 when the hostage crisis
began, and his students looked up to him throughout, even though he
had cautioned them against taking the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion it was a very big mistake. We delivered an image
to America of violence and recklessness, when, in fact, we were
under siege and fragile and struggling to do the right thing, which
was overthrowing a corrupt, tyrannical king just like you did in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Yazdi, a political activist who has been jailed on and
off in recent years for his opposition to the clerical
establishment, is also cautiously critical, despite the risk of
being so. In 1979, he was on the 15-member Revolutionary Council
and later the foreign minister under the provisional government.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage taking occurred at a time when they were trying to
stabalize the revolution, says Yazdi, and political change was
moving in the right direction. ``If they did not do that (storm the
embassy), all of it would have been in favor of a democratic
government _ a traditional, liberal government not controlled by
rightists, but more moderate ellements.''
</P>
<P>
   Yazdi even goes so far as to suggest that unseen forces in the
US intelligence community actually pushed the students to act so
that the revolution would be discredited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran did not acheive anything from taking the hostages. We
hurt American pride. But are we supposd to build Iranian interest
or merely wound the pride of a superpower? That was the question of
the day. We as revolutionaries should have focused on protecting
our own intrests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the students recognize it as something they regret,'' he
says, explaining that privately many of the students have expressed
this to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up helping to impose the conservative clerical
government that now restricts their vision of what this country
should be,'' said Yazdi. ``It took 20 years, lots of suffering,
eight years of war, billions of dollars, many lives, just to find
out that it was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdi and Asghar-Zadeh dismiss the questioning of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to question the US embassy capture you have to
question the revolution itself,'' says Abdi. ``The emotions, the
momement, the expression was the fruit of capturing it. It gave the
revolution momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that even if there were forces in the United States that
wanted the taking of the embassy for their own political purposes,
it would not matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make no difference. We had to defend our own
interests,'' he said. ``We feared war, we feared a coup. And we had
to act. So even if this came out as a truth, it would not change
our history.''

SOUTH AFRICA REVISITS LEGACY OF ITS WAR, DOWN TO THE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Having shed apartheid five years ago, roughly on
the eve of the centenary of the Boer War, South Africa is now
poised to rewrite a narrative that for most of the century was
dominated by the Afrikaner point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Historical revisions can be important, especially for societies
trying to redefine themselves after decades of exclusion and
oppression. But as the country commemorates the firing of the first
shots of the war 100 years ago this month, a war that laid the
basis for the territorial unity of modern South Africa, the flurry
of today's newfound inclusiveness is making yesterday's tragedies
hard to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems to know anymore what to call the battle between
British soldiers and Dutch descendants for control of the gold- and
mineral-rich lands at the southern tip of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have always called it the Boer War, or the Anglo-Boer
War. But ``Boer'' has fallen into disrepute. The British recently
suggested that it is derogatory (even if Afrikaners still use it to
describe themselves).
</P>
<P>
   Afrikaners have always called the battle The War _ a name that
reflects the Boer view that it was always about them, their
suffering, their oppression, their need for freedom. They were
shaped by it, much as the American South was shaped by the Civil
War. Others now say that ``Boer'' and ``Anglo-Boer'' fail to
acknowledge the role blacks played in the fighting. Hence, new
names have been suggested, such as Anglo-Boer South African War or,
simpler, the South African War.
</P>
<P>
   These latter terms invite new problems, and South African
newspapers are filled these days with fresh disagreements. The
Afrikaner poet and journalist Antjie Krog argued in the weekly Mail
and the Guardian recently that it is time to recognize that blacks
fought and suffered in the conflict, but that under apartheid, the
war became exclusively Afrikaner lore: ``Because the Anglo-Boer
South African War lacked an inclusive narrative, it became an
exclusive myth. The centenary is about finding that comprehensive
story.''
</P>
<P>
   John Matshikiza, a black columnist for the same publication,
took exception. Blacks might have been exploited, forced into
menial servitude for one side or the other, but the war was never
about their emancipation, he said. ``The Boer War, or the
Anglo-Boer War, or the South African War, as it is referred to by
those anxious not to offend minority sensibilities on either side,
was decidedly not a war in which the majority of the population had
a stake. It was a white man's war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thabo Mbeki, once a freedom fighter struggling against
Afrikaner domination, now president of ``the rainbow nation,'' ever
a towering intellect, had trouble picking his way through the
battle field of modern inclusiveness. Laying a wreath at a war
memorial last week, he said the Boers ``had courage to take on
Goliath in defense of their freedom. Black allies who stood side by
side with the Boers were ready to lay down their lives for their
freedom and land.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was identifying, in a common past, the basis for a
common future between foes of a later South African conflict. But
to keep the John Matshikizas of his country happy _ not to mention
one of South Africa's most important trading partners, Mbeki added
of the blacks: ``Others said they could align themselves with the
British to reclaim their freedom and land.''
</P>
<P>
   The British had the final word on the battlefield a century ago,
and seem ready to have it again today. Laying a wreath at a war
memorial last week and offering an apology on behalf of his nation
for the suffering endured by Afrikaner women and children in
British concentration camps during the war _ an apology less
explicit and more implied _ Britain's Prince Edward, the duke of
Kent, said, ``Today we can agree that the war was not just a white
man's war as has been claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least not just a white man's debate anymore.

IN AFRICA, HIRED GUNS HELP KEEP THE PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ A generation ago, in the blood-soaked
Belgian Congo, in Biafra, and in other gruesome conflicts of
post-colonial Africa, they were known as ``les affreux'' _ the
terrible ones.
</P>
<P>
   They were the white mercenaries, the Wild Geese, the ``dogs of
war,'' freebooting soldiers of fortune who, for a suitcase full of
hard currency, would pull the trigger for any cause, no matter how
dubious or despicable.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, most had limped off into retirement or had
disappeared into a jungle grave. Their day seemed done in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a new breed of Western soldier for hire is looming
large on this continent, where endless woe is matched only by
boundless and still largely unexploited natural riches. In some
countries, including Angola and Sierra Leone, the freelance
soldiers are quietly encouraged by the United States, Britain, and
other Western nations alarmed by Africa's descent into greater
chaos but fearful of risking their own troops on peacekeeping
expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by the glitter of diamonds, the whiff of crude oil, and,
above all, the prospect of fat contracts from African countries
under the gun or Western mining companies trying to operate in
those same countries, a host of security specialists, military
consultants, and combat operatives from corporate armies based in
London, Pretoria, and Washington, D.C., are flocking to Africa's
woes.
</P>
<P>
   And if the old mercenaries were a relic of Africa's colonial
past, the new mercenaries may be a portent of an even grimmer
future _ for they appear to be filling a vacuum created by the
increasing refusal of Western nations, and of the United Nations,
to intercede in the world's ugliest ``humanitarian disasters,''
euphemism for the famines, genocides, and other massive miseries
spawned by brutal internecine conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest wars of the second half of the 20th century are
the bush wars of Africa, with millions of lives already lost in
obscure conflicts, from Angola to Sudan, expected to become even
more savage and intractable as the continent lurches into the next
millennium. The combination of upheaval and almost incalculable
mineral riches _ especially in such ``failed states'' as Sierra
Leone _ is an irresistible magnet for the new soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fast-expanding business,'' said Jim Davis, partner in a
small firm, Globe Risk Inc., that offers security services to
mining companies operating out of this steamy capital, where
mercenaries quaff beer in the same bars frequented by the relief
workers also descending in droves. The country ranks last on almost
every UN index of misery, but boasts diamond deposits so rich that
in some places the raw gems can be kicked from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're politically correct alternatives to the old-style
mercenaries,'' said Davis, a former paratrooper with Canada's elite
Airborne Regiment. ``We don't overthrow governments. We don't do
combat operations. We do training and security.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are less squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   The new age mercenary was created by a South African firm,
Executive Outcomes Ltd., which beginning in 1989 dispatched
military professionals, from machine gun squads to air crews, to
fight for profit in Sierra Leone, Angola, and other hot spots in
Africa and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Outcomes, whose executives, like so many corporate
honchos, often seemed torn between a lust for publicity and a love
for cloak-and-dagger secrecy, announced this year that it was
shutting down in compliance with a new South African law
restricting mercenaries. But the company lives on in an array of
cross-linked specialized military, logistics, and communications
firms whose arsenal-for-hire includes military transport planes,
attack helicopters, heavy machine guns, light artillery, and even
field hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   On one extreme of the modern mercenary spectrum are the handful
of firms able to provide serious military firepower for paymasters
with deep pockets, usually governments. For example, Sierra Leone's
democratically elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, was ousted in
a 1997 coup but shot his way back to power last year with
assistance from Sandline International, a British firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other extreme are small security teams, like Globe Risk,
staffed by former soldiers willing to work in regions of
hair-raising hazard. In between are companies with specialized
expertise, whether flying cargo into hot zones, training artillery
teams or performing such nonviolent but high-risk tasks as clearing
land mines, arranging release of corporate kidnap victims, or
cutting deals with guerrilla warlords for safe passage of mining
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The mercenary trade is nearly as old as warfare itself. A
mercenary is a contract soldier in foreign service. The Romans used
them. King George III paid German mercenaries to fight American
revolutionaries. And France's Foreign Legion is essentially a
mercenary force of hirelings from around the world, including
criminals on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new companies converging on Africa different from
the old white mercenaries are high standards of military
professionalism coupled with a corporate structure little different
from any other international business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of organizing clandestinely, today's mercenaries
operate out of office suites, have public affairs staff and Web
sites,'' said David Isenberg, analyst with DynMeridian, a security
and military consulting firm in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are usually highly trained and organized into
incorporated, registered businesses,'' he said. ``As conflicts
continue, and major states become more reluctant to undertake
humanitarian interventions, these private military companies are
going to play a significant future role.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still plenty of murderous misfits and outright
psychopaths plying the mercenary trade in Africa. The ``white
legion'' of Serb militiamen and French thugs recruited by Zaire's
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, certainly wreaked mayhem, and may have
been guilty of massacres, as that country collapsed in 1997.
Freebooters from Europe are still running guns to UNITA rebels in
Angola, while Israeli commandos have been linked to arms supplies
reaching the butcherous insurgents of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   According to intelligence sources, at least 90 private armies _
mostly composed of former military personnel from the United
States, Britain, Canada, Israel, France, and South Africa _ are
selling their services in Africa, not only to governments but also
to Western-owned mining operations, UN agencies, and even
humanitarian agencies working under cross-fire conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of mercenaries are working in Africa today, compared
with dozens a decade ago. But companies like Sandline and Military
Professional Resources Inc. claim to have thousands of military
specialists on call, ready for rapid deployment to any trouble spot
in the world _ and they boast that they can respond to military
emergencies more rapidly than can any national army.
</P>
<P>
   ``State systems are breaking down in parts of Africa. At the
same time, the end of the Cold War has resulted in a loss of
appetite among nations of the West, especially the US, for direct
intervention in Africa,'' said Douglas Fraser, executive director
of the Canadian Council for International Peace and Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, these private military companies are
stepping into the void,'' Fraser said. ``Privatization of security
is a growth industry, and there's concern that African nations may
be mortgaging their natural resources and surrendering some of
their sovereignty to these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   While most private military companies work under straightforward
terms of payment, others barter their skills for lucrative mining
concessions and other unusual incentives, pledged by impoverished
nations with nothing else to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Such organizations as Sandline International or Executive
Outcomes Ltd. provide client states with front-line firepower
capable of turning the tide of a bush war _ combat helicopters,
mortar teams, commando units, and armored assault vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we expect to get paid, but we are a lot less expensive
than a sovereign or UN force,'' said Tim Spicer, the much-decorated
former British Army colonel who heads Sandline. ``And casualties
among private military companies don't have the same emotional
impact as among national forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms, notably Military Professional Resources Inc., a
Virginia-based company founded by retired US Army generals that
claims to offer ``the world's greatest corporate military
expertise,'' restrict themselves to training and support
operations, refusing combat roles as a matter of policy. MPRI
reported $48 million in earnings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying very hard to eliminate the mercenary image,''
said Ed Soyster, vice president of international operations for
MPRI. He is a retired US Army general who served as head of the
Defense Intelligence Agency. ``No one at MPRI carries a gun,
although we all carried guns in our former lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether they fight, train others to fight, or provide
military-style security services in violent realms, many of these
private organizations are serving as proxies for Western foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola, for example, the Clinton administration is quietly
nudging the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to hire
MPRI to provide training and other assistance, according to
military analysts.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the Cold War, Africa is no longer a prize.
Western military aid to Africa has plunged precipitously. That may
be a good thing, but, in backing away, the West also has lost the
ability to restrain African governments and insurgency movements
from the worst excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The West's fear of wading into another African quagmire is the
main reason mercenary soldiers are staging a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising aspect of the surge of private military and
security operations in Africa in recent years is that, though still
controversial, these new hired guns are increasingly perceived as
potential guardians of whatever order still exists in the countries
most savaged by violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It speaks to how bad things have turned in parts of Africa
that the arrival of mercenaries on the scene is no longer always
seen as bad news by humanitarian groups,'' said a European surgical
nurse, Greta Van Ryswyk, treating war victims in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When mercenaries arrive, the rebels run and fighting stops,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when fighting stops, that's when people finally get help,
that's when babies get fed.''

SENIOR CITIZEN RODEO COMPETITOR SEES NO END TO THE TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At 71 years old, Bill Cresta is one of your
older addicts around and an unrepentant one at that.
</P>
<P>
   His vice _ if you can call it that _ is riding in rodeos, a
passion that many of his peers can only enjoy as spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sky diving,'' Cresta, of Santa Rosa, Calif.,said.
``It's just an adrenaline high.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Cresta got into the arena and indulged his
addiction at the 1999 Grand National Rodeo Horse and Stock Show at
the Cow Palace. Riding alongside 65-year-old partner Jack
Montgomery, Cresta participated in the rodeo's first senior team
roping competition.
</P>
<P>
   At a combined age of 136, the pair was the oldest of the five
teams in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   For Cresta, who grew up roping in the shadow of the Cow Palace,
rodeo is as much a part of him as the air he breathes.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Montgomery said they can't imagine giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost worse than an addiction or I wouldn't be at it
this many years,'' said Montgomery, who lives in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   The team roping was just one of many events, which was
designated Senior Day. The program also included bareback bronc
riding, barrel races and steer wrestling. None of the participants
in those sports was a senior citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The senior team roping was added for the first time to spice up
the program and play to Saturday's older crowd, Grand National
public relations director Al Guthertz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to get everyone involved so it's not just the young dudes
out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cresta, for his part, thinks nothing of mounting a horse and
chasing down calves, saying he has too much fun to get caught up
with his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any athlete, if he stays with a sport, never quits
and stays healthy,'' he said. ``It's no tougher than when you were
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Team roping is an intricate sport requiring the cooperation of
two skilled ropers. The first roper or ``header'' snares the calf's
horns or head, then leads the animal toward his partner. As the
animal kicks and wrestles with the rope, the second roper lassoes
the animal's legs. It doesn't always go off perfectly _ but when it
does, it's pure magic, ropers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you just see those heels fly up, it's just one of the
greatest feelings in the world,'' Dusty O'Farrall, 62, of Santa
Rosa, said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Farrall started roping when he was 6 and only begrudgingly
admits that he might have lost a step or two over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I'm as fast as I once was, but every once in a
while these kids will show me I'm not,'' he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   During the competition, Montgomery burst out of the shoot and
snared the calf's horns but Cresta missed the legs, much to his
chagrin. O'Farrall and his partner Lee Persico didn't fare any
better. For many of the seniors who showed up Saturday, it was
still a treat to see their peers out there roping cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just in their prime,'' John Osmers, 81, of Santa
Clara, said. ``It's very encouraging to see they still have the
stamina to go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of riding and roping, the ropers said they'd
sooner die than hang up their boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep doing this until they have to pry me off the
saddle,'' O'Farrall said. ``If you're a real cowboy, you never
quit.''

   EGYPTAIR _ QUONSET POINT, R.I. _ The Coast Guard kept up a grim
search for survivors in the choppy waters off Nantucket Island
early today as hope dwindled of finding anyone alive from EgyptAir
Flight 990. Navy divers and a salvage ship are expected to arrive
off the Massachusetts coast by tonight to help in the search for
debris. While relatives mourned the 217 passengers and crew
members, investigators began the painstaking task of figuring out
what caused the jetliner to plummet into the sea from 33,000 feet
early Sunday.(Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitutioin).

   ANGELS-MILCRASHES _ The F-18 jet fighter crash that killed two
members of the Navy's Blue Angels demonstration team last week is
among more than 100 aviation incidents linked to military air shows
since 1972. Never-before released computer records show a
disproportionate number of those incidents _ 46 _ were major
accidents, killing at least 97 people and causing more than a
quarter of a billion dollars in damages. Among the dead were at
least six civilians, one described by Navy records as an adolescent
ejected from a parked aircraft at an airshow in Maryland in 1980.
Seeking comment on whether the crashes raise questions about using
demonstration teams for recruitment purposes. (Carollo, Dayton

converting Sunday readers to every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be posted on your Web site, as a sure-fire traffic
draw. There new readers can catch up with the narrative, or collect
all the chapters. The novel will also spark reader exchanges on the
Web, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be distributed as an advertiser-supported giveaway at
newsstands, with two or three episodes as a lure to bring readers
to the newspaper series.

NATION'S OLDEST LUTHERN CONGREGATION CELEBRATES 350TH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THAI JONES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In 1649, a mere 132 years after Martin Luther
nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the chapel door in Wittenberg,
followers of his faith founded the First Lutheran Church of Albany,
the oldest Lutheran congregation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The church is celebrating its 350th anniversary this year,
culminating in a festival service on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, services at the First Lutheran have been
delivered in Dutch, High German (as of 1760) and English (since
1808). The name of the town in which the church stands has changed
from Fort Orange, to Beverwyck in 1652, and finally to Albany in
1664. The land beneath it has been part of The Dutch West India
Company, the British Empire and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 350 years there have been 42 U.S. presidents, two World Wars,
29 popes in Rome, 13 kings and four queens of England. The Yankees
have won 25 World Series, McDonald's has served billions and
billions of burgers, and Halley's Comet has appeared four times. It
is older than any living human, but not beyond the grasp of a
collective human memory.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Mosmen, who is 100 years old and has been a church member
for 49 years, said, ``it's wonderful that the congregation has
stayed together.''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation has outlasted five church buildings over the
centuries. The original church was built just within the stockade
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Christoph, who serves as church archivist along with
her husband, Peter, can claim descent from the brother of an
original member of the 17th-century congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Bredt was a prominent businessman, church elder and fur
trader. Florence moved to Albany in 1965 and has been a member of
the church for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when I found out,'' she said, referring to the
discovery of her relationship to the well-known Bredt. ``There are
people around, tombstones around, and it makes me feel a part of
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the archives is the church register with long lists of
deaths, births, and marriages. It is a straight-ruled record of
life and love and death for two centuries of Albany residents.
These are the things that the congregation at First Lutheran will
be celebrating Sunday, when their year-long anniversary
commemoration culminates with a celebrity-filled gala on
Reformation Day.
</P>
<P>
   They will celebrate 350 years of history, of dusty books, framed
deeds and charred remnants of former sanctuaries. They will
celebrate the 70 original families and the current 475 members,
including Mosmen, who remembers when almost nobody had a car and
she had to walk to church each Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is a celebration of the life of a community as well as the
congregation, and it is a tribute to the hardiness of its
inhabitants living and dead that Albany has clung to the cold and
often dreary banks of the Hudson River for so long.
</P>
<P>
   As the first Lutheran himself said, ``Here we stand; we can do
no other.''

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it
forever. Our Pirates fan says the first 10 ``greatest moments'' are
fun, but after that the editors make some faulty picks and leave
themselves open to ridicule. As we said, it's that kind of book. &QL; 
``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DREAMS (Undated) _ In the last five years, new work has
forced scientists to rethink their understanding of dreaming and
the brain, granting a much more active role to brain areas involved
in motivation, emotion, memory and visual processing. The new
findings do not validate the particulars of Sigmund Freud's dream
theories, published 100 years ago this month, or prove that dream
interpretation is, as Freud asserted, ``the royal road to a
knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.'' But neither
are the results inconsistent with psychoanalytic thinking. By Erica
Goode. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DREAMS-FREUD (Undated) _ A century after the publication
Freud's ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' the ideas first given
shape in its pages have seeped deeply into the culture.
Psychoanalysis itself may be out of favor _ the books of its
founder are rarely taught in any class that falls under the rubric
of science. But anyone with a serious interest in literature, art
or the social sciences ignores Freud at his peril. By Erica Goode.
(700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AMERICAS-CUP (Undated) _ Instead of using the wooden boats
with billowy cotton sails of yesterday, or even the fiberglass
hulls and sheets of woven synthetic fibers common today, the cup
challengers and defenders steer craft that their builders say shove
sailing technology right to its edge, pushing their materials to
the breaking point. By Warren E. Leary. (2140 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MENINGITIS (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Because of the
panic and deadly results that often surround meningitis outbreaks,
a federal health advisory panel has urged the 520,000 college
freshmen who live in dormitories to consider rolling up their
sleeves to get the meningococcal vaccine ahead of the peak season,
from November through January. The panel, which advises the CDC on
immunization practices, called on universities and health
professionals to tell college freshmen and their parents about the
availability of a well-established vaccine that is safe and
effective against most subtypes of the bacteria affecting college
age Americans. By Lawrence K. Altman, M.D. (1960 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLORIDA-PANTHERS (Miami Beach) _ The Florida panther not
long ago was almost extinct. But now the species Puma concolor
coryi, a subspecies of the cougar, is on the verge of a remarkable
comeback. In a bold effort to restore genetic diversity to the
panther, wildlife biologists four years ago imported a handful of
females from a closely related subspecies, the Texas cougar. By
Mark Derr. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ZUBRIN-MARS (Undated) _ A conversation With Robert Zubrin,
47, an astronautical engineer and founder of the Mars Society, a
citizen's organization advocating space travel to the neighbor
planet. By Claudia Dreifus. (1380 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on the wolf vs. moose battle on Isle
Royale and its effect on the ecology, the damage to an ecosystem by
introduction of strange species and a new spacecraft to measure
various characteristics of stars. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MUSICAL-INSTRUMENTS (Undated) _ Deep-freezing musical
instruments may sound an odd way to extract the best sound from
them, but it is just one example of how brass and woodwind
manufacturers are wrestling with deciding just how much to allow
technology to remake their craft. As the technological revolution
expands into music, however, instrument makers find themselves
split over whether to welcome or shun the economic benefits of
compuion, robots and precision tooling. While the new
technologies can make manufacturing cheaper, instrument
manufacturers resist a one-size-fits-all approach. They talk about
another goal: the creation of instruments individually suited to
the musicians who play them. By Terry H. Schwadron. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GALACTIC-JETS (Undated) _ They are among the greatest
frustrations in astronomy: colossal outpourings of energy driven by
engines that remain a mystery because they are too far away for
astronomers to resolve their details with even the largest
telescopes. Among the most spectacular manifestations of these
mysterious powerhouses are the narrow jets of particles, many
thousands of light years long, that emerge from the centers of some
galaxies at nearly the speed of light. By James Glanz. (500 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MERCURY-ENVIRON (Undated) _ The toxicity of methylmercury,
formed from the mercury discharged into the air by coal-burning
power plants, incinerators, mining and other sources, is a matter
of intense debate. As a result, scientists and government officials
are making new efforts to determine how much mercury is safe to
consume and whether new limits on power-plant emissions are needed.
By Robert A. Saar. (1550 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-VESSELS (Undated) _ Two studies offer promise of
improved treatments for some half million heart patients whose
blood vessels have seriously deteriorated _ patients who are at
risk of suffering fatal heart attacks or who have had by-pass
surgery that must be repeated. By Holcomb B. Noble. (700 words)

   SCI-MAMMOGRAMS (Undated) _ There is a new epidemic afoot, an
epidemic of lawsuits alleging that a diagnosis of breast cancer was
missed because a radiologist failed to find it on a mammogram. Yet
experts in the field say such lawsuits stem primarily from serious
misconceptions about the ability of mammograms to detect cancers
and from an assumption that the radiologists who read mammograms
should be able to see things that may be discernible only in
hindsight. By Jane E. Brody. (1220 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Claims that diet in children can
cause variations in energy level and even help bring on
hyperactivitiy disorder, a group of consumer advocates and
scientists now say, at least among a small group of children. By
Jane E. Brody. (1230 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-WATER (Undated) _ Sports doctors are warning people
not to drink too much water during endurance events like the New
York City Marathon next Sunday. Though athletes need to drink
regularly during a race to prevent dehydration, experts say that
excess water can lead to hyponatremia, a potentially fatal
condition that is rare but increasing among recreational athletes.
Hyponatremia is characterized by abnormally low concentrations of
sodium in the blood. By Susan Gilbert. (700 words)

<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health an fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 33-year-old woman who consulted a Houston neurologist about
her persistent migraines was relieved when a brain scan showed her
fears of a brain tumor or an aneurysm were unfounded. But she was
skeptical when her doctor told her the cause was much simpler: her
headache pills. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Could there be a connection with the visuals?
Elementary-school pupils who were encouraged to watch less
television put on less body fat over six months. And, nutrition
experts encourage adults to visual just how much they're eating and
understand the size of servings. (195 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A man who was the subject of a medical journal letter has
discarded anonymity. He claims his friends recognized him based on
the journal description, and he's particularly angry because the
journal hinted a drug abuse. To top it off, he says, the doctors
who wrote the piece misdiagnosed his condition. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Cardiac patients whose hearts take longer than normal to
recover after exercise are far more likely to die of heart disease,
according to a study at the Cleveland Clinic. (325 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Even in low doses and even for a relatively short time,
amphetamine use leads to significant and long-lasting brain damage
in monkeys, a Yale study has found. But the good news for the
monkeys, and perhaps for humans as well, was that in some cases the
damage was reversed. (310 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MEDICAL-GUIDELINES (Undated) _ For real-life practitioners,
staying up to date with medical science increasingly means staying
abreast of such consensus statements _ all 1,500 or so of them,
according to one recent list. The guidelines are meant to improve
medical care by codifying what panels of experts deem to be best
practices in a given field. The problem is that many doctors are
unaware of any number of guidelines, and those who read them often
fail or refuse to adopt their recommendations, according to a study
published last month in The Journal of the American Medical
Association. By Marcia Sherman. (550 words)

<P>
   SCI-DREAMS (Undated) _ In the last five years, new work has
forced scientists to rethink their understanding of dreaming and
the brain, granting a much more active role to brain areas involved
in motivation, emotion, memory and visual processing. The new
findings do not validate the particulars of Sigmund Freud's dream
theories, published 100 years ago this month, or prove that dream
interpretation is, as Freud asserted, ``the royal road to a
knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.'' But neither
are the results inconsistent with psychoanalytic thinking. By Erica
Goode. (2150 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DREAMS-FREUD (Undated) _ A century after the publication
Freud's ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' the ideas first given
shape in its pages have seeped deeply into the culture.
Psychoanalysis itself may be out of favor _ the books of its
founder are rarely taught in any class that falls under the rubric
of science. But anyone with a serious interest in literature, art
or the social sciences ignores Freud at his peril. By Erica Goode.
(700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AMERICAS-CUP (Undated) _ Instead of using the wooden boats
with billowy cotton sails of yesterday, or even the fiberglass
hulls and sheets of woven synthetic fibers common today, the cup
challengers and defenders steer craft that their builders say shove
sailing technology right to its edge, pushing their materials to
the breaking point. By Warren E. Leary. (2140 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MENINGITIS (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Because of the
panic and deadly results that often surround meningitis outbreaks,
a federal health advisory panel has urged the 520,000 college
freshmen who live in dormitories to consider rolling up their
sleeves to get the meningococcal vaccine ahead of the peak season,
from November through January. The panel, which advises the CDC on
immunization practices, called on universities and health
professionals to tell college freshmen and their parents about the
availability of a well-established vaccine that is safe and
effective against most subtypes of the bacteria affecting college
age Americans. By Lawrence K. Altman, M.D. (1960 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLORIDA-PANTHERS (Miami Beach) _ The Florida panther not
long ago was almost extinct. But now the species Puma concolor
coryi, a subspecies of the cougar, is on the verge of a remarkable
comeback. In a bold effort to restore genetic diversity to the
panther, wildlife biologists four years ago imported a handful of
females from a closely related subspecies, the Texas cougar. By
Mark Derr. (1200 words)

   SCI-ZUBRIN-MARS (Undated) _ A conversation With Robert Zubrin,
47, an astronautical engineer and founder of the Mars Society, a
citizen's organization advocating space travel to the neighbor
planet. By Claudia Dreifus. (1380 words)

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items on the wolf vs. moose battle on Isle
Royale and its effect on the ecology, the damage to an ecosystem by
introduction of strange species and a new spacecraft to measure
various characteristics of stars. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MUSICAL-INSTRUMENTS (Undated) _ Deep-freezing musical
instruments may sound an odd way to extract the best sound from
them, but it is just one example of how brass and woodwind
manufacturers are wrestling with deciding just how much to allow
technology to remake their craft. As the technological revolution
expands into music, however, instrument makers find themselves
split over whether to welcome or shun the economic benefits of
computerization, robots and precision tooling. While the new
technologies can make manufacturing cheaper, instrument
manufacturers resist a one-size-fits-all approach. They talk about
another goal: the creation of instruments individually suited to
the musicians who play them. By Terry H. Schwadron. (1600 words)

<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GALACTIC-JETS (Undated) _ They are among the greatest
frustrations in astronomy: colossal outpourings of energy driven by
engines that remain a mystery because they are too far away for
astronomers to resolve their details with even the largest
telescopes. Among the most spectacular manifestations of these
mysterious powerhouses are the narrow jets of particles, many
thousands of light years long, that emerge from the centers of some
galaxies at nearly the speed of light. By James Glanz. (500 words)

<P>
   SCI-MERCURY-ENVIRON (Undated) _ The toxicity of methylmercury,
formed from the mercury discharged into the air by coal-burning
power plants, incinerators, mining and other sources, is a matter
of intense debate. As a result, scientists and government officials
are making new efforts to determine how much mercury is safe to
consume and whether new limits on power-plant emissions are needed.

   SCI-MAMMOGRAMS (Undated) _ There is a new epidemic afoot, an
epidemic of lawsuits alleging that a diagnosis of breast cancer was
missed because a radiologist failed to find it on a mammogram. Yet
experts in the field say such lawsuits stem primarily from serious
misconceptions about the ability of mammograms to detect cancers
and from an assumption that the radiologists who read mammograms
should be able to see things that may be discernible only in
hindsight. By Jane E. Brody. (1220 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Claims that diet in children can

when the independent groups didn't want him either and a GOP

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``K'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

POLITICAL CLOUT WINS OUT IN NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, N.Y. _ As pallid morning sunlight flickered through the
naked tree limbs overhead, Mark Newton moved into the creek,
sinking into swiftly running water nearly to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you coming?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The boots I'd worn came up only to the tops of my ankles. In
Autumn, that water was sure to be cold. On the other hand, what the
hell? I went lurching in after him.
</P>
<P>
   We splashed through the icy water for several hundred yards
along the meandering creekbed, following its gentle curves right
and left through the trees as fallen leaves swirled in the wake we
left. Then, maybe a hundred yards from the lake, the creek's sandy
bottom rose up finally to form a dyke.
</P>
<P>
   That was where the stream died while its water spilled in all
directions. All directions, that is, except the one God had
intended. That was into Round Lake _ to nourish the still water and
serve as crucial breeding grounds for fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,` Mark Newton said. ``That's where it ends now. And
I can't get the state to do a thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Newton owns a pleasant old farmhouse atop a hill on the
north side of Round Lake in this northern Albany suburb. He also
owns 45 or so other acres behind the hill that slope down to the
lakeshore. A few years ago, he bought the place from Don Corp, now
his next-door neighbor, who was raised on that farm and lived there
until he was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Don Corp calls the stream Maltaville Crick. He's not sure if
that's the official name. But he has known that narrow waterway for
seven decades and more. He's as horrified as his new young
neighbor, Mark Newton, at what has happened to it.
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is this: A mile or two upstream, a builder
began to erect nice houses on a hill overlooking the stream. Sand
from that construction site washed down into the water. Over time,
the sand crawled down the creek until it formed that dyke.
</P>
<P>
   And the water? It just keeps flowing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, much of the land Mark Newton bought from Don Corp is under
water. Come next spring, when the snow melts, it's likely that most
of Mark Newton's place _ the sprawling farm he bought from Don Corp
and uses to raise a few cashmere goats to supplement what he earns
from his job in Albany _ will become part of Round Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Newton doesn't own that stream. Its proprietor is the State
of New York. Somebody with a backhoe and a dump truck could make
Maltaville Crick flow freely again. But if Mark Newton brings in
somebody to do that, he risks arrest. And the State of New York
exhibits no eagerness to fix this.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to the regional director of the State Department of
Environmental Conservation (DEC). He described this as an
``enforcement issue'' and was reluctant to say more.
</P>
<P>
   I suggested that he warn department headquarters that I would be
calling and tell them what he seemed so wary of explaining to me.
When I called, they'd heard from the regional director and said
that this would be looked into.
</P>
<P>
   That was weeks ago. I've heard from nobody from DEC and neither
has Mark Newton. He now has a well that spews sand into his sinks,
and his land is vanishing, and nobody will even talk to him about
it.
</P>
<P>
   I called somebody else I know in that department. Why won't the
DEC brass fix this, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, I was told. This Mark Newton? This guy whose property is
becoming lake bottom before his very eyes?
</P>
<P>
   He's nobody important enough for the State of New York to fret
about.

ANYWHERE BUT DOWN: SUSAN SARANDON DOESN'T LET ICON STATUS GET IN
HER WAY

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Susan Sarandon with Natalie Portman in a
scene from ``Anywhere But Here.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If the fans at a recent midnight showing of ``The Rocky Horror
Picture Show'' in New York had turned around to see who was sitting
behind them, they might have forgotten all about Dr. Frank N.
Furter and friends.
 &HT;    Blending into the audience were Susan Sarandon, star of the 1975
cult classic, and Natalie Portman, star of 1999's biggest
box-office smash, ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' With them,
just as a bonus, were a star of the current hit ``American Beauty''
and one of today's leading young male actors.
 &HT;    Sarandon, who had come so Portman could see the film for the
first time in the right setting, was disappointed in what she saw.
 &HT;    ``I took Nat, Thora Birch, my daughter and Lukas Haas,'' the
actress says. ``I hadn't seen it since I took Molly Ringwald when
she was 11.
 &HT;    ``The audience has diminished,'' she reports. ``It was everyone
just shouting obscenities for two hours, and you couldn't
understand what they were saying. There used to be a bit of
organization.
 &HT;    ``I sound like an old lady,'' she admits with a laugh, ``but
there was total anarchy. Everybody was trying to put new lines
in.''
 &HT;    Portman wasn't even born when Sarandon appeared in ``Rocky
Horror,'' and Ringwald is now 31. Even Sarandon's longtime beau,
Tim Robbins, was only 17 when ``Rocky Horror'' hit the scene.
 &HT;    Clearly, Sarandon has been around a long time. Many a young
actor looks up to her, wants to work with her, cites her as a hero.
 &HT;    ``It's great,'' Sarandon says during a conversation at New
York's Rihga Royal Hotel. As usual, she looks great _ far younger
than her 53 years _ and doesn't hesitate to speak her mind about
any topic.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have very many heroes,'' she says. ``I'm glad if I'm
helping somebody think the possibilities are bigger. I'm not quite
sure if it's me as much as some of the roles I've played. I don't
get it, but I don't mind it.
 &HT;    ``It's wonderful if you can encourage people to tell stories
they feel passionate about.''
 &HT;    When Sarandon looks back, she sees an awful lot _ children, a
divorce, an Oscar, political activism and, of course, her
long-running union with Robbins. Not to mention films beginning
with ``Joe'' (1970) and including hits as diverse as ``Rocky
Horror,'' ``Pretty Baby'' (1978), ``Atlantic City'' (1980), ``The
Witches of Eastwick'' (1987), ``Bull Durham'' (1988), ``Thelma and
Louise'' (1991), her Oscar-winning role in ``Dead Man Walking''
(1995) and ``Stepmom'' (1998).
 &HT;    Unlike many performers, Sarandon admits that she often watches
her old films.
 &HT;    ``It's not scary,'' she says. ``In some ways it's bittersweet. I
see people who are gone. I have no regrets, so I don't mind
watching anything at all. And I look at my work and I think, `Wow,
I packed a lot in these years.'
 &HT;    ``In that sense, it is really good.''
 &HT;    Her current film, ``Anywhere But Here,'' opens Nov. 12. Based on
the novel by Mona Simpson and directed by Wayne Wang, the film
explores the volatile relationship between 14-year-old Ann August
(Portman) and her loving-but-eccentric mother, Adele (Sarandon).
 &HT;    Adele can't keep a job or a man, but relocates from a lazy
Wisconsin town to Beverly Hills, determined to start anew and chase
her dreams afresh.
 &HT;    ``When you start edging toward this icon thing that everybody
puts you in, you don't want to lose your sense of humor,'' Sarandon
says. ``I was really looking forward to wearing eyeliner and doing
something fun.
 &HT;    ``I also thought that the story was about something that people
could relate to,'' she adds, ``that there was an element of truth
there, not just for mothers and daughters, but for anyone trying to
raise a child and everybody who's had a mother.
 &HT;    ``Letting go, learning to love somebody and letting them be who
they are is something that's tough not just as a mother, but as a
person,'' the actress says. ``It gave me a chance to practice all
the things not to do with my teen-age daughter.''
 &HT;    Add Sarandon to the list of people impressed with Portman, who
has already been hailed as a rising young star and, who knows,
perhaps the next Susan Sarandon.
 &HT;    ``She's always been incredibly bright,'' Sarandon says. ``She
comes from a very interesting background. She's a person with a
natural grace that doesn't seem like today _ that's very much just
who she is.''
 &HT;    In years to come Portman may have a screen career as prolific as
Sarandon's, but she'll be hard-pressed to match the older actress'
phenomenal roster of extracurricular activities.
 &HT;    Sarandon has been arrested several times while taking part in
protests on behalf of various political causes. She even incurred
the wrath of Oscar when, during an Academy Awards telecast, she
unexpectedly interrupted the show-biz preening for a brief,
impassioned plea on behalf of the struggling people of Haiti.
 &HT;    She didn't apologize for it, either. As a celebrity with access
to the world media, Sarandon considers it her responsibility to
speak out for those who might not otherwise have a voice.
 &HT;    ``The turning point came for me years ago, for the ERA,'' she
recalls, ``when I was on the steps of a library in front of this
bank of microphones.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to go up,'' the actress admits. ``Bella Abzug
had just spoken, and she was amazing. Marlo Thomas just kept
pushing me, saying `You have to. That's the only way this will get
on the news. It doesn't matter what you say. Just get up there.'
 &HT;    ``And she was absolutely right,'' Sarandon says. ``When I have
to, I just speak from the heart. But I'm not someone who's
comfortable with rhetoric _ I'm not comfortable in the public eye.
 &HT;    ``I end up having to do it, but it's hard.''
 &HT;    Another unconventional aspect of Sarandon's life is her
relationship with Robbins, 12 years her junior. The two met in 1988
on the set of ``Bull Durham'' (1989), and have been together ever
since. They have two children together, but have never married.
 &HT;    ``I like the idea of remembering to tell someone you love them
and not taking them for granted,'' Sarandon says. ``In my mind,
this works.
 &HT;    ``Were it to mean something to my children, I'd do it,'' she
says. ``It's not that big a deal. We've been together so long now,
we take each other for granted anyway.
 &HT;    ``No, that's not true,'' she adds with a laugh.
 &HT;    ``So this is my feeble attempt at trying to keep my identity and
be separate,'' Sarandon concludes. ``As my daughter said when she
was little, `Marriage, what an embarrassing word.' I thought, `What
does that mean, exactly?'
 &HT;    ``But mostly it is just a way of saying that, every day, I
choose to be with this person.''

 (Includes a color slide of Chris O'Donnell in a scene from ``The
Bachelor.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's not a bachelor _ he just plays one in the movies.
 &HT;    Chris O'Donnell's bachelor days ended three years ago in a small
apartment in Washington, where he finally got up the nerve to
propose marriage.
 &HT;    ``Well, I picked up my future wife Caroline from school, where
she was teaching,'' he recalls. ``We walked into her apartment and
she said, `Let's go for a run.' I said, `Nah, let's go sit on the
couch.'''
 &HT;    O'Donnell nervously fumbled through a catalog on the coffee
table _ coincidentally, a jewelry catalog with one particular
engagement ring circled. It was sort of ugly, he told her.
 &HT;    ``She said, `Are you nuts? That's a gorgeous ring,''' he
recalls. ``I said, `Well, I like this one better,' and I pulled out
her ring.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell smiles at the memory. Tired and jet-lagged, he
nonetheless looks muscular and sleek in khaki pants and a beige
silk shirt, only the dark circles under his eyes revealing that he
only recently arrived from New Zealand, where he's filming
``Vertical Limit,'' to do interviews for his new film, ``The
Bachelor.''
 &HT;    ``We haven't been home for months,'' he says, shaking his head
wearily, ``so during my 24 hours in Los Angeles before going back
to New Zealand, I have to go check on the contractors. They've been
finishing our bathroom for six months.''
 &HT;    Opening Nov. 5, ``The Bachelor'' casts O'Donnell as a young heir
who finds himself forced to get married within 24 hours or lose a
$100 million inheritance. A botched proposal to his girlfriend
(Renee Zellweger) leads to a frantic search for a wife, culminating
in a personal ad which has him fleeing from a throng of eager
would-be brides.
 &HT;    ``People have asked me if this movie is about sexual politics,''
says O'Donnell, who also served as executive producer on the film.
``What does it say about women who will do anything to get married,
including chasing me down the street in one scene in wedding
dresses?
 &HT;    ``I don't think we're making any statement,'' he says. ``It's
just a fun, wacky comedy about love.''
 &HT;    It was O'Donnell's wife who suggested Zellweger _ best known for
``Jerry Maguire'' (1996) _ to play O'Donnell's true love. ``Jerry
Maguire'' is her favorite movie, the actor says. But just as much
fun was lining up the parade of famous faces who have cameo
appearances as would-be brides.
 &HT;    Among them are actress/model Brooke Shields and singer Mariah
Carey, playing respectively a chain-smoking snob and an Italian
opera singer.
 &HT;    ``It's funny,'' O'Donnell says, ``because part of my education
as an executive producer meant that agents were calling me
suggesting these women. I've never been on the other end, where I
could say, `Well, send me a tape of her work.'''
 &HT;    The various famous faces add a lot to the film, he says, even if
their appearances are brief.
 &HT;    ``I thought it would be nice to have some familiar faces to cast
as the girlfriends,'' he says. ``And it was great because, even
though these women were big stars, there were no problems.
 &HT;    ``Look at Brooke, who used to do an anti-smoking campaign _ in
the film, she had to smoke,'' he says. ``This poor girl would go
and puke between scenes, but she was a trouper. She was just
no-attitude.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell himself has always been noted for his laid-back
attitude, ever since his first movie audition. As a Chicago
teen-ager, he answered an open casting call for the role of Jessica
Lange's son in ``Men Don't Leave'' (1990).
 &HT;    ``At the audition, I told them there was one problem: I didn't
know who Jessica Lange was,'' O'Donnell recalls. ``I also told them
that the movie could not interfere with my practice for the
high-school crew team.
 &HT;    ``The casting director's mouth flew open,'' he says, laughing.
``You could hear her thinking, `Who is this kid?'''
 &HT;    As it turns out, that kid would grow into the handsome,
clean-cut star of some of the 1990s' most popular films, including
``Scent of a Woman'' (1992), ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``Circle of
Friends'' (1995). But he got his first taste of real superstardom
when he was cast as Robin, first in ``Batman Forever'' (1995) and
again in ``Batman and Robin'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It still amazes me to know I'm known globally,'' he says. ``I
was in the airport in Indonesia, and I was recognized. I thought I
was on the other side of the world, and it's like `Ro-binnn!
Ro-binnn!'''
 &HT;    He was en route to New Zealand, where he's currently filming
``Vertical Limit,'' a mountain-climbing movie due out in summer
2000.
 &HT;    To prepare for the strenuous role, O'Donnell and his very
pregnant wife left their home in Chicago and landed in New Zealand
on the Fourth of July. The actor immediately began a rigorous,
eight-week training program with professional climbers.
 &HT;    ``It is very dangerous work,'' he says. ``You're climbing up
400-foot, sheer mountain walls. We climb up frozen waterfalls. Your
hands are holding onto ice picks and your feet are dug into the
side of a mountain.
 &HT;    ``Storms blow up out of nowhere,'' he adds. ``Two days ago I was
hunkered down on the mountain with rain pouring on me. I was just
holding on.
 &HT;    ``It's very easy to fall,'' O'Donnell says, ``and, even though I
have a safety rope, it still stops your heart when you tumble 10 or
15 feet. You're just waiting for the rope to break your fall. It's
very hairy.''
 &HT;    Especially if you've got a wife who's due to give birth at any
moment.
 &HT;    ``I was so worried that I'd be on the side of the mountain and
my cell phone would ring,'' O'Donnell says with a grimace. ``I
could imagine her saying, `It's time! Get down here!'
 &HT;    ``My nightmare was that I couldn't get to her.''
 &HT;    Finally, the birth was induced in August. After a five-hour trek
to the nearest hospital that had a good neonatal unit, O'Donnell
was indeed present for the birth of his first child, Lily.
 &HT;    ``It was a miracle,'' he says, groping for words. ``It was just
so overwhelming. I still can't believe it.''
 &HT;    Not that he has to rely on his memory of the event, of course.
 &HT;    ``It was so funny,'' the actor admits, laughing. ``The doctor
thought I was nuts _ he even said, `I've never seen so many cameras
in my life.' I had the video camera going, I had the digital
camera.
 &HT;    ``The minute after she was born,'' he adds, ``I downloaded her
picture for my folks back home and E-mailed them the first photo of
their granddaughter.''
 &HT;    Those bachelor days seem a long time ago now, O'Donnell adds.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought the biggest change in my life was getting
married, but that wasn't the half of it,'' he says. ``Having a kid
really changes all your priorities. This little girl is the focus
of my life.
 &HT;    ``I was so sad to leave her yesterday.''
 &HT;    But don't cry, Lily _ jet-lagged or not, O'Donnell is on his way
home.
 &HT;    ``I'm on the first flight to New Zealand after this is over,''
he says with a tired-but-happy smile. ``In about 24 hours, I'll be
on diaper duty.''

 (Includes a color slide of playwright Neil Simon.) 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's a theater in the heart of New York's theater district
that's named after playwright Neil Simon, but it hasn't hosted one
of his own plays in years.
 &HT;    That might change next year. His latest play, ``The Dinner
Party,'' is being launched in Los Angeles in December 1999, and
could be a Broadway transfer in 2000.
 &HT;    If it isn't, though, Simon won't be too upset.
 &HT;    ``In the time I have left as a writer _ it could be a few years,
it could be more years than I imagine _ all I want to do is write
new and original plays, and not worry about where it goes from
there,'' he says during an interview at his New York office.
 &HT;    He's still one of the busiest men in show business, of course,
with a memoir recently published and another new play in the works
_ plus his recent marriage to his fourth wife, actress Elaine
Joyce.
 &HT;    One topic not on the mind of this elder statesman of the
American theater _ so old-fashioned that he writes all his books,
plays and screenplays first on a pad and then on a typewriter, but
never on a computer _ is age, even though he's now 72.
 &HT;    ``Seventy's all right if you accept it,'' he says breezily. ``I
have to _ I don't have a choice.''
 &HT;    His first volume of memoirs, ``Rewrites'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1996), took him from childhood to the death of his first wife, Joan
Baim. ``The Play Goes On'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999) brings the
story up to the present.
 &HT;    It wasn't easy for this famously self-effacing, private man to
write a memoir. He did so, he says, because he wanted to let people
know some things about himself and because he wanted to cut through
the anecdotes to find some truths about himself that even he didn't
know when he began.
 &HT;    ``It's like sitting down and writing a confession to the police,
or to the chief of your religion,'' he says. ``But it's not a
confession of the good and bad things I did _ I'm not trying to
empty my baggage and lay it at the feet of the people who read this
book.''
 &HT;    He freely admits to having left out a lot of material which he
considered too private to discuss. What's left, he says, is in
large part the story of a writer, a look at the creative process
itself.
 &HT;    ``Most people can't relate to that,'' he says. ``People at my
tennis club, for example, have no concept. They say, `You sit
alone?'
 &HT;    ``There's hardly a job in the world like that,'' the playwright
says. ``Almost everything includes other people. This one doesn't
include them until I'm finished writing _ yet I've never had
trouble with coming up to the office, because I never felt alone
here.''
 &HT;    In the process of writing the memoir, he says, he came to terms
with his own identity in a way he hadn't before.
 &HT;    ``For a long time, I didn't even see myself as Neil Simon,'' he
says. ``I had no idea who Neil Simon was. I knew who I was, but I
wasn't necessarily the Neil Simon people wrote wonderful and
not-so-wonderful things about, that public figure. I don't usually
see that _ I see myself walking along the street, almost invisible.
 &HT;    ``So it took some doing to come to terms, to make those two
people one, which I have now,'' he says. ``I accept being that
other person. We've made friends.''
 &HT;    Simon's book offers insights into the creation of his plays, and
shows unmistakable pride in discussing his two daughters, Nancy and
Ellen, accomplished writers in their rights. And he somewhat
gingerly explores the same traumatic events which for years have
fueled his plays _ the death from cancer of his first wife, and the
three failed marriages that followed.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing in the book that I'm ashamed of or afraid to
tell,'' Simon says. ``The places where I don't want to go, I don't.
I'm not going to tell what goes on in the rooms where the door
should never be opened.
 &HT;    ``But if I do it,'' he says, ``it can open others up to doing
it. When you're in pain, if you go back and search through it all,
where it came from, maybe you'll find the beginning of that pain
and help relieve some of it.''
 &HT;    Some have marveled at Simon's propensity for turning his private
turmoil into the stuff of comedies, but he doesn't find it so
surprising.
 &HT;    ``All my plays are based on stress, which is basically
conflict,'' he says. ``That's what I look for in every play _ the
stress and conflict that characters have to go through, and the
journey that the audience takes with them.
 &HT;    ``The great thing about the writing is that it has supported me
emotionally all through the bad times and the good times,'' he
adds. ``It never abandons me. It never walks out.''
 &HT;    Audiences and critics alike have often assumed that Simon's
style, with its easygoing humor and deft one-liners, must come
easily. Actually, the playwright says, that isn't usually the case.
 &HT;    ``No, it hasn't been facile,'' he says. ``I really work hard.
Some days the pages flow, and other days you just look at them.
When you stop to think that I've just finished the seventh draft of
`The Dinner Party,' which has taken nine months, you realize that
pages don't fly all the time.
 &HT;    ``They may fly out of the typewriter, but they can fly right
into the wastebasket!''
 &HT;    Simon's other theatrical project of the season is the
one-act-play collection ``Hotel Suite,'' which will open in
Philadelphia next spring. Its four one-acters are drawn from his
three hotel-based anthologies, ``Plaza Suite'' (1968), ``California
Suite'' (1976) and ``London Suite'' (1995).
 &HT;    ``It's a crystallization of the best of them,'' he says, ``and
tied together much better, because there's no way I could have
written `Hotel Suite' this way without going through the other
three plays.''
 &HT;    Recently Simon has also been enjoying his fifth marriage _ after
his first wife's death, he was married to actresses Marsha Mason
and, twice, Diane Lander. He and Joyce first met back in the 1970s,
but became reacquainted earlier this year, after Simon's second
divorce from Lander.
 &HT;    ``I'm not taking a chance,'' the playwright says. ``This is the
last marriage _ I'm so sure about her.''
 &HT;    Settled down again, an hour or so away from his daughters and
their families, Simon says that what he most wants out of life now
is peace of mind _ which isn't to s retirement lies anywhere
in his foreseeable future. The act of putting words on paper, of
creating characters and giving them life, is still intensely
rewarding to him, he says.
 &HT;    ``It's not merely words, but the means of expression, going to
someplace that's richer and more meaningful,'' he says. ``And yet I
always need the humor, because I find that in my life all the time
_ when things are bleakest I'll find some humorous way to look at
them, not to avoid the pain, but just to see the absurdity of life.
 &HT;    ``I'm at that age when you start saying, `OK, it's not going to
go on forever,''' the playwright says. ``But I'm not ready to
settle down and stop writing. I have enough writers and therapists
who've said, `Never stop writing _ it's going to keep you alive and
keep a lot of other people happy.'''

 (Includes a color slide of Martin Sheen with Richard Schiff and
John Spencer in a scene from ``The West Wing.'') 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not available in Canada until Nov. 15, 1999. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States in NBC's new hit series ``The
West Wing'' is a principled man who invariably opts for the right
decision over the politically prudent one. He doesn't care about
politics, only about helping his fellow Americans, and has
surrounded himself with a staff of sharp, canny professionals more
attuned to getting the job done than to brown-nosing the boss.
</P>
<P>
   What planet does this show take place on, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, the 38-year-old playwright/screenwriter who
created ``The West Wing'' and, before it, the acclaimed ``Sports
Night,'' is no stranger to the world of politics, having previously
scripted the films ``A Few Good Men'' (1992) and ``The American
President'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of wish-fulfillment here,'' he
admits. ``Maybe it'll be exciting to look at the White House the
way we wish it was a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing life to Sorkin's stirring, epigrammatic dialogue _
``When people talk in things that I write,'' he admits, ``they tend
to be hyper-communicative, which is to say they can't shut up'' _
is a sterling cast drawn mainly from feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sheen plays President Josiah Bartlet, with Rob Lowe as
his sardonic, womanizing deputy communications director. Richard
Schiff as the communications director, Allison Janney as Bartlet's
press secretary and John Spencer as his chief of staff have a wide
range of film credits, as do Tim Matheson as the vice president,
Stockard Channing as the first lady and Timothy Busfield as a
scrappy reporter covering the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tough time slot opposite ABC's ``The Drew Carey
Show,'' ``The West Wing'' made a splashy October debut and drew
respectable ratings from day one _ not bad for a show whose
production was delayed for a year because of network qualms over
the recent White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the events of the last two years in
the Clinton White House have been dismaying, to say the least,''
Sorkin admits. ``You're setting yourself up for the snicker factor
anytime you mention the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sheen says, he was fascinated by the show from the
moment he read Sorkin's script for the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it,'' the actor recalls, ``and said, `I'm not nuts
about doing a TV series. I've never done one. I have no interest in
doing one.
</P>
<P>
   ```But I will do this as long as you write every script that I'm
involved in.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, so far the workaholic Sorkin, who had a major hand
in every ``Sports Night'' episode last season, has written every
script. Part of his motivation, no doubt, is the intriguing
character of Bartlet _ originally scheduled to appear only once
every three or four episodes, but soon upgraded to regular status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He backed into the presidency,'' Sheen says, ``and, not having
a mandate and not having a fully coordinated agenda, he was freed
to form an administration that would be responsible for all the
people in the best possible sense.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been such a president not so long ago, Schiff adds _
that of Harry Truman, from 1945 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite presidency in American history is Truman's,
because he was a reluctant servant,'' Schiff says. ``He found
himself in the office after Roosevelt died and he really understood
how to respect what the office was about. He understood the gravity
and profundity of the decisions that were made there, by the office
_ the man was secondary. I've always respected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen hastens to add that the show isn't about any real
administration, past, present or future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be clear about that,'' he says. ``Otherwise we're
not going to be free to have a public debate on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to confront issues on a personal level, and if
you're not interested in going on this battleground with us, don't
join the army,'' Sheen declares, his voice rising. ``Get out now.
Because we're gonna fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds militant, but Sorkin _ a self-professed liberal _
insists that the show isn't about the personal politics of himself,
Sheen or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your enjoyment of the show really isn't going to depend upon
whether you agree with that episode or character politically,'' the
writer/producer says. ``Issues are going to be on the show, but
really only as fodder for drama _ the show is going to be all over
the map. This president is extremely unpredictable, politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing' isn't meant to be `good for you,''' he adds.
``We're not telling anyone to eat their vegetables. It's going to
be for the sake of drama, not for the sake of winning your vote
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lowe is struck by the show's realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a real world,'' he says. ``I come home and watch
`Crossfire' and go, `I'll have to talk to them about that the next
day.' You really get lulled into the fact that you're actually
working there.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that realism, Janney has befriended Dede Myers,
who was the real-life White House press secretary in the early
years of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me that the hierarchy at the White House is totally
personality-driven, not according to your job role,'' Janney says.
``Who gets to be in on meetings doesn't depend on your job _ your
title doesn't entitle you to be somewhere _ but if you get along
with someone, then you get invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wow _ it's just like high school!'''
</P>
<P>
   The only real hazard the show faces, many observers feel, is the
pressure on Sorkin to continue pumping out 45 minutes of new,
top-quality material every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the writing, there's nothing going on,'' Schiff says.
``When writing for television, you're supposed to resolve the
conflict in the 39th minute, and a lot of times easy choices are
made because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens on this show,'' he says, ``it'll be a tragedy.
Because the potential is for us to reach a level of work which
would be so rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is confident that ``The West Wing'' won't succumb to the
siren calls of standard television writing or the dictates of
network programmers and publicity flacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be any assassination attempts,
impeachment attempts or any kind of hanky-panky in the Oval
Office,'' Sheen adds. ``I would be an outspoken critic of such a
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is one aspect of network politics which will
unavoidably affect the world of President Bartlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get picked up for a fourth year, I will have been
re-elected,'' Sheen says. ``If we get cancelled in the fifth or
sixth year, I've been impeached.''

 (Includes a color slide of Chris O'Donnell in a scene from ``The
Bachelor.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He's not a bachelor _ he just plays one in the movies.
 &HT;    Chris O'Donnell's bachelor days ended three years ago in a small
apartment in Washington, where he finally got up the nerve to
propose marriage.
 &HT;    ``Well, I picked up my future wife Caroline from school, where
she was teaching,'' he recalls. ``We walked into her apartment and
she said, `Let's go for a run.' I said, `Nah, let's go sit on the
couch.'''
 &HT;    O'Donnell nervously fumbled through a catalog on the coffee
table _ coincidentally, a jewelry catalog with one particular
engagement ring circled. It was sort of ugly, he told her.
 &HT;    ``She said, `Are you nuts? That's a gorgeous ring,''' he
recalls. ``I said, `Well, I like this one better,' and I pulled out
her ring.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell smiles at the memory. Tired and jet-lagged, he
nonetheless looks muscular and sleek in khaki pants and a beige
silk shirt, only the dark circles under his eyes revealing that he
only recently arrived from New Zealand, where he's filming
``Vertical Limit,'' to do interviews for his new film, ``The
Bachelor.''
 &HT;    ``We haven't been home for months,'' he says, shaking his head
wearily, ``so during my 24 hours in Los Angeles before going back
to New Zealand, I have to go check on the contractors. They've been
finishing our bathroom for six months.''
 &HT;    Opening Nov. 5, ``The Bachelor'' casts O'Donnell as a young heir
who finds himself forced to get married within 24 hours or lose a
$100 million inheritance. A botched proposal to his girlfriend
(Renee Zellweger) leads to a frantic search for a wife, culminating
in a personal ad which has him fleeing from a throng of eager
would-be brides.
 &HT;    ``People have asked me if this movie is about sexual politics,''
says O'Donnell, who also served as executive producer on the film.
``What does it say about women who will do anything to get married,
including chasing me down the street in one scene in wedding
dresses?
 &HT;    ``I don't think we're making any statement,'' he says. ``It's
just a fun, wacky comedy about love.''
 &HT;    It was O'Donnell's wife who suggested Zellweger _ best known for
``Jerry Maguire'' (1996) _ to play O'Donnell's true love. ``Jerry
Maguire'' is her favorite movie, the actor says. But just as much
fun was lining up the parade of famous faces who have cameo
appearances as would-be brides.
 &HT;    Among them are actress/model Brooke Shields and singer Mariah
Carey, playing respectively a chain-smoking snob and an Italian
opera singer.
 &HT;    ``It's funny,'' O'Donnell says, ``because part of my education
as an executive producer meant that agents were calling me
suggesting these women. I've never been on the other end, where I
could say, `Well, send me a tape of her work.'''
 &HT;    The various famous faces add a lot to the film, he says, even if
their appearances are brief.
 &HT;    ``I thought it would be nice to have some familiar faces to cast
as the girlfriends,'' he says. ``And it was great because, even
though these women were big stars, there were no problems.
 &HT;    ``Look at Brooke, who used to do an anti-smoking campaign _ in
the film, she had to smoke,'' he says. ``This poor girl would go
and puke between scenes, but she was a trouper. She was just
no-attitude.''
 &HT;    O'Donnell himself has always been noted for his laid-back
attitude, ever since his first movie audition. As a Chicago
teen-ager, he answered an open casting call for the role of Jessica
Lange's son in ``Men Don't Leave'' (1990).
 &HT;    ``At the audition, I told them there was one problem: I didn't
know who Jessica Lange was,'' O'Donnell recalls. ``I also told them
that the movie could not interfere with my practice for the
high-school crew team.
 &HT;    ``The casting director's mouth flew open,'' he says, laughing.
``You could hear her thinking, `Who is this kid?'''
 &HT;    As it turns out, that kid would grow into the handsome,
clean-cut star of some of the 1990s' most popular films, including
``Scent of a Woman'' (1992), ``School Ties'' (1992) and ``Circle of
Friends'' (1995). But he got his first taste of real superstardom
when he was cast as Robin, first in ``Batman Forever'' (1995) and
again in ``Batman and Robin'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It still amazes me to know I'm known globally,'' he says. ``I
was in the airport in Indonesia, and I was recognized. I thought I
was on the other side of the world, and it's like `Ro-binnn!
Ro-binnn!'''
 &HT;    He was en route to New Zealand, where he's currently filming
``Vertical Limit,'' a mountain-climbing movie due out in summer
2000.
 &HT;    To prepare for the strenuous role, O'Donnell and his very
pregnant wife left their home in Chicago and landed in New Zealand
on the Fourth of July. The actor immediately began a rigorous,
eight-week training program with professional climbers.
 &HT;    ``It is very dangerous work,'' he says. ``You're climbing up
400-foot, sheer mountain walls. We climb up frozen waterfalls. Your
hands are holding onto ice picks and your feet are dug into the
side of a mountain.
 &HT;    ``Storms blow up out of nowhere,'' he adds. ``Two days ago I was
hunkered down on the mountain with rain pouring on me. I was just
holding on.
 &HT;    ``It's very easy to fall,'' O'Donnell says, ``and, even though I
have a safety rope, it still stops your heart when you tumble 10 or
15 feet. You're just waiting for the rope to break your fall. It's
very hairy.''
 &HT;    Especially if you've got a wife who's due to give birth at any
moment.
 &HT;    ``I was so worried that I'd be on the side of the mountain and
my cell phone would ring,'' O'Donnell says with a grimace. ``I
could imagine her saying, `It's time! Get down here!'
 &HT;    ``My nightmare was that I couldn't get to her.''
 &HT;    Finally, the birth was induced in August. After a five-hour trek
to the nearest hospital that had a good neonatal unit, O'Donnell
was indeed present for the birth of his first child, Lily.
 &HT;    ``It was a miracle,'' he says, groping for words. ``It was just
so overwhelming. I still can't believe it.''
 &HT;    Not that he has to rely on his memory of the event, of course.
 &HT;    ``It was so funny,'' the actor admits, laughing. ``The doctor
thought I was nuts _ he even said, `I've never seen so many cameras
in my life.' I had the video camera going, I had the digital
camera.
 &HT;    ``The minute after she was born,'' he adds, ``I downloaded her
picture for my folks back home and E-mailed them the first photo of
their granddaughter.''
 &HT;    Those bachelor days seem a long time ago now, O'Donnell adds.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought the biggest change in my life was getting
married, but that wasn't the half of it,'' he says. ``Having a kid
really changes all your priorities. This little girl is the focus
of my life.
 &HT;    ``I was so sad to leave her yesterday.''
 &HT;    But don't cry, Lily _ jet-lagged or not, O'Donnell is on his way
home.
 &HT;    ``I'm on the first flight to New Zealand after this is over,''
he says with a tired-but-happy smile. ``In about 24 hours, I'll be
on diaper duty.''

 (Includes a color slide of playwright Neil Simon.) 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's a theater in the heart of New York's theater district
that's named after playwright Neil Simon, but it hasn't hosted one
of his own plays in years.
 &HT;    That might change next year. His latest play, ``The Dinner
Party,'' is being launched in Los Angeles in December 1999, and
could be a Broadway transfer in 2000.
 &HT;    If it isn't, though, Simon won't be too upset.
 &HT;    ``In the time I have left as a writer _ it could be a few years,
it could be more years than I imagine _ all I want to do is write
new and original plays, and not worry about where it goes from
there,'' he says during an interview at his New York office.
 &HT;    He's still one of the busiest men in show business, of course,
with a memoir recently published and another new play in the works
_ plus his recent marriage to his fourth wife, actress Elaine
Joyce.
 &HT;    One topic not on the mind of this elder statesman of the
American theater _ so old-fashioned that he writes all his books,
plays and screenplays first on a pad and then on a typewriter, but
never on a computer _ is age, even though he's now 72.
 &HT;    ``Seventy's all right if you accept it,'' he says breezily. ``I
have to _ I don't have a choice.''
 &HT;    His first volume of memoirs, ``Rewrites'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1996), took him from childhood to the death of his first wife, Joan
Baim. ``The Play Goes On'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999) brings the
story up to the present.
 &HT;    It wasn't easy for this famously self-effacing, private man to
write a memoir. He did so, he says, because he wanted to let people
know some things about himself and because he wanted to cut through
the anecdotes to find some truths about himself that even he didn't
know when he began.
 &HT;    ``It's like sitting down and writing a confession to the police,
or to the chief of your religion,'' he says. ``But it's not a
confession of the good and bad things I did _ I'm not trying to
empty my baggage and lay it at the feet of the people who read this
book.''
 &HT;    He freely admits to having left out a lot of material which he
considered too private to discuss. What's left, he says, is in
large part the story of a writer, a look at the creative process
itself.
 &HT;    ``Most people can't relate to that,'' he says. ``People at my
tennis club, for example, have no concept. They say, `You sit
alone?'
 &HT;    ``There's hardly a job in the world like that,'' the playwright
says. ``Almost everything includes other people. This one doesn't
include them until I'm finished writing _ yet I've never had
trouble with coming up to the office, because I never felt alone
here.''
 &HT;    In the process of writing the memoir, he says, he came to terms
with his own identity in a way he hadn't before.
 &HT;    ``For a long time, I didn't even see myself as Neil Simon,'' he
says. ``I had no idea who Neil Simon was. I knew who I was, but I
wasn't necessarily the Neil Simon people wrote wonderful and
not-so-wonderful things about, that public figure. I don't usually
see that _ I see myself walking along the street, almost invisible.
 &HT;    ``So it took some doing to come to terms, to make those two
people one, which I have now,'' he says. ``I accept being that
other person. We've made friends.''
 &HT;    Simon's book offers insights into the creation of his plays, and
shows unmistakable pride in discussing his two daughters, Nancy and
Ellen, accomplished writers in their rights. And he somewhat
gingerly explores the same traumatic events which for years have
fueled his plays _ the death from cancer of his first wife, and the
three failed marriages that followed.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing in the book that I'm ashamed of or afraid to
tell,'' Simon says. ``The places where I don't want to go, I don't.
I'm not going to tell what goes on in the rooms where the door
should never be opened.
 &HT;    ``But if I do it,'' he says, ``it can open others up to doing
it. When you're in pain, if you go back and search through it all,
where it came from, maybe you'll find the beginning of that pain
and help relieve some of it.''
 &HT;    Some have marveled at Simon's propensity for turning his private
turmoil into the stuff of comedies, but he doesn't find it so
surprising.
 &HT;    ``All my plays are based on stress, which is basically
conflict,'' he says. ``That's what I look for in every play stress and conflict that characters have to go through, and the
journey that the audience takes with them.
 &HT;    ``The great thing about the writing is that it has supported me
emotionally all through the bad times and the good times,'' he
adds. ``It never abandons me. It never walks out.''
 &HT;    Audiences and critics alike have often assumed that Simon's
style, with its easygoing humor and deft one-liners, must come
easily. Actually, the playwright says, that isn't usually the case.
 &HT;    ``No, it hasn't been facile,'' he says. ``I really work hard.
Some days the pages flow, and other days you just look at them.
When you stop to think that I've just finished the seventh draft of
`The Dinner Party,' which has taken nine months, you realize that
pages don't fly all the time.
 &HT;    ``They may fly out of the typewriter, but they can fly right
into the wastebasket!''
 &HT;    Simon's other theatrical project of the season is the
one-act-play collection ``Hotel Suite,'' which will open in
Philadelphia next spring. Its four one-acters are drawn from his
three hotel-based anthologies, ``Plaza Suite'' (1968), ``California
Suite'' (1976) and ``London Suite'' (1995).
 &HT;    ``It's a crystallization of the best of them,'' he says, ``and
tied together much better, because there's no way I could have
written `Hotel Suite' this way without going through the other
three plays.''
 &HT;    Recently Simon has also been enjoying his fifth marriage _ after
his first wife's death, he was married to actresses Marsha Mason
and, twice, Diane Lander. He and Joyce first met back in the 1970s,
but became reacquainted earlier this year, after Simon's second
divorce from Lander.
 &HT;    ``I'm not taking a chance,'' the playwright says. ``This is the
last marriage _ I'm so sure about her.''
 &HT;    Settled down again, an hour or so away from his daughters and
their families, Simon says that what he most wants out of life now
is peace of mind _ which isn't to say that retirement lies anywhere
in his foreseeable future. The act of putting words on paper, of
creating characters and giving them life, is still intensely
rewarding to him, he says.
 &HT;    ``It's not merely words, but the means of expression, going to
someplace that's richer and more meaningful,'' he says. ``And yet I
always need the humor, because I find that in my life all the time
_ when things are bleakest I'll find some humorous way to look at
them, not to avoid the pain, but just to see the absurdity of life.
 &HT;    ``I'm at that age when you start saying, `OK, it's not going to
go on forever,''' the playwright says. ``But I'm not ready to
settle down and stop writing. I have enough writers and therapists
who've said, `Never stop writing _ it's going to keep you alive and
keep a lot of other people happy.'''

 (Includes a color slide of Martin Sheen with Richard Schiff and
John Spencer in a scene from ``The West Wing.'') 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 Not available in Canada until Nov. 15, 1999. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States in NBC's new hit series ``The
West Wing'' is a principled man who invariably opts for the right
decision over the politically prudent one. He doesn't care about
politics, only about helping his fellow Americans, and has
surrounded himself with a staff of sharp, canny professionals more
attuned to getting the job done than to brown-nosing the boss.
</P>
<P>
   What planet does this show take place on, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, the 38-year-old playwright/screenwriter who
created ``The West Wing'' and, before it, the acclaimed ``Sports
Night,'' is no stranger to the world of politics, having previously
scripted the films ``A Few Good Men'' (1992) and ``The American
President'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of wish-fulfillment here,'' he
admits. ``Maybe it'll be exciting to look at the White House the
way we wish it was a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing life to Sorkin's stirring, epigrammatic dialogue _
``When people talk in things that I write,'' he admits, ``they tend
to be hyper-communicative, which is to say they can't shut up'' _
is a sterling cast drawn mainly from feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Sheen plays President Josiah Bartlet, with Rob Lowe as
his sardonic, womanizing deputy communications director. Richard
Schiff as the communications director, Allison Janney as Bartlet's
press secretary and John Spencer as his chief of staff have a wide
range of film credits, as do Tim Matheson as the vice president,
Stockard Channing as the first lady and Timothy Busfield as a
scrappy reporter covering the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tough time slot opposite ABC's ``The Drew Carey
Show,'' ``The West Wing'' made a splashy October debut and drew
respectable ratings from day one _ not bad for a show whose
production was delayed for a year because of network qualms over
the recent White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the events of the last two years in
the Clinton White House have been dismaying, to say the least,''
Sorkin admits. ``You're setting yourself up for the snicker factor
anytime you mention the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sheen says, he was fascinated by the show from the
moment he read Sorkin's script for the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it,'' the actor recalls, ``and said, `I'm not nuts
about doing a TV series. I've never done one. I have no interest in
doing one.
</P>
<P>
   ```But I will do this as long as you write every script that I'm
involved in.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, so far the workaholic Sorkin, who had a major hand
in every ``Sports Night'' episode last season, has written every
script. Part of his motivation, no doubt, is the intriguing
character of Bartlet _ originally scheduled to appear only once
every three or four episodes, but soon upgraded to regular status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He backed into the presidency,'' Sheen says, ``and, not having
a mandate and not having a fully coordinated agenda, he was freed
to form an administration that would be responsible for all the
people in the best possible sense.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been such a president not so long ago, Schiff adds _
that of Harry Truman, from 1945 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite presidency in American history is Truman's,
because he was a reluctant servant,'' Schiff says. ``He found
himself in the office after Roosevelt died and he really understood
how to respect what the office was about. He understood the gravity
and profundity of the decisions that were made there, by the office
_ the man was secondary. I've always respected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen hastens to add that the show isn't about any real
administration, past, present or future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be clear about that,'' he says. ``Otherwise we're
not going to be free to have a public debate on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to confront issues on a personal level, and if
you're not interested in going on this battleground with us, don't
join the army,'' Sheen declares, his voice rising. ``Get out now.
Because we're gonna fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds militant, but Sorkin _ a self-professed liberal _
insists that the show isn't about the personal politics of himself,
Sheen or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your enjoyment of the show really isn't going to depend upon
whether you agree with that episode or character politically,'' the
writer/producer says. ``Issues are going to be on the show, but
really only as fodder for drama _ the show is going to be all over
the map. This president is extremely unpredictable, politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing' isn't meant to be `good for you,''' he adds.
``We're not telling anyone to eat their vegetables. It's going to
be for the sake of drama, not for the sake of winning your vote
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lowe is struck by the show's realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a real world,'' he says. ``I come home and watch
`Crossfire' and go, `I'll have to talk to them about that the next
day.' You really get lulled into the fact that you're actually
working there.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that realism, Janney has befriended Dede Myers,
who was the real-life White House press secretary in the early
years of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me that the hierarchy at the White House is totally
personality-driven, not according to your job role,'' Janney says.
``Who gets to be in on meetings doesn't depend on your job _ your
title doesn't entitle you to be somewhere _ but if you get along
with someone, then you get invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Wow _ it's just like high school!'''
</P>
<P>
   The only real hazard the show faces, many observers feel, is the
pressure on Sorkin to continue pumping out 45 minutes of new,
top-quality material every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the writing, there's nothing going on,'' Schiff says.
``When writing for television, you're supposed to resolve the
conflict in the 39th minute, and a lot of times easy choices are
made because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens on this show,'' he says, ``it'll be a tragedy.
Because the potential is for us to reach a level of work which
would be so rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheen is confident that ``The West Wing'' won't succumb to the
siren calls of standard television writing or the dictates of
network programmers and publicity flacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be any assassination attempts,
impeachment attempts or any kind of hanky-panky in the Oval
Office,'' Sheen adds. ``I would be an outspoken critic of such a
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is one aspect of network politics which will
unavoidably affect the world of President Bartlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get picked up for a fourth year, I will have been
re-elected,'' Sheen says. ``If we get cancelled in the fifth or
sixth year, I've been impeached.''

   SCI-DREAMS (Undated) _ In the last five years, new work has
forced scientists to rethink their understanding of dreaming and
the brain, granting a much more active role to brain areas involved
in motivation, emotion, memory and visual processing. The new
findings do not validate the particulars of Sigmund Freud's dream
theories, published 100 years ago this month, or prove that dream
interpretation is, as Freud asserted, ``the royal road to a
knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind.'' But neither
are the results inconsistent with psychoanalytic thinking. By Erica

   SCI-DREAMS-FREUD (Undated) _ A century after the publication
Freud's ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' the ideas first given
shape in its pages have seeped deeply into the culture.
Psychoanalysis itself may be out of favor _ the books of its
founder are rarely taught in any class that falls under the rubric
of science. But anyone with a serious interest in literature, art
or the social sciences ignores Freud at his peril. By Erica Goode.

   SCI-MENINGITIS (Undated) _ The Doctor's World: Because of the
panic and deadly results that often surround meningitis outbreaks,
a federal health advisory panel has urged the 520,000 college
freshmen who live in dormitories to consider rolling up their
sleeves to get the meningococcal vaccine ahead of the peak season,
from November through January. The panel, which advises the CDC on
immunization practices, called on universities and health

   SCI-MUSICAL-INSTRUMENTS (Undated) _ Deep-freezing musical
instruments may sound an odd way to extract the best sound from
them, but it is just one example of how brass and woodwind
manufacturers are wrestling with deciding just how much to allow
technology to remake their craft. As the technological revolution
expands into music, however, instrument makers find themselves
split over whether to welcome or shun the economic benefits of
computerization, robots and precision tooling. While the new
technologies can make manufacturing cheaper, instrument
manufacturers resist a one-size-fits-all approach. They talk about
another goal: the creation of instruments individually suited to

PERSONAL HEALTH: WHEN FOODS CAN DRIVE A CHILD WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My sister-in-law Cindy Brody thought that large amounts of
sugary foods turned Sam, her otherwise normally active son, into a
wild and aggressive  though well-designed studies have
repeatedly failed to find a relationship between sugar per se and
hyperactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, through careful observation, Cindy realized that sugar
itself was not the culprit; rather, it was chocolate that typically
made Sam hard to control.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter of a century now, parents of hyperactive children
have been besieged with claims that various common foods, food
additives and preservatives were the cause of the syndrome that is
now called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
</P>
<P>
   And over and over again, many leading health organizations,
bolstered by a collection of mostly small and often poorly done
studies, have disputed such claims.
</P>
<P>
   Children with the disorder are hard to manage, disruptive at
home and in the classroom, and they often fail in school. The main
symptoms are difficulty concentrating, short attention spans, easy
distractibility, excessive activity and impulsiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of children with diagnoses of the disorder are
given Ritalin (methylphenidate), a stimulant that has the
paradoxical effect of calming them down and helping them to get a
better focus on the task at hand. The use of Ritalin in children
has skyrocketed in the last decade, increasing two and a half times
in the first five years of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While Ritalin is highly effective _ it helps 70 percent to 90
percent of children with the disorder, often significantly _ there
is growing concern about its extensive use and occasional abuse,
its common side effects and its possible and still unknown
long-term effects on children who take it for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Various estimates hold that 3 percent to 5 percent of
schoolchildren have the disorder, which affects twice as many boys
as girls. But in some schools as many as 20 percent of boys in the
upper elementary grades are being given Ritalin. Critics say that
many boys exhibiting normal (testosterone-induced?) activity and
aggressiveness are being improperly labeled hyperactive and treated
with a drug that may ultimately do them more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by these concerns and nagging questions about the
effects of diet on behavior, the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a nutrition advocacy group, has taken a new hard look at
the studies that explored various dietary factors in ADHD and the
pronouncements by health authorities that there is little or no
evidence to support such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   A new report, released last week, reviews 23 of the best studies
conducted since the mid-1970s and public statements from the Food
and Drug Administration, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
International Food Information Council and the American Council on
Science and Health, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes that the evidence strongly indicates that for some
children, behavioral disorders are caused or aggravated by certain
food additives, artificial food colors, the foods themselves or a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 of the 23 studies, behavioral improvements were noted when
the children's diets were modified. Eleven other studies, ones that
were not as well designed, showed even greater improvements on
restricted diets.
</P>
<P>
   The center and a group of physicians and scientists who share
this conclusion have urged the Department of Health and Human
Services to advise parents and health professionals to try changing
the diets of children with ADHD before placing them on stimulant
drugs (Ritalin or amphetamines) that may suppress their appetites
and cause weight loss, insomnia, stomachaches and, in rare cases,
tics. The petitioners also expressed concern about a laboratory
study that found an increase in liver tumors in mice (but not rats)
given doses of Ritalin not much greater than what children receive.
</P>
<P>
   The center has also asked the Health and Human Services
Department to commission new and better studies on the relationship
between diet and behavior in children, and the Food and Drug
Administration to require behavioral tests for certain food
additives.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a consensus conference convened by the National
Institutes of Health noted in its final report that ``some of the
dietary elimination strategies showed intriguing results suggesting
future research'' but then failed to include diet in its research
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the report suggested that the food industry refrain
from using suspect additives and that the g ``consider banning
synthetic dyes in foods and other products widely consumed by
children,'' including cupcakes, candies, sugary breakfast cereals,
vitamin pills, drugs and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a small percentage of children with the disorder
are expected to benefit significantly from changes in their diets,
the new report urges parents to try the changes before resorting to
drugs. Children who suffer from asthma, eczema or hives are
especially likely to benefit, some research has indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling behavior through diet requires first identifying and
then removing from the child's diet those foods or chemicals that
seem to cause the unwanted behaviors. The task is not easy, but it
has been done successfully for many children with food allergies.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to approach the problem. One is to start
with a very basic diet of foods that are beyond suspicion and one
at a time add back possible culprits for a few days and carefully
monitor the results. Another is to eliminate one suspect food or
substance at a time from the child's usual diet and see if there is
an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The substances that have most often been linked to worsening
ADHD symptoms include artificial colors and flavors; foods that
naturally contain salicylates, like apricots, berries and tomatoes;
and foods that sometimes cause allergic reactions, like milk, wheat
and corn. Some children may also react to chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, and children when they are old enough, will have to
become compulsive label readers to avoid the offending foods. And
of course, keeping a child away from problem foods can be a
daunting task, especially when the child eats lunch in school, goes
out to eat or eats in other people's homes. Some children may be
teased about their dietary restrictions; others may rebel at being
deprived of foods and treats they love. On the other hand, as one
11-year-old from Waldorf, Md., put it, ``I would rather be
different because of what I eat than because of how I behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Single copies of the report, ``Diet, ADHD and Behavior,'' are
available for $8, and a brochure, ``A Parent's Guide to Diet, ADHD
and Behavior,'' which summarizes the report and suggests ways of
modifying the diet, is available for $1.50 from CSPI-Behavior,
Suite 300, 1875 Connecticut Ave., Washington, D.C. 20009. The
reports are also posted on the center's Web site (www.cspinet.org).

ON THE OUTER LIMITS OF THE ENVELOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Allergies, I am told, don't flare up the first time you come
in contact with the offending agent,'' writes Tom Wolfe, author of
the novels ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Man in Full.'' ``The
allergens build up gradually over time until one day you can't take
it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a writer's way of beginning a letter. None of this
right-to-the-point e-mail stuff, or apologies for belatedness, or
arch ``anent: whatever.'' On the contrary, a letter that begins
with an apt metaphor or an original turn of phrase causes the
recipient to sit back and prepare to enjoy the vanishing art of
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happened to me when it came to the expression  &UR; pushing
the envelope &LR; ,'' Wolfe continued, enclosing a clipping from The New
York Times with the headline `` &UR; Pushing the Bleeping Envelope &LR; .''
The article quoted Doug Herzog, president of the Fox Entertainment
Group, about the sex talk and profanity in one of his television
series: ``Without question, it  &UR; pushes the envelope &LR; .'' The
reporter, Bernard Weinraub, then observed, ``Mr. Herzog is hardly
alone in  &UR; pushing the envelope &LR; .'' This was fairly heavy pushing.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Pushing an envelope &LR;  isn't very hard,'' notes the novelist.
``It's one of the easiest things in the world and one of the most
pointless. The actual expression, which comes from flight test, is
` &UR; pushing the outside of the envelope &LR; .'''
</P>
<P>
   There is a world of metaphoric difference between shoving a
piece of stationery around and pushing the outside of a container
from the inside. ``Each type of aircraft has a certain envelope
within which it can operate safely,'' writes Wolfe. ``It can dive
safely only up to such-and-such a slope or turn safely only beyond
such-and-such a radius. Trying to stretch those limits is  &UR; pushing
the outside of the envelope &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In mathematics, the outer boundary of a family of curves has
been known since the mid-19th century as the  &UR; envelope &LR; .
Aeronautical engineers later applied the word to the limits of
aircraft operation, from  &UR; gust envelopes &LR;  to  &UR; maneuver envelopes &LR; 
to  &UR; flight envelopes &LR; . When a test pilot presses against those
outer limits, he  &UR; pushes the outside of the envelope &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe helped introduce the metaphor and certainly popularized
the phrase in ``The Right Stuff,'' his 1979 book about astronauts.
``Perhaps that's why the allergens finally got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clymer's Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clan's reverence for evocative language has long
ennobled political speech. My New York Times colleague Adam Clymer,
in the new ``Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography'' (Morrow, $27.50),
shows how the youngest of the Kennedy brothers has used the
family's affinity for the sea in political metaphor: In his 1978
speech challenging Jimmy Carter on health insurance, Kennedy said,
``Sometimes a party must sail against the wind.'' Two years later,
his challenge to Carter's renomination defeated, he boasted, ``We
have kept the rudder true.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator compiled a privately printed book, ``Words Jack
Loved,'' Clymer recounts, which shows the origins of some familiar
themes and lines in President Kennedy's speeches.
</P>
<P>
   This collection included a rhyme attributed to soldiers in the
Irish brigade in the Civil War's Battle of Fredericksburg: ``War
battered dogs are we/Gnawing a naked bone/Fighters in every war and
clime/For every cause but our own.'' And this biblical passage from
Luke 12:48: ``For unto whomsoever much is given, of him much shall
be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will
ask the more.''
</P>
<P>
   Poetic allusions pervade Kennedy prose to this day. In his
eulogy to JFK Jr., Edward Kennedy sorrowed that the young man did
not ``live to comb gray hair,'' from William Butler Yeats' 1919
poem ``In Memory of Major Robert Gregory'': ``What made us dream
that he could comb gray hair?''
</P>
<P>
   I'd add that though Ted Kennedy has few rivals in the delivery
of a prepared address, his extemporaneous oratory sometimes falls
short. In last month's Senate debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, he rose to urge continued funds for the Nuclear Stockpile
Stewardship Program, which aims to keep our weapons in usable
condition without testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key element of our adherence to the treaty ... is the
Stockpile  &UR; Stewardess &LR;  Program,'' Kennedy said. Aides winced at the
slip of the lip, but he did it again in his ringing voice. As Al
Kamen of The Washington Post cruelly noted, he concluded that
``with the Stockpile  &UR; Stewardess &LR;  Program, we will still be able to
maintain a powerful nuclear deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a fine orator can goof. (The preferred term is  &UR; flight
attendant &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Editor Gore
</P>
<P>
   To show that Al Gore personally participated in the writing of a
TV spot blasting the Senate rejection of the nuclear test ban, his
campaign made available the script with his handwritten editing.
Let's see how he did:
</P>
<P>
   A line in the draft read, ``I want to ensure ((the drafter meant
 &UR; assure &LR; )) our nation and the entire world that this vote does not
speak for the majority of the American people.'' Gore changed that
to ``I believe in my heart that this vote does not speak for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another line went, ``Campaigns should be about the important
issues, and there's none more important than stopping the spread of
nuclear weapons.'' Gore's fix: ``I believe campaigns should be
about the future, and there is no more important challenge than
stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Note (1) the insertion of the self with  &UR; I believe &LR; ; (2) the
substitution of  &UR; the future &LR;  for the dull  &UR; the important issues &LR; ;
(3) the replacement of the ungrammatical  &UR; there's none more
important &LR;  with  &UR; there is no more important challenge &LR; , a correct
use of the singular that avoids repeating  &UR; important &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The weak draft: ``I will ask the American people for a clear
mandate. And if elected president, my first act will be to resubmit
the test ban treaty.'' The vice president's handwritten redraft
rolls along with greater strength: ``I ask for your support and
your mandate if elected President to send this treaty back to the
Senate with your demand that they ratify it.''  &UR; Demand &LR;  beats
 &UR; resubmit &LR;  any day, and by making it  &UR; your &LR;  demand, rather than his
own, he avoided arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   A careful TV-spot writer would not use the plural  &UR; they &LR;  with
the singular  &UR; Senate &LR; , but that's nitpicking.

DORLING-KINDERSLEY, AN EMPIRE BUILT ON COLLEGIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating Sunday story to fix Kindersley's first name in lede to
Peter.)   (For release Sunday, October 31)  (DW) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Peter Kindersley bicycles from his home across the
River Thames every morning, slicing through traffic to his office
in Covent Garden, his suit pants bound with steel clips to avoid
catching in the sprockets. Kindersley, chairman and former chief
executive of the British publisher Dorling Kindersley, then marches
up four flights of stairs, dismissing the lift as simply a modern
excuse for laziness.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley, 58, admits upfront that he is not exactly in the
mainstream of a business now dominated by global conglomerates. ``I
was trained as a painter and not a business person at all,'' he
said, sitting in the office that he shares with James Middlehurst,
who took over as chief executive in August 1998 to supply the
financial skills that Kindersley admittedly lacks. ``I run the
company as much more a workshop session rather than as a
hierarchical business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley is a publishing throwback _ one whose old-fashioned
independence of mind is such that he and his partner in the
company's 1974 founding have largely ceased speaking to each other
over Kindersley's resistance to selling out.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley has changed little since he toiled away on the
company's first book, illustrating photography techniques for
tradesmen.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has.
</P>
<P>
   Though modest by the standards of the industry's giants, Dorling
Kindersley now publishes more than 300 titles a year. This year,
capitalizing on its reputation for distinctive illustration, the
company has reached deals to publish licensed books _ tied to
brands or products _ for Mattel's Barbie line, for the National
Football League and for the Star Wars series (an exclusive,
seven-year deal initiated by George Lucas).
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a consolidating industry, the company has remained
stubbornly independent. Kindersley, whose gentle demeanor belies a
determination to chart his own course, would not have it any other
way. Walt Disney, W.H. Smith of Britain and Microsoft are among the
suitors who have approached him, but he has rebuffed every offer.
</P>
<P>
   Kindersley began Dorling Kindersley with no grand ambitions. ``I
set up the company because I had a wife and two children to feed,
and I had fallen out with my previous company in a fairly serious
way,'' he said. The issue was what Kindersley calls the failure of
that company, also a publisher, to make good on the promise of a 5
percent stake for becoming art director.
</P>
<P>
   His old experience and his new predicament inspired him to start
a new kind of publisher. ``I was so horrified by how boring it was
because it was so word-based _ there was no interest in what a book
looked like,'' he said. ``It was just this sort of university
mentality where every shred of aesthetic had been pressed out of
them. I thought I must do something about this or I'll never
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   After that first photography book, he moved into children's and
reference books. Since 1991, the company has also sold more than 40
million of its Eyewitness Guides travel series.
</P>
<P>
   All these books have made Kindersley rich. He holds a 7.8
percent stake in a company worth $348 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still feels poor. ``It was strictly survival then and it
is still survival today,'' he said. ``I begin to feel poor if the
company doesn't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorling Kindersley has always been a family affair. His wife,
Juliet, an artist, has been a board member since the company's
founding. His son, Barnabas, took the photographs for Dorling
Kindersley's 1995 children's best seller, ``Children Just Like
Me.'' His daughter, Rosie, is the company's food editor.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kindersley treats most of the staff like family, his
refusal to sell out has alienated his original partner, Christopher
Dorling. Dorling, who retired in 1987 but remains a board member,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   With trademark elements like the DK logo on every cover and
spine ``You can spot a Dorling book a mile off,'' said Lorna
Tilbian, an analyst at West LB Panmure in London. But Kindersley's
business acumen does not match his flair for design, Ms. Tilbian
added, saying, ``There is nobody in this industry who can combine
creative skills with financial skills.''
</P>
<P>
   It was wobbly financial performance that helped prompt
Kindersley to hand day-to-day operations over to Middlehurst, a
former entertainment executive. The company lost 77 percent of its
stock market value from 1996 to 1998 as it struggled to introduce a
line of CD-ROM's and manage its investments in emerging markets.
The shares have since rebounded, closing Friday at $4.83.
</P>
<P>
   But Kindersley would much rather talk about books than finance.
</P>
<P>
   After much prodding, he explains why Kindersley remains second
in the company name. It is for esthetic, not business reasons. ``KD
doesn't work so well, does it?'' he said. ``DK sounds better.''

SEEING PAST OUR OWN PAIN TO HELP OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bea Salazar was down on her luck, suffering emotionally and
physically from the pain of a broken marriage and a workplace
injury that rendered her unable to work and provide for her five
children.
</P>
<P>
   Her suffering had almost consumed her. Then one day, she
happened upon a little boy looking for lunch in the trash bin
outside her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She took him home, fed him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
and sent him on his way. Fifteen minutes later, six 5-year-olds
were at her door. They were hungry, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true you're giving peanut butter sandwiches away?'' one
little boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar told them she wasn't, but she fed them anyway. When the
next batch showed up, she fed them, too. And the next.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter and jelly and a sense of purpose. For the first
time in a long while, Bea Salazar could lay down her burden and
embrace the tremendous joy life offers us in helping others.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is known as the founder of ``Bea's Kids,'' a
nonprofit organization in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton.
</P>
<P>
   I liked this story for two reasons: First, peanut butter and
jelly is my favorite sandwich. More important, it was uplifting to
see how Salazar realized that she wasn't the only one with burdens
and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Her story is just one of 30 sketches in Jackie Waldman's ``The
Courage to Give,'' a collection of stories describing how people
healed themselves by reaching out to others.
</P>
<P>
   The title implies giving, but more often than not the stories _
for me at least _ were about putting the needs of others before our
own.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to stay in a place of pain, to ask, ``Why me?'' and
``How?'' and ``When?'' I know, because more than once I've asked
God ``Why?''; Why is there is so much injustice in the world? Why
does it seem evil always triumphs?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions, in particular, were lingering when ``The
Courage to Give'' showed up on my desk last week. I had been trying
to help a friend through a rough spot and not even my faith in an
all-powerful, all-knowing God seemed to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   In my mind, I recounted every biblical story I'd ever read:
Daniel in the lion's den, the three Hebrew boys in the fiery
furnace, David when he faced Goliath, and even Paul when he was
thrown into a Roman prison.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Salazar, I couldn't see past the pain I'd witnessed in
my friend. I was angry.
</P>
<P>
   I had to read no further than the foreword of ``The Courage to
Give,'' however, to reclaim my peace: ``A heart filled with anger
has no room for love.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the courage to give in the face of adversity come
from? How do you love someone, for instance, who has wronged you or
someone you love?
</P>
<P>
   By letting go of the pain and seeking the greater good.
</P>
<P>
   I knew this just as surely as Daniel was rescued from the lion's
den, as the Hebrew boys escaped the fiery furnace and as David slew
Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``The Courage to Give,'' I was reminded that their focus
was never on their adversity; it was on all-powerful, all-knowing
God.
</P>
<P>
   Job said that though you slay me, yet will I trust in God.
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice a month, a book comes to me that I either toss
into the office giveaway box or put in my bookcase to read at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, I get a book like ``The Courage to Give'' and
I have to read it right away. I've done that, but I'm going to put
it in the giveaway box anyway. Maybe it will inspire someone else
as it did me.

JACKSON, RIMES RECAPTURE THE MAGIC OF CLASSIC COUNTRY MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By SHIRLEY JINKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like opening volleys of cannon fire, Alan Jackson and LeAnn
Rimes released two of the year's most significant country albums
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being rivals, ``Under the Influence'' and ``LeAnn
Rimes'' represent a singular statement, a stylistic line drawn in
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson actually fired the first shot last month, with his small
act of defiance during the Country Music Association awards show in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   You remember: George Jones had been told to cut his song to fit
into a tight time frame. Jones said forget it and didn't perform.
Jackson came on to do his new single from this album, ``Pop a
Top,'' and slipped in a verse of Jones' scheduled song,
``Choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it wasn't right, and that George Jones deserved
more respect than that,'' Jackson said of his actions, on an
appearance the next night on ``Prime Time Country,'' itself a
canceled show.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Waylon Jennings has joked around at Billy Bob's
about lighting a fire, literally, under certain music programmers.
And fans have written this newspaper in support of an
editorial-page piece written by veteran Arlington radio man Bill
Mack.
</P>
<P>
   For country music lovers, this is obviously Day 13 of the siege
of the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, ``Under the Influence'' is Jackson's
best shot yet, lobbed over country's battered walls.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's choices here are warm and familiar, but not overdone.
His reflections on each song, printed in the margins of the lyric
sheet, reveal his own past, as well as country music's more honest
era.
</P>
<P>
   Savor ``Farewell Party,'' ``Once You've Had the Best,'' and
``Revenooer Man.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't attempt to sound like the originals, instead bringing
his own clean baritone and uncluttered arrangements to the
material. (However, he sounds uncannily like a young Merle on ``My
Own Kind of Hat.'')
</P>
<P>
   It really breaks the mood to include ``Margaritaville,'' but
hey, Jackson got Jimmy Buffett to duet with him, so can you really
blame him?
</P>
<P>
   The album's best cut, another Haggard song, ``The Way I Am,''
might be Jackson's own mission statement, and everyone else's, too.
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes' return to the traditional country fold with her new
self-titled album on Curb is perhaps an even more crucial move than
Jackson's.
</P>
<P>
   She's been in real danger of becoming yesterday's entertainment
news, and this could be her ticket back to credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Recent campy forays and misfires in song selection (an album cut
of Prince's ``Purple Rain'' comes to mind) have undercut Rimes'
``Blue'' success and alienated many of her traditional fans.
There's nothing sadder than a good girl gone bad, you know.
</P>
<P>
   But here's ``LeAnn Rimes'' to salvage LeAnn Rimes, and it's good
enough to work. (Too bad they couldn't have come up with a more
imaginative title, though.)
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 12 offerings are old songs, including
``Crazy,'' ``Born to Lose,'' ``Cryin' Time'' and especially,
``She's Got You,'' which may actually improve on Patsy.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, that's blasphemy. Pretend you didn't read that.
</P>
<P>
   Now 17, Rimes obviously has some emotional maturity to go along
with that perfect voice. Take ``Faded Love'': She goes for low and
smoky at first, then piercingly poignant on the higher notes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``LeAnn Rimes'' has an old-time, countrypolitan feel
with lush strings, snare drums and quartet background vocals. It
harks back to the Patsy Cline era in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Best upbeat song? ``Lovesick Blues,'' so filled with flirty
turns, yodels, trills and triks, it comes off more Tin Pan Alley
than honky-tonk.
</P>
<P>
   Though a departure from the earlier material of the '50s and
'60s, LeAnn's upbeat ``Me &AMP; Bobbie McGee'' is another good turn,
though she hopelessly mangles some of the lyrics in an effort to be
stylish. ``Bobbie McGee'' comes off sounding like ``Babb-ey
Mag-hee-aah.''
</P>
<P>
   The one new song, ``Big Deal,'' owes more to Brenda Lee than
Patsy Cline stylistically.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Rimes fans may miss the purity and innocence of Rimes'
earlier work. But they all grow up sometime, huh? ___
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jackson, ``Under the Influence,'' Arista Nashville. Five
stars
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes, ``LeAnn Rimes,'' Curb Records. Four stars. ___

A MAN TRUSTING THERE'S MORE GOOD THAN BAD
</HEADLINE>
 ATTN: Colo. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent morning, I bought a newspaper at the neighborhood
bagel shop and had found a booth to read, when a front-page
headline caught my eye: ``Tragedy Again Hits Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long while, I could manage only the first few paragraphs
of the story about Carla Hochhalter's suicide, which had occurred
in a Denver suburb the day before. I wept that day in the bagel
shop, mourned for a woman and her family that I never really knew,
and remain saddened even now, several days later.
</P>
<P>
   She had walked into a Colorado pawnshop, asked to see a handgun,
loaded it and then shot herself, the newspaper story said. Just the
month before, the day after the shootings at Wedgwood Baptist
Church, I had traveled to the Denver suburb of Littleton and spoken
with her husband, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose our faith, not only in God, but in the goodness of
human nature, we lose everything,'' Ted Hochhalter told me on the
telephone that September night.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a remarkable statement under the circumstances. In
April, his teen-age daughter had been paralyzed in the infamous
rampage at Columbine High School. Now, with his wife's suicide, Ted
Hochhalter's remarkable faith is being tested again. The intensity
of my own grief on that Saturday morning surprised me. In the bagel
shop, I wondered how much suffering a human could possibly endure.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of assignment I dread, calling to request an
interview with a bereaved person, to intrude on their pain. And my
unease that night in September only intensified after hearing the
profound weariness and sadness in Ted Hochhalter's voice.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, Anne Marie Hochhalter, Ted's daughter, was eating
lunch outside Columbine High when two young gunmen approached. Anne
Marie was critically wounded and left partially paralyzed. Her
younger brother, Nathan, was trapped inside the school that day and
still carries emotional wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hochhalter's wife, Carla, battled severe depression, her husband
told me that night. He was struggling desperately to keep his
family afloat. Quite obviously, another call from another reporter
was the last thing that Ted Hochhalter needed.
</P>
<P>
   But only the night before my call, another gunman entered a
public space, this time Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth,
pitching another community into the darkest days of shock and
grief. I had been sent by the Star-Telegram to Littleton to
interview the survivors of Columbine in the hope that our residents
might learn something from brethren in the recently stricken Denver
suburb. That night on the telephone, after a moment's hesitation,
Ted Hochhalter agreed to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the people in Fort Worth, and will
continue to,'' he said in that unforgettably weary voice that
night, ``because it's like the doctor said about Anne Marie's
injury: `It's not a short race. It's a marathon.' Now they have to
go back in and pick up the pieces, and it's not an easy thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet from somewhere within his devastation, Hochhalter managed to
offer hope. Fort Worth would rise to the occasion, he said,
``because it's happened here for us.'' He spoke of the meals
prepared for his family, help with the laundry, the hundreds of
cards and letters from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something you can never forget is that there are many more
good people in the world than there are bad, like the one
individual who did this in Fort Worth,'' Hochhalter told me. ``If
we lose our faith, not only in God, but in the goodness of human
nature, we lose everything. Things will get better. The community
in Fort Worth will rise to the occasion and be there for those
people. I believe that from the bottom of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, his words were an extraordinary act of courage and
generosity, a source of light for Fort Worth, a place badly in need
of it. Ted Hochhalter and I had talked on the telephone for only 30
minutes, but in 20 years of journalism, few people had touched me
so deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that headline and the surprising intensity of my own
grief. Further on in the grim account of Carla Hochhalter's suicide
were the hopeful comments of her husband, spoken to me in our
previous interview. Ted Hochhalter's hope now seemed tragically
ironic.
</P>
<P>
   The question that the newspaper story raised was only implied,
but unavoidable: After yet another wrenching tragedy, could he
possibly feel the same way, cling to even the faintest hope? Who
could blame him if he couldn't?
</P>
<P>
   But somehow I believe he will. Maybe not now _ but someday, I
believe, his hope will return. One can only imagine the burdens
that await him: the grief of the loss of his wife, the struggles of
caring for his scarred daughter and son. But there is a certain
indestructibility to hearts like that of Ted Hochhalter's, a person
who found it within himself to offer comfort to Fort Worth amid his
own profound weariness and pain.
</P>
<P>
   My own hope is that we can now reciprocate _ perhaps not in a
tangible way, but with our thoughts and prayers for Ted and his
family. Maybe, in this sad moment, it is a chance to demonstrate
what Ted Hochhalter has publicly believed: In this world, despite
so much evidence to the contrary, there are many more good people
than bad. ___

<P>
   On a recent morning, I bought a newspaper at the neighborhood
bagel shop and had found a booth to read, when a front-page
headline caught my eye: ``Tragedy Again Hits Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long while, I could manage only the first few paragraphs
of the story about Carla Hochhalter's suicide, which had occurred
in a Denver suburb the day before. I wept that day in the bagel
shop, mourned for a woman and her family that I never really knew,
and remain saddened even now, several days later.
</P>
<P>
   She had walked into a Colorado pawnshop, asked to see a handgun,
loaded it and then shot herself, the newspaper story said. Just the
month before, the day after the shootings at Wedgwood Baptist
Church, I had traveled to the Denver suburb of Littleton and spoken
with her husband, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose our faith, not only in God, but in the goodness of
human nature, we lose everything,'' Ted Hochhalter told me on the
telephone that September night.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed a remarkable statement under the circumstances. In
April, his teen-age daughter had been paralyzed in the infamous
rampage at Columbine High School. Now, with his wife's suicide, Ted
Hochhalter's remarkable faith is being tested again. The intensity
of my own grief on that Saturday morning surprised me. In the bagel
shop, I wondered how much suffering a human could possibly endure.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of assignment I dread, calling to request an
interview with a bereaved person, to intrude on their pain. And my
unease that night in September only intensified after hearing the
profound weariness and sadness in Ted Hochhalter's voice.
</P>

   &UR; REMEDIES: Catching Headache Pain on the Rebound &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A 33-year-old woman who consulted a Houston neurologist about
her persistent migraines was relieved when a brain scan showed her
fears of a tumor or aneurysm were unfounded. But she was skeptical
when her doctor told her the cause was much simpler: her headache
pills.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter published last month in the journal Headache, the
neurologist, Dr. Randolph Evans, described a case of ``rebound
headaches,'' a phenomenon he said was too little known among
migraine sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Evans wrote that the woman came to see him after her occasional
migraines had turned into daily afflictions. She had been taking an
over-the-counter medication containing acetominophen, aspirin and
caffeine, and her daily dosage had grown until it reached two to
six pills daily.
</P>
<P>
   She was doubtful when she was told to stop taking the pills,
Evans wrote, ``as she was not aware of rebound headaches.'' He
added, ``The patient was pleasantly surprised when the frequency of
her headaches dramatically decreased within 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seymour Solomon, director of the headache unit at Montefiore
Medical Center in the New York, said that ``virtually any analgesic
designed to be used for headaches'' could perpetuate them if taken
too often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We caution patients not to take medication for an acute attack
more than two days a week,'' Solomon said. Switching pills can help
prevent rebounds, he said, but the best way to avoid rebound
headaches is to consult a physician about preventive medication.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PATTERNS: How the Eyes Help Watch the Weight &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the intimate connection between the eyes and
the stomach should consider these observations.
</P>
<P>
   For children: Elementary-school pupils who were encouraged to
watch less television put on less body fat over six months,
according to a Stanford University study published in a special
issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association devoted to
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   For adults: Nutrition experts at the American Institute for
Cancer Research suggest that weight-conscious people figure out
just how much they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Citing studies that have found that most people underestimate
their daily consumption by 25 percent, the institute recommends
``eyeballing'' the diet by checking the serving size of a food on
its label, measuring out that amount and dumping it on an empty
plate, then comparing that with a mental image of how much food is
actually eaten. ``Without knowing how big a serving size really is,
the nutritional information listed on labels can't be put into
context,'' said Melanie Polk, the institute's director of nutrition
education.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXCHANGES: Anonymous Patient, Irate, Goes Public &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's a standard of medical journals: a letter outlining the
unusual case of an anonymous patient. But in an unusual twist, a
Michigan man has thrown aside anonymity to take issue with the
description of his cases and to remind doctors of the consequences
of journal submissions.
</P>
<P>
   The patient, George J. Borg, said his friends figured out that
he was the patient whose drug use was being blamed for a
neurological disorder after they heard news reports based on the
letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. Borg said his
doctors told him about the letter just before it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The original letter, published May 6, linked Borg's difficulties
in walking, speaking and balancing to his admitted use nine times
of the drug ecstasy. After noting that Borg denied using other
drugs besides cannabis, Dr. Scott Mintzer, Dr. Susan Hickenbottom
and Dr. Sid Gilman of the University of Michigan Medical Center
asserted that while they had ``no firm evidence of a causal
relation'' between his drug use and his condition, ``no other
tenable explanations'' existed.
</P>
<P>
   In a journal letter last week, Borg denied ever using marijuana
and wondered why the doctors had focused on his use of ecstasy
instead of looking at other possibilities. But mainly he complained
about his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said they had ``assiduously protected'' his
confidentiality. After Borg submitted the letter, he said, doctors
at the Mayo Clinic determined he had Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TESTING: Slowing the Heart, Extending the Life &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac patients whose hearts take longer than normal to recover
after exercise are far more likely to die of heart disease,
according to a study at the Cleveland Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead researcher, Dr. Michael S. Lauer, said the
findings suggested ``a very easy, inexpensive, safe way'' to
separate potential heart patients into low- or high-risk groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, published last week in The New England Journal of
Medicine, 2,428 adults who had or were suspected of having heart
disease were monitored as their heart rates rose during limited
exercise and fell when the exertion stopped.
</P>
<P>
   What doctors call vagal tone, the ability of the vagus nerve to
automatically speed or slow the pulse on demand, has long been
considered an indication of physical fitness; healthy adults drop
their heart rates an average of 20 beats in the first minute after
work stops, said Lauer, a cardiologist who is director of the
clinic's exercise laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the the patients had their pulses fall by at least 12
beats. But 26 percent had very poor recovery rates, and they
accounted for more than half the deaths among patients over the
next six years. Lauer said that meant their odds of dying were four
times the rate of the other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, Lauer said, is that the test appears to offer a
solid way of assuring most cardiac patients that their risks of
mortality are ``extremely low.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, there is no treatment for
abnormalities of the vagal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In patients that are identified as high risk, everything that
can be fixed should be fixed,'' he said. ``Blood pressure should be
lowered if it's high, cholesterol should be lowered, smokers should
be read the riot act and angioplasty or bypass should be strongly
considered if indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIDE EFFECTS: Hope for Reversing Damage From Drugs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even in low doses and even for a relatively short time,
amphetamine use leads to diminished capacity to learn in monkeys, a
Yale study has found.
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases the damage was reversed. And the treatment the
researchers used may hold promise for disorders linked to excessive
levels of the brain chemical dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stacy Castner, the researcher at Yale who conducted the
study, said the team was surprised at the depth and persistence of
the cognitive deficits that resulted from six weeks' intermittent
exposure to the drugs. A task that undrugged monkeys were able to
learn in fewer than 100 attempts was beyond the ability of the
drugged monkeys after up to 18 months of trials, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The implication for humans, she said, is that even brief periods
of dabbling in amphetamines could diminish the mind's performance
for years and perhaps permanently.
</P>
<P>
   In the second phase of the study, the drugged monkeys were given
an experimental medication that stimulated a dopamine receptor,
reducing the dopamine's effect. Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic, a
neuroscience professor at Yale who supervised the work, said that
in some cases this succeeded in reversing the cognitive damage,
apparently permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from this research,'' she said, ``shouldn't be
that it's now OK to take speed because there's a drug that can
reverse it.'' Instead, the hope is that studies into medications
that alter dopamine levels could eventually lead to treatments for
a wide range of conditions, including schizophrenia and attention
deficit disorder, in which that delicate balance is involuntarily
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented in Miami last week at a conference of
the Society of Neuroscience.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many things that offend me on television these days is
an advertisement that clearly makes fun of something very serious.
</P>
<P>
   You will have noticed in recent years that football players from
opposing teams occasionally gather in a small group after the game
to offer a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Some find such an obvious display of religion offensive, either
because they are not religious or because they believe that prayers
are more properly offered in private.
</P>
<P>
   There is Scripture to support the latter view in Matthew 6,
where Jesus warns about those who ``love to pray standing in the
synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
of men.''
</P>
<P>
   So some think the football-field prayer circles are too much for
show.
</P>
<P>
   Others see them as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   There is support for this in Matthew 5, where Jesus reminds his
followers that they are ``the light of the world'' and commands
them to ``let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the difference is in the heart. Prayer offered so that
the person doing the praying may be seen as being religious is
questionable. Sincere prayer is not.
</P>
<P>
   Until someone proves differently to me, I will choose to believe
that those football players who point to heaven after a score, or
who kneel in the end zone or who gather with opposing players in
small groups are doing it because their hearts are sincere.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I find this particular advertisement offensive. It's
a really good ad _ showing a football player trash-talking by
questioning his opponent's investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, several players are shown kneeling on
the field, discussing investments. It's funny right up to that
point, but that's where it crosses my personal out-of-bounds line.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to golfer Payne Stewart. Stewart's Learjet
crashed last Monday, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   There will be many ways to remember Stewart, but the image that
will remain in my mind is of his fist-pumping, leaping celebration
on the 18th green at Pinehurst in North Carolina when he dropped a
seemingly impossible putt to win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   But do you remember what he did next?
</P>
<P>
   On national TV, he credited his win to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that happens often after athletic conquests,
setting off no shortage of skeptics questioning the true religious
commitment by the victorious sports star,'' writer Larry Guest said
in The Orlando Sentinel on Oct. 18, before Stewart's death. ``Payne
has had more skeptics than most during his 20-year PGA Tour career.
Perhaps it's the playful costume and the jaunty personality that
was interpreted as a lack of depth.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to question his sincerity any more, Guest said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Pinehurst, Stewart said his recent religious growth came by
osmosis through his children's experience at The First Academy, the
private Christian school on the FBC (First Baptist Church of
Orlando) campus,'' Guest said. ``He wore a simple, woven bracelet,
a gift from son Aaron, with the letters `WWJD' _ the Christian
guideline for daily living, `What Would Jesus Do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Guest notes that Stewart did not stop there. Without
fanfare, he and his wife, Tracey, gave a half-million dollars to
the First Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the First Baptist
Church of Orlando. Stewart also invited other parents to a barbecue
to urge them to contribute. The group pledged another $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a William J. Stewart House for the use of families
of cancer patients, a tribute to Stewart's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne funded it by donating the $108,000 first-place check
right after he won the 1987 Bay Hill Classic,'' Guest said.
</P>
<P>
   I liked watching Payne Stewart play golf. I liked his clothes. I
liked his style. And I like the quote from Stewart in Guest's
column when he was asked about his gift to the church:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracey and I and our kids have more than we deserve. That's
just the way it is. So it's not that hard to give something back.
We decided we wanted to give where it would make an impact, mostly
in the lives of children.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were skeptical after the U.S. Open or when other athletes
choose to proclaim a witness in public, consider this:
</P>
<P>
   We tread dangerous ground when we make assumptions about people
and about their motives. And we tread dangerous ground when we find
humor in people's most deeply held beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Who are we to question?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it God's job to (as the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic''
puts it) sift out hearts before the judgment seat?
</P>

THERE'S NO BUCKING VETERAN DEAR HUNTER JIM NIELSEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The stories of most people can be told on the
lines on a page, but the story of Jim Nielsen, 89, is best told
from the lines on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those creases and wrinkles are like the back roads on a
detailed map of the wilderness, leading off to secret canyons,
ridges and adventures, telling of a journey like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, always an avid outdoorsman, is believed to be the only
hunter in North America to have filled his buck tag for 70 straight
years. In addition, he has done it in a state, California, where
deer hunting is so difficult that 85 percent of hunters fail to get
their deer and many never see buck for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you need is a love of nature,'' Nielsen said.
``It is so beautiful at sun-up. I sit out there and listen to the
wild birds, the coyotes every morning. That can't be replaced by
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you must study the country,'' he continued. ``Out there
in the dry canyon country of the Coast Range, I know where the
water holes are. I'll get 100 yards from the water holes and watch
the wind, you know, keep the wind in your face and they can't smell
you. I've learned between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. is a very good time. A
buck nibbles on something, wants to get a drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people go too fast. They don't stop, look and listen.
They don't see the places where they feed, water and the routes
they take to those places. I've tromped around plenty to find those
places. 'Course, I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen has lived in the Watsonville, Calif., area for his
entire life. He is an avid hiker, camper, fishermen, bird hunter
and deer hunter, with his home decorated with several of his
trophies, including a 333-pound blue marlin, a one-in-a-million
buck with a strange non-typical rack that looks something like a
cactus, and a trophy deer mount with horns nearly two feet high,
with nine points and a 35-inch spread.
</P>
<P>
   He also won a Distinguished Service Award from Ducks Unlimited
for habitat conservation work in Elkhorn Slough area near Monterey
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Marilyn, almost always joins him on his hunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At age 65, he took me on hikes that I was sure were going to
kill me off _ I figured he wanted another wife,'' she joked. ``But
this is a hunting family. We go into tough country, rocky and
steep, and we look forward to it. We always spend our anniversary,
Aug. 16, at deer camp in the Coast Range.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim has a son from a previous marriage, Ray of Sacramento, 57,
who got his first buck as a 12-year-old, and a daughter, Jane Sharp
of Pleasanton. Jane has two sons, David, 20, and Steven, 16, who
both just passed hunter safety courses, and as a reward, Jim gave
them both hunting rifles.
</P>
<P>
   At 89, Nielsen still works his job, distributing grain seed to
farmers. He's owned a grain business since 1940, selling the seed,
then buying the harvest to sell to brokers for distribution across
the country. ``I've done it since the day I finished high school,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen credits his long, healthy life to the great love and
bonds in his family and his passions for his career and outdoor
adventure. ``'Course, I never smoked or drinked.''
</P>
<P>
   His first successful hunt was in 1930, deep in Chular Canyon in
the Coast Range of Monterey County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a greenhorn, about 20, and the fellow who was with me,
Dan Ready, my friend, was also a greenhorn,'' Nielsen said. ``We
didn't know too much about it. It was a hot day and I was pretty
tired, and I sat down at a brush patch for about an hour to rest,
and then I spotted this forked horn. I tracked him up a mountain
side, around a brush patch, and that's where I surprised him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time since, he's been schooled by the University of
Nature. Most of the lessons have come in the dry, brushy canyon
country of the Coast Range in Monterey and San Benito counties, and
the high rocky ridges of the Sierra Nevada, where he has driven his
Jeep, hiked and bushwhacked in wilderness to learn the skills of
woodsmanship. Most hikers never see much wildlife, he noted, and
many fishermen don't catch many fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most hunters get up early in the morning, tromp around for a
couple hours, don't see anything, and then go back to camp,''
Nielsen said. ``I go out in the morning and also hunt around as
much as I can, but I don't quit. I've seen most of my deer right in
the middle of the day, when most of the guys are back at their
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have two rules. I always use binoculars, wouldn't go
unless I had a pair. And I have to have a scope on my rifle for a
clean, accurate shot.''
</P>
<P>
   His most difficult hunt, Nielsen explained, was back in 1961,
just after he had been released from a hospital with multiple
injuries from a vehicle accident. He had been driving a harvester
on a twisty road near San Jose when a speeding car sailed around a
bend and rammed the harvester over a cliff _ ``I had a wrecked
ankle, broken pelvis, busted shoulder and a crooked neck, those
were the main things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week after I got out of the hospital, my boy Ray took me
out hunting,'' Nielsen said. ``One arm was still in a sling, and he
helped me put my boots on, put shells in my rifle. I wasn't strong
enough to hold a rifle. The last weekend of the season, we went
down Chular Canyon with the Jeep, the same area where I got my
first buck in 1930, and positioned ourselves at this one spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to lay the rifle on the Jeep and got down on my knees,
cause I only had one arm _ and I got my buck with one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled at the memory, lines around his eyes bunching into
little crinkles. The story on his face was like a book. It told of
70 years of hunts, adventures and passions fulfilled. No more words
were necessary.

RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE GOES INTO `BATTLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rage Against the Machine is one of those bands
that could only come from the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet, whose music fuses heavy metal, rap and political
themes to such a degree that gigs often resemble rallies, reflects
the city's racial makeup. The exhilarating sound the group makes,
too, refers to the many cultures co-existing here.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Rage's highly anticipated third album, ``The
Battle of Los Angeles'' (in stores Tuesday), which, in case there
was any question, makes its inspiration obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of tension and economic disparity
here,'' offers Rage guitarist Tom Morello. ``Hollywood is just a
tiny slice of the pie. Clearly we're just one cop-beating verdict
away from the whole place going up in flames. In our stage show,
you can hear the violence and aggression of the city _ the heat,
the funk, the hard rock, the punk, the hip-hop, the desperation and
hope that make up what this place is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rage's snarling anthems punched a hole in rock's spreading
apathy in 1992, spearheaded by Morello's power chords, tough
hip-hop rhythms and singer-rapper Zack de la Rocha's pulverizing
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Songs about the imprisonment of American Indian Movement leader
Leonard Peltier didn't seem like a recipe for Top-40 success. But
Rage developed a fervent following for sweaty, high-energy shows
while its self-titled debut spawned tracks that scored plenty of
radio airplay: ``Killing in the Name,'' an expletive-filled rant
against the ills of society; ``Bombtrack''; and ``Freedom,'' which
MTV surprisingly latched onto.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rage was marketed as a rap group, since the
now-commonplace hybrid of rock and hip-hop that fuels chart-topping
acts such as Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid Rock was years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an entirely different musical landscape,'' Morello, 35,
recalls. ``Everything was lined up against us. We were a
multiethnic band and if you had a black guy in your band, you
weren't gonna get rock-radio play. And if you had a white guy in
the group, hip-hop radio wasn't interested. And if there was a
Chicano guy who didn't sing in Spanish, nobody knew what to think.
And we were combining the most hard-core forms of music _ militant
rap and punk and hard rock with semi-Marxist lyrics on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Rage's 1996 album, ``Evil Empire,'' and its
single, ``Bulls on Parade,'' landed on far friendlier ground,
selling more copies its first week of release than any other record
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``The Battle of Los Angeles'' (Epic), containing songs
such as ``Voice of the Voiceless,'' about African-American radio
journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, sentenced to die by lethal injection
for killing a Philadelphia policeman. Other tracks deal with
racism, capitalism, media coverage of the Gulf War and the plight
of the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine-born de la Rocha, 29, says his lyrics are inspired by
political hip-hop outfits such as Public Enemy and socially
conscious writers such as James Baldwin. The ``Evil Empire'' disc,
in fact, included a suggested reading list of books by Che Guevara,
Malcolm X, Henry Miller, Noam Chomsky, Jean-Paul Sartre and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to write songs that engage people in a critical dialogue
about fighting for and among dispossessed peoples around the
world,'' de la Rocha recently told Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Morello insists such subject matter isn't incompatible with
recording for Epic, which is owned by entertainment monolith Sony
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 100 percent creative control over every aspect of our
career and Sony has worldwide reach,'' the Harvard-educated
guitarist said. ``If you were an author, wouldn't you want your
book in every book store in the world? Or would you rather sell it
out the back of your car?''
</P>
<P>
   Fans such as Lance Buchi, 17, who runs an impressive Web site
called ``The Complete Rage'' (www.musicfanclubs.org/rage), believe
such alliances are unavoidable in today's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rage spreads the truth to as many people as possible by
utilizing mainstream pop culture,'' the Salt Lake City high
schooler said. ``Those who struggle for change appreciate the
band's contribution. Those who don't are the ones questioning
Rage's legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you subscribe to the message or not, there's no denying
the blistering power of Rage's musical attack. As a note on the new
album proclaims, ``all sounds made by guitar, bass, drums and
vocals,'' and the overall effect on such standouts as the first
single, ``Guerrilla Radio,'' is often nothing less than startling.
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of chances to experience Rage in the coming
days. The band appears tonight on CBS-TV's ``Late Show With David
Letterman'' and in a sold-out show Friday at the Park Plaza Hotel
near downtown Los Angeles. Portions of the latter gig will be
broadcast live on KROQ-FM (106.7).
</P>
<P>
   Band members will also be on hand at Virgin Megastore Sunset at
3 p.m. Saturday to sign copies of ``The Battle of Los Angeles.''
And Nov. 11 you can catch Rage on NBC-TV's ``Late Night With Conan
O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket information is expected soon for a Dec. 19 show at
Staples Center, a 17,000-seat gig that's sure to draw an audience
that reflects not only the look of Rage but the look of Los Angeles
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite tradition of Los Angeles bands like the
Doors, X, Jane's Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, where you
really see and hear the city in their music,'' said Morello, who
grew up in the Chicago suburbs. ``I mean, those guys weren't gonna
come from any other place. I find it an inspiring place to live.
There are tremendous possibilities for both good and bad here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Morello and bandmates Tim Commerford (bass), Brad Wilk
(drums) and de la Rocha have only cut three albums in their seven
years together, the pressure was on during the making of ``The
Battle of Los Angeles,'' which is widely expected to hit the top of
the Billboard 200 upon release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't mind the pressure to create a memorable
record,'' Morello explains. ``I know what we're capable of. I like
the fact people are expecting the album of our career. It's better
than them not caring if we make a record at all. I mean, I want to
be the guy with the ball who has seconds to go before the buzzer
rings. I want to be the guy at bat when the bases are loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sort of pressure I look forward to.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Impact of Climate Change &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The effect of climate change on ecosystems is well known. In a
region experiencing a drought, to take an obvious example, less
flora is available for the fauna, which can cause populations of
certain animals to decline.
</P>
<P>
   But climate change can also have a more indirect effect on an
ecosystem, by altering the behavior of predators within it. The
latest illustration of this is from a long-term study of wolves in
Isle Royale National Park, an island sanctuary in Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by a team of researchers led by two Norwegian
biologists, shows that during harsh winters with more snow, wolves
hunt in larger packs. This makes them more efficient hunters and is
bad news for their favorite prey, moose. But what is bad for the
moose is good for the vegetation: fewer moose means that more
balsam fir saplings, the animal's main winter forage, survive.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied data collected over 40 years in the
park. Their analysis, reported in the journal Nature, shows that
average pack size ranged from 4.5 wolves during the mildest winters
to 12 during the snowiest, as grown pups that would normally leave
to seek mates stayed with the family instead. Larger packs killed
up to three times more moose than smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   The data showed there were fewer moose in the year after a snowy
winter. And by studying tree rings, the researchers found that in
those same years, growth of balsam fir saplings increased.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Legacy of an Intruder &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ecosystems can also be affected by the introduction of an
aggressive, non-native species. Often the result is significant, as
anyone who has spent hours chopping kudzu vine from fences and
telephone poles can attest.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by Canadian scientists suggests that even a
seemingly innocuous alien invader can have a negative impact.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied crested wheatgrass, which has steadily
supplanted native grasses in much of the northern Great Plains,
often at the enthusiastic insistence of ranchers and government
agencies. The grass was first imported from Siberia during the
drought years of the Dust Bowl, and is still valued for its
hardiness, long growing season and because it makes good hay.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists, writing in the journal Ecology, show that
all that crested wheatgrass appears to have reduced the quality of
the soil. Analyzing samples from Grasslands National Park in
Saskatchewan, the researchers found that soil under the wheat grass
had significantly fewer nutrients and less organic material than
soil under native varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The wheatgrass' root system is probably to blame. Wheatgrass
develops only shallow root, devoting most of its energy to its
above-ground shoots. Native grasses do not grow as tall, but their
roots are more extensive, allowing for greater enrichment of the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Star Measuring &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NASA has chosen a U.S. Naval Observatory satellite to check out
the neighborhood _ the galactic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The craft, called the Full-Sky Astrometric Mapping Explorer,
will carry a telescope to determine position, distance and other
information about stars brighter than 15th magnitude. Stars of that
magnitude are very faint (the North Star, by contrast, is of second
magnitude), so the spacecraft will have its hands full, measuring
about 40 million objects.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stars that the satellite will study are a class called
the Cepheids, which are used to measure the distance of galaxies
and other objects that are extremely far away. The telescope should
also be able to detect the presence of large planets in orbit
around other stars, by accurately measuring a star's wobble, which
is caused by the gravitational pull of a planet or other object.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite, which is expected to be launched in 2004, will
make use of the solar wind, the waves of electromagnetic radiation
emanating from the Sun, as a kind of solar sail to help keep the
telescope in the proper orientation.

SPIDERS' LIFE SPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 (Eds: Question may be italicized)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q How long do spiders live?
</P>
<P>
   A. With some exceptions, spiders that live in temperate regions
have a one-year life span, with the females outliving the males by
weeks or months. Perhaps the most interesting exceptions belong to
the family Lycosidae, or wolf spiders.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``American Spiders,'' by Willis J. Gertsch (Van
Nostrand), some members of this family live in elaborate silk-lined
underground burrows.
</P>
<P>
   The females protect their eggs in sacs that they carry
everywhere and care for assiduously. In burrowing species, the
female may even carry the sac to the surface to be warmed by the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   After hatching, the spiderlings may spend the winter in the home
burrow and may not reach full maturity until the second year,
eventually moving out to build their own burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Black widow spiders' life spans depend on when they are hatched,
according to ``The Black Widow Spider,'' by Raymond W. Thorp and
Eldon D. Woodson (Dover). Those hatched in late spring or early
summer reach maturity in about four months, before cold weather,
but may delay egg-laying until spring and then die a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Those that emerge later may find their development severely
retarded by the cold and the shortage of food. Only when warm
weather arrives again do they mature. They may live a year and a
half before reproducing. In the laboratory, some have lived through
two or even three summers.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sacking someone is a horrible task, as near to commanding a
firing squad as most civilized people get these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite as unpleasant as being sacked, of course, and it
is easier if you can delegate your dirty work to somebody in Human
Resources.e sheer nastiness of telling somebody it's time to
go is enough to make the toughest hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this truer than in the boardroom. Confronted with a
chief executive whose strategy is not working, the instinct of many
company directors is to wait in the hope that something _ the
shares, ideally _ will turn up. Far better to find a replacement,
quickly, and pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   An able chief executive has extraordinary power to make or break
a company. Take the way that Robert Ayling has turned Britain's BA
from ``the world's favourite airline'' into just another troubled
carrier. Or look at how Gil Amelio damaged Apple Computer and
Edzard Reuter wrecked Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed with which Apple's resurrection followed the
return of Steve Jobs, or the vigor with which Jurgen Schrempp has
restructured Daimler and Jean-Marie Messier has transformed
France's Vivendi, all show the value of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Such influence reflects the demands of running a large firm
these days. Backed by the corporate bureaucracy, a chief executive
might once have got by with good managers, cost-control, and a
beady eye on the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although such things still matter, a chief executive now has to
think for himself. He needs to be an innovator and an entrepreneur
with a global vision. He needs political skills, to steer a course
through the regulatory maze. He needs to be a salesman and a
preacher to woo consumers, employees and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a firm with a good boss does everything in its
power to hang on to him _ and why some of the most successful chief
executives, such as the late Roberto Goizueta of Coca-Cola, spent
years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the costs of failure are so high, it is also
essential to get rid of an underperforming boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, more boards are doing their duty. Indeed,
running a big American firm or a Silicon Valley start-up is now
riskier than being grand vizier in the court of the Ottoman sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Boards in other parts of the world are too reluctant to pull the
trigger. A few firms go to the other extreme and become serial
sackers; many others, even American ones, seem stuck with a
fossilized strategy and a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rakesh Khurana, of MIT's Sloan School of
Management, most boards give the chief executive a honeymoon of
between two and three years. Then follow a couple of dangerous
years. After that, the longer you are chief executive, the less
likely you are to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   A change might do the world of good in such companies as Disney
or Britain's Rentokil Initial, both of which have recently done
poorly under long-serving chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of such firms should ask themselves whether their
bosses are stars like Goizueta, or tyrants like Armand Hammer, who
ruled Occidental Petroleum as his fief into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is inaction, institutional investors bear part of
the blame. Rather than step in when performance flags, many prefer
to sell the shares or sit back and wait for a free ride on the
activism of others.
</P>
<P>
   When investors act, as they do increasingly in America, they
discover that replacing the boss is a labor of behind-the-scenes
negotiations. Which is why sacking the boss ultimately comes down
to the judgment of a firm's directors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet boards find many excuses for doing nothing. The boss is near
retirement; he is the founder; he is the founder's son. It would
look bad; it would be hard to find someone better; it would show
that the corporate strategy had been less brilliant than the board
had told shareholders at the previous AGM.
</P>
<P>
   How to change this? An essential is to structure the board so
that it can scrutinize the chief executive. That is best done when
the roles of non-executive chairman and chief executive are
separate, so that rebellious directors have a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Non-executives should meet without the chief executive, and make
a regular evaluation of the boss's achievements. Directors will do
this better if they have a stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have grasped the need to align the interests of
chief executive and shareholders, with shares or (less good) share
options; far fewer have seen the need to align the interests of
directors and shareholders in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Many mediocre chief executives owe their jobs to bad boards. The
longer a chief executive has been in the job, the more likely he is
to have appointed the executive directors and brought in his chums
as ``independent'' non-executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the chief executive's tennis coach and golf partner have to
decide his future, they are unlikely to vote for execution _ a
reason for ensuring that non-executives are truly professional, and
value their reputation for independence above their board fees.
</P>
<P>
   When it is time to make a change, firms should reluctantly
accept that they may have to pay a bad boss to leave. To pay a
crooked one would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, when a chief executive leaves under a cloud, his
career is wrecked and he is unlikely ever again to run a firm of
similar size.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out the boss may be the fastest way to give a company a

<P>
   Sacking someone is a horrible task, as near to commanding a
firing squad as most civilized people get these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite as unpleasant as being sacked, of course, and it
is easier if you can delegate your dirty work to somebody in Human
Resources. But the sheer nastiness of telling somebody it's time to
go is enough to make the toughest hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this truer than in the boardroom. Confronted with a
chief executive whose strategy is not working, the instinct of many
company directors is to wait in the hope that something _ the
shares, ideally _ will turn up. Far better to find a replacement,
quickly, and pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   An able chief executive has extraordinary power to make or break
a company. Take the way that Robert Ayling has turned Britain's BA
from ``the world's favourite airline'' into just another troubled
carrier. Or look at how Gil Amelio damaged Apple Computer and
Edzard Reuter wrecked Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   But the speed with which Apple's resurrection followed the
return of Steve Jobs, or the vigor with which Jurgen Schrempp has
restructured Daimler and Jean-Marie Messier has transformed
France's Vivendi, all show the value of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Such influence reflects the demands of running a large firm
these days. Backed by the corporate bureaucracy, a chief executive
might once have got by with good managers, cost-control, and a
beady eye on the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Although such things still matter, a chief executive now has to
think for himself. He needs to be an innovator and an entrepreneur
with a global vision. He needs political skills, to steer a course
through the regulatory maze. He needs to be a salesman and a
preacher to woo consumers, employees and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a firm with a good boss does everything in its
power to hang on to him _ and why some of the most successful chief
executives, such as the late Roberto Goizueta of Coca-Cola, spent
years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because the costs of failure are so high, it is also
essential to get rid of an underperforming boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, more boards are doing their duty. Indeed,
running a big American firm or a Silicon Valley start-up is now
riskier than being grand vizier in the court of the Ottoman sultan.
</P>
<P>
   Boards in other parts of the world are too reluctant to pull the
trigger. A few firms go to the other extreme and become serial
sackers; many others, even American ones, seem stuck with a
fossilized strategy and a familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rakesh Khurana, of MIT's Sloan School of
Management, most boards give the chief executive a honeymoon of
between two and three years. Then follow a couple of dangerous
years. After that, the longer you are chief executive, the less
likely you are to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   A change might do the world of good in such companies as Disney
or Britain's Rentokil Initial, both of which have recently done
poorly under long-serving chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of such firms should ask themselves whether their
bosses are stars like Goizueta, or tyrants like Armand Hammer, who
ruled Occidental Petroleum as his fief into his 90s.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is inaction, institutional investors bear part of
the blame. Rather than step in when performance flags, many prefer
to sell the shares or sit back and wait for a free ride on the
activism of others.
</P>
<P>
   When investors act, as they do increasingly in America, they
discover that replacing the boss is a labor of behind-the-scenes
negotiations. Which is why sacking the boss ultimately comes down
to the judgment of a firm's directors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet boards find many excuses for doing nothing. The boss is near
retirement; he is the founder; he is the founder's son. It would
look bad; it would be hard to find someone better; it would show
that the corporate strategy had been less brilliant than the board
had told shareholders at the previous AGM.
</P>
<P>
   How to change this? An essential is to structure the board so
that it can scrutinize the chief executive. That is best done when
the roles of non-executive chairman and chief executive are
separate, so that rebellious directors have a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Non-executives should meet without the chief executive, and make
a regular evaluation of the boss's achievements. Directors will do
this better if they have a stake in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have grasped the need to align the interests of
chief executive and shareholders, with shares or (less good) share
options; far fewer have seen the need to align the interests of
directors and shareholders in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Many mediocre chief executives owe their jobs to bad boards. The
longer a chief executive has been in the job, the more likely he is
to have appointed the executive directors and brought in his chums
as ``independent'' non-executives.
</P>
<P>
   When the chief executive's tennis coach and golf partner have to
decide his future, they are unlikely to vote for execution _ a
reason for ensuring that non-executives are truly professional, and
value their reputation for independence above their board fees.
</P>
<P>
   When it is time to make a change, firms should reluctantly
accept that they may have to pay a bad boss to leave. To pay a
crooked one would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, when a chief executive leaves under a cloud, his
career is wrecked and he is unlikely ever again to run a firm of
similar size.
</P>
<P>
   Buying out the boss may be the fastest way to give a company a
fresh start. A fresh start is exactly what many companies need. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   All the signs are that the Russian government thinks it is going
to swat its pesky Chechen rebels and reassert itself over the
country's turbulent southern rim by force. It is unlikely to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's military campaign has so far been a bit less
crass, though hardly less brutal, than it was in 1994-96, when
perhaps 80,000 people were killed, Chechnya won de facto
independence and Russia was humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chechens are no less tough now than they were then.
Today, moreover, the entire Caucasus, not just Chechnya, is a
dangerous mess, and Russia is making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Chechen war, the rest of the world stood aside,
vaguely muttering that it was an internal Russian affair. This
time, with several neighboring countries threatened by the
convulsions, outsiders have every reason to use their influence to
promote a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuitously, a good moment for trying to do that is at hand.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is
soon to hold its first grand summit for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the club's members are the United States, Russia, Turkey,
three ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan and
Armenia) and all the other countries of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE has come up in the world, mainly as an organization
that can discuss human rights and other delicate issues. It also
happens to be Russia's favorite forum.
</P>
<P>
   Its gathering in Istanbul in three weeks' time provides the
ideal opportunity to seek a general settlement in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Halting the bloodshed in Chechnya is the most urgent task. The
way to start would be for Russia, which now declares itself to be
in a position of strength, to offer a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   It could then negotiate with Aslan Maskhadov, Chechnya's elected
leader, and grant Chechnya at least the wide measure of autonomy
promised three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That would provide the best hope of winning the Chechens'
cooperation in the battle against Islamic terrorism in Russia's
cities, which is supposedly a large part of the reason for the
Russian campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will insist that this war in Chechnya, like the
last one, is an internal matter. But the international aspects
cannot be brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   At least 180,000 Chechens are said to have fled their homes;
many have gone west to Ingushetia, a neighboring republic within
Russia; some have gone south to Georgia. Disgracefully, the
Russians are blocking the exodus of more, and are being less than
helpful to charities such as the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russian meddling is feared well beyond its borders, especially
in countries sympathetic to Chechnya. So Georgia, which has a
general election on Oct. 31, suspects it is once more in Russia's
baleful sights.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, which wants the lion's share of the Caspian oil that
Russia covets, is equally nervous; its foreign minister was fired
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, Russia's oldest ally in the area, is convulsed in
political turmoil after its prime minister's assassination on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks _ blood-brothers of the Azeris and therefore, in
Russian eyes, a leading strategic foe _ are watching warily.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the signs are bad. The Russians may now be ready to
accept that most of the newly discovered oil being pumped from
Baku, the Azeris' Caspian-shore capital, will go via a pipeline
through Turkey to the Mediterranean _ and not, as they would
prefer, across their own land to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia might even help fix a deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a settlement of the big arguments in the area should not
mean letting Russia trample roughshod over the small peoples,
Chechens included, as the price for accepting its loss of influence
in the southern half of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The whole region is combustible. One bit affects another. The
summiteers in Istanbul should insist that making peace in Chechnya
is just one part, albeit the most urgent, of the business of
bringing stability to the entire Caucasus. &QL;

   At least 180,000 Chechens are said to have fled their homes;
many have gone west to Ingushetia, a neighboring republic within
Russia; some have gone south to Georgia. Disgracefully, the
Russians are blocking the exodus of more, and are being less than
helpful to charities such as the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Russian meddling is feared well beyond its borders, especially
in countries sympathetic to Chechnya. So Georgia, which has a
general election on Oct. 31, suspects it is once more in Russia's
baleful sights.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan, which wants the lion's share of the Caspian oil that
Russia covets, is equally nervous; its foreign minister was fired
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, Russia's oldest ally in the area, is convulsed in
political turmoil after its prime minister's assassination on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks _ blood-brothers of the Azeris and therefore, in
Russian eyes, a leading strategic foe _ are watching warily.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the signs are bad. The Russians may now be ready to
accept that most of the newly discovered oil being pumped from
Baku, the Azeris' Caspian-shore capital, will go via a pipeline
through Turkey to the Mediterranean _ and not, as they would
prefer, across their own land to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia might even help fix a deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a settlement of the big arguments in the area should not
mean letting Russia trample roughshod over the small peoples,
Chechens included, as the price for accepting its loss of influence
in the southern half of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   The whole region is combustible. One bit affects another. The
summiteers in Istanbul should insist that making peace in Chechnya
is just one part, albeit the most urgent, of the business of
bringing stability to the entire Caucasus. &QL;

<P>
   PRATT, KANSAS AND BROKEN BOW, NEBRASKA _ These may be boom times
in America, but some people feel the hoopla has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In Pratt County, Kan., a farming area that lies about an hour by
road from Wichita, one of the consuming worries is what to do when
you need a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt County's population is growing older: not just because of
the normal passage of time, but because the young folk tend to
leave to find work in the cities and their suburbs. Yet there are
few doctors around _ 14 of them, seven general practitioners and
seven specialists, for 9,000 people _ and few hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to driving long distances to see a doctor used
to be a home visit, with medical tests performed then and there
and, if the patient qualified, the chance of a home-health aide to
give a little extra help with meals and bathing.
</P>
<P>
   But home visits have fallen victim, since 1997, to general cuts
in federal health-care spending.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, four companies that provided home-health
services in Pratt County have gone out of business. In turn, those
closures have pushed county-financed programs to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   With home visits disappearing, patients are increasingly using
the medical system only when they become seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this change is that patients either are not
receiving services, are being readmitted to hospitals much more
often, or are being admitted to nursing homes,'' says Susan Page,
president of the Pratt Regional Medical Center, a private,
nonprofit hospital in Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   The first option increases suffering; the other two are
potentially much more expensive. Rural hospitals are anyway in
difficulties. With few people to serve, it is hard for a hospital
to earn back its original capital outlay and keep pace with new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Page says her hospital is doing fine, mainly because federal
officials have deemed it a ``sole community provider'' in isolated
Pratt County. This means it gets better rates of reimbursement from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the hospital's billings are paid by federal
programs, either Medicare (for the elderly) or Medicaid (for the
poor). And several other programs have helped to cushion the effect
of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A ``critical access hospital'' can get financial incentives to
focus on primary care and emergency-room services rather than the
more expensive (but also potentially more lucrative) longer-term
acute care.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital judged ``Medicare-dependent'' _ in other words, with
a lot of elderly patients _ can earn higher reimbursements than
usual. Others get more money because, though most of their patients
are country people, the hospital itself is close enough to a city
to be affected by inflated prices and wages.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the hospitals in Kansas fall into one or
other of these categories. On the whole, though, federal
reimbursements to rural hospitals are lower than those made to
urban hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this makes sense; the countryside is a cheaper
place to live. Yet expensive hospital equipment is no cheaper to
buy, and in states such as Nebraska _ which has one of the lowest
unemployment rates in the country _ a shortage of medical
technicians has led to severe salary inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional increases in the reimbursements, rural health
officials say, have not solved the problem. ``These jobs require up
to two years of training, and nursing programs take three to four
years of training, so we're really competing with the higher-paying
urban areas for the same people,'' says Michael Steckler, the
president of the Jennie Melham Medical Center in Broken Bow, Neb.
(population 3,800).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steckler's hospital, which is an hour away from the nearest
equivalent medical center, is dependent on federal payments for
about three-quarters of its billings.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of doctors. For a highly trained
professional coming out of medical school with a big debt to pay,
rural postings are not the most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are lower, culture markedly scarcer and jobs for
educated spouses nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Rural doctors also have to be a cross between a missionary and a
cowboy. They are on call more often, because the duties cannot
easily be spread among colleagues; and without the backup of
medical specialists they must themselves become specialists in many
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because rural communities are so small, doctors must often cope
with the strain of getting involved in all aspects of their
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   They must even be prepared to accept odd forms of payment. Paul
Paulman, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC) in Omaha, recalls once receiving a pig for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, rural regions have some selling points, including a
calmer pace of life and low crime rates; and some doctors like the
idea of being generalists. But this is not enough to keep rural
areas supplied with medical talent.
</P>
<P>
   So Nebraska, for one, has been trying a different tack. For 50
years, UNMC has been sending its medical students out to rural
areas for short-term appointments.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, it added some new ideas. One is a rural
residency program, in which students spend the last two years of
their training in a country district, first in a very small
community medical clinic, then in a somewhat larger town with a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Another program offers undergraduates early guarantees of a
place in medical school if they are willing to practice in rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   These measures have been quite successful. Of the 19 students
who enrolled in the rural residency program, 17 have stayed on as
country doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But because rural medical students are still lost to the big
cities each year, UNMC is now trying to hook them at an even
earlier stage, in high school, where information about a career in
medicine is now included in the science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   As Roxanna Lynn Jokela, coordinator of the UNMC program, puts
it, ``If you're from a community without a physician, or if you
don't know what a medical technologist does, how can you become
interested in them?'' &QL;

   HAVANA _ How did George Ryan, the avuncular governor of
Illinois, get on in Cuba? The answer is that, as the first American
governor to go there in 40 years, he did rather well.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan believes the American embargo has failed; as he put it,
``Isolating Cuba is not in the best interests of Illinois or in the
best interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he certainly does not believe in
mollycoddling Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader, or in concealing his own
democratic ideas.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Ryan arrived at his Havana hotel than he stepped
out of his Ford Grand Marquis (impressively newfangled, for Cuba)
and waded into the crowd of onlookers to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told the story to the president of the National
Assembly, explaining that his natural impulse was to treat the
crowd like voters. He then added, ``Maybe they can be voters
someday, Mr. President'' _ at which point all members of the press
were rapidly ushered out of the room by anxious Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
   After a private meeting with a small group of dissidents, Ryan
told Cuban and American journalists that ``basically... the problem
with Cuba is Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a Cuban about the criticism he may endure at home
for speaking out against the American embargo, the governor shot
back, ``It's a free country. I can say whatever I want.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his Cuban hosts after a tour of a children's hospital
that the hospital would be shut down if it were in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's jabs at the regime did not disqualify him and selected
members of his delegation from a seven-hour audience with Castro,
in which he, and occasionally they, ranged over everything from
baseball to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The governor managed to get one concession from the president _
or, more surprisingly, Senator Jesse Helms managed to extract one.
At Helms's request, a seven-year-old Cuban boy was allowed to fly
back to the United States with the delegation to receive treatment
for liver disease in North Carolina, where he has relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was also filled with talk of potential trade between
Cuba and Illinois. That was the point of it.
</P>
<P>
   The small but influential anti-Cuba lobby, based primarily in
Miami, at last has a counterweight in the shape of Midwest farmers
(and related agribusinesses) who have been hit by low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The private groups represented in the governor's delegation tell
the story: John Deere, Caterpillar, Archer Daniels Midland, the
Illinois Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois House of Representatives was the first state
legislature to pass a unanimous resolution calling for Congress to
lift the ban on the delivery of food and medicine to Cuba, a
country that imports roughly $800 million a year in food products,
some from as far away as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   American farmers, closer and more efficient, reckon they could
quickly gain much of that market. Farmers have long complained that
they carry a disproportionate share of the cost of America's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department reckons that food embargoes around
the globe cost them $1.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan is not alone. Earlier this autumn, the Senate voted 70-28
to tack an amendment on to the annual agricultural appropriations
bill that would have ended all prohibitions on the sale of food and
medicine and required congressional approval for any such sanctions
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by John Ashcroft, a Republican from
Missouri, and supported by a bipartisan coalition of other
farm-belt senators, ran into anti-Castro fury in the House and was
left out of the final farm bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the same senators hoped to pass it as a separate measure at
the end of October and to try to persuade the House again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   These actions suggest ``a silent seismic shift'' in thinking
towards Cuba, says Philip Peters, vice-president of the Lexington
Institute and a former State Department official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in the embargo will have to come from Washington. But
the trip has done Ryan no harm in Illinois. Local farmers feel they
are being listened to, and local Latinos mostly seem to have
approved of the trip (the complaints came from Florida).
</P>
<P>
   There is still some doubt as to how Cuba would ever pay for all
those imports from Illinois, if they appeared; the regime is as
desperate for hard currency as ever. But Illinois is at least
standing ready, at the head of the line, for the day when the gates
open. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever you think of Gary Bauer's politics, you have to admit
that the man has pluck.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is slight and short _ five-foot-six to be exact _ in a
party that shops at Big and Tall. He is also a proletarian in a
party that is increasingly dominated by monied dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this son of an alcoholic caretaker is still in the race, and
on Oct. 28 he happily did battle in New Hampshire with the heir to
a publishing fortune, his natural debating skills honed by years of
defending what he regards as simple truths against the ridicule of
sophisticates on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer is proof of the continuing influence of the religious
right on American politics. His campaign shares an office building
with a clutch of high-tech companies; he talks intelligently about
the way that interest groups are corrupting politics.
</P>
<P>
   But you only have to walk through his office door (which has had
a glass panel inserted into it so that he can be observed whenever
he has dealings with his female aides) or shake hands with his
campaign workers (who have the irritating cheerfulness that comes
with being born-again) to realize that he occupies a different
world from regular politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here as a presidential candidate,'' he likes to
declare on the campaign trail. ``I'm here as a sinner, at the foot
of the cross, saved only by the blood of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of talk was enough to give Bauer both a national
profile and a national organization. (The Family Research Council,
which he took over in 1988, built up a mailing list of 400,000 and
an annual income of $14 million.) It was also enough to give him a
respectable fourth place in the Iowa straw poll in August.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's fortunes should have enjoyed yet another boost on Oct.
25 when Pat Buchanan, a rival for the affections of social
conservatives, left the Republicans for the Reform Party. But it
was hard to talk to him the next day without suspecting that being
a champion of the religious right can be a prison as well as a
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Cornered in his office, Bauer is keener to talk about the
virtues of the flat tax and the evils of China than he is about
bathing in the blood of Christ; and he mentions Ronald Reagan, a
president remembered more for his economic than his moral agenda,
so frequently that you get the impression that the Gipper has
agreed to accept a post as his running-mate.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates need to broaden their appeal, of course. But
Bauer's keenness to change the subject suggests that the religious
right is not the source of intellectual and emotional energy that
it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The armies of righteousness, which once threatened to overwhelm
the Republican Party, are downcast and despondent. One paradoxical
reason for their current despondency is what might be called the
sanctification of politics.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush talks o helping the poor through churches
rather than government, and Al Gore describes himself as a ``child
of the Kingdom,'' God's true anointed lose their cachet.
</P>
<P>
   And this sea-change in public debate has been accompanied by an
improvement in key cultural indicators. The murder rate is at its
lowest since 1967. The number of AIDS cases has decreased by more
than 50 percent since 1993. The welfare rolls have been reduced by
46.5 percent since 1994. There are now 243,000 fewer abortions a
year than there were at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to get exercised about slouching towards Gomorrah
when the slouching seems to be going in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many social conservatives who worry that they have
snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. For anyone who believes
that abortion is murder, even reduced numbers are an abomination _
particularly as seven of the current Supreme Court judges were
appointed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many hard-liners are convinced that they have been used as foot
soldiers of the Republican revolution but then consigned to the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are
currently working hard to prevent conservatives from attaching
abortion restrictions to appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is divided over its relationship with
mainstream politics, reliving, in a peculiar quirk of cultural
history, the divisions that tore apart the radical student movement
in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, who did more than anyone else to turn the Christian
Coalition into a political force, is the leader of the ``long march
through the institutions'' school. He is now an influential adviser
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, is the head
of the rejectionist school. He was so disgusted by the general
reaction to the Clinton scandal that he decided the best tactic for
Christians was to retreat from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is also divided over a more immediate issue:
whether to rally behind Bauer or Steve Forbes. The battle between
the two is arguably the bloodiest thing going on in politics at the
moment, and is about to get bloodier still, as the candidates
battle it out in the socially conservative states of Louisiana and
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer accuses Forbes of being a Johnny-come-lately to social
conservatism: his 1996 campaign ignored the subject entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are also lots of rumors of dirty deeds. Bauer had to
install his glass door because his former campaign chairman,
Charles Jarvis, complained that Bauer was spending time behind an
opaque one with a female assistant. Jarvis subsequently joined
Forbes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-door affair has obviously shaken Bauer. It cannot be
easy competing with Forbes's millions and Bush's extraordinary
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bauer clearly has a fighting chance against
Forbes, if not against Bush, and he clearly likes showing the rich
kids what he's made of.
</P>
<P>
   The better he does in the next few months, the more chance he
has of influencing Bush, who has already sounded many themes that
delight social conservatives (albeit shorn of the blood-and-thunder
rhetoric that sends them into the highest ecstasies).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns transformed him from
a spokesman for an interest group into a national political figure.
In Bauer's dogged campaign, America could be witnessing the making
of a Jesse Jackson of the right. &QL;

president remembered more for his economic than his moral agenda,
so frequently that you get the impression that the Gipper has
agreed to accept a post as his running-mate.
</P>
<P>
   All candidates need to broaden their appeal, of course. But
Bauer's keenness to change the subject suggests that the religious
right is not the source of intellectual and emotional energy that
it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The armies of righteousness, which once threatened to overwhelm
the Republican Party, are downcast and despondent. One paradoxical
reason for their current despondency is what might be called the
sanctification of politics.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush talks of helping the poor through churches
rather than government, and Al Gore describes himself as a ``child
of the Kingdom,'' God's true anointed lose their cachet.
</P>
<P>
   And this sea-change in public debate has been accompanied by an
improvement in key cultural indicators. The murder rate is at its
lowest since 1967. The number of AIDS cases has decreased by more
than 50 percent since 1993. The welfare rolls have been reduced by
46.5 percent since 1994. There are now 243,000 fewer abortions a
year than there were at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to get exercised about slouching towards Gomorrah
when the slouching seems to be going in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are many social conservatives who worry that they have
snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. For anyone who believes
that abortion is murder, even reduced numbers are an abomination _
particularly as seven of the current Supreme Court judges were
appointed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Many hard-liners are convinced that they have been used as foot
soldiers of the Republican revolution but then consigned to the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives are
currently working hard to prevent conservatives from attaching
abortion restrictions to appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is divided over its relationship with
mainstream politics, reliving, in a peculiar quirk of cultural
history, the divisions that tore apart the radical student movement
in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, who did more than anyone else to turn the Christian
Coalition into a political force, is the leader of the ``long march
through the institutions'' school. He is now an influential adviser
to George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation, is the head
of the rejectionist school. He was so disgusted by the general
reaction to the Clinton scandal that he decided the best tactic for
Christians was to retreat from the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some sort of quarantine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right is also divided over a more immediate issue:
whether to rally behind Bauer or Steve Forbes. The battle between
the two is arguably the bloodiest thing going on in politics at the
moment, and is about to get bloodier still, as the candidates
battle it out in the socially conservative states of Louisiana and
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer accuses Forbes of being a Johnny-come-lately to social
conservatism: his 1996 campaign ignored the subject entirely.
</P>
<P>
   There are also lots of rumors of dirty deeds. Bauer had to
install his glass door because his former campaign chairman,
Charles Jarvis, complained that Bauer was spending time behind an
opaque one with a female assistant. Jarvis subsequently joined
Forbes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-door affair has obviously shaken Bauer. It cannot be
easy competing with Forbes's millions and Bush's extraordinary
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bauer clearly has a fighting chance against
Forbes, if not against Bush, and he clearly likes showing the rich
kids what he's made of.
</P>
<P>
   The better he does in the next few months, the more chance he
has of influencing Bush, who has already sounded many themes that
delight social conservatives (albeit shorn of the blood-and-thunder
rhetoric that sends them into the highest ecstasies).
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jackson's two presidential campaigns transformed him from
a spokesman for an interest group into a national political figure.
In Bauer's dogged campaign, America could be witnessing the making
of a Jesse Jackson of the right. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA _ No sooner was Abdurrahman Wahid chosen to be president
of Indonesia than the doubters began to voice their fears. They
fretted over the new leader's ability to deal with his country's
huge problems, over his physical frailty, over the deals he had
made to get the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To all of these worries Wahid's friends had a simple response:
you don't know Gus Dur.
</P>
<P>
   The man to whom Indonesians have given this respectfully
affectionate nickname, they said, is a clear thinker who knows a
lot about Indonesia's troubles and even more about its
troublemakers. He will find a way to free himself from burdensome
compromises, and to choose a cabinet that can cope.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 24, speaking in Bali, Gus Dur himself set out to
reassure the skeptics. To become president, he admitted, he had to
make some tactful cabinet appointments. But he would make sure that
all his ministers ``follow our code...(in) honesty, frankness and,
most important, economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   The semi-blind president, referring to the slightly aloof lady
chosen to serve as his vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri,
showed a cheeringly blunt sense of humor. We make a perfect team,
he explained: ``I can't see and she can't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And two days later Wahid named a pretty solid-looking cabinet.
This contains, as expected, people from most of the major parties,
as well as from the armed forces and the past governments of
Suharto and B.J. Ha
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of exceptions, Wahid has done a good job of
balancing old and new faces, and limiting the damage done by his
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest doubts surround his new economics team. This will be
headed by Kwik Kian Gie, a Dutch-trained economist and a senior
member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, which is led
by Megawati.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Kwik has said some controversial things. He has
advocated a currency board to peg the exchange rate, and he has
taken several potshots at the IMF, which attached a set of
uncomfortably tight strings to the rescue package it helped to
organize when Indonesia's economy got into a mess in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he has calmed down lately. He now seems willing to follow
the IMF's prescriptions, and he appears to understand the
importance of cleaning up the banking industry and restructuring
corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's other economic choices have had mixed reviews. Investors
have applauded the new state-enterprise minister, but raised their
eyebrows about the new finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The team as a whole looks reasonably competent, but none of its
members has had any experience in government and some of them want
to do things with the economy that conflict with each other. The
skillful controlling hand the president's admirers claim for him
will be badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wahid's other choices are more impressive. This applies
especially to his handling of the armed forces. The new president
has brushed aside General Wiranto, who had been both the minister
of defense and the commander of the country's armed forces,
demoting him to the less influential post of minister for political
and security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   General Wiranto will no longer command any armed men.
</P>
<P>
   The men chosen by the president to replace General Wiranto,
moreover, seem to be distinct improvements. The new defense
minister, Juwono Sudarsono, served as education minister under
Habibie and as environment minister under Suharto _ and, unusually,
had a clean reputation in both governments. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the first civilian defense minister for decades,
he has done a stint at Indonesia's military think-tank and seems to
understand the army's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yuwono's appointment signals the president's intention to bring
the wayward army _ responsible for many of Indonesia's tribulations
_ under firmer control. So does Wahid's choice for the leadership
of the armed forces, Admiral Widodo Adi Sutjipto.
</P>
<P>
   The new president has said several times that he wants the navy
to play a lart in Indonesia's defense structure. Not only
does a country with so vast and tangled a coastline need an
efficient navy to protect it from invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia also suffers from rampant piracy, smuggling and
environmental vandalism around its shores. And, let it be quietly
added, demonstrators are less likely to get shot by patrol boats
than by politically guided infantrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Along with General Wiranto, the army's territorial commander,
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has also been moved to a political job.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of this is that he has been given charge of
mining and energy, which puts an inexperienced minister in charge
of a huge export-earning sector. But that may be a price worth
paying to have a reliable ally in Yudhoyono's previous job. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all, the political influence of the armed forces has been
much diminished. The new president's 35-member cabinet contains
only six serving or retired generals, the fewest ever in Indonesia.
This should make it easier for the new attorney-general, Marzuki
Darusman, to investigate the army's past activities.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Marzuki, a member of the once-dominant Golkar
party, is another compromise. He is, in fact, an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   Although he belongs to the same party as the departing
president, Habibie, the new attorney-general was one of Habibie's
fiercest critics. He is also a former head of Indonesia's
human-rights commission.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki will dig into the army's misdeeds, including the trouble
it caused in the recently liberated province of East Timor. On Oct.
27, he said he would reopen investigations into Suharto's wealth. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 950) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new president's wider aims should also be made easier to
achieve by the people he has gathered around him. Wahid wants to
win more influence for Indonesia in the Muslim world, and he is
anxious to find a way of holding Indonesia together.
</P>
<P>
   The new foreign minister, Alwi Shihab, is a moderate Muslim from
the president's National Awakening Party. He was educated in Cairo
and Philadelphia, and recently taught at Harvard University's
divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   The president has consistently supported a brand of Islam that
is both democratic and tolerant, and hopes to forge ties with
Muslims in other countries who think in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
   He has already said that he would like better relations with
Israel. His trip to a forthcoming conference on religious tolerance
in Jordan will be worth watching. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There remains the president's choice of Megawati to ease the
central government's strained relations with disaffected parts of
Indonesia such as the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya, and areas
like Ambon that are rent by religious and ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati has the credentials to preach unity: her father was
Indonesia's founding president, and her own campaign for the
presidency was rich in nationalist symbolism. Who knows, her new
task may be just what the vice-president needs to bring her out of
her shell.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's standoffish timidity helped to deny her the
presidency. But, under a frail president who has suffered two
strokes, she may yet inherit the job. If she does, she will take
over a strong cabinet. &QL;

   VANCOUVER _ Back in the 1920s, when the United States had
Prohibition, quite a few Canadians grew rich running booze over the
border to intoxicate their neighbors. Now they are trying their
luck with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, British Columbia has earned a reputation
for growing the most potent marijuana in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is said to be the province's most lucrative export
crop, worth an estimated C$2 billion ($1.4 billion) a year.
</P>
<P>
   Given British Columbia's cool soggy climate, this may seem odd:
the strongest cannabis generally comes from tropical countries,
such as Jamaica. No longer. The sophisticated growers of British
Columbia use plant genetics and ``active indoor hydroponic
technology,'' some of it computer-controlled, to achieve higher
yields and potency.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Jamaica's strongest ganja contains 12 percent
tetrahydrocannabinol, the compound that produces a ``high,'' the
new stuff from British Columbia has, on average, 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This has made ``BC bud'' America's pot of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive to export is great. A pound of pot can fetch about
$6,000 in California, up to twice what it fetches in Canada. So
British Columbia's cannabis farmers find ingenious ways to smuggle
south most of the estimated 800 tons they grow each year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States border patrol reckons that dope-smuggling has
soared tenfold in the past two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for this booming export business, grumble the
Canadian and American police, is the leniency of British Columbia's
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people are prosecuted: the police laid 2,329 charges
for growing and trafficking marijuana in 1997, and have stepped up
their efforts since. But, according to the Vancouver Sun, only one
in five of those convicted of growing marijuana in Vancouver over
the past three years received a jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   One in four served no time in jail, and paid no fine; and 58
percent received a fine that averaged less than C$2,700.
</P>
<P>
   The average pot grower, who pockets C$150,000-250,000 per crop,
treats such light fines, complains one Canadian policeman, ``simply
as the cost of doing business _ a business license.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do locals seem much bothered. Many British Columbians smoke
pot regularly, or have at least tried it. In a recent poll, no less
than 63 percent thought possession of marijuana should be
decriminalized, more than in any other Canadian province.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is still considered by many to be a relatively
harmless drug grown by aging hippies with beards and beads. In
fact, the industry has become big, sophisticated and nasty, and is
increasingly run by organized criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Gangs use specialized technicians to grow hundreds of cannabis
plants at a time; clandestine ``dial-a-harvest'' teams pick the
crops, and a network of brokers market the product in America _ and
bring back guns and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs are not shy of protecting their interests; 15 people
in the dope business have been killed in Canada in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is spreading. Recently, a member of Parliament from
Quebec, Yvan Loubier, was given 24-hour police protection after he
had exposed a racket in his constituency. He claimed that gangs of
pot growers were forcing local farmers to let them hide plantations
in the middle of their sprawling fields of corn, sometimes by
threatening the lives of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Loubier said that, on a recent flight, he could see a dozen
patches of pot not far from Montreal, each with between 40 and
2,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United States was angry about Canadian
whiskey-smugglers 80 years ago, it is increasingly edgy about
cannabis today.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the State Department took the unprecedented step of
considering placing Canada on its narcotics blacklist _ alongside
Myanmar _ for not doing enough to combat the drugs trade. Nothing
came of it after Canada protested. But, as one Mountie says, ``It's
embarrassing that we get a wake-up call from the U.S. to say that
we have a serious problem.'' &QL;

NEW YORK'S HIGHEST COURT TAKES TO TURN TO THE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's highest court has long relished its
national prominence as a trailblazing tribunal that expanded the
rights and liberties of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, some analysts and observers say, the
State Court of Appeals has grown timid and conservative and seems
now to shy away from controversial cases and decisions,
particularly in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Some tie the perceived shift to Gov. George Pataki's 1995-96
criticisms of the court, when he characterized its rulings as out
of touch and far too liberal. Others say Pataki's two conservative
appointments to the seven-judge tribunal have swung the court from
a generally liberal 4-3 majority to a generally conservative 4-3
court.
</P>
<P>
   What many court watchers, prosecutors, defense attorneys and
even former judges say is certain is that the court has become far
more reserved and, at the moment, seems to have abandoned its
traditionally progressive stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now one of the most conservative courts in the United
States,'' said Marvin E. Schechter, president of the state chapter
of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``It is
not a court in transition from liberalism to conservatism, it has
made that transition. It is a conservative court, led by a
conservative chief judge.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Stewart E. Sterk, a law professor at the
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University and former
clerk to Chief Judge Charles D. Breitel, said the court has
retained its historical commitment to individual rights,
particularly in right-to-counsel cases, even if it hasn't gone out
of its way to expand those protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be hard put to say there is clear evidence of a
conservative tilt,'' Sterk said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye declined to partake in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that anyone is even arguing over whether Kaye is a
liberal or conservative is in itself noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, a Democrat from Manhattan appointed in 1993 by Gov. Mario
Cuomo, has long been part of the court's moderate to liberal wing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, she criticized the majority for breaking ``with its
proud tradition'' and diluting the right-to-counsel protection.
And, after Kaye became chief judge in 1993, the panel's ``liberal''
rulings _ those in favor of the individual, often times a criminal
defendant, over the government or police _ more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court's decisions on individual liberties are right back
where they were before Kaye took over _ about 80 percent for the
government and about 20 percent for the individual, according to
Albany Law School Professor Vincent M. Bonventre.
</P>
<P>
   Bonventre, who tracks and analyzes every decision the court
renders, said that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Kaye
frequently dissented when the panel cut back on, or declined to
expand on, the rights of the accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, you don't see anything written by Judge
Kaye on the rights of the accused or civil rights and liberties
areas complaining about the court cutting back on rights and
liberties, or even in the majority arguing in favor of protecting
rights and liberties,'' Bonventre said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kaye is consistently voting with the two
``conservative'' judges appointed by Pataki: Richard C. Wesley and
Albert M. Rosenblatt, both Republicans. Wesley, a former
assemblyman, voted for the death penalty. Rosenblatt, as a trial
judge, imposed the death penalty in a case where Kaye wrote the
opinion overturning the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no (crimimnal) case last term in which Judge Kaye and
the two Pataki judges were on the opposite side,'' said Paul
Schechtman, an attorney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Schechtman served as the governor's criminal justice director at
the time the Kaye court was under siege by the administration.
``That to me speaks volumes about how non ideological and middle of
the road the court has become. ''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the New York Law Journal showed that in criminal
cases prosecutors prevailed in 54 of 79 cases _ 68 percent _
between September 1998 and July 1999, and won 80 percent the year
before. In prior terms, prosecutors typically won less than 60
percent of their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the Law Journal survey also showed that over the
last three years the court has dramatically cut back on the
percentage of criminal cases it agrees to hear _ about 1.9 percent,
compared to an average of roughly 4 percent over the prior 15
years.In other words, criminal defendants are getting their appeals
before the high court less frequently and losing more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see the kind of decisions that sent prosecutors into
spasms years ago,'' Schechtman said. ``It is not like they cut back
on what they created, they are just not expanding. To my mind, it
is a good, responsible court, but I think anyone who thinks it
hasn't moved back toward the center just misreads the last
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonventre said his analysis suggests that the court is ducking
tough issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though you read these opinions and you say it is
impossible or illogical to reach these decisions,'' Bonventre said.
``But it is just that when there is a controversial case or a
difficult case, the court typically chooses the easy,
non-politically difficult road. What it means is that the
individual cannot expect nearly as much protection from government
over-reaching as it could have expected in the past.''

Restaurant Replicas: Re-create the Cheesecake Factory's bruschetta 
(Eds: includes two more Restaurant Replicas) 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
By Natalie Haughton, Food Editor 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mail continues to bring new requests for copycat versions of
Cheesecake Factory creations. This time it's the bruschetta
requested by reader L.S. Nelson of North Hollywood, who notes that
it is delicious and has a wonderful taste. A recent sampling
verified that it is indeed terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, our version designed for home cooks goes together
in a jiffy with chopped fresh tomatoes, red onion, garlic, basil
and olive oil. Be sure to use fresh basil _ it's not the same
without it. And use top-quality extra virgin olive oil. Serve as an
appetizer or offer as a quick meal with a big green salad with or
without meat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for something different for an entree salad,
consider the cold Chicken Diablo Salad, a replica version of one
from the take-out counter of Gelson's market. The flavor is
intriguing _ hot and spicy with a slight sweet and sour twist. It's
not too time-consuming to prepare if you use cooked chicken breasts
or a whole chicken from the market. Remove the skin and dice the
meat. Red pepper strips, rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes (Gelson's
uses yellow, which we couldn't locate, so red ones were
substituted), red onions and ripe olives add color while a little
chopped green chile, cilantro, rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and
oil add interesting flavor. The mixture is best chilled an hour
prior to serving if you have the time.
</P>
<P>
   Serve piled on assorted greens for a beautiful-looking variation
on the chicken salad theme. Keep this salad in mind next time
you're entertaining at a midday shower or weekend lunch. Both its
appearance and flavor make it a showstopper.
</P>
<P>
   Another novel entree salad _ that could be served in a smaller
portion as a dinner salad, especially during the holiday season _
completes today's replica collection. It's a fabulous-tasting
combination sampled at the Bongo Room, a restaurant in Chicago. The
restaurant is small and busy at breakfast and lunch and brunch on
the weekends. And with the wonderful array of tempting-sounding
salads and sandwiches, it's no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast dishes sound innovative with offerings like Raspberry
Cheesecake Hotcakes and Pineapple Upside Down Brioche French Toast.
Go early if you want to avoid waiting for a table.
</P>
<P>
   The salad, referred to as the Ambassador on the menu, combines
fresh spinach leaves, fennel pieces, red onion slices, toasted
pecans, dried sour cherries and manchego cheese. The ingredients
are dressed with an Orange-Balsamic Vinaigrette, which in our
version has lots of fresh orange juice along with a little orange
peel.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not familiar with fennel, give it a try in this dish.
It has a pale green feathery top and large bulblike base. The
distinctive flavor is similar to licorice or anise seed but less
pungent. Look for fresh green leaves and crisp, large compact
greenish-white bulbs with no sign of splitting, drying or browning.
Keep refrigerated until using.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, rinse well and trim top and bottom, removing any
bruised outer pieces. Although all parts of the fennel plant are
edible _ and can be eaten raw, steamed, baked, stir-fried or
sauteed _ we used the bulb (cut out and discard the hard center
core) cut into thin slices. Blanch in boiling water in the
microwave oven for a few minutes, just until crisp-tender.
</P>
<P>
   If you can find it, use manchego cheese (a rich, golden semifirm
cheese with a mellow flavor) as the restaurant does. In a pinch,
substitute a very mild crumbled feta or goat cheese so you don't
overpower the other ingredients. Manchego is famous in Spain and
was so named because originally it was made only from the milk of
Manchego sheep that grazed the famous plains of La Mancha.
</P>
<P>
   These three facsimiles are all winners. Tasters gave them top
marks. Clip and save to use throughout the year.
</P>
<P>

   Low pressure moving north along a slow-moving front will
circulate copious Atlantic moisture into the Appalachians and
eastern Great Lakes. As the moist air intercepts the front, a large
swath of heavy showers, accompanied by local flooding, will fall
across the region. Isolated thunderstorms will also occur. Farther
east, sunshine will fade behind a thickening veil of clouds over
New England with heavy rain arriving overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the northwest gusting past 40 mph will direct
much colder air into Great Lakes and Middle West on Tuesday. Midday
readings will hold in the 30s over much of the region. As the
chilly air passes over the still tepid waters of the Great Lakes,
ascending currents of moistened air will lead to snow showers in
parts of Michigan and northern Indiana. Some accumulation is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the West will be dry and tranquil as a large ridge of
high pressure at 20,000 feet diverts inclement weather from the
Pacific into western Canada. California will remain seasonably warm
with readings well into the 80s across southern sections, though
onshore breezes will keep the air cooler along the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Indian Summer
</P>
<P>
   During late October and early November, a second summer often
comes. Indian summer is the name given to a mid-autumn period of
abnormally warm weather accompanied by sunny, hazy days and cool
nights. While there is no official definition, tradition suggests
that a killing frost must precede the warm spell for it to be
considered true Indian summer. The origin of the term most likely
relates to the way American Indians used these last mild days to
increase their winter stores. The recent spell of Indian summer
across the East will come to an abrupt end as a strong cold front
sweeps south from Canada.

HOLIDAY TAX TIPS COULD MAKES FOR A JOYOUS APRIL 15 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One of the best ways to reduce any income taxes
you'll owe in the spring is to start figuring your tax liability
now, tax experts say.
</P>
<P>
   With nine weeks left in the calendar year, taxpayers still have
time to shift deductions, make adjustments to retirement accounts
and take other legitimate steps that will lessen the tax burden
come next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to do is get a good estimate of what kinds of
income you'll have this year and what your deductions are,'' said
Jeffrey M. Levine, an Albany financial consultant. ``Get a good
overview so you can do some planning.''
</P>
<P>
   This shouldn't be too tough for most people this year, since
there have been no major changes in the tax code, said Gerard
Mazurkiewicz, who runs the upstate New York tax preparation
business for accounting firm KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Start by checking your pay stubs, and seeing if you have any
self-employment income.
</P>
<P>
   Cross check these against your likely deductions and withholding
payments and any quarterly payments already made to the IRS and
your state.
</P>
<P>
   Then, see if anything on this checklist could help your tax
standing.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're a homeowner, make an extra mortgage payment in
December in time to be posted for 1999, Levine said. This will
increase your mortgage interest deduction. People who have just
bought their first home are especially apt to overlook this
deduction, Levine said. Home buyers also need to remember they get
a deduction for mortgage points, he added.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you suffered any damage to property from Hurricane Floyd,
document the value of any losses not reimbursed by insurance. The
IRS allow deductions, within certain limits, for such casualty
losses. IRS allows people to ammend their 1998 tax returns to
reflect those losses, and get any refunds more quickly,
Mazurkiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have any self-employment income, make your January
state quarterly tax payment in December to boost your deductions,
Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Similarly, self-employed people might purchase now any new
computer, fax, electronic or other business equipment they've been
needing and planning to buy, said Mazurkiewicz. The IRS will allow
the purchases to be deducted all in one year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan charitable giving now. Clean out closets and basements
and donate any unused clothing, Levine said. If you are considering
a major cash contribution to a charity and own stock, consider
instead donating stock worth the same amount, said Mazurkiewicz.
The charity can sell the stock for cash, tax-free, and the giver
can avoid incurring capital gains tax that would be triggered by
selling the stock while still in his or her name.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look to ``bunch'' other kinds of deductions in either 1999 or
2000. These would include your taxpayer's uninsured costs, such as
medical and dental work, miscellaneous deductions for
non-reimbursed employee business expenses or payments for tax and
investment advice. The IRS ties the deductions taxpayers can take
on such items to a percentage of income.
</P>
<P>
   With medical expenses, taxpayers can only deduct the amount that
is more than 7.5 percent of the adjusted gross income. For
miscellaneous expenses, taxpayers can deduct only the expenses
exceeding 2 percent of the adjusted gross income. The upshot is
that it's hard to have enough expenses in any one year to earn the
deductions, Levine noted, but sometimes people are successful at
grouping the bills into one year.

TEXTBOOK BATTLE BREWING IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By R.A. DYER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An 11th-hour request by a State Board of
Education member to revise the content of first-grade textbooks has
outraged publishers, who said the changes would unfairly cost them
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But board member Geraldine Miller, who asked for the changes in
September, said publishers have only themselves to blame _ and
possibly bad advice from the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just stepping in and fixing this,'' said Miller,
R-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is expected to peak this week when the board
votes on $90.6 million in reading and language arts textbooks for
kindergarten through third grade. The board begins meeting
Wednesday, with the general session scheduled for Friday in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what percentage of words should be ``decodable,'' or
simple enough that students can read by sounding out letters or
combinations of letters. The state board said ``most'' words should
be ``decodable;'' almost a year ago, the education agency told
publishers that ``most'' meant 51 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she has the votes to require publishers to include
more decodable words. The 15-member board will decide which
textbooks comply with the state's curriculum guidelines, meaning
many publishers may have prepared books that will not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Books that do not conform may still be selected by local
districts, but publishers say that rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the position that the publishers have produced
awful good materials and that it's not right _ and maybe illegal _
to require that they change them,'' said Joe Bill Watkins, an
attorney representing the Association of American Publishers. ``It
will cost several million dollars. But it's the principle that's
really wrong. If this happens, then every November, some member of
the board can put together a majority and rewrite'' the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Words that beginning readers can decode, or sound out using
phonics, include straightforward spellings such as ``cat,'' ``see''
and ``it.'' Many simple words do not follow phonics rules, however,
and children learn to read them on sight. Examples would be
``one,'' ``two,'' ``there'' and ``their.''
</P>
<P>
   As supporters of phonics, many board members want a high
percentage of decodable words in early reading textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has called for an average of 80 percent. She said the
education agency should have told the board that a question had
arisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every right do to this because the process was
flawed,'' Miller said. ``In hindsight, we should have defined what
`most' meant. But we never dreamed that they would define it as 51
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Lozano, an agency spokesman, said the TEA frequently
responds to requests to clarify legislation and board rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody identified this as an issue, or expressed a concern,
until that September meeting,'' he said. ``It was then that Mrs.
Miller raised the issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not sure there was an error, ``it's just that
nobody ... brought this to our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate cuts to the heart of the sometimes contentious
discussion over how best to teach reading: either through phonics
instruction or whole-language instruction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the phonics method of sounding out words, whole
language emphasizes reading through the use of context, encourages
children to draw inferences from clues within the text and even
permits children to invent their own spellings.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, of the Association of American Publishers, said the
board has changed the guidelines too late.
</P>
<P>
   To help untangle the mix-up, education agency staff members have
asked publishers to come up with plans to include more decodable
words.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano said the board could adopt textbooks on a provisional
basis, then provide a permanent endorsement later if publishers
fulfill those plans.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts may choose conforming or nonconforming
textbooks and can receive state funding for either. Still, failing
to make the board's conforming list can doom a textbook because
districts generally prefer those aligned with the state's
high-stakes testing process, publishers say.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, State Education Commissioner Jim Nelson issued
recommendations about which books conform to the state's
curriculum. Basing his decision on the 51 percent standard for
decodable words, Nelson recommended first-grade reading textbooks
from about a dozen publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner gave publishers a letter saying that you
voluntarily might want to come up with a plan in case the board
decided to change'' the standard, Watkins said. ``Well, the
publishers have to protect their investment, so they say the plan
is voluntary, but it's more like there is a gun to their head.''

100 YEARS AGO, A BOOK IGNITED THE STUDY OF THE MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ERIC GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was not the overnight success its author had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   The first edition of Sigmund Freud's ``Interpretation of
Dreams,'' published on Nov. 4, 1899, sold 600 copies in eight
years, a disappointing accounting for any writer, much less one who
likened his struggle with the manuscript to the biblical Jacob's
wrestling match with an angel.
</P>
<P>
   But beginnings are sometimes deceptive. A century after the
book's publication, Freud's ideas have seeped so deeply into the
culture that most people invoke them daily without being aware of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis itself may be out of favor, but to take a serious
interest in literature, art or the social sciences is to ignore
psychoanalysis at one's peril. And the book's emphasis on
unconscious urges and desires, and the compromise negotiated
between the rational ego and the unruly libido, became the bedrock
upon which psychoanalysis was built.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways,'' said Dr. Bertram Cohler, an analyst and
professor of psychology at the University of Chicago, Freud's dream
book ``is not about dreaming at all, but about the ways that we
make meanings out of our lives.'' ``Nothing that Freud did ever
really departed from that first major discovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freud regarded ``The Interpretation of Dreams'' as his most
important work, according to Dr. Ritchie Robertson, of Oxford in
the introduction to a new translation of the first edition,
released this month by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, with the refinement of his theories, Freud
revised and expanded the original edition. At one point, under the
influence of a colleague, Wilhelm Stekel, he even added a section
explaining specific dream symbols: wild beasts represented
passionate impulses: staircases symbolized sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   The inclusion of such a literal glossary, writes Robertson, has
``given so much satisfaction to the simple-minded, and done so much
to bring Freudian analysis into disrepute.''
</P>
<P>
   The eighth edition of the book, as translated into English by
James Strachey in 1953, became part of the Standard Edition of
Freud''s work. But by then, psychoanalysis was weighted down with
technical terminology, and Strachey's translation added yet another
layer of ``medicalized'' language.
</P>
<P>
   The new translation, by Dr. Joyce Crick, a scholar of German
retired from University College London, contains none of the
material added in later editions, and tries to remain faithful to
the spontaneous quality of Freud's idiom.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Crick said in the end she viewed the book less as a
scientific text than an interpretive work. And she was drawn in by
the deeply personal expedition Freud chronicled, filled with his
own dreams and his efforts to make sense of them using the methods
he developed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Freud lamented that his ideas about dreams,
insofar as they reached the public, were often misunderstood. ``If
you ask how much of dream-interpretation has been accepted by
outsiders,'' he wrote in 1932, ``the reply gives little cause for
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A few concepts, he continued has become generally familiar,
among them some that we have never put forward _ such as the thesis
that all dreams are of a sexual nature.'' But much of the bhook's
most important material, he wrote still seems as foreign to
gerneral awareness as it was 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 100 years later, though, Freud might well take pleasure
that his ideas still loom large on the landscape. ``He is terribly
like Everest,'' Dr. Crick said. ``He's there.''

 &HT;    S T R E T C H YOUR IMAGINATION
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I like to pretend that my imagination is a rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's right. A rubber band. It sits dusty and curled in
the back of my mind when I'm not daydreaming.
</P>
<P>
   But when my mind begins to wander, oh how that rubber band
changes. I imagine myself stretching and twisting it into all kinds
of new and wonderful shapes.
</P>
<P>
   You may find my metaphor (remember that word from English
class?) a stretch, but I think it captures what makes writing
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Even though imagination is key, it is not enough. You must
hammer a good idea into shape through hard work.
</P>
<P>
   How, you may ask, would I know?
</P>
<P>
   Because I write stories for the newspaper every day and have
written two children's novels.
</P>
<P>
   Each of my books began as a crazy idea that made me laugh out
loud. Unfortunately, a good laugh was not enough. I learned the
hard way it's tough to turn a funny scene into a readable story.
</P>
<P>
   That requires something else _ craft.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way. Learning to write well is like figuring out
how to hit a baseball or bake bread. There are certain things you
can do that ensure the bread rises and your bat connects with the
ball. It's the same with writing.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tricks I've learned for hitting a home run with
stories:
</P>
<P>
   TIPS FOR FANTASTIC WRITING
</P>
<P>
   -- Pepper your stories with crazy characters doing interesting
things. Nobody wants to read a story with a great character who
sits around twiddling his thumbs in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't tell your readers the characters are interesting, show
them. Use meaningful details to describe the colorful things that
make your characters unique. For example, don't write ``Paula loves
the color green.'' Write instead, ``Each day, Paula wore army green
pants, a lime green shirt and even painted her nails a pale shade
of Chartreuse.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Grab your reader from the first sentence. Begin your stories
in the middle of the action and then work backward to explain
what's going on. (The ancient Greeks always did this!)
</P>
<P>
   -- Never start a story with ``Let me tell you a story,'' or
``Once upon a time.'' It's a lazy way to begin.
</P>
<P>
   -- Think about your stories as scenes. Connect the scenes in a
story line driven by conflict and action.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep your writing crisp. Use strong, specific verbs, such as
grumble, wallop or wheeze. Avoid strings of adjectives. Keep your
writing and story line taut (that means tight) _ just like this
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   -- And lastly, never fear rewriting a story. Writing is
rewriting. Your best ideas will come in the third or fourth drafts.

   MIDDLE EAST
</P>
<P>
   New peace
</P>
<P>
   talks to begin
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians and Israelis are trying to make peace after years
of fighting. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, along with President Clinton, will meet in
Norway this week to discuss a final treaty. They will negotiate
over some of the most difficult issues in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations created Israel from the territory of
Palestine in 1948 after World War II. The goal was to give the
Jewish people, many of whom were survivors of the Holocaust in
Europe, a homeland. However, many Arabs felt the Palestinians were
treated unfairly and they decided to fight. Violence has raged off
and on, as Arabs and Jews struggle with who will occupy what land.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders will try to settle the final borders of Palestinian
territory, how the city of Jerusalem should be divided and the
future of millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   BACKSTREET BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Man arrested in scam
</P>
<P>
   Buyer beware _ especially when it comes to Backstreet Boys
tickets. A New Jersey man was arrested last week for trying to sell
nonexistent tickets to the sold-out Nov. 24 Backstreet Boys show in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He offered the tickets on eBay's Internet auction site during
the summer. At least two dozen people from across the country,
including Georgia, said they sent $200 to $1,000 in response to the
posting. However, they got no tickets in return.
</P>
<P>
   The man could face several years in prison if convicted of
forgery, theft and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   BLOW OUT
</P>
<P>
   Gum-slinger takes 2nd
</P>
<P>
   Champion bubble-blower Jimmy Bender isn't sore about being a
mere half-inch of gum away from victory at the Bubble Yum World
Series Blowout. The Parkview High School student competed last week
for a chance to win up to $35,000 in savings bonds and a spot in
``The Guinness Book of World Records'' at the national
bubble-blowing competition in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy faced off with his bubble-blowing challengers Tuesday. He
puffed a 7.5-inch bubble that set the pace for the competition. But
a kid from New Jersey later blew away the competition with an
8-inch bubble, which took first prize.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Jimmy said the experience was an interesting one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like in any major sporting event, it comes down to mere inches
between who wins and who takes second place,'' Jimmy said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Count calories. No, count fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   All right, you can have some fat, but only the good kind. Eat
more protein and less sugar. Eat more fiber and less dairy. Eat six
small meals, not three big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Snack. Don't snack. Don't touch pasta. Don't even look at that
Halloween candy.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise 30 minutes, three times a week. Or 10 minutes, three
times a day, three times a week. Or 90 minutes on the days with the
letter A in them.
</P>
<P>
   Every diet and exercise program says: Eat this, do that.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, losing weight and improving your health boils down
to this: Eat less, move more.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, we know this. Most of America knows this.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we fatter than ever?

   A brief digression: In this context, fat means being overweight
according to your body mass index, which is based on your height
and weight. Being larger than a supermodel or a Hollywood actress
does not necessarily make you fat. This latest uproar over the
obesity epidemic is not intended to fuel an increase in eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   That said, more than half of all Americans are fat, with BMIs of
25 to 29.9. One-fifth of U.S. adults are clinically obese, with
BMIs of 30 or higher. Georgia has earned a special distinction as
the state with the largest increase in the percentage of obese
people since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Which means we are neither eating less nor moving more.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, no one is saying that we deliberately choose to be
lazy pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That suggests that people are at fault for their weight
problems,'' says Dr. William Dietz, who heads the division of
nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control

than that. Our lifestyle and our environment make it increasingly
difficult to be active and make the food choices that we want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   We spend hours commuting to and from neighborhoods without
sidewalks. Exhausted, we slump in front of the TV or the computer
and eat microwave dinners or takeout, which we wash down with
sugary sodas. Or we go to restaurants and shovel down enormous
portions.
</P>
<P>
   We take elevators and escalators and circle sharklike through
parking lots for a space near the door. Our kids would rather watch
TV or play computer games than go outside, a factor proven to
contribute to childhood obesity. We order the Super Size fries by
reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick one thing and say, this is the problem,'' says
Dr. James Hill, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of Colorado in Denver. ``What you have to realize is,
society is the problem. The way we live is creating obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   But history shows we sure do want the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   We want foods that taste great and are less filling. We
foolishly thought ``fat-free'' meant free to eat all you want, and
we ate Snackwells cookies by the box. Admit it, they didn't even
taste that good.
</P>
<P>
   We want magic pills. We went nuts over fen-phen diet drugs, and
look how that turned out.
</P>
<P>
   But even nasty side effects don't faze us. We eat potato chips
made with the fat substitute olestra, even though it commonly
causes stomach upset and diarrhea. We take the supplement
Metabolife, whose active ingredient is ephedra, an unregulated
herbal stimulant that can raise your blood pressure and cause heart
palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 100,000 prescriptions have been written for the
recently approved drug Xenical, whose side effects include rectal
leakage. Yes, that means what you think it means.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, we fell in love with the HealthRider, a goofy
piece of fitness equipment best described as a mechanical bucking
Shetland donkey. It didn't make you feel like you were working
hard, because you weren't. A study by the American Council on
Exercise found that even the most strenuous workout on an aerobic
rider only burns 50 percent to 75 percent of the calories consumed
during a similarly intense workout on a treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   In March, ACE debunked a claim by Time Works that its new
exercise machine, which combines the dynamic principles of a stair
stepper and a hula hoop, could provide a complete aerobic,
strength-training and flexibility workout in just four minutes. The
$600 machine, heavily advertised on TV, brought in $60 million in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, treadmills, which really do offer solid exercise,
turn into extra clothing racks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think there's some miraculous way, without any
discipline or hard work, to live a healthier, fitter lifestyle,''
says Charles Platkin, the founding CEO of the Internet site
eFit.com, to debut Nov. 22. ``They want to believe in a quick
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   America is, after all, the land of instant gratification, the
country that pioneered drive-thru banking and one-hour photo
processing. By comparison, we're being generous when we give
ourselves until the holidays to lose 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the enormous popularity of highly restrictive diets and
ultra-intense exercise programs that promise fast results.
Frequently, though, the only result is burnout.
</P>
<P>
   Slim Fast has a special ``Jump Start'' kit that promises users
they will lose 5 pounds in 5 days. The packaging doesn't mention
the likelihood that you'll gain it all back as soon as you quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to make any money telling people to lose a
pound a month,'' points out Rod K. Dishman, a professor of exercise
science at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Workouts such as spinning, kickboxing and military-inspired
``boot camp'' programs, all of which burn several hundred calories
per hour, do have merit _ for those already in shape. Novice
exercisers risk injury and, more significantly, discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to push too hard because they remember that they
were in better shape at one time, and that's what they want to
reproduce immediately,'' says Richard Cotton, ACE's chief exercise
physiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, obesity experts say, is that we make such a
big deal out of weight management. The word diet implies
restriction. People think they have to limit themselves to certain
foods to lose or maintain weight.
</P>
<P>
   But dieting is doomed to fail, says compulsive eating expert
Geneen Roth, who has a simple philosophy: Eat when hungry, and eat
until full. Roth says people have yelled at her for telling them
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so accustomed to these fad diets, and people are so
removed from that initial and instinctive reason to eat, that when
someone says to tune into your hunger, it sounds like another
diet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   We think exercise must be done in a gym, or requires copious
sweating, or demands special clothes and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about exercise is that it has a negative
connotation,'' says Dr. Karen Dewling, an Emory Clinic pediatrician
who deals with childhood obesity. ``Somewhere in childhood it turns
into a not fun thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many health experts prefer the term physical activity. Lisa
Stone, deputy director for Georgia's Commission on Physical Fitness
and Sports, applauds companies that install gyms, but she'd just as
soon see more people taking the stairs every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gyms in workplaces only get the same 30 percent of the
population that's going to exercise anyway,'' Stone says. ``We're
thrilled that corporations are spending all this money on fabulous
facilities, but they're not getting the people in there that need
to be in there. We're trying to reach the inactive people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the commission's most popular and effective worksite
programs, the Take Charge Challenge, encourages participants to get
physical activity into their workday by taking the stairs, doing
leg lifts while talking on the phone, walking over to someone's
desk instead of e-mailing them.
</P>
<P>
   Some exercise physiologists point out that this moderate
activity doesn't fulfill the recommendation that people elevate
their heart rate for at least 30 minutes at a time. Dietz counters
that we should be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant debate in this field whether you need
continuous and sustained activity rather than small increments of
exercise,'' he says. ``But 60 percent of the adult population is
inactive. In that context, even small amounts of activity are
likely to have benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about are changes in lifestyle that can be
sustained,'' Dietz says. ``Not short-term solutions from which you
will relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   So, walk. Skip the elevator. Get up from your desk every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Eat lunch, but walk to get it. Eat out, but cut your portions.
Eat dinner at the table, not in front of the TV. Always eat
breakfast. Drink water. Drink more water.
</P>
<P>
   Move more. Eat better.

 &HT;    Diet game: The skinny on quick fixes
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for a quick fix? These diets are among the most popular,
but all have drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   LOW-CARBOHYDRATE, HIGH-PROTEIN DIET
</P>
<P>
   A diet with many variations, and known by many names _ Atkins
Plan, The Zone, Sugar Busters _ the premise is the same: By
drastically cutting down on carbohydrates, the body will burn up
stored fat because it's not getting the usual daily shot of energy
boosters (insulin) from the carbs and sugars found in breads,
potatoes, fruits and juices. People can, however, gorge themselves
on protein and fats. So those items normally banned on low-fat
diets _ bacon, steaks, cheese hamburgers, eggs, and peanut butter
sandwiches without the bread _ are on the menu. Low-carb diets have
been around for three decades but are now enjoying a resurgence of
popularity; four of the most popular low-carb diet books top the
paperback New York Times best-seller list this week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Risks: Although people can drop significant weight on these
diets, nutritionists and doctors warn that the diet can be
dangerous to your kidneys and heart, and it most likely won't be a
long-lasting solution. ``They will lose weight because protein does
not retain fluid as much as carbs do,'' says Franca Alphin,
dietician and administrative director of Duke University Diet and
Fitness Center. ``Therefore, when they go make the switch, it will
be an immediate weight loss, and they are eating fewer calories
also. But people tend to crave carbohydrates, and when they
eventually go back to adding carbs, they will regain weight.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Other concerns: The high-saturated fat content of the diet
can raise cholesterol levels and put people at risk for heart
disease; high-protein consumption over several weeks will stress
the kidneys. Eliminating fruits and vegetables cuts down on
cancer-fighting and fiber needed for proper digestion. Nausea, hair
loss, and muscle strain are also possible side effects, dieticians
say.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD COMBINING
</P>
<P>
   These diets not only dictate what foods to eat, but when they
should be eaten and whether certain foods can be eaten with other
foods at the same meal. Two best-selling books pushing this regimen
are from TV personalities Marilu Henner and Suzanne Somers. The
premise is that weight loss and maintenance can be controlled by
when the hormone insulin is released into the body after a meal.
This is also done by cutting down on carbohydrates and eating more
fats, proteins and nonstarchy vegetables. In a sequel to her
best-selling ``Get Skinny on Fabulous Foods,'' Somers suggestions
for ``metabolism reprogramming'' include: Eating fruit alone on an
empty stomach, do not eat proteins and fats with carbs and
eliminate all ``funky'' foods, such as alcohol and caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Risks: Although Somers's second book is co-authored by a
physician, some dieticians still frown on the idea of combining
certain foods to lose weight because it's not based on any
scientific research. ``This one really gets me going,'' says Duke's
Alphin. ``Of course, if you eat simply one type of food and not in
combination, it is more easily digested.'' Page Love, an Atlanta
dietician with Nutrition Solutions, says this type of diet flies in
the face of what she would recommend for a dieting client. ``About
50 to 60 percent of diet should come from grains, vegetables and
fruits,'' Love said. ``People are setting themselves up for craving
if they don't have what they are used to eating together, such as
cereal and milk, a sandwich with actual bread. It's the only way of
getting in a healthy supply of food and meeting complex
carbohydrate needs.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Other concerns: Being low in fiber, the diets could cause
constipation.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK WEIGHT LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Pick up any women's magazine and you're sure to find a blurb
screaming: Eat X and Lose Y in Z Days. Whether it be grapefruits,
or cabbage soup or `gazpacho fat-burning miracle soup,''' these
diets allow a person to eat as much as they want of one item for
one week (some allow additional ``mini-meals.'') People can drop 5
to 10 pounds on such diets because the body drops significant water
and muscle mass. If not followed for more than one week, such diets
can provide the jump-start some people need to get motivated for a
longer-term healthy weight-loss plan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Risks: But too many see results on these quick-loss diets and
stay on them too long, dieticians say, leading to nutrient loss,
nausea, fatigue, and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another danger: Revolving-door crash dieting can lower the
body's metabolism, meaning it takes more exercise to burn off fat.
``Every time you go on one of these, the ability to lose weight
decreases over time with each diet cycle,'' says Love of Nutrition
Solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With quick muscle loss, you are dramatically decreasing
metabolism.''

A CENTURY AFTER HIS BOOK ON DREAMS, A PARTIAL VINDICATION FOR
FREUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Sigmund Freud, whose seminal book, ``The Interpretation of
Dreams,'' arrived in the bookstores of Vienna 100 years ago this
month, dreams were filled with latent meaning, their bizarre
imagery and peculiar narratives concealing deep-seated, instinctual
motives and desires.
</P>
<P>
   Modern neuroscientists, however, have cast the products of
nightly repose in a different light. Laboratory studies in the
1960s and '70s linked dreams not to hidden urges but to the firing
of neurons and oscillation of chemicals in the most primitive part
of the brain during the arousal of ``rapid eye movement,'' or REM
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming, in this conception, was random and chaotic, the mind's
attempt to take account of the brain's revved-up physiology. Higher
brain centers _ the crucibles of thoughts, emotions and memories _
were merely passive responders, making ``the best of a bad job in
producing even partially coherent dream imagery from the relatively
noisy signals sent up from the brainstem,'' as Dr. John Allan
Hobson and Dr. Robert McCarley of Harvard, authors of the
``activation-synthesis'' model of dreaming, put it in a 1977 paper.
</P>
<P>
   Freud, in other words, could not have been more wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seemed. But in recent years, new work has forced
scientists to rethink their understanding of dreaming and the
brain, granting a more active role to parts of the brain that feel,
remember and see.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings neither validate the particulars of Freudian
theory nor prove that dream interpretation is, as Freud asserted,
``the royal road to a knowledge of the unconscious activities of
the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And some scientists, Hobson among them, see little in the new
work to bolster Freud's case.
</P>
<P>
   But neither are the results inconsistent with psychoanalytic
thinking. And they have been eagerly pounced upon by many
psychoanalysts, who say that they offer a biological foundation for
at least some of what the Viennese doctor deduced from treating
neurotic patients a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago,'' said Dr. Mark Solms, lecturer in
neurosurgery at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, who is both a
neuropsychologist and a psychoanalyst, ``Freudian dream theory
seemed absolutely untenable. Today, what we know about the brain
mechanisms of dreaming is far more compatible with what Freud
inferred.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new insights into dreaming have come from the
development of neuro-imaging techniques that allow investigators to
observe the living brain. In one series of studies, for example,
Dr. Allen R. Braun of the National Institutes of Health and his
colleagues used PET scanning to measure blood flow, an indicator of
brain activation, during REM and non-REM stages of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   During REM sleep, Braun and his colleagues found, the brainstem
and other regions involved in regulating arousal were highly
active, as predicted by earlier laboratory studies. But areas of
the brain responsible for more complex mental functions also showed
great bursts of activity. These included structures that form the
limbic system _ including the hypothalamus, the amygdala and the
hippocampus _ involved with emotion, motivation and memory
formation, and visual and auditory areas of the forebrain involved
in processing sensory information.
</P>
<P>
   The brain centers that went ``off line'' during REM sleep were
equally striking. Cortical regions responsible for the most
sophisticated mental processes, like planning, abstraction, logical
thinking and the contextual flow of memories, showed decreased
activity, as did the primary visual cortex, in charge of receiving
visual input from the outside world. Imaging studies by other
researchers have yielded similar results.
</P>
<P>
   What the findings add up to is a map of the dreaming brain that
conforms nicely to the subjective experience of dreaming: the
presence of florid images, intense emotions and gobs of memory; the
absence of orderly sequence, time sense, self-awareness and other
hallmarks of waking consciousness.

 &HT;    Losing weight 101: Eat less, move more

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Count calories. No, count fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   All right, you can have some fat, but only the good kind. Eat
more protein and less sugar. Eat more fiber and less dairy. Eat six
small meals, not three big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Snack. Don't snack. Don't touch pasta. Don't even look at that
Halloween candy.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise 30 minutes, three times a week. Or 10 minutes, three
times a day, three times a week. Or 90 minutes on the days with the
letter A in them.
</P>
<P>
   Every diet and exercise program says: Eat this, do that.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, losing weight and improving your health boils down
to this: Eat less, move more.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, we know this. Most of America knows this.
</P>

exercise,'' he says. ``But 60 percent of the adult population is
inactive. In that context, even small amounts of activity are
likely to have benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about are changes in lifestyle that can be
sustained,'' Dietz says. ``Not short-term solutions from which you
will relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   So, walk. Skip the elevator. Get up from your desk every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Eat lunch, but walk to get it. Eat out, but cut your portions.
Eat dinner at the table, not in front of the TV. Always eat
breakfast. Drink water. Drink more water.
</P>
<P>
   Move more. Eat better.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News ServiceWhat if you're not trying to lose weight
<TEXT>
but just want to be healthy? What makes up a good, healthy day? An
adult woman needs about 2,000 calories per day; an adult man about
2,800 daily calories. Eat a variety of foods from the bottom up
from the Food Guide Pyramid: Six to 10 servings of bread, rice,
pasta or cereal; at least five servings of a combination of fruits
and vegetables; two to four servings of fruit; two to three
servings of milk and cheese group and two servings of meats,
poultry, eggs and other proteins. Consume fats, oils and sweets
sparingly.
<P>
   -- Rise and drink water: Begin the day with a glass of water.
And keep drinking water throughout the day. Most adults need 8 to
12 cups of water daily, but that can come from other beverages
(except caffeinated drinks, since caffeine actually depletes your
body of water) and some foods, such as lettuce, carrots, apples and
yogurt. Water is vital in carrying nutrients throughout your body
and in carrying waste products away. It helps soften stools,
cushion joints and protect body organs and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eat breakfast: No matter what your age, it's still the most
important meal of the day. After eight to 12 hours without a meal
or snack, your body needs replenishing of glucose, or blood sugar.
Your brain particularly needs a morning shot of glucose because it
has no stored reserves. Studies show breakfast eaters have more
strength and endurance and better concentration and problem-solving
ability.
</P>
<P>
   A bowl of whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk, a slice of toast
with jam, and a glass of citrus juice can provide 100 percent of
daily vitamin C needs, 33 percent of calcium, thiamin and
riboflavin and a good supply of fiber and iron.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping breakfast or any other meal won't necessarily help
dieters shed pounds. Eating revs up your metabolism. If you don't
eat, your metabolism slows down to conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   -- Take time, make tracks: Park a distance from the subway
station or your workplace to get in a short walk. If you work a
desk job, get up and walk around every hour. Take the stairs up and
down, or at least alternate between the stairs and elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the late afternoon, break away for 15 minutes to
stroll a few blocks and get your body and brain stirred up. During
your day, fit in a total of at least 30 minutes of physical
activity. You don't have to go to a health club. Physical activity
includes walking briskly, cleaning house, gardening, raking leaves,
or washing the car.
</P>
<P>
   -- Snack well: Eat healthy snacks between meals, especially
between lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rest: Get at least 8 hours of sleep. Avoid caffeine and
alcohol too close to bedtime. Alcoholic drinks may make you sleepy,
but studies show they actually contribute to a less restful night.
Also, try not to exercise late at night, as that may make it more
difficult to fall asleep.

 UNDATED: waking consciousness.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, Braun said in an interview, the map is also
``consistent with psychoanalytic theory.'' The fact that the
emotional system in REM is ``wildly active,'' at the same time that
brain regions responsible for rational thought appear to be shut
down, for instance, might be seen as the ``ego'' relaxing its
control during sleep, allowing the ``id'' free reign _ the
``regression'' that Freud posited, he said. And the activation of
regions associated with motivations and appetites, though broader
and more amorphous than the sexual and aggressive instincts Freud
thought underlay dream images, still leaves open the possibility
that dreams are driven by basic drives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in another sense, Braun added, the brain scans are in
conflict with Freudian thinking. Freud argued that the unconscious
desires underlying dreams were censored and disguised. But in the
PET study the parts of the brain essential for such maneuvering
were inactive during REM. This finding fits more comfortably with
the ``activation-synthesis'' theory, which requires no cloaking of
meaning, and which Hobson and McCarley have revised to account for
the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hobson said that he saw no need to call upon
psychoanalysis in order to understand the role of emotions in
dreaming. ``I see no convincing evidence that convicts Freud of
being correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiety, anger, elation _ emotions that commonly emerge in
dreams _ are interwoven with survival, Hobson pointed out. ``And
anxiety is not a symptom,'' he said. ``It's not something you're
experiencing because you don't want to recognize some cognitive
truth about yourself. It's because anxiety is damned important.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent studies address a more fundamental question, one
that also bears on the question of how plausible Freud's theory
remains: ``Where in the brain is the dream engine located?''
</P>
<P>
   In the activation-synthesis model put forward by Hobson and
McCarley, dreaming is, for all intents and purposes, equated with
REM sleep, which occurs with predictable regularity at 90-minute
intervals during a typical night's slumber.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, decades of studies in the sleep lab have shown that REM
is the stage of sleep when dreaming is most likely to occur. Human
subjects awakened during REM report dreaming 80 to 95 percent of
the time, in comparison to about 10 percent of the time when
awakened during other sleep stages.
</P>
<P>
   Because studies had demonstrated that REM sleep is turned on by
the shifting of neurotransmitter chemicals in an area of the
brainstem called the pons, it was logical to think, the Harvard
researchers reasoned, that the REM ``on'' mechanism initiated
dreaming, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if the vivid scenes of the night are set off by the
preprogrammed flip of a chemical switch, what room does that leave
for the stirring of unconscious desires, the replaying of childhood
traumas, the acting out of psychological conflict _ in short, for
all the dream material that therapists and their patients routinely
interpret?
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1960s, some scientists, notably Dr. David
Foulkes, then at the University of Chicago, took issue with notion
of a one-to-one correspondence between dreaming and REM sleep.
Foulkes and other researchers demonstrated that at some points
during non-REM sleep, subjects reported dreams that, rated by
judges unaware of what stage the dreams occurred in, were
indistinguishable from REM dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the evidence shows that REM sleep is not necessary or
sufficient for dreaming,'' said Dr. Gerald Vogel, director of the
Sleep Research Laboratory at Emory University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Uncoupling of REM and dreaming would mean that dreams could be
instigated in other parts of the brain, said Solms, the lecturer in
neurosurgery, even in the forebrain, where the instinctual drives
Freud wrote of would be most likely to reside.
</P>
<P>
   Solms said that during his training as a neuropsychologist in
the early 1980s, he studied Hobson's model and assumed that Freud
must be ``100 percent wrong.'' But after beginning to practice, he
saw two patients with injuries in areas of the forebrain. Both said
that they had stopped dreaming after their injuries, a peculiar
thing if dreams were in fact driven by the brainstem.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, Solms began to investigate more systematically. In
1997, he published a report of dreaming cessation in 45 patients
with intact brainstems but lesions in the forebrain. He has
collected an additional 65 cases from the medical literature, and
discovered hundreds of other accounts of patients who underwent
frontal lobotomies _ at one time a popular treatment for psychosis
_ and experienced a loss of dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Solms studied 26 cases in the literature of
patients with lesions in the pons area of the brainstem _ the home
of the REM sleep generator. REM was no longer present in these
patients, and some were comatose as a result of their injuries.
Still, he said, in only one was there a report that dreams ceased,
also problematic if dreams in fact are born of brainstem activity.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, he said, fit neatly with the dreaming-equals-REM
model he had learned in school: ``It was a gradual process of
realizing that there was something horribly wrong with the original
theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In its place, Solms, who debates Hobson in a forthcoming issue
of the interdisciplinary journal Neuropsychoanalysis, proposes that
dreams can be set off by various types of brain activation. REM
activity in the brainstem is the most common trigger. But increased
activity during other sleep phases _ the periods immediately before
awakening in the morning or just after falling asleep at night, for
example _ could also provide this stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, Solms contends, would be more compatible with a
psychological approach to dreams, including Freud's assertion that
every dream is spawned by a deep-seated wish, or more accurately,
in light of current knowledge, by emotions and appetites, conscious
or unconscious. ``My proposal is this: Dreaming can occur as a
result of anything that arouses the sleeper,'' Solms writes in the
journal, but only when the stimulus in question ``excites the
motivational systems of the forebrain and thereby initiates a
goal-directed intention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Studies like these, said Dr. William Domhoff, research professor
in psychologyat the University of California at Santa Cruz,
``relegitimize dreaming as a psychological process by showing that
it is necessary to have higher brain capability.'' He added,
``Dreams are a platform through which people can talk about
themselves, they can be interior, they can be self-disclosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Solms and Hobson still disagree, in some ways the new
research has brought their respective assessments of the dreaming
brain closer together.
</P>
<P>
   Solms, for example, concedes that there is as yet no evidence to
support Freud's assertion that unconscious motives are disguised
and censored, to prevent their intrusion into consciousness. This
is the part of Freudian dream theory that, at the moment, seems
weakest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, for his part, said that he never claimed dreams were
meaningless: he has filled 109 volumes with his own dreams over the
years, hardly the act of someone who dismisses dreaming as
unimportant. ``Dreams are transparently meaningful,'' Hobson said,
``chock full of emotional salience.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not opposed to the idea of unconscious mental process, but
questions whether ``there are parts of my unconscious mind that are
inaccessible to me and that are critically important in
understanding my behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he suggested, the emotions in dreams, and in particular
anxiety, serve as rehearsals of basic, evolutionarily determined
survival mechanisms. ``One theory emerging here is that REM sleep
enables you to run all the crucial programs for behavior two hours
a night,'' he said. ``How much time does a pianist practice each
day?''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson rejects, however, the notion that the forebrain can act
entirely on its own in inciting a dream. And he doubts that the
appearance of vivid dreams in non-REM sleep means anything other
than that sleep and waking form a continuum, with some REM
processes stretching into other parts of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he bridles at the idea that advancing the
understanding of dreaming means resurrecting Freud. ``My problem
with psychoanalysis is historical,'' he said. ``I was trained in an
era when it was unquestioned. I thought it was a scientific theory
and I found out little by little that it was a speculative
hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for both sides, it is perhaps time to put Freud aside,
suggested Braun of the National Institutes of Health, who served as
commentator in the journal's Solms-Hobson debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepping back a short distance,'' Braun wrote, ``this is what
I see: Hobson, a consummate biological psychiatrist, now argues
against reductionism and passionately advocates the study of
subjective conscious experience. Solms, a psychoanalyst, is
attempting to recast dynamic psychology in neurochemical terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me like these gentlemen are approaching common
ground,'' Braun wrote. ``Perhaps it is simply the ghost of Freud
that is getting in the way.''

 &HT;    DIETARY SOY SEEN REDUCING COLON CANCER RISK
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Lifestyle (l) categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Small amounts of soy protein, consumed daily for a
year by persons who had been diagnosed with colon cancer or
precancerous colon polyps, appeared to cause changes that reduced
the likelihood of recurrent tumors or polyps, researchers said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which involved only 29 persons, was described as
a preliminary indication that soybean products may help in
preventing or treating colon cancer. A larger and longer trial
would be required to produce more definitive evidence a benefit,
said Maurice Bennink, the Michigan State University researcher who
directed the study.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings were greeted warmly at a scientific symposium
here on the role of soy in preventing and treating chronic disease
that was underwritten by the soybean industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have produced still unconfirmed indications that
soybean products may be effective in preventing breast cancer,
prostate cancer, coronary heart disease and osteporosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the four-day symposium was getting underway, the American
Institute for Cancer Research warned against loading up on soy or
soy concentrates. The private, nonprofit organization noted that,
although evidence that soy might be valuable in warding off
prostate cancer appears to be encouraging, those findings also are
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of benefits in preventing breast cancer is even
more mixed, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not possible as yet to draw any conclusions about
soy consumption and cancer prevention,'' but further research is
certainly warranted,'' said soyfoods expert Mark Messina, a former
researcher with the Diet and Cancer Branch of the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Bennink's study was described as the first human study
suggesting a benefit in preventing or treating colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, there was a change in the characteristics of the
colin lining which is consistent with a reduction in colon cancer
risk,'' Bennink said. ``It appeared that these people would be less
likely to develop cancer or polyps a second time,''
</P>
<P>
   Every day during the study, the10 women and 19 men consumed a
two-ounce supplement of soy isolate, the kind sold in health food
stores, Bennink said, and were asked not to change their diets in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, scientists from Harvard University Medical
School transplanted human prostate cancer into the prostate glands
of mice and tested the effects of dietary soybean extracts.
</P>
<P>
   Jin-Rong Zhou said tumor growth was reduced from 50 to 60
percent in mice fed the soy extracts and metastasis to lungs and
other organs was from 40 to 50 percent less common than in animals
that were not fed the extracts.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou said the soybean substances appeared to block development
of blood vessels needed by the tumors and ``starve them to death.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sports bottles of water have become indispensable accessories in
gym bags and symbols of good health. But sports doctors are warning
people not to drink too much water during endurance events like the
New York City Marathon, which takes place on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though athletes need to drink regularly during a race to prevent
dehydration, experts say that excess water can lead to
hyponatremia, a potentially fatal condition that is rare but
increasing among recreational athletes. Hyponatremia is an
abnormally low concentration of sodium in the blood. The cause is
unknown, but overconsumption of water is thought to increase the
risk by diluting blood sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, hyponatremia was seen almost exclusively in
ultramarathons and other extremely high-endurance events, said Dr.
Michael Sawka, chief of thermal and mountain medicine at the U.S.
Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Mass.
``Now we're seeing it in marathons, hiking and military
occupations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include nausea and vomiting, muscle weakness, headache
and disorientation, as well as bloating and puffiness in the face
and fingers. In the last year or so, a dozen marathon runners in
this country were known or suspected of having hyponatremia, said
Dr. William Roberts, a spokesman for the American College of Sports
Medicine, the professional organization of sports physicians.
</P>
<P>
   One victim was a 43-year-old woman who died after running the
Chicago Marathon last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are looking for hyponatremia now more than ever before,
but they say that increased vigilance does not fully explain the
increased diagnoses. Another reason may be that many recreational
athletes are drinking too much water. ``We've done a good job of
educating people on proper rehydration, but some people have taken
that to the Nth degree, thinking that the more you drink, the
better,'' Sawka said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that most of the marathon runners with hyponatremia
were relatively inexperienced athletes who entered races to raise
money for charity. ``They're the ones who are in the race for a
long time, and there's some speculation that they're drinking too
much water during the race,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The condition seems more common among women than men. Medicine
and Science in Sports and Exercise, a journal, recently reported
that about half the women studied who finished the New Zealand
Ironman triathlon developed hyponatremia, compared with 14 percent
of the men. Doctors are not sure why. It may be that women simply
drink more water than men. The guidelines, set by the sports
medicine organization, call for about 17 ounces of fluid two hours
before exercise, and then early and at regular intervals to replace
all the water lost through perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that people could calculate their ``sweat rate''
ahead of time by weighing themselves and then exercising for half
an hour at the pace and in the conditions anticipated in a coming
race. Then they should weigh themselves again to get the number of
pounds lost through perspiration. For every pound lost, they should
drink a pint per hour during the race. The guidelines also
recommend drinking a sports beverage, like Gatorade, that contains
carbohydrates and electrolytes. Sports drinks help prolong an
athlete's peak performance and replace sodium lost in perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether sports drinks help prevent hyponatremia is under study,
the American College of Sports Medicine says. In any case, doctors
say, an effective way for runners to maintain healthy blood sodium
concentrations in Sunday's race is to salt their food every day
between now and then.

   WASHINGTON -- Small amounts of soy protein, consumed daily for a
year by persons who had been diagnosed with colon cancer or
precancerous colon polyps, appeared to cause changes that reduced
the likelihood of recurrent tumors or polyps, researchers said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which involved only 29 persons, was described as
a preliminary indication that soybean products may help in
preventing or treating colon cancer. A larger and longer trial
would be required to produce more definitive evidence a benefit,
said Maurice Bennink, the Michigan State University researcher who
directed the study.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings were greeted warmly at a scientific symposium
here on the role of soy in preventing and treating chronic disease
that was underwritten by the soybean industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have produced still unconfirmed indications that
soybean products may be effective in preventing breast cancer,
prostate cancer, coronary heart disease and osteporosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the four-day symposium was getting underway, the American
Institute for Cancer Research warned against loading up on soy or
soy concentrates. The private, nonprofit organization noted that,
although evidence that soy might be valuable in warding off
prostate cancer appears to be encouraging, those findings also are
preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of benefits in preventing breast cancer is even
more mixed, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply not possible as yet to draw any conclusions about
soy consumption and cancer prevention,'' but further research is
certainly warranted,'' said soyfoods expert Mark Messina, a former
researcher with the Diet and Cancer Branch of the National Cancer
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Bennink's study was described as the first human study
suggesting a benefit in preventing or treating colon cancer.
   ``Basically, there was a change in the characteristics of the
colin lining which is consistent with a reduction in colon cancer
risk,'' Bennink said. ``It appeared that these people would be less
likely to develop cancer or polyps a second time,''
</P>
<P>
   Every day during the study, the10 women and 19 men consumed a
two-ounce supplement of soy isolate, the kind sold in health food
stores, Bennink said, and were asked not to change their diets in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, scientists from Harvard University Medical
School transplanted human prostate cancer into the prostate glands
of mice and tested the effects of dietary soybean extracts.
</P>
<P>
   Jin-Rong Zhou said tumor growth was reduced from 50 to 60
percent in mice fed the soy extracts and metastasis to lungs and
other organs was from 40 to 50 percent less common than in animals
that were not fed the extracts.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou said the soybean substances appeared to block development
of blood vessels needed by the tumors and ``starve them to death.''

DON'T ENTER THE `HOUSE'; NO ONE GETS OUT OF THIS REMAKE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Jan De Bont's ``The Haunting'' is ``Scooby Doo'' in the
big-scary-mansion-as- amusement-park movie sweepstakes, then ``The
House on Haunted Hill'' is the sub-sub-sub- genre's ``Scrappy
Doo.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two films with their youngish casts lured into a p.o.'d
house for a good scare couldn't be more different. One had
Anglo-Latina bombshell Catherine Zeta-Jones, the other has
Bridgette Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know who Bridgette Wilson is, it doesn't matter:
Neither do the people responsible for this movie. If you do know
who she is, you're lying. You probably wouldn't be able to
distinguish her, anyway, from co-star Ali Larter _ she was the slut
who put whipped cream and cherries on her ``tarts'' for Jimmy Van
Der Beek in ``Varsity Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The House on Haunted Hill'' is horrendously underlit so that
two blondes essentially become one, and Taye Diggs as the movie's
Black Guy has to end his sentences with ``yo'' and ``maaan,'' so we
know that he's, you know.
</P>
<P>
   That Diggs has a role smaller than Linda Hunt demonstrates the
exact brand of craven dunderheadness rockin' this ``House.'' It
refuses to cheat even in Diggs' favor, giving him no more to do
than stay fully clothed and be the fool asking all the obvious
questions. (``What is this?!'' he demands holding a bloody cloth.)
</P>
<P>
   But Diggs is fully determined to make it to the end of this
movie as if a combo of dialogue, direction and production design
this embarrassing were a terrible thing to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs is one of six strangers picked to live in a big-ass house
and have their lives tampered with by Geoffrey Rush. He plays a
sicko theme-park ride inventor who's married to Famke Janssen, one
of the victims _ I mean ``strangers.'' Together they play a
bantering, hateful husband-wife team best described as deeply
unkinky Boris and Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gallagher and Chris Kattan join Wilson, Larter and Diggs
in a house so bloated with dead souls and one insane doc (not being
played by Brad Dourif, coincidentally) that it often sounds like
it's belching. The strangers' assignment is to stay alive through
the night for a million-dollar payday. (What, is Regis Philbin
beneath these people?)
</P>
<P>
   Who survives in a movie this irrelevant is beside the point _ if
your name's on the marquee, chances are your agent's already dead.
But for the curious, staying alive in ``The House on Haunted Hill''
is a matter of Hollywood math. Gallagher used to be sort of famous
and Diggs is getting more famous. Follow?
</P>
<P>
   Rush, by comparison, only has an Oscar, but no Jane Magazine
interview.
</P>
<P>
   However, here are some reasons none of this matters: The ghost
haunting the house looks like the interior of a car wash; ``SNL's''
Kattan really isn't the guy you want for your horror film; there
isn't a single money shot of Diggs' ass or Larter's ``tarts,'' just
Rush with an open shirt exposing his cadaverous chest. It's a
moment to be grateful the film's been lit and photographed like it
was cruising a gay night club for a Scooby snack.

<P>
   They are among the greatest frustrations in astronomy: colossal
outpourings of energy driven by engines that remain a mystery
because they are too far away for astronomers to resolve their
details with even the largest telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most spectacular manifestations of these mysterious
powerhouses are the narrow jets of particles, many thousands of
light years long, that emerge from the centers of some galaxies at
nearly the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   Now three astronomers have used an array of radiotelescopes
scattered around the globe to trace a jet of particles closer to
its source, which is thought to be a black hole three billion times
as massive as the Sun, than in any previous observation.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers came so close to the source that they observed a
sudden widening of the spray of particles, a feature that they
believe is a clue to the workings of the central engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now probed deeply enough to see that something is
different deep in the core,'' said Dr. William Junor of the
University of New Mexico, the lead author of the team's report,
which appeared last week in Nature. ``We're not seeing more of the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Junor and his two collaborators, Dr. John A. Biretta and Dr.
Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute, believe the
sudden widening shows that most of the jet's energy is not coming
directly from the black hole _ as suggested by some models _ but is
emanating from a larger structure called an accretion disk, a
whirling ring of gas and dust sucked in by the black hole and in
orbit around it.
</P>
<P>
   The observations focused on the center of galaxy M87, which at
about 50 million light years from Earth is the closest galaxy that
spits out a large jet. The jet gives off radiation in many
wavelength bands including the radio. The astronomers took
advantage of this to observe the jet, using a technique called Very
Long Baseline Interferometry, which links radiotelescopes at more
than a dozen spots on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   That wide spacing of the telescopes allows the technique to
resolve features about one five-hundredth the size of those
resolved with the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Moran, a radioastronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, called the observations unprecedented and
said they would help unravel the mystery of the engine.
</P>
<P>
   The widening of the jet's angle to 60 degrees from about 6
degrees, Livio said, suggested the jet is powered by the accretion
disk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Livio, these results support a model in which
magnetic fields attached to the disk sweep around and throw off
particles that are stuck to them like beads on a string.
</P>
<P>
   At least in this case, he said, the results seem inconsistent
with a competing theory in which the energy comes straight from the
black hole, which should be much smaller than the accretion disk.

<P>
   It was a chance meeting. Dr. Joseph Markoff, a Philadelphia
ophthalmologist and a classically trained trumpet player, was
entertaining at a family party when one of the guests made a
startling proposition: would Markoff consider having his trumpet
frozen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was some kind of nut,'' Markoff said. ``I could
not imagine what he was talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   But the guest, Steven Wasser, a flute manufacturer, was
perfectly serious. As president of Powell Flutes, in Maynard,
Mass., he had been experimenting with deep-freezing techniques, and
had become convinced that something musically interesting occurred
as a result. Cryogenics had a lot to offer musicians, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Markoff, who knew of the uses of cryogenics in the operating
room, was intrigued. He agreed to send Wasser an old trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a valued instrument, said Markoff, who described it
as ``best suited for a lamp.'' But when he played it after it had
been frozen, Markoff found the instrument had become ``one of the
freest-blowing'' and most superbly focused trumpets he had ever
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Wasser said he had experienced such success with the freezing
process that he now regularly included that step in the
flute-manufacturing process. ``I don't publicize cryogenics because
I can't prove it scientifically,'' he said. ``But almost everyone
who has tried a blind test picks the treated instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep-freezing musical instruments may sound extreme, but it is
just one example of how brass and woodwind makers are wrestling
with deciding just how much to allow technology to remake their
craft.
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years, brass-instrument makers have tinkered
with their processes and hoarded their secret tricks like
alchemists of old, all with the hope of making it easier to amplify
the sound made by a vibrating column of air. It is a business in
which science traditionally has run a distant second to the art of
tailoring the instrument to the musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician is invited to visit the factory and all but create
the instrument in hope of supplying a perfect combination of
acoustics and alloys to satisfy the human, if not the scientific,
ear.
</P>
<P>
   As the technological revolution expands into music, however,
instrument makers find themselves split over whether to welcome or
shun the economic benefits of computerization, robots and precision
tooling. While the new technologies can make manufacturing cheaper,
instrument manufacturers resist a one-size-fits-all approach. They
talk about another goal: the creation of instruments individually
suited to the musicians who play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, every instrument is different,'' said Richard K.
Breske, vice president of United Musical Instruments of Elkhart,
Ind., one of the largest musical instrument manufacturers. ``We
stretch metal and pound it, heat it, cool it. We give people
interchangeable parts to make the sound brighter or darker, more or
less resistant and then make lots of small changes to fit the sound
our musicians want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So United, which makes instruments under brand names like Conn
and Benge, as well as Yamaha Musical Products, the Edwards
Instrument Co., the Getzen Co. and the Selmer Co., makers of Bach
instruments, all now sell brass instruments with multiple bells,
lead pipes and other parts that vary in size or thickness or alloy.
The variety is all meant to help musicians who are trained to hear
such differences more easily make the sounds they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   A yellow bell on a trombone, for example, is generally about 70
percent copper and 30 percent zinc; a noticeably more red bell is
about 90 percent copper, 10 percent zinc. Jazz musicians generally
seek the yellow bell for its ``brighter'' tones, while redder bells
seem more preferred among symphony musicians, who seek ``darker''
coloration in sound.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is in the timbre of the sound rather than in
loudness or range. Attentive concertgoers might see musicians
changing instruments for different pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The basic processes of producing a horn have remained unchanged
for decades, even centuries. Brass alloys are stretched, cut,
hammered, spun. The metal is shaped against hard surfaces, brazed,
soldered and buffed. Some companies are using computer-guided
production and robots for hammering, but the basic idea is age-old.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, some instrument makers believe, these manufacturing
techniques seem to be causing problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that soldering, bending, banging causes actual stress in
the metal itself,'' said Andrew Naumann, director of development
for trumpets at Edwards. Naumann, who himself builds models of
historical trumpets, explained that stretching and soldering ``can
make an instrument blow `tight' rather than freely. It is that free
sound that most professionals want.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter cryogenics.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching metal into the contortions that make up the average
trumpet or tuba may upset the alloy's molecular structure. What was
a discernible arrangement of molecules becomes less orderly, and
stressed. Heat may make metal more malleable, but it may also
spread the molecules. Supercooling treatments appear to return the
molecules to a more orderly arrangement, relieving stress in the
metal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Or so goes the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the scientific work on supercooling metal has
involved ferrous metals, steel mostly. Brass has received little
attention, relatively speaking. In fact, a dozen or more companies
around the country offer to deep-freeze a variety of steel
products, including razor blades, golf clubs and drill bits. They
display performance charts assuring greater longevity and hardness
in metal after cryogenic treatment.
</P>
<P>
   So why not musical instruments? Those who have tried the
deep-freeze say there is a difference in ease of playing and in the
range of ``color'' in the tone.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Tanabe, owner of the Brass Bow music repair shop in
Arlington Heights, Ill., has a cryogenics tank big enough to hold a
tuba.
</P>
<P>
   For about $200, Tanabe cleans an instrument with ultrasound,
then he wraps it, and, over 35 to 50 hours, he gradually lowers its
temperature to about 325 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, well above
absolute zero (459 degrees below zero Fahrenheit).
</P>
<P>
   As Tanabe explains it, the extreme cold can accelerate what
seems to happen to brass instruments as they age. Sound quality
improves, he said, because resonance is clearer. He believes that
his is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment, and that the effects last
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Tanabe offers testimonials from musicians, including several
from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. But his advertising is by word
of mouth. ``Otherwise, people think you're talking about voodoo,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because there has been little scientific research on the effect
of extreme cold on musical instruments, several of the larger
manufacturers have decided not to pursue such techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard about it, but we cannot show that it works,'' said
Breske of United Musical Instruments. Fred Powell, who directs
brass instrument development for United, said that the techniques
might relieve structural stress, but that there was no evidence
that the metal changed.
</P>
<P>
   Even some specialized brass instrument manufacturers are
skeptical. David G. Monette of Portland, Ore., has built the
unusual, recognizable trumpets that Wynton Marsalis uses. At seven
pounds, his trumpets, which include a built-in mouthpiece and a
rare inner and outer bell, can weigh up to three times as much as
more popular trumpets. ``Brass is brass,'' Monette said. ``It is
what you do with it that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cryogenics, he said, ``is the poor man's answer to problems in
resonance,'' the problems of creating a pleasing tone.
</P>
<P>
   Monette believes in the theories about stress, but says he has a
secret proprietary manufacturing process that is a better antidote.
He was part of a study performed by the Materials Research Society
with Sandia National Laboratories that probed resonance both in his
trumpets and in a golf club he produced.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggested that the patterns of resonance were similar.
``Resonance is the name of the game,'' Monette said. ``It is what
we all are after.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Powell Flutes, which uses precious metals, not
brass, has been swayed, even if Wasser cannot prove his belief.
Wasser, the company's president, has sought scientific verification
for introducing cryogenics to his manufacturing process for several
years, ever since he learned that supercooling had helped
strengthen fasteners used on the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   At least one expert rejects Wasser's theory. Dr. Harry C. Gatos,
a retired professor of materials science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and a flute player, insisted that several
diagnostic tests he and a team had run could turn up no measurable
differences in silver, gold or platinum used in the instruments
that had been supercooled.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, if there had been any change, it would
probably wear off. ``Theory tells us that nothing should happen
under cooling, and we saw no evidence of it,'' he said. ``But
people swear they feel a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Markoff, the ophthalmologist, has been spreading the word about
cryogenics among 20 musicians in the Philadelphia Orchestra, where
he is a substitute player. As a result, about 45 instruments have
been frozen, and while results were not uniform, many musicians
described the sound as ``richer'' and ``more focused'' and the
instruments as having ``easier response.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientifically, Markoff said, ``I believe that cryogenics
stabilizes the brass and reduces extraneous vibrations and
harmonics. It dampens whatever interferes with resonance and
eliminates obstacles between the musician's lips and air column and
the instrument. But the bottom line is that it makes me sound
better.''

 &HT;    Airlines give breaks flying to a sick family member, but not
much
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If your out-of-town relative is gravely ill or seriously
injured, don't look to the friendly skies for too much compassion
when it comes to the cost of your ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Although some travelers are fortunate enough to stumble into a
sympathetic ticket booker, most airlines are taking a harder stance
on illness and bereavement policies.
</P>
<P>
   The industry does offer discounts for emergency flights _
typically, half of what a walk-up ticket would cost. And they often
allow the traveler to have an open-ended return date _ useful when
you don't fully know what the situation is at the other end of your
journey.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: Requirements to get these fares are getting stiffer.
For example, Delta's policy only allows bereavement discounts for
situations involving imminent death or life-threatening situations.
Stuff that doesn't qualify include terminally ill patients
traveling to a medical facility; people visiting terminally ill
relatives and emergencies that aren't life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   If you do qualify for a bereavement discount, be prepared to
have a physician's statement on letterhead stating that imminent
death is probable. Some airlines also require the address and phone
number of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And expect to wince from the price tag. For example, a
bereavement round-trip fare to Los Angeles on Delta Air Lines would
total more than $1,000, based on a Friday inquiry. That contrasts
with a 14-day advance fare of $350.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are not that sympathetic with travelers in
difficult situations,'' said Mark Alan Reinke, of Carlson-Wagonlit
Travel in Atlanta. ``And although 50 percent off sounds like a lot,
when you get right down to it, it's no bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even airline representatives advise that travelers seek other
solutions than bereavement fares. Jackie Pate, Delta's spokeswoman,
recommended that you always compare the bereavement cost with that
of the airline's lowest priced ticket. AirTran Airlines doesn't
even offer bereavement tickets because its fares already are
discounted, said spokeswoman Cara Maruskin.
</P>
<P>
   So what else can a traveler do, especially when time is of the
essence? Start with a travel agent, so you get a more comprehensive
view of the industry's prices. In the case of the Los Angeles fare,
for example, while Delta's bereavement fare hovered at $1,000,
Frontier Airlines offered on the same day a walk-up fare of $410,
with a change in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And travel agents will also know about quirky changes in the
market. America West Airlines was also offering a $202 round-trip
special to LA on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other ways to beat back the costs if you have a
little bit of flexibility. For example, ask your travel agent if it
would be cheaper to book two flights _ on even two different
airlines _ to get to your destination. For example, it might be
cheaper to fly to Chicago on one airline, and then fly from Chicago
to Minneapolis on another.
</P>
<P>
   It is also worth checking the Internet if you've got a little
time. Log on to airline websites, which often run cut-rate
specials. Delta (www.delta-air.com) posts its cut-rate flights on
Wednesday for the following weekend. And check out other websites,
like www.priceline.com, that feature so-called ``distressed
inventory'' _ flights that aren't booked to capacity. If you don't
mind out of the way stop-overs, twin-engine airplanes and an
itinerary that's not revealed until you buy the ticket, it might be
the perfect ride.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you'll need to fly often to see your ailing relative,
buy several tickets in advance with penalty clauses. Often, this is
a cheaper alternative than waiting until the last minute, with the
traveler paying only a $50 to $75 penalty for changing dates.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can also use a trick known in the business world. If
you already hold a ticket for a flight days or weeks in advance of
the trip, you can usually redeem it at the airport to fly standby
on earlier flights.
</P>
<P>
   Those with thousands of frequent flyer miles can sometimes
finagle a free ticket quickly. That's because instead of being
merely ``self-loading cargo'' (as travelers are fondly referred to
by the industry), you move into the realm of being a valued
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you call the airline and find the customer service
representative isn't willing to work with you, thank them, ask for
a supervisor or call back to get someone else. Experts say the
market is wildly subjective and wink-wink deals are still common,
if you hit the right sympathetic soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any magic answers to getting a reasonable fare,''
said Carole Barrett, owner of the Art of Travel. ``And the airlines
haven't done anything to make it easier for consumers.''

 &HT;    Change in interest rates reflected in fewer number of mortgages
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One little percentage point can turn feast to famine
in the mortgage lending business.
</P>
<P>
   Since the average home-loan interest rates for metro Atlanta
jumped in June from the 6-percent range into the 7-percent range,
mortgage lenders have watched a big hunk of their business
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, total mortgage applications _ new-home loans and
refinancings _ are down. They dropped 59 percent in the third week
of October, compared with the same period a year ago, according to
the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refinance segment of our business has dropped from
probably 50 percent the first half of the year to 10 percent now,''
said Brooks Campbell, vice president of MetroFirst Mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage loan industry is coming down from a ``tremendous
spurt of activity,'' said Fannie Mae economist Robert D. Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Loan originations are expected to drop 16 percent in 1999,
ending the year at $1.32 trillion, compared with a record-breaking
$1.45 trillion in 1998. He forecasts loan originations will fall
under $1 trillion for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An end-of-summer slowdown in relocations also fed the drop-off
in the loan business, said Bob Slocum, senior vice president at
Premier Lending.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all this, lenders have two ways to maintain
profits. They can cut prices or trim operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, there are spotty reports of layoffs, said Julia
Hiler-Barrette, executive vice president of Sunshine Mortgage and
current president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen and experienced a slowdown, with refinancings
having gone away and the (new-home-loan origination) market
slowing. It is true that people have been laid off ... ,'' she
said. ``It is also true that we have shifted staffing around to
busier areas like recording deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the number of
jobs in the industry to decrease from 375,000 to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
   When loan volume is down, mortgage loan employees make less
money in commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The loan originator then has to try harder, Slocum said. ``You
have to be aggressive to keep the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend more time bonding with customers, giving them special
attention, because it is very hard to win loans on the best rate
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Slocum, most loan originators can adjust pricing no
more than 1/2 percent in closing costs and 1/8 percent in the loan
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the difference between making a 6 1/2 percent loan and a
7 3/4 loan, last year and now,'' he said. ``Now, you have to price
more aggressively, but, at the same time, you are less likely to
make as much money per loan.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Robert Zubrin, 47, an astronautical engineer and
founder of the Mars Society, a group advocating space travel to the
neighbor planet, was having coffee in Manhattan on a recent autumn
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin, who heads the Pioneer Astronautics engineering company,
which develops ideas for NASA, had come to New York from his home
in suburban Denver to talk about his latest book, ``Entering Space:
Creating a Space-Faring Civilization'' (Tarcher-Putnam, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   His 1996 volume, ``The Case for Mars,'' had made a sensation in
astronautical circles with an interesting notion for a cut-rate
program for Mars exploration known as the Mars Direct Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed program would use existing technology and would
keep fuel weight at a minimum by having the astronauts manufacture
propellant for the return trip from material on Mars. ``Entering
Space'' elaborates on the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In both your books, you suggest that the United States will
enjoy a kind of national rebirth once it sets up a Mars
colonization program. Why do we need a national rebirth? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think we need a challenge. Civilizations are like people.
They grow when they are challenged and stagnate when they are not.
I think this is especially important to youth, who need to go
somewhere where no one has gone before. A ``human to Mars'' program
would be an invitation to adventure to every kid in the country:
learn your science, develop your mind and you can be a part of
pioneering this new world. In concrete terms, we would get millions
of scientists, inventors, doctors and medical researchers. That's
the real benefit we got from Apollo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In reading ``Entering Space,'' I couldn't help but feel you
were overromanticizing the nature of 19th century America. Yes, it
was an era of expansion, but it was also a time of incredible
violence, of destruction of the American wilderness and the
slaughter of American Indians.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think people feel the need for a continued existence
of an open frontier. They want a place where they can go where the
rules haven't been written yet. The most profound kind of freedom
that people can have is the freedom to be makers of their own world
and not simply inhabitants of it. That was a sort of freedom that
people had during the creation of this country. If we open space,
then people can have that freedom again, except there are no
Indians on Mars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. If there are life forms like microbes on Mars, do we have a
right to interfere with their environment? You advocate all kinds
of radical activities for your space colonists, like melting the
Martian permafrost and mining the planet for minerals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If there are microbes, even if we hydrogen-bombed the whole
planet to our maximum capability, we could not bomb those microbes
to extinction. What we are talking about here is bringing a dead
planet to life. We're talking about taking a planetary surface
which is, in fact, dead _ if there's life on Mars, it's only in the
ground water _ and turning this into a viable arena for the
development of life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your books, you offer suggestions for the social life of a
Mars colony. You have a list of possible rights. For instance, the
right to bear arms. Why will Mars colonists need that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. These are rights that exist in contemporary American
society. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You suggest that Mars colonists will enjoy the right to bear
children and the right to be free of extortionist lawsuits. Where
did you get those?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To be frank, I just sat down here and banged out a whole
bunch of rights. In the United States, by the way, we do have the
right to have children, but in certain other societies, China, they
don't. The point I'm trying to get at here, is what I'm advocating
here is not a particular system of rights. These are more a list of
suggestions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you were an engineering student at the University of
Washington in 1983, did you ever think your studies would take you
into the nether world of politics? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not to this extent. Although, I've always been aware that
engineering projects had a significant political component. I
studied nuclear engineering for a while, which basically failed on
the political battleground. The industry has been aborted due to
its inadequate performance on the political battleground. It was
unable to make its case adequately to the public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did nuclear engineering face problems because of public
relations failure or did Three Mile Island and Chernobyl frighten
the public? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Three Mile Island, of course, was the failure of an American
commercial nuclear power plant. No one was hurt. We have much more
disastrous things in coal mines all the time in terms of loss of
life. Chernobyl wasn't an engineering failure of the American
nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   But, to return to your question, I did not imagine that I would
be leading a crusade. I imagined I'd be participating in political
dialogue. I think an engineer would have to put his head in the
sand to think that a project could be built without that. The
Brooklyn Bridge wouldn't have been built without a massive fight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. How large is the Mars Society? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Right now, we have 2,000 dues-paying members and 8,000 on our
mailing list. We get about 50,000 hits on our Web site daily. Also,
we've recruited to our ranks some pretty heavy-hitting people.
</P>
<P>
   We've also launched this project for an research station on
Devon Island, in the Canadian Arctic. Devon Island is a polar
desert with a meteorite impact crater that has a geology very
similar to Mars. You can explore Mars there by analogy.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to build a human Mars exploration simulation base on
Devon Island and use it as both an operational and engineering test
base to learn how to conduct human exploration on Mars. We have the
money required to build the first module from a lot of small
donations and a major one from Steve Kirsch, the chairman of
Infoseek. He gave $100,000. At Devon Island, we're going to
discover a lot of things that just don't occur to you when you are
designing missions on paper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your basic take on the recent Mars Climate Orbiter
mishap? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, I think the Mars robotic program is
underfunded. We used to send our robotic spacecraft out in pairs
because they are high-risk. Now, to save money, we send only one
out, and the recent mishap has set the science back four years. The
cost of losing the Mars Climate Orbiter is low _ about 50 cents per
American citizen, but the cost in time has been great. So I feel
that's why we should have sent two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Mars mishap was attributed to human error. Is that
right? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know who made what mistake when. But they have
reduced the mission operation staff from the previous standard of
about 200 to close to 80, as a cost-saving measure and I think they
may have gone a bit too far. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the new book, you're rather critical of the nature of
aerospace contracts. You suggest that the basic structure of the
contracts leads to big clunky programs that take forever to be
completed and impede space exploration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the free market would work better. I think it would
be better if the government said to Lockheed/Martin, ``We'll pay
you $200 million dollars per launch instead of 10 percent over your
documented costs. If you can do it for $30 million, you can take
the rest as profit.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you were a kid, did you have science heroes? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Einstein was kind of an icon. I actually had an engineering
hero as a kid: Admiral Rickover. He said something I tried to take
to heart: the most important quality that an engineer needed to
have is courage. By that, he didn't mean physical courage, but the
courage of one's convictions. That made an impression.

CD SOFTWARE SAID TO GATHER DATA ON USERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   RealNetworks' popular RealJukebox software for playing CDs on
computers surreptitiously monitors the listening habits and certain
other activities of people who use it and continually reports his
information, along with the user's identity, to RealNetworks, said
a security expert who intercepted and examined data generated by
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, company officials acknowledged that
RealJukebox, which can copy music to a user's hard drive and
download it from the Internet as well as play it, gathers
information on what music users are playing and recording.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer
products, said the company gathered the information to customize
services for individual users. He and other company officials
insisted that the practice did not violate consumer privacy because
the information was not being stored by RealNetworks nor
distributed to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and security experts interviewed last week
were unanimous in condemning the practice, calling it a violation
of the privacy of the 13.5 million registered users of RealJukebox,
almost all of whom have given the company their names and e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company's use of the data is benign, these experts
said, the practice is unacceptable because of the secrecy:
RealNetworks, one of the largest distributors of audio software on
the Internet, does not inform consumers that they are being
identified and monitored by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The information that RealNetworks gathers is extensive.
According to Richard Smith, an independent Internet security
consultant from Brookline, Mass., who discovered RealJukebox's
monitoring functions, each time the program is started on a
computer connected to the Internet, it sends in the following
information to the company: the number of songs stored on the
user's hard drive; the kind of file formats _ RealAudio or MP3 _
the songs are stored in; the quality level of the recordings; the
user's preferred music genre, and the type of portable music
player, if any, that the user has connected to the computer.
Officials at RealNetworks said most of this information was used to
offer music selections to users based on their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   All this information is combined with a personal serial number
known as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, which is assigned
to each user when he or she registers the software.
</P>
<P>
   RealJukebox is distributed only on the Internet, and users are
instructed to register _ giving the company their names, e-mail
addresses and ZIP codes _ when they install the software.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if RealJukebox is used with its default settings,
it automatically loads each time a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM
drive, and if the computer is connected to the Internet, the title
of the CD is sent, together with the GUID, to RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they have been dazzlingly careless with their treatment
of personally identifiable information or they are completely
disingenuous,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of
Junkbusters, a privacy watchdog organization. ``Which is worse? If
they are not disclosing what they are doing, that is
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other CD player programs also assign GUIDs to each copy of
the software. The difference lies in what they do with it.
Microsoft Corp., for example, says that the unique identifier in
its Windows Media Player is used for such things as purchasing
multimedia from a Web site. It is not routed through Microsoft, nor
does Microsoft require users to register, and it does not gather
information through Media Player, said a spokesman for Waggener
Edstrom, a public relations firm that represents Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that RealJukebox is gathering this information is not
mentioned in the long privacy policy the company posts on its Web
site. Nor is it acknowledged in the licensing agreement that users
must approve when installing the program.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David Banisar, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in
Internet law, said that RealNetworks' surveillance practices could
violate various state and federal statutes, including the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act. ``It's a new type of case that hasn't been
brought before,'' he said. ``But I think it's a pretty good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar argued that RealJukebox could be considered a ``trojan
horse,'' a legitimate program that contains hidden instructions to
perform illegitimate functions.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said on Friday that the registration procedure
for the free version of RealJukebox did ask for personal
information, including name and e-mail address, but they said that
users could skip the registration and still use the program and
that RealJukebox would stop prompting users to register after five
attempts. Some customers, they said, had stumbled on this fact and
had declined to register.
</P>
<P>
   However, customers who purchase RealJukebox Plus, a version with
enhanced features that RealNetworks sells online for $29.99 with a
money-back guarantee, cannot avoid ring since they must type
in a unique serial number to install the program. And in this case,
RealNetworks also gathers credit card and mailing address
information before it assigns the number.
</P>
<P>
   Richards of RealNetworks said the reason the program tallied the
number of songs a user had recorded was to enable the company to
determine whether the user was ``naive'' or ``sophisticated.'' This
better enables the software to steer sophisticated users toward its
advanced features, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this seemed at odds with a statement by Steve Banfield,
RealNetworks' general manager of consumer products, who said the
company was gathering only ``aggregate usage'' information about
users of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts said the kind of information being gathered by
RealJukebox had the potential to be used to detect copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said that to his knowledge, the company had no plans to
allow information about individual users to be used in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett of Junkbusters said that such information could be
subpoenaed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. ``This usage
and tracking information is a way for them to collect intrusive
profiles about people and possibly set up prosecutions for
copyright infringements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like some 250 other such programs, RealJukebox licenses the
right to use a database of CD titles and tracks that is compiled
and maintained by a company called CDDB. This enables the software
to display the title and tracks of a CD moments after it is loaded
into the computer. To do this, the program must send out
information to CDDB every time a user plays a CD.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other popular programs, RealJukebox routes the
information through its own servers and tags it with the GUID,
which uniquely identifies the user.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said the information went to CDDB via a proxy server, a
computer that masks certain data, to protect the privacy of
RealJukebox users. He said it was his understanding that CDDB
typically collected a user's e-mail addresses each time its
database was queried, but by using a proxy server, he said,
RealNetworks' users were all generically identified as
user(AT)real.com.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield painted RealNetworks as a defender of consumer privacy,
asserting: ``Everyone else who uses that database sends them their
e-mail address. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Greenberg, senior vice president of marketing and business
development for CDDB, said last week that her company ``strongly
encourages but does not require'' e-mail addresses or any other
identifiers that enable the company to tally unique users of its
database. She said the addresses were purged every four days. But
she said it was not fair for RealNetworks' to blame CDDB for
gathering personal information.

<P>
   Most people think of mercury as the shiny liquid metal in
thermometers. But it has other forms, and it is a far less visible,
and very toxic, kind _ methylmercury (my) _ that is troubling
scientists, environmentalists and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury is discharged into the air by power plants that burn
coal, which contains small amounts of it, and by incinerators,
mining and other sources. It rains down onto the land and leaches
into waterways, collecting in the fatty tissues of the fish people
eat. And while other industrial uses of mercury are declining,
concentrations are nevertheless on the rise in the environment and
in the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The toxicity of methylmercury is a matter of intense debate. As
a result, scientists and government officials are making new
efforts to determine how much mercury is safe to consume and
whether new limits on power-plant emissions are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences has established a committee to
investigate the mercury toxicity issue, but its work is difficult.
Recent studies of the effects of low-level mercury exposure,
primarily from eating contaminated fish, have produced differing
results.
</P>
<P>
   One showed neurological damage; the other did not. The
committee's study, sponsored by the Environmental Protection
Agency, began last December and is scheduled for completion next
June.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Goyer, the panel's chairman, says its top priority is
to determine the effects of prenatal mercury exposure. ``My, the
type of mercury found in fish people eat, kills nerve cells because
it is transported readily across the cell membranes,'' he said.
``The bottom line for the NAS study is determining the minimum
amount of mercury that will affect the most sensitive member of our
population, the unborn child. The current data from different
studies are not consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's conclusions could have big implications for the
coal-burning plants of the electric power industry. The EPA
estimates that it would cost about $2 billion a year to control
mercury emissions from those plants; Congress has required the
environmental agency to wait for the National Academy of Sciences'
study before proposing additional mercury regulations for power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury from coal burning is deposited on land and in bodies of
water through rainfall and the settling of dust. Some is then
converted to my, a very toxic form of mercury that contains carbon.
Because my is soluble in fatty tissues, it accumulates in fish and
animals that prey on them. Its concentration rises at each step up
the food chain until it is consumed by people.
</P>
<P>
   Death and serious illness from mercury poisoning have been
documented since the 16th century in Europe. The expression ``mad
as a hatter'' came into the language because hat makers were
poisoned by mercury salts used to make felt for fancy hats. They
were well known for their symptoms: shaking, stumbling and
muttering to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1960s and '70s, consumption of food heavily
contaminated with my resulted in death or serious illness to
thousands of people in Japan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But subtle, mostly neurological, effects of low doses are now
emerging as the long-term legacy of mercury. Slower reflexes,
reduced coordination and poorer vision are evident in people
ingesting small amounts of mercury in fish. But the effects are
difficult to measure and despite decades of study, experts disagree
on the levels of mercury that are safe in air, water and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a frustrating issue,'' said Dr. David C. Bellinger, an
associate professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School and
member of the N AS committee. ``With mercury, we have only a few
major studies.'' He said more mercury studies were needed to form a
better foundation for regulatory change.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donna Mergler, a professor of neurophysiology at the
University of Quebec at Montreal, says that in many respects, the
situation with mercury is similar to what it was years ago for
lead. ``Why take lead out of gasoline and paint?'' she said. ``No
one was getting sick or writhing on the ground. But lead did lower
the IQ of kids. Subtle effects for toxins like lead and mercury are
sometimes difficult to see in the individual, but can be seen in a
group portrait where we compare the functioning of groups of people
exposed to different levels.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in some respects, mercury is a more serious contaminant than
lead. Because mercury can exist in the form of a vapor, it can
spread around the globe far more easily than lead. Also, ``mercury
accumulates more efficiently than lead in the aquatic food chain,
especially in larger predatory fish,'' said Dr. William H. Farland,
director of EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment.
Even minute additions of mercury to a lake can substantially change
the amount in the fish people eat.
</P>
<P>
   Regional effects of mercury have been observed by teams of
Canadian and Brazilian researchers working along the Amazon River
since 1994. They have concluded that the small amounts of mercury
naturally occurring in local soils can substantially raise the
concentration of my in fish when the soil erodes into the river
after clear-cutting of the adjacent forests. Neurological testing
has shown that local people have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coordination and vision tests showed a shift to lower
performance at higher levels of mercury exposure from fish
eating,'' said Mergler, one of the researchers working in Brazil.
``This lower level of performance makes the people less able to do
things, which is important in a world which is expecting them to
develop.'' Programs are under way to reduce mercury exposure there
by encouraging consumption of fish species with lower mercury
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Fish consumption was also examined in two major studies under
way since the late 1980s. One, in the Seychelles, in the Indian
Ocean, found that general performance on intelligence tests was not
affected by exposure to my; the other, in the Faroe Islands,
northwest of Scotland, found deficits in memory, attention span and
language.
</P>
<P>
   The studies differed in many respects, including eating patterns
in pregnancy, ethnic or genetic makeup, and testing methodology.
They are now under review by the national academy's panel. Already,
though, the results have led the Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry, part of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, to revise mercury health guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the agency announced it was safe to consume 0.3
micrograms of mercury per kilogram of body weight per day, up from
its 1994 guideline of 0.1. This means a 150-pound person could
safely eat four ounces of canned tuna in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury enters the body in a number of ways, including diet,
dental fillings, pharmaceuticals, and from contact with mercury
metal or its compounds. But it is fish _ ``brain food'' _ that is
the major dietary source of my to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Food and Drug Administration continues to
recommend consumption of as much as 2.2 pounds of fish and
shellfish a week and has not changed the mercury level it considers
safe: 1 part per million in fish.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 seafood species, making up 80 percent of the
commercial seafood market, all average well below that level. Shark
and swordfish, both top predator fish, may have mercury
concentrations above 1 part per million, and the FDA continues to
recommend no more than one serving a week for these two types of
fish for most people, and no more than one serving a month for
pregnant or nursing women, or those who may become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The push to lower overall exposure to mercury has continued on
many fronts. In June, the EPA announced that fluorescent bulbs,
which contain mercury, could now be recycled to keep them out of
waste dumps. On Sept. 14, the National Wildlife Federation released
a study blaming coal-burning power plants for more than half of
excess mercury in rain in several Midwestern cities.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, the EPA announced a plan to severely restrict the
direct discharge of mercury and other chemicals that accumulate in
fish in the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this activity, full protection of human health and a
comprehensive understanding of mercury's effects in the human body
and in the environment will be difficult to achieve. Farland said
the Academy of Sciences panel would have more information than the
CDC did in making its recommendations, but he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``They will still not have complete information. Over all, we
are looking at what to do to avoid adding more mercury to the
environment and how controls on mercury sources may improve human
heath.''

LAWSUITS SEEK TO SET A STANDARD FOR MAMMOGRAMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Hawaii, Fla.)   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, a jury in Hawaii awarded $1.32 million to a
57-year-old woman who said her breast cancer diagnosis had been
delayed for 17 months because a radiologist had not found it on a
mammogram. In New York, a 37-year-old woman won a $2.5 million
malpractice suit against a radiologist who she said had failed to
find her breast cancer on a mammogram done seven months earlier. In
Florida, a jury awarded $3.35 million to a 56-year-old woman who
claimed that her breast cancer diagnosis was delayed for six months
because her cancer had been missed on a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   These are just some of a growing number of lawsuits asserting
that a diagnosis of breast cancer was missed because a radiologist
failed to find it on a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts in the field say such lawsuits mainly stem from
serious misconceptions about the ability of mammograms to detect
cancers and from an assumption that the radiologists who read
mammograms should be able to see things that may be discernible
only in hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   In current American Journal of Roentgenology, Dr. Leonard
Berlin, chairman of radiology at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago, wrote that ``the number of medical
malpractice lawsuits alleging injury due to missing or delaying the
diagnosis of breast cancer has increased so rapidly that such
lawsuits have now reached epidemic proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Radiologists who read mammograms are the main targets of these
lawsuits, which often result in multimillion-dollar jury awards,
even when no medical error has been committed by the doctors
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Clifford, a plaintiff's lawyer in Chicago and vice
chairman of the section on litigation of the American Bar
Association, said: ``Radiologists do miss these things. I've seen
top-drawer radiologists miss it. I believe it's a volume issue
where the doctor has too much business on his plate. He's rushed,
harried and doesn't give it the time and attention it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin said in an interview: ``Some lawsuits could have been due
to errors made by radiologists. I'm not passing judgment as to the
legitimacy of the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berlin believes that well-meaning efforts to encourage women
to get regular mammograms have led to a highly inflated view of the
accuracy of the technique. For example, in promoting mammography in
the 1980's, the American Cancer Society stated, ``Now, breast
cancer has virtually nowhere to hide,'' even though 10 percent of
known breast cancers in older women and up to 25 percent of cancers
in young women cannot be seen on a mammogram.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Homer, a professor of radiology at the Tufts University
School of Medicine, said in an interview, ``Mammography is the best
tool we have for finding small, potentially curable breast cancers,
but it's not 100 percent perfect.'' A cancer can be seen on a
mammogram only if it looks different from the surrounding normal
breast tissue, he explained, and some cancers are indistinguishable
from normal tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast cancers like invasive lobular carcinomas can masquerade
as normal, even if you can feel them,'' Homer said. In younger
women, he added, the density of the breast tissue makes it
difficult to recognize subtle early signs of cancer on a mammogram,
even when more than one radiologist looks at the films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public perception is that the mammogram is a test that is
100 percent accurate,'' Homer said. ``A woman thinks, `If I have
cancer, itmust be on the mammogram, and if the mammogram was read
as normal, my cancer must have been missed.''' He added that he had
seen advertisements by malpractice lawyers seeking clients whose
cancers were initially undetected by mammography.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Kopans, a radiologist and mammography expert at the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in an interview, ``I
think we've elevated the expectations of women above reality. The
legal system is holding us to a standard that's impossible to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that there is no radiologist, no matter how
competent and experienced, who ``has not failed to see a
significant abnormality on a mammogram,'' and added: ``It's like
looking for your keys in the morning and not being able to see them
when they are right in front of you. Finding cancers on a mammogram
can be much more difficult than finding the Ninas in a Hirschfeld
drawing. No one tells us how many, if any, are in the picture. And
they may not all be Ninas; some may be Janes or Dans.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rise in lawsuits involving mammography represents the
flip side of arguments that have long raged over this technique.
Many critics claim that its widespread use and doctors' fear of
litigation has resulted in large numbers of unnecessary biopsies
and operations for cancers that are unlikely ever to threaten a
woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   While studies have indicated death rates from breast cancer are
reduced by 30 percent when women over 50 have annual mammographic
screening, the benefits to younger women are less clear because it
is harder to see cancers in dense breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Mammography can often find tiny cancers before they can be felt
by a woman or her doctor and when they are presumed to be most
curable. But the diagnosis and treatment of a tiny cancer is not a
guarantee of cure. As Homer explained, ``Some breast cancers are
very aggressive even at a small size'' and may have spread beyond
the breast even before they can be felt. Others are slow-growing
``and may only be recognizable on a mammogram when they grow
larger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When used annually as a screening tool, mammography is most
valuable when it finds hidden tumors before they have spread beyond
the breast and while they are potentially curable. But tumors that
grow rapidly may become apparent as a discernible lump months after
a routine mammogram has found no trace of it.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman or her doctor can feel a lump, ``a negative
mammogram is essentially meaningless,'' Kopans said, adding: ``It
does not tell someone she does not have breast cancer. Once
something can be felt, it must be checked out further,'' for
example, by ultrasound or biopsy. In some cases, a lump that an
expert considers unlikely to be cancer may be watched for a few
months to see if it will go away on its own. ``But it cannot be
ignored just because the mammogram is negative,'' Kopans said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to improve the accuracy of mammograms have taken several
paths. One is to have two experienced radiologists look at them
independently, but not under the pressure of a woman who is waiting
in the office for the results, Kopans said. Unrushed double
readings can increase the accuracy of mammography by about 7
percent, his studies have shown. Another approach is the use of a
computer-assisted second reading, a technique that has not yet been
proved helpful but that has the potential to result in more
accurate readings.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society has also been urging women to seek
out high-quality mammography. In its newest brochure and
advertisements, the society tells women to ask questions about the
office or center where they are getting their mammograms. They
should seek out a place that specializes in mammography or does
many mammograms each day; those that meet high professional
standards of safety and quality should display a Food and Drug
Administration certificate.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman changes medical sites, she is advised to bring copies
of her previous mammograms so they can be compared to the current
ones, which can make it easier for a radiologist to detect a change
that may be medically significant.

 &HT;    Thrashers' 'soft' approach not working, but all news not bad
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The signs of a team in search of a presence could be
found on Petr Buzek's lower lip Monday. It was split, precisely
where it was met by a Kelly Buchberger elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost lost a tooth,'' the Thrashers' rookie defenseman
said, smiling nonetheless. ``It was a physical practice. That's
good. I like it. We need it. We need to toughen up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten games into the season, a bell appeared to have sounded
before the Thrashers' practice Monday at the Duluth IceForum. The
words from coach Curt Fraser came louder, the stick slamming came
more frequently, than in some time. Another home loss will do that
to a coach, particularly when it appeared that every goal was
caused by a defensive lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Damian Rhodes might not have been in Vezina form in
Sunday's 6-4 loss to Ottawa, but the Senators found the slot area
in front of him as comfortable as a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought defense would be a strength of ours,'' Fraser said.
``I think it's still going to be. But maybe we tried to do too much
early, and we got our lunch fed to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering their second month, the Thrashers are 2-6-2 with a
regulation tie. It's not a great record, but it's not terrible,
considering that they're still under warranty and that the schedule
has ranked among the league's toughest. The losses have come to New
Jersey, Detroit, New York Rangers, Colorado, Toronto and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   What has been disturbing to the coaching staff and general
manager Don Waddell are repeated mistakes in the defensive zone and
at times, such as Sunday, a lack of physical presence in front.
Fraser used the word ``soft'' after the Ottawa game
</P>
<P>
   Waddell has made several minor changes to the team already,
including Monday's acquisition of rugged winger Eric Bertrand from
New Jersey. But in terms of serious roster analysis, he is sticking
to his plan to break the season into 20-game segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I'm happy with the direction we're going in,''
Waddell said. ``We could have had another one or two wins, but,
hopefully, by the way we've lost some of the games, we'll use it as
a learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how big is the learning curve for the several
veterans on the roster? When Waddell put this team together,
largely through the expansion draft, he thought that he was getting
a team that would be fairly solid in its own zone. It hasn't always
been the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the veteran players have to be better, no doubt about
that,'' he said. ``The young players have been the bright spots;
the older players need to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have given up 38 goals in 10 games for a
league-worst 3.80 average. Particularly disturbing to Fraser was
the timing of Sunday's goals by Ottawa: The Senators scored 1:12
into the first period, once with 1:11 left in the period, twice in
the first 4:39 of the second and again 18 seconds into the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot of about your first shift, your last shift, the
first shift after a goal,'' Fraser said. ``We may have to expand
that to the first five minutes, the last five minutes and the last
five after a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his series of lectures Monday, the coach said, ``We're
working on our shortcoming. Hopefully, we can shore things up, but
it's going to take time. . . . You can't teach offense. You have a
50-goal scorer and a 20-goal a scorer and a 10-goal scorer. But
everybody can play good defense. It just takes hard work, and you
have to be willing to be physical. But we've gotten away from it.''

STUDY FINDS LAPSES ON MEDICAL GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It is hard to imagine the wizards of ``E.R.'' stopping to
consult the latest practice guidelines before rushing to deliver a
baby or cracking open a dying patient's chest. But for real-life
practitioners, staying up to date with medical science increasingly
means staying abreast of such guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are meant to improve medical care by codifying
what panels of experts deem to be best practices in a given field;
there are hundreds of them, the American Medical Association says.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many doctors are unaware of any number of
guidelines, and those who read them often fail or refuse to adopt
their recommendations, according to a study published last month in
The Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which reviewed 120 physician surveys spanning the
last 30 years, reached these conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ At any given time, at least 10 percent of doctors are unaware
of a particular guideline that pertains to their practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 10 percent more, while probably aware of the
guideline, are not familiar enough with its specifics to be able to
follow it correctly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yet another significant group knows the guideline but refuses
to follow it for a variety of reasons. For example, the study said,
doctors sometimes decline to order recommended tests that they
believe will expose patients to unjustifiable risks. A persistent
minority of doctors resent what they often call a ``cookbook''
approach to patient care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guidelines for preventive medicine are often disregarded
because doctors do not think their advice will be taken seriously.
Physicians place little faith in studies that show a small but
important minority benefiting from such advice.
</P>
<P>
   _ And patients may resent clinical guidelines because the
treatments recommended may be expensive or uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, the creators of medical guidelines have a `Field of
Dreams' mentality,'' the study's author, Dr. Michael Cabana, a
pediatrician at the University of Michigan, said in an interview.
``They think, `If you develop it, they _ the average practitioner _
will come.' It just doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just publishing guidelines and hoping doctors will
notice them, a more aggressive approach may be warranted, he said.
Direct mailing of guidelines has been successful in some
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Cabana recommends an even more unorthodox tactic. It may be
possible for better-informed patients to bring their doctors up to
date with changes. ``I often learn about a new therapy from a
patient who read about it before I got there,'' he said. Now the
Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research is compiling
clinical guidelines online at a Web site (www.guideline.gov) where
more than 3,500 will be available in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be worried if my own physician blindly followed
clinical guidelines,'' Cabana said. ``But I would also be worried
if my physician never followed guidelines or, worse, was unaware of
them. The critical use of a recommendation is the key.''

TEXAS RESCUE SQUAD COMES TO AID OF FLORIDA PANTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By MARK DERR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ With its Roman nose, gray-tinted coat and
lethal jaws, the Florida panther was once a figure of mythological
power that roamed throughout the southeastern United States. But in
the last century, hunting and development isolated the panther in
the vast undeveloped swamps and forests of South Florida, and by
1967, when the cats were listed as endangered, there were barely 30
of them left.
</P>
<P>
   Although they continued to reproduce, evidence mounted that the
big, solitary cats _ males weigh 130 to 140 pounds; females, 80 to
90 pounds _ had become dangerously inbred. With kinked tails and
cowlicks, recessive traits manifested in no other subspecies, the
panthers were vulnerable to disease and parasitism and prone to
heart abnormalities. Most of the males were cryptorchid, meaning
one or both testicles had failed to descend, and had an
extraordinarily high percentage of malformed sperm, which pointed
toward growing fertility problems.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), a subspecies
of the cougar, is on the verge of a remarkable comeback. In a bold
effort to restore genetic diversity to the panther, wildlife
biologists four years ago imported a handful of females from a
closely related subspecies, the Texas cougar. Uprooted from the
arid hills of West Texas, three of the imports have died, but the
remaining five adapted to swamp life and have each given birth to
at least one litter of kittens.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the original imports have produced 17 kittens. Several
of those kittens have now produced as many as seven
second-generation hybrids, bringing the total population to 50 to
70 adults and kittens. In at least one instance, a first-generation
male hybrid mated with an unrelated Texas female and a
first-generation hybrid female, according to Darrell Land, panther
section leader for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid kittens do not have cowlicks or kinked tails, and
they appear more robust than their pure cousins. Biologists have
yet to conduct biomedical tests to see whether other negative
effects of inbreeding have vanished, but the prognosis is
promising.
</P>
<P>
   But in the arcane politics of the Florida panther, success also
breeds debate. Dr. David Maehr, assistant professor of forestry at
the University of Kentucky and former project leader of the
recovery effort, frets that the crossbreeding has gone so far that
it ``is spiraling out of control.'' The Florida panther's unique
physical and behavioral characteristics could be lost, he says, if
its genetic makeup becomes dominated by the slightly larger,
browner and flatter-nosed Texas cougars. He urges immediate removal
of all Texas cougars and their offspring by first generation
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Other biologists dismiss such concerns. Dr. Stephen O'Brien,
chief of the National Cancer Institute's genomic diversity
laboratory, said the various subspecies of puma _ also called
mountain lions, panthers, catamounts and cougars _ were
indistinguishable genetically and so there was no cause for alarm.
O'Brien, who is preparing to conduct DNA analysis of the hybrids,
said of the Texas cougars: ``Removing the cats is a concession to
purists. I don't think it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Brien who paved the way for the revitalization program.
In the late 1980s, he showed in genetic studies that historically
the puma was a single, unbroken population, ranging from northern
Canada to Tierra del Fuego and mating regularly across subspecies.
He also documented that a handful of Florida panthers in Everglades
National Park were the descendants of hybrids released by a private
collector, with the consent of the park superintendent, between
1956 and 1966. Those cats, O'Brien said, were derived from crosses
the collector had made between Florida panthers and pumas from
Costa Rica in the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The descendants of those hybrids, which had mingled freely with
Florida panthers, showed no signs of the ``inbreeding depression''
threatening their ``pure'' cousins in nearby Big Cypress Swamp.
Their health, O'Brien said, provided crucial evidence that genetic
supplementation through crossbreeding could work and that the
differences between the Florida panther and other pumas were
largely the ``consequences of inbreeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on genetic and demographic studies, the IUCN (World
Conservation Union) Conservation Breeding Specialty Group, led by
Dr. Ulysses Seal, bluntly warned in 1989 and again in 1992 that
without human intervention, the Florida panther would probably be
extinct before 2055. Finally responding to the alarm, the Florida
Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission drew up a plan for
genetic enhancement using Texas cougars, because their historic
range had abutted that of the Florida panther.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for introducing eight cougars from West Texas
and leaving them in place until each had produced two breeding
offspring _ enough to increase genetic variability within the
Florida panther population by 20 percent _ and then removing them.
Females were selected because of the belief that they would
acclimate without conflict, whereas males will fight to the death
over territory.
</P>
<P>
   Geneticists calculated that the influx of new genetic material
from those crossbreedings would equal what had occurred naturally
in the past and would correct problems resulting from inbreeding
without obscuring whatever evolutionary adaptations the Florida
panther had made to its wet, hot and humid home. Laying aside their
often rancorous debate over how best to preserve the Florida
panther, state and federal wildlife officials, environmentalists
and independent scientists endorsed the proposal, and in 1995 the
eight cats were brought from Texas and released.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at a workshop held last June in Gainesville, Fla.,
to review the recovery project agreed that the most pressing issue
now was allowing the Florida panther population to expand in size,
to as many as 500 individuals, and in geographic distribution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past two years, several males have moved north of the Big
Cypress Swamp across the Caloosahatchee River, west of Lake
Okeechobee, but they have no mates and efforts to find a place to
establish another reproducing population have so far fallen prey to
human concerns about living close to a large predator.
</P>
<P>
   Without those demographic changes, the South Florida cats remain
at risk from epidemics and natural catastrophes. They will also
require infusions of new genes every two decades or so, something
Land of the wildlife commission hopes can be accomplished with new
reproductive technology to avoid repeatedly relocating pumas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seal, even with those caveats, the Florida panther
program ``shows you can outbreed to help isolated populations of
other animals, like tigers.''

FRONT LINE IN MENINGITIS CAMPAIGN: FRESHMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif., Mich., Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the infectious diseases that afflict Americans,
meningitis ranks nowhere near the top. But meningococci, the
bacteria that are a cause of both meningitis and other serious
health problems, bring chaos disproportionate to the low case
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The infection can progress with devastating rapidity even under
the best of medical care; what starts as a mild flulike infection
can kill an otherwise healthy person in hours. A single case of
meningococcal meningitis can prompt emergency public health drills
to identify the scores of people with whom the victim came in
contact before falling ill, so that each can be given immediate
antibiotic therapy. The accompanying media attention intensifies
the air of panic.
</P>
<P>
   That is why a federal health advisory panel has urged the
520,000 college freshmen who live in dormitories to consider
rolling up their sleeves to get the meningococcal vaccine ahead of
the peak season, November through January _ even though it is not
expected to prevent much more than a couple of dozen cases.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention on immunization practices, called on universities and
health professionals last month to tell college freshmen and their
parents about the availability of a well-established vaccine that
is safe and effective against most subtypes of the bacteria that
affect college-age Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (The vaccine is not recommended for the general population,
because of the low incidence of infection, and it is not effective
against the subtype of bacteria that causes most cases among
infants and occasional cases in other age groups.)
</P>
<P>
   Each year in the United States, there are about 3,000 cases of
meningococcal infection, including 300 deaths. Of the total, about
125 to 175 cases occur among college students, including 15 to 20
deaths. By contrast, pneumonia and influenza killed 86,449
Americans in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while the overall meningococcal rates are low, they have
been rising among young adults _ from one to more than two per
100,000 people aged 15 to 24, since 1991. Although the centers
started keeping statistics on college students only last year,
outbreaks seem to have been rising in this group as well.
</P>
<P>
   And recent studies have found that freshmen living in
dormitories have six times as much risk of developing meningococcal
infections as students overall.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not know why. The centers recently conducted an
extensive survey, said Dr. Nancy Rosenstein, an expert there in the
epidemiology of meningococcal infections, but could not come up
with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not smoking, drinking, attending bars or anything else
we asked about,'' Rosenstein said. ``It may have something to do
with the difference in the behavior of freshmen living in
dormitories compared to other groups of students, and despite our
study we were not able to identify what that was.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen live in close quarters, and Rosenstein noted that in
homes where someone has a meningococcal infection, the risk of
someone else's being stricken is 500 times that of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, meningococcal infection was a serious problem for the
military until 1970, when the rate was 25 per 100,000, with most
cases occurring in the recruits' initial training camps. Since
1971, thanks to routine immunizations, the rate has plummeted _ to
0.51 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts speculate that the lower rates among upperclassmen
may relate to the buildup of immune defenses against the bacteria,
particularly the diversity of subtypes that students bring with
them from homes in different geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have meningococci in their throats yet do not become
ill. The bacteria are spread through the air in respiratory
droplets. They also can be spread by direct contact _ by kissing,
for example, or by sharing cigarettes or drinking glasses. From
seven to 10 days after exposure, a person can come down with a
flulike illness that starts with mild, nonspecific symptoms like
fever, sore throat, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting and malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard disease to diagnose in its early stages,'' said
Dr. James Turner, who heads the student health center at the
University of Virginia and is chairman of the American College
Health Association's task force on diseases that can be prevented
by vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids can walk into your office with a mild headache and
a low-grade fever, and look like they have the flu, just like the
other 50 to 60 people you saw that day,'' Turner said. ``Then they
can go home and slip into a coma and shock within hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those who develop meningococcal infections, 13 percent die,
according to the centers _ a rate rivaled by few other types of
infections in the United States. And about 15 percent of survivors
develop permanent brain damage, which may include hearing loss and
learning disability.
</P>
<P>
   For an idea of how savage this infection can be, consider
Melanie Benn. On the day before Christmas in 1995, Ms. Benn, then
an 18-year-old student at Humboldt State University in Arcata,
Calif., woke up at her home in San Diego feeling as if she were
coming down with the flu. She felt worse as the day went on. By the
time she arrived in the emergency room on Christmas Eve, she was in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococci destroyed her kidneys and caused gangrene as the
bacteria spread to her arms and legs. Doctors had to amputate all
four limbs. She required kidney dialysis treatments for a year.
Then her father donated a kidney in successful transplant surgery.
Her medical costs have exceeded $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benn, who graduated from San Diego State University in May,
plans to use her training in psychology to counsel others about
disabilities.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The federal panel's recommendation for meningococcal vaccine
grows out of one that the American College Health Association made
in 1997. Since then, more than 70 colleges and universities have
included information about meningococcal vaccine and other
immunizations in the packets they send to students announcing their
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, more than 2,000 students turned up at a
vaccination clinic at the University of Virginia that Turner said
was modeled after clinics at the University of Pennsylvania and
Princeton. The clinic was part of a strategy, developed long before
the federal panel's recommendation, that has resulted in the
immunization of at least a third of the university's 12,440
undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got embroiled in this,'' Turner said, ``because we had five
nonfatal cases in 1995-96; each case occurred at an interval of
about three or four months. With each succeeding case the level of
panic and hysteria grew and grew. We had parents and students
concerned. We had family physicians calling in prescriptions for
antibiotics over the phone and giving vaccine over holiday
breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's strategy was to appeal not just to students _
who tend to think they are invulnerable _ but to their parents.
After advertising the clinic during student orientation in the
summer, Turner reinforced its importance in a letter early last
month to every parent. And since the vaccine costs $65 or so per
shot, the university timed the clinic to be three days after
parents' weekend, in hopes that parents would pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this was an extraordinarily successful campaign,''
Turner said. ``We created such a demand that they ran out of time
and vaccine, so we are going to repeat it on Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is hardly alone. At Michigan State University on Oct.
9, a student entered a hospital with meningococcal infection. This
was the university's fourth case since late 1996, and two of the
others had been fatal. On Oct. 11, Michigan State officials
recommended vaccinations, and, through last Friday, 16,000 of the
university's 55,000 students and faculty members had received a
free meningococcal shot.
</P>
<P>
   But other colleges are not rushing into a vaccination program.
The University of Massachusetts, for example, has not recommended
the vaccine, is working out the logistics of changing its policy,
and has not been flooded with calls about it, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is about 85 percent effective against four subtypes
of meningococci, accounting for about two-thirds of the cases among
18-to-23-year-olds. Because such protection lasts more than three
years, a booster is not needed while a student is still in college.
</P>
<P>
   If used widely among college students, the vaccine is expected
to prevent from 14 to 26 cases and up to three deaths from
meningococci each year. The vaccine's side effects are minimal.
Some recipients may develop a mild fever and have pain and redness
at the site of injection for one to two days after the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstein of the CDC says the question parents most often ask
her is whether the vaccine can cause meningococcal infections. The
answer, she says, is no. ``It is impossible, because the vaccine is
made from only the outside of the bacteria,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Information about meningococcal vaccinations is posted on the
Web site of the American College of Health Associations
(www.acha.org). CDC plans to put the full version of the
recommendation, when it is completed in about two months, on its
Web site (www.cdc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   What about groups other than college freshmen? Rosenstein says
the centers are considering new studies of the incidence of
meningococcal infections among summer campers, preparatory school
students, prisoners and other groups.

LET'S MAKE SURE MEXICAN TRUCKS ARE SAFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JACK SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, on a pleasant October day, I was cruising
eastward on Interstate 30 near Greenville in Northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was trouble ahead. A pickup and a larger truck
had collided. I braked like crazy, going from 70 mph to a dead stop
as fast as my little Toyota Corolla would permit.
</P>
<P>
   I barely avoided hitting the rear of an 18-wheeler that also had
braked hard for the accident. But in the next split second, another
18-wheeler _ which I never saw coming _ creamed me from behind.
</P>
<P>
   My 150-pound frame was rocked by a stunningly powerful jolt from
the truck and its cargo of South Texas produce, which together
totaled about 80,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old truck driver emerged from his vehicle literally
shaking, fearful he had killed me. My car was history, the rear
squeezed like an accordion. The trucker, unable to stop in time,
had popped me at 50 mph. I was get-down-on-my-knees grateful to
come out of that accident with an aching neck and back as my only
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that crash, I've been extra-paranoid about big trucks
and their capability of rearranging my innards. I therefore have
read with alarm in recent weeks about the potential for waves of
reportedly unsafe Mexican trucks to begin hauling commercial cargo
throughout the Unites beginning Jan. 1, under provisions of
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has indicated that he will indefinitely delay
this vehicular onslaught from south of the border because of grave
doubts as to whether the trucks are safe. Let's hope he sticks by
that.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks from Mexico are now permitted only in very limited areas
along the U.S.-Mexico border. These trucks should be prevented from
entering other parts of the United States until there is a strong
assurance that they are safe, and only after Congress has
appropriated more money to greatly increase the already thin ranks
of truck safety inspectors along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely have a concern over the safety of the trucks,''
said Bill Munk, a captain in the traffic law enforcement division
of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   There already are safety concerns about the growing numbers of
U.S. trucks on the road. There should be a magnified safety concern
for Mexican trucks, many of which are older and in poorer condition
than the average U.S. truck.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has less rigorous safety standards for both trucks and
drivers than the United States does, according to testimony at a
recent National Transportation Safety Board hearing in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the U.S. inspector general's office states that
fewer than 1 percent of the 3.9 million Mexican trucks that cross
the border each year are inspected for safety. Among Mexican trucks
inspected in 1997 at Texas border checkpoints, nearly half were so
unsafe that they were ordered off the road or back to Mexico, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck safety issues should particularly concern Fort
Worth-Dallas residents and other Texans who frequently drive on
Interstate 35. This road is increasingly congested by all kinds of
vehicles, including escalating numbers of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 3 million additional Mexican trucks might enter the United
States every year under NAFTA. And the most favored route for these
trucks would be up I-35 from Laredo into and-or through Fort
Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Truck traffic on the entire 1,500 miles of I-35 _ from Laredo to
Duluth, Minn. _ is expected to grow by a staggering 85 percent by
2025, according to a new study done by a Kansas City, Mo., firm.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 35W _ the portion that goes through Fort Worth _ will
require 16 lanes to handle the expected growth in urban and truck
traffic in Fort Worth over the next 25 years, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   There's already been a huge increase in commercial truck
traffic. From 1990 to 1997, for example, the number of large trucks
traveling on I-35W at its juncture with Interstate 20 in south Fort
Worth spiraled from 4,700 to 8,837 trucks daily _ a huge 88 percent
increase in just seven years, Texas Department of Transportation
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   There's serious talk now about creating a series of ``truck
byways'' on I-35 _ separate lanes for trucks through busy areas.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, officials in Houston are discussing dividing freeways
into separate truck and car lanes.
</P>
<P>
   There is legislation pending in Congress that could produce
substantial increases in funding for truck safety, including money
to hire more inspectors on the U.S.-Mexico border. That's greatly
needed.
</P>
<P>
   I have great admiration for the skills and stamina of
professional truck drivers in both the United States and Mexico.
And I'm not an opponent of NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   But memories of the jolting blow I suffered 11 years ago from
that 18-wheeler in Northeast Texas are still fresh in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   Let's keep those Mexican trucks down south until we're sure they
won't pose a major safety threat. I don't want to become road kill
in the name of free trade.

   EGYPTAIR _ QUONSET POINT, R.I. _ The Coast Guard kept up a grim
search for survivors in the choppy waters off Nantucket Island
early today as hope dwindled of finding anyone alive from EgyptAir
Flight 990. Navy divers and a salvage ship are expected to arrive
off the Massachusetts coast by tonight to help in the search for
debris. While relatives mourned the 217 passengers and crew
members, investigators began the painstaking task of figuring out
what caused the jetliner to plummet into the sea from 33,000 feet
early Sunday.(Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitutioin).

disproportionate number of those incidents _ 46 _ were major
accidents, killing at least 97 people and causing more than a
quarter of a billion dollars in damages. Among the dead were at
least six civilians, one described by Navy records as an adolescent

INTERVIEWS: A SOURCE OF INFORMATION

 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with TV sports reporter Jim Gray's controversial
interview with Pete Rose, a reader informed me the other day, was
that Gray was glorifying himself rather than attempting to elicit
information from Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The reader couldn't be more correct. If Gray was looking for
information, there were lots of questions he could have asked
baseball's all-time hit leader. The one question that was
guaranteed NOT to elicit information from Rose was the one that
Gray asked. And asked. And asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rose would have happily talked all night long about his many
accomplishments as a ballplayer, but he had no intention of
discussing the gambling allegations that led to his 1989 suspension
from major-league baseball. He had no intention of confessing that
he gambled on baseball games _ the most serious charge against him
_ and he certainly had no intention of apologizing for a
transgression that he insists he didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   That line of questioning was going nowhere _ and Gray surely
knew that from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the reader who responded to my Friday column about
the interview by pointing out the self-promotional nature of Gray's
questions was one of many baseball fans who weren't taken in by
Gray's tough-interviewer shtick. Let's hope that they weren't taken
in by Rose's disingenuous stonewalling, either.
</P>
<P>
   But all this misses an important point. Those of us who have
always believed that the purpose of an interview is to elicit
information are clearly barking up the wrong tree _ at least where
TV interviews are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   As annoying as Gray's approach to the Rose interview may have
been to some viewers, it was hardly an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of a television interview nowadays is confrontation. If
a tidbit of information should happen to emerge amid the verbal
jousting, well, that's an unexpected bonus.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, I seem to recall, when bona fide journalists
such as Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite would conduct
interviews as if they were actually interested in the person they
were interviewing. They wouldn't hesitate to ask tough questions,
if such questions were warranted, but they would ask them in a way
that communicated a certain level of respect for the interviewee _
and for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example. After Frank Sinatra died, CBS reran an
hourlong special from the 1960s in which Cronkite interviewed ol'
Blue Eyes about his life and his music. Cronkite was respectful
without being even slightly obsequious, and Frank was unusually
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to ask Sinatra the inevitable question about
allegations of
</P>
<P>
   mob connections, Cronkite asked it in such a subtle and
dignified way that it didn't offend his subject _ and yet left no
doubt in the viewer's mind that Cronkite was putting Sinatra on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine one of today's TV hotshots confronting Sinatra _
or trying to _ on the mob issue? Sinatra would probably reply with
a string of unprintables and storm off the set. Matt Lauer or
whoever would achieve the electrifying confrontation he was hoping
for, and he'd snare some shrieking headlines in the tabloids _ but
to what benefit for the viewer?
</P>
<P>
   Would we know any more about Sinatra than we did before the
sparks started flying?
</P>
<P>
   The way Cronkite handled the situation, we actually gained some
insight into Sinatra's thoughts and feelings about a highly
sensitive subject.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the new interviewing style is just another product of the
much-discussed decline of civility in our society. Or maybe it has
nothing to do with anything except the frenzy to rack up TV ratings
_ and big ratings most often follow fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's unfortunate that a once civilized and
illuminating format, the TV interview, has degenerated into nothing
more than a daily showcase for self-aggrandizing media stars to
indulge their mammoth egos at the expense of the
information-starved public.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think it's bad now, it's about to get worse. Bryant
Gumbel has a new morning show on CBS.

CAN BRYANT GUMBEL RISE AND SHINE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good Morning America has taken on an embattled atmosphere; this
must be what it's like to be reading a TelePrompTer with a gun to
your head. Co-hosts Diane Sawyer and Charlie Gibson no longer look
like they want to be where they are, and would make a run for it if
there were someplace they could run to.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be NBC's Today, where hosts Katie Couric and Matt
Lauer are sitting awfully pretty, putting up huge ratings with a
show that's as transparently superficial as the new and
bubbleheaded Later Today that it spawned.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it has taken the return of the exceptionally cranky,
annoyingly whiny, pompous, arrogant, humorless Bryant Gumbel to
make us care about morning television again.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing up as the host for the revamped CBS morning show,
which began Monday, Gumbel has become the equivalent of the doomed
lab frog _ a much-dissected specimen for critics and
industry-watchers who consider Gumbel's interviewing skills without
peer but compare his warmth to that of a Minnesota winter.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been a Gumbel fan, blaming in part his low scores
for humility, humanity, tact and grinning banter on a society that,
by and large, still reads overconfidence in African-American men as
how-dare-he arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there is a coldness about Gumbel in person, a feeling
that you're beneath him, a feeling that whatever question you ask
is a dumb one and whatever answer you give is the wrong one. Sad to
say, all that ult seeps through on air.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, time has moved on without him, and not in his favor.
Morning television may have begun as an extension of hard-news
programs, designed to get early risers caught up with the world _ I
mean, Walter Cronkite was the first host of the CBS show in 1954.
That the current CBS morning program ended its run Monday with Mark
McEwen, a weatherman by trade, says something, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the a.m. programs morphed into a news-you-can-use
mixture of information and entertainment, hosted by charming,
breezy, awfully good-looking personalities intent not on informing
us as much as comforting us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ABC's GMA and CBS' Early Show, have even duplicated Today's
``window to the world'' idea, where a glass window looking onto the
studio allows gawkers to wave signs screaming ``We Luv U.'' Morning
television has become nothing more than a New York City attraction,
something to put on the list of tourist things to do, like visiting
the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to why Gumbel, who vowed never to return to
morning television after 15 years of dragging himself out of bed
for Today, would subject himself to such slumming. Gumbel never
seemed all that comfortable at Today, particularly when he had to
venture outside to actually talk to people. (Though Couric seemed
sincerely interested or at least accepting of this part of her job,
you could tell Gumbel couldn't care less.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gumbel says he's returning to ``a wonderful opportunity''
and is royally pumped by the idea of starting an operation from
scratch. But the real reason is that after CBS canned his
prime-time newsmagazine, Public Eye, the network was paying him in
the ballpark of $7 million annually and getting nothing for it.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Gumbel's failure with Public Eye will be
indicative of how he'll be received on the Early Show. Maybe, even
though my theory on the newsmagazine's failure has more to do with
TV's cyclical nature than Gumbel's lack of talent or appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Public Eye aired at a time when viewers were conditioned to
expect salacious, alarmist stories offered up by the PrimeTime
Lives and Dateline NBCs _ not the gumshoe investigative pieces
Bryant delivered. (The show, by the way, received a pair of Peabody
Awards even as it gasped for ratings air.)
</P>
<P>
   But back to the Gumbel likability factor: No one I've sparred
with over Gumbel has ever said the guy is terrible at what he does,
that he's not one of the best at cornering a politician or even
deflating an actor trying to pitch his or her film as serious art.
But rarely has a news figure elicited so much passion, for and
against, as Gumbel. I have to say this doesn't bode well for the
chances of his show catching Good Morning America in the ratings,
let alone Today, which recently completed a staggering 200 weeks at
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel has made the point, accurately, that he was successful on
Today with Jane Pauley, Deborah Norville and Couric, so how could
he be the bad guy? (Early on, Couric, in particular, received good
press reviews, even though her journalistic approach was more like
that of a giggling, cuddly panda bear.) Or was it that these
co-hosts, no matter their weaknesses, help soften Gumbel's glare?
</P>
<P>
   Can Gumbel's Early Show co-host, Jane Clayson, a former ABC news
correspondent and complete unknown, balance Gumbel's perceived
weaknesses? Well, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   But now more than ever, morning television involves being chummy
and accommodating, or occasionally stern and sympathetic. Gumbel
can be all those things, but only if he tries really, really hard.
And I have to wonder whether he sees wake-up television as a whole
as even more cosmetic and superficial than when he left.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sawyer said recently that it troubles her that so much
emphasis was being put on ABC's new digs, as if it doesn't matter
which hosts are on the other side of those windows.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of Today, has been so
adamant about the window trend not being a big deal that he's MADE
it a big deal. Zucker can't deny that Today owes much of its
ratings lead to the gimmick, which is why GMA is now in a 2-story,
glass-encased studio, with an anchor desk overlooking Broadway and
a ground-level area for passersby.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Early Show, it will broadcast from a new $30 million
studio across the street from New York's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its techno-wonder, the best thing about CBS' see-me
window version is that, unlike on Today, the glass can instantly
turn opaque, shutting out the animated movement over the hosts'
shoulders that has now become a ratings necessity.
</P>
<P>
   A Gumbel request, you think?

BUSH ADS ON JUVENILE CRIME CALLED `QUESTIONABLE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush, in a presidential campaign
television ad, claims to have cut juvenile crime 38 percent in
Texas since he has been governor, although the actual reduction in
juvenile arrests has been only about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has dropped 38
percent during the Bush administration, according to the Texas
Department of Public Safety and the Criminal Justice Policy
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's TV spot, one of four that began airing last week in
the key nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire, says that the
Republican front-runner ``cut juvenile crime 38 percent,'' implying
that all categories of juvenile offenses had been markedly reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Budgetary claims made in the same ad were attacked last week by
the campaign of Republican rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy in juvenile crime figures was pointed out by
Texans Against Gun Violence, a gun-control group that was angered
last spring when Bush did not try to win legislative approval of a
bill that would have required criminal background checks of people
purchasing firearms from non-licensed sellers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the fatal high school shootings in Columbine,
Colo., Bush said he supported the bill, but did nothing to try to
get the bill passed before it was killed by a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control group said figures in the campaign commercial
were ``questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   According to crime statistics compiled by the DPS, the number of
juveniles arrested for all types of crimes, violent and nonviolent,
in Texas totaled 178,677 in 1994, the year before Bush took office.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile arrests increased to 182,405 in 1995 and 186,103 in
1996, Bush's first two years in office, before dropping to 181,633
in 1997 and 173,905 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The overall reduction from 1994 to 1998 was almost 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made juvenile crime one of his top priorities during his
1994 campaign, when Texas was suffering through a rash of violence
perpetrated by teenage offenders.
</P>
<P>
   During Bush's first year in office, the Legislature enacted laws
to crack down on juvenile crime, including one measure that lowered
to 14 the age at which most violent juveniles can be tried as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the TV ad's claim was based
on a juvenile arrest rate for violent crimes developed by the
Criminal Justice Policy Council from Department of Public Safety
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Violent crimes include murder, forcible rape, robbery and
aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bush campaign, juvenile arrests for those
crimes dropped from 7,220 in 1994 to 4,649 in 1998. The rate of
violent-crime arrests dropped from 364.7 per 100,000 juveniles in
1994 to 224.2 per 100,000 juveniles in 1998, a 38 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the TV ad was not misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reference is to violent juvenile crime, which was
dramatically increased prior to Bush's administration and has been
reduced under his leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope this group (Texans Against Gun Violence) would
commend Governor Bush for his efforts to reduce juvenile crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ken Blackwell, Forbes' national chairman, said the
same TV ad, which says that Bush has reduced the growth of state
spending in Texas to its lowest level in 40 years, was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said a 35 percent increase in the Texas budget under
Bush was greater than a 21 percent increase in federal spending
under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign defended the budgetary claim. The
governor's office contends the budgetary growth under Bush has been
only 2.7 percent, when adjusted for inflation, population growth
and extra education funds that the state transferred to local
school districts for property tax relief.

GOLF, YOU GOTTA LOVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, Nov. 3)  
(dw) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Th New York Times Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why golf is the greatest game:
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf was invented by Scots, the same people who invented
bagpipes, haggis and skirts for men. In this context, golf makes
perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1457, King James II of Scotland declared the game illegal
because it was taking time away from his army's archery practice.
Golf, then, could be considered one of the first instruments for
world peace.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1567, Mary Queen of Scots was criticized for playing golf
within a few days after the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley.
Golf, therefore, was on the cutting edge of the women's liberation
movement, though ``cutting edge'' is probably not a good choice of
words when talking about Mary Queen of Scots.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first golf balls were leather covers stuffed with chicken
feathers. This is how the word ``McNugget'' originated.
</P>
<P>
   _ After a frustrating day on the links, golfers down through the
ages have mused that golf is ``flog'' spelled backward. No one has
ever sat at a bar after a hard day of running, biking and swimming
and mused that nolhtairt is triathlon spelled backwards.
</P>
<P>
   _ No one plays golf for exercise. Do not gamble with a man who
tells you otherwise because he is not to be trusted. One of the
great golfers of the 1940s was a man named Porky Oliver. A few
years ago, Golf Digest started a campaign to get golfers to walk
instead of driving around in electric carts. The campaign generated
a lot of laughs, much like one of Pat Paulsen's presidential
campaigns. Speaking of laughs, one of the better golfers of the
1930s was a man by the name of Ky Laffoon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just because golf is not played for exercise does not mean you
cannot injure yourself while doing it, thereby giving yourself a
story with which you can bore people at cocktail parties: ``Last
year, I threw my back out by bending over to pick up my 9-iron. I
am feeling much better now, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Thanks, in part, to Tiger Woods, golf has suddenly become
``cool.'' I am not at all sure that this is a good thing, but it
has happened, so I guess we will have to deal with it. Bill Murray
plays golf. Kevin Costner plays golf. Hootie and the Blowfish play
golf. Dan Quayle and Bill Clinton play golf. Like I said, I'm not
at all convinced that this is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Golf courses tend to wind themselves through and around woods
and lakes, which means you're likely to see lots of critters. On
public courses in Manatee and Sarasota counties, I've seen bobcat,
deer, wild turkey, otters, eagles, ospreys, scrub jays, alligators
and, once, a rattlesnake that was about 8-feet long and as big
around in the middle as my thigh. Which is another good thing about
golf carts: You can escape nature quickly if you need to.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rules of golf are ridiculously complex, which is the way
the rules of a superior game should be. When golfers are not
betting or swearing, chances are they're arguing about the rules.
Nobody, with the possible exception of Frank Hannigan, understands
the rules of golf, least of all the touring pros. Paul Azinger was
disqualified from a big tournament in Miami in 1991 because he
violated rule 13-4 _ moving a loose impediment in a hazard _ and
failed to add the two-stroke penalty before signing his scorecard.
A TV viewer caught the infraction and busted Azinger who, needless
to say, was not pleased. Roberto de Vicenzo lost a Masters once
because he incorrectly signed for a score higher than what he
actually shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am such a stupid,'' poor Roberto lamented when he realized
what he had done. De Vicenzo may have lost the Masters, but he
inadvertently uttered one of the greatest golf lines of all time,
right up there with ``It's still your turn'' and ``You might want
to hit a provisional.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many other reasons why golf is the greatest game but
if I say any more it will sound like I'm encouraging you to play
and I certainly wouldn't want to do that. The courses are crowded
enough already.
</P>

IT'S TIME TO POP OPEN A SIX-PACK OF HOLIDAY-GIFT CDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By TODD CAMP, DAVE FERMAN 
And MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music and Christmas go together like eggnog and Christmas,
office parties and Christmas, and credit-card debt and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The record industry has long recognized it, thus timing new
releases and best-of CDs for the last two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's lineup of ``Super Tuesdays'' starts this week and
continues through Nov. 23, with releases by Dr. Dre, Savage Garden,
Mariah Carey, Will Smith, Korn, Beck, The Artist Formerly Known As
Popular and others.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spirit of giving, we're doing reviews of the biggest
of the big, starting with six CDs that hit the shelves Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Carey, ``Rainbow,'' Columbia Records: Among female pop
vocalists, Carey's popularity is unmatched. This time out, though,
she's actually not so bad. More genuinely streetwise than her last
CD, ``Butterfly,'' ``Heartbreaker'' scores some points for the
vocal restraint that Carey lacked in the past, and a few of the
songs _ ``X-Girlfriend'' and ``Did I Do That?'' _ are fairly good.
Three stars (out of five).
</P>
<P>
   Counting Crows, ``This Desert Life,'' DGC: Is there anyone who
has done so well but sounds so miserable as the Crows' lead singer,
Adam Duritz? As usual, he sings about feeling stuck and bored. And
as usual, the band follows through with basic pop/rock.
``Hanginaround'' is the first song here, and it's a) about nothing
more than hanging around your old hometown and being bored, and b)
emblematic of the CD as a whole. Two and a half stars.
</P>
<P>
   Foo Fighters, ``There Is Nothing Left to Lose,'' RCA: This, the
third disc from the ex-Nirvana drummer-turned-guitarist-frontman
Dave Grohl and his ever-changing band, is one of those records that
sounds really good the first few times you hear it. Then you just
don't wanna hear it anymore. Two and a half stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell, ``A Rosie Christmas,'' Columbia Records: Rosie
and Celine. Rosie and Billy Joel. Rosie and Elton. Rosie and Cher.
Rosie and 'N Sync. This CD has 'em all. For an all-purpose pure-pop
seasonal effort, this is actually fairly good, especially when
O'Donnell stays in the background and lets the featured artist do
all the work. Three and a half stars.
</P>
<P>
   Pet Shop Boys, ``Nightlife,'' Sire Records: While plugging PSB's
recent appearance at the Bronco Bowl, lead singer Neil Tennant
described their latest disc as a salute to the night, ``when
people's fears are greater and people's desires are greater.''
Count on plenty of the kind of ethereal electronica you've come to
expect from PSB. It's not as dance-driven as earlier efforts, but,
hey, everyone's gotta grow up sometime. Three and a half stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against the Machine, ``The Battle of Los Angeles,'' Epic:
In 1999, RATM is a rock-music rarity _ a band unafraid to protest
this or question that. On its third disc, nothing, thankfully, has
changed: The quartet continues to successfully mine the same
territory it did with its first two records. More lyrics about
political unrest and injustice, more songs that combine the
abrasiveness of rock with the infectiousness of hip-hop. Four
stars.

SO MUCH FOR PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political scrimmage involves clashing egos more
than competing ideas, even though our elected officials habitually
cloak their motives in lofty principles.
</P>
<P>
   The instinct to look altruistic in public while being privately
selfish is so pervasive that voters who don't pay attention can
easily get confused about why national figures do what they do.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is stiff for the title of opportunist of the
year (or maybe the decade), particularly with Patrick Buchanan
around. But we have a clear winner these days, a senator who is
protecting his rear no matter how the maneuver looks. And it looks
terrible.
</P>
<P>
   He is Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who had the audacity to run for
the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year despite a
conspicuous lack of legislative achievements or national
recognition. He was re-elected to the Senate with a mere
3-percentage-point margin five years ago, and Democrats consider
him among their most vulnerable targets in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   When he could stir up no noticeable GOP interest in a White
House future, he turned on his party in a fury and formally became
an independent in July. He trashed the Republicans as an
unprincipled lot, sharply contrasting his colleagues' views to his
own purely idealistic stands.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday he returned to the Republican fold as though his
summer departure had all had been momentary madness, a mere
bagatelle in the game of life. He had said only a few months ago he
was resigning as a ``decision of conscience,'' but now we are not
to take his conscience seriously.
</P>
<P>
   His new career as an independent wasn't working out. Third party
groups were just as unimpressed by his presidential credentials as
the Republicans. He was having second thoughts. And he had suddenly
been offered the dazzling chance to become chairman of a major
Senate committee _ if he just belonged to the majority party.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders, nervous about the 2000 elections, were shamefully
eager to welcome him back. They need every Republican they can get.
</P>
<P>
   No hurt feelings. Numbers are more important than personal
pride. Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson, who Smith had
complained was ``petty, vindictive and insulting,'' stood
cheerfully at Smith's side during his homecoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. John Chafee, chairman of the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee, unexpectedly died last week, Smith's
seniority put him in line for the post. So much for principle. A
chairmanship dangled, and with it real political power. Temptation
reared its unprincipled head.
</P>
<P>
   Smith undoubtedly wishes we would ignore his parting shot at the
GOP now that he's had a political epiphany. But it is a classic
example of the truth of the old saw that it is never wise to say
``never.'' Things change.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his leaving, Smith gave the Republican Party no quarter. He
accused it of being more concerned with winning elections than
promoting conservative ideals. He professed not to understand why
the GOP is willing to ``walk away from the issues that got us
here'' just to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a party,'' he said in a Senate floor speech.
``Maybe it is a party in the sense of wearing hats and blowing
whistles but it is not a political party that means anything. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The party, to put it bluntly, is hypocritical,'' he thundered.
He called the ``fancy words'' in the platform issued at the GOP
presidential convention every four years ``a charade'' and added,
``I am not going to take part in it any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not come here (to the Senate) to compromise my values to
promote the interests of a political party,'' he said. Repeatedly,
he cited as a chief gripe the party's refusal to punish folks who
won't crusade to overthrow the Supreme Court's ruling that a
limited right to abortion is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He also whined about attacks on his judgment for leaving the
GOP, saying, ``That is what is wrong with politics. It is the ugly.
It is the bad. It is the worst. I am going to stay an independent,
whatever happens in the future. I am the same ingredients. I have
merely redesigned the label.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for the new label. No shelf life. The GOP hasn't
changed since July. There must be some other factor working here.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith were to become chairman of the environmental panel, he
would likely use the post as a pro-business spokesman to try to
undo several decades of progress in conservation. In that role, he
would also attract the kind of big business bucks he could not
raise in his defunct presidential campaign. His re-election coffers
would swell.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity, it's wonderful.

CD SOFTWARE SAID TO GATHER DATA ON USERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   RealNetworks' popular RealJukebox software for playing CDs on
computers surreptitiously monitors the listening habits and certain
other activities of people who use it and continually reports this
information, along with the user's identity, to RealNetworks, said
a security expert who intercepted and examined data generated by
the program.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, company officials acknowledged that
RealJukebox, which can copy music to a user's hard drive and
download it from the Internet as well as play it, gathers
information on what music users are playing and recording.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Richards, RealNetworks' vice president for consumer
products, said the company gathered the information to customize
services for individual users. He and other company officials
insisted that the practice did not violate consumer privacy because
the information was not being stored by RealNetworks nor
distributed to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates and security experts interviewed last week
were unanimous in condemning the practice, calling it a violation
of the privacy of the 13.5 million registered users of RealJukebox,
almost all of whom have given the company their names and e-mail
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company's use of the data is benign, these experts
said, the practice is unacceptable because of the secrecy:
RealNetworks, one of the largest distributors of audio software on
the Internet, does not inform consumers that they are being
identified and monitored by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The information that RealNetworks gathers is extensive.
According to Richard Smith, an independent Internet security
consultant from Brookline, Mass., who discovered RealJukebox's
monitoring functions, each time the program is started on a
computer connected to the Internet, it sends in the following
information to the company: the number of songs stored on the
user's hard drive; the kind of file formats _ RealAudio or MP3 _
the songs are stored in; the quality level of the recordings; the
user's preferred music genre, and the type of portable music
player, if any, that the user has connected to the computer.
Officials at RealNetworks said most of this information was used to
offer music selections to users based on their preferences.
</P>
<P>
   All this information is combined with a personal serial number
known as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, which is assigned
to each user when he or she registers the software.
</P>
<P>
   RealJukebox is distributed only on the Internet, and users are
instructed to register _ giving the company their names, e-mail
addresses and ZIP codes _ when they install the software.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, if RealJukebox is used with its default settings,
it automatically loads each time a CD is inserted in the CD-ROM
drive, and if the computer is connected to the Internet, the title
of the CD is sent, together with the GUID, to RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they have been dazzlingly careless with their treatment
of personally identifiable information or they are completely
disingenuous,'' said Jason Catlett, founder and president of
Junkbusters, a privacy watchdog organization. ``Which is worse? If
they are not disclosing what they are doing, that is
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other CD player programs also assign GUIDs to each copy of
the software. The difference lies in what they do with it.
Microsoft Corp., for example, says that the unique identifier in
its Windows Media Player is used for such things as purchasing
multimedia from a Web site. It is not routed through Microsoft, nor
does Microsoft require users to register, and it does not gather
information through Media Player, said a spokesman for Waggener
Edstrom, a public relations firm that represents Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that RealJukebox is gathering this information is not
mentioned in the long privacy policy the company posts on its Web
site. Nor is it acknowledged in the licensing agreement that users
must approve when installing the program.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-PRIVACY-VIOLATION-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the program. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   David Banisar, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in
Internet law, said that RealNetworks' surveillance practices could
violate various state and federal statutes, including the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act. ``It's a new type of case that hasn't been
brought before,'' he said. ``But I think it's a pretty good case.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar argued that RealJukebox could be considered a ``trojan
horse,'' a legitimate program that contains hidden instructions to
perform illegitimate functions.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said on Friday that the registration procedure
for the free version of RealJukebox did ask for personal
information, including name and e-mail address, but they said that
users could skip the registration and still use the program and
that RealJukebox would stop prompting users to register after five
attempts. Some customers, they said, had stumbled on this fact and
had declined to register.
</P>
<P>
   However, customers who purchase RealJukebox Plus, a version with
enhanced features that RealNetworks sells online for $29.99 with a
money-back guarantee, cannot avoid registering since they must type
in a unique serial number to install the program. And in this case,
RealNetworks also gathers credit card and mailing address
information before it assigns the number.
</P>
<P>
   Richards of RealNetworks said the reason the program tallied the
number of songs a user had recorded was to enable the company to
determine whether the user was ``naive'' or ``sophisticated.'' This
better enables the software to steer sophisticated users toward its
advanced features, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this seemed at odds with a statement by Steve Banfield,
RealNetworks' general manager of consumer products, who said the
company was gathering only ``aggregate usage'' information about
users of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts said the kind of information being gathered by
RealJukebox had the potential to be used to detect copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said that to his knowledge, the company had no plans to
allow information about individual users to be used in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   But Catlett of Junkbusters said that such information could be
subpoenaed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. ``This usage
and tracking information is a way for them to collect intrusive
profiles about people and possibly set up prosecutions for
copyright infringements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like some 250 other such programs, RealJukebox licenses the
right to use a database of CD titles and tracks that is compiled
and maintained by a company called CDDB. This enables the software
to display the title and tracks of a CD moments after it is loaded
into the computer. To do this, the program must send out
information to CDDB every time a user plays a CD.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other popular programs, RealJukebox routes the
information through its own servers and tags it with the GUID,
which uniquely identifies the user.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield said the information went to CDDB via a proxy server, a
computer that masks certain data, to protect the privacy of
RealJukebox users. He said it was his understanding that CDDB
typically collected a user's e-mail addresses each time its
database was queried, but by using a proxy server, he said,
RealNetworks' users were all generically identified as
user(AT)real.com.
</P>
<P>
   Banfield painted RealNetworks as a defender of consumer privacy,
asserting: ``Everyone else who uses that database sends them their
e-mail address. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Greenberg, senior vice president of marketing and business
development for CDDB, said last week that her company ``strongly
encourages but does not require'' e-mail addresses or any other
identifiers that enable the company to tally unique users of its
database. She said the addresses were purged every four days. But
she said it was not fair for RealNetworks' to blame CDDB for
gathering personal information.

IN A REBAPTISM BY CRASH, GUMBEL IS TRUE TO SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in case Bryant Gumbel had forgotten how hectic the world of
morning television can be, he was served up a reminder Monday as he
launched CBS's ``The Early Show,'' on the heels of a major news
story: the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   Between coverage of that tragedy and a timely interview of
President Clinton in the Oval Office, taped on Sunday, Gumbel got
off to a solid start. But there were also a number of missteps, as
Gumbel and cohost Jane Clayson began the long uphill climb toward
the peaks occupied by NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good Morning
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio glitches marred parts of the ``Early Show'' debut, seen
locally on WBZ-Ch. 4. The downside of broadcasting outdoors _ de
rigueur on morning programs these days _ became apparent when
ambulance sirens virtually drowned out the show's closing moments.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of noxious noise, was it really necessary to inflict
Donald Trump on innocent viewers at such an early hour, even if
Trump does own the building where the ``Early Show'' studio is
located? As for Gumbel's interview of Clinton, obviously a booking
coup, it was smoothly professional until the end, when he adopted
an overly chummy tone in pointing out that he belongs to a country
club near the president's future address in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Gumbel generally seemed to regain his stride without
too much difficulty. He did not try to reinvent the morning-TV
wheel, but he offered a few reminders of the unpredictable
qualities that have made him stand out from the pack. A case in
point: Immediately after Mark McEwen's puffy interview of Mel
Gibson, Gumbel bluntly opined to McEwen that Gibson has said
``outrageous things over the years and no one seems to call him on
it. Didn't he say something about the homeless one time?''
</P>
<P>
   The run-up to ``The Early Show'' had been spiced with
controversy. Late last week, the pop diva Mariah Carey bowed out of
a scheduled appearance on ``The Early Show'' and was immediately
booked by the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gumbel has made news by taking a thinly veiled shot
at Couric, his old ``Today'' show partner. In an interview with The
New York Times, he sought to rebut claims that he's hard to work
with by noting that ``somebody who shall remain nameless'' had gone
through five assistants in five years while he has had the same
assistant for two decades. (Coincidentally, when ``The Early Show''
broke for commercials at 7:59 a.m. Monday, Channel 4 broadcast an
ad for a supermarket tabloid that promised to tell ``Why Bryant
Hates Katie.'')
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer Clayson, in her first stint as anchor of a national
show, played it low-key and let her famous partner set the
program's tone. ``You having any fun yet?'' Gumbel teased Clayson
in one of their appearances before a crowd gathered outside the
studio. It was hard to tell. Whereas the female anchors are the
main stars of ``Today'' and ``GMA'' _ Katie Couric and Diane
Sawyer, respectively _ that will clearly not be the case on ``The
Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically enough, the person who seemed most comfortable on the
air was McEwen, former host of the now-defunct ``CBS This
Morning,'' which ``The Early Show'' replaced. McEwen showed energy
and good humor in performing his new duties of delivering weather
reports, doing celebrity interviews, and bantering with the crowd
(which included Clayson's parents). Kevin James, star of CBS's
``King of Queens,'' provided one of the high points by leading a
hilarious tour of the ``Early Show'' neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But the 51-year-old Gumbel _ with his eyeglasses on again, off
again _ was the focus of attention. If you liked him on ``Today,''
where he coanchored from 1982 to 1997, you'll like him on CBS. If
not, you won't. He hasn't changed his style. He has a no-nonsense
way of charging up the atmosphere; his verbal tempo is as rapid as
ever, and he conducts interviews with the same juxtaposition of
long, ornate questions and short, sudden word bursts.
</P>
<P>
   It's his strongest suit, as he showed while quizzing Clinton
about the airline crash, his wife Hillary's Senate campaign, his
``one-line'' description of his own legacy, and the ``line of
demarcation'' that George W. Bush has drawn regarding questions
about past cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Gumbel followed one light moment by asking
Clinton a tough question about whether the president will be a
``liability'' to his wife's campaign. But it was jarring when
Gumbel noted that he belongs to a country club near Chappaqua, the
New York community where the Clintons have bought a home, and that
it is the ``closest golf course'' to that home. Clinton replied:
``I'd be happy to be your guest any time.'' Afterwards, Clayson
gushed to Gumbel: ``Even the president could use a little help from
you.'' Said Gumbel, alluding to golf: ``If I give him two a side,
it could be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, despite his initial reluctance about returning to the
morning beat, Gumbel seemed glad to be back on the air Monday. For
the most part, he seemed to be genuinely enjoying himself. Over the
long term, that just might be bad news for ``Today'' and ``GMA.''

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TO ALLOW ANONYMOUS GUN TIPS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Ga., Pa., Nev.)  (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
the police may stop and frisk someone solely on the basis of an
anonymous, uncorroborated tip that the person is carrying a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, an anonymous tip that describes seemingly innocent
behavior _ standing on a particular corner, for example _ and that
has not been verified by further police work gives the police an
insufficient basis on which to detain someone, even briefly, the
court has ruled. The question in this case is whether the specific
allegation of the presence of a concealed weapon is inherently so
alarming as to tip the constitutional balance in favor of a brief
``investigatory detention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court said no, declaring last year in a 4-2
opinion that it would ``decline the state's invitation to create a
firearm or weapons exception to the limitations on searches and
seizures'' contained in the state and federal constitutions. The
state court barred prosecutors from introducing as evidence the
unlicensed gun a police officer discovered in the pants pocket of a
teen-ager who was wearing a plaid shirt and standing with two other
youths in front of a pawn shop _ details the anonymous caller had
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Florida appealed the decision, arguing that guns are so
dangerous that the police should not have to wait until a suspect
actually brandishes one before moving in. The Fourth Amendment,
which bans unreasonable searches, ``is not to be read in a
vacuum,'' the state said, adding that under these circumstances, a
brief stop and frisk was ``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The state courts are divided over the issue, with a majority,
including those in New York and New Jersey, having ruled that a tip
about a gun justifies an investigatory detention. Last month, the
Supreme Court turned down, without comment, a similar case from
Pennsylvania, in which that state's supreme court suppressed the
narcotics evidence that Philadelphia police found when they
conducted a stop and frisk of a man whom an anonymous caller had
identified as carrying a gun. It was not clear in that case,
Pennsylvania vs. Allen, No. 98-1910, whether a gun was ever found _
a gap in the record that may have led the justices to select the
Florida case instead. The case is Florida vs. J.L., No. 98-1993,
with the defendant being identified only by his initials because of
his age.
</P>
<P>
   The new Supreme Court term is developing as an important one for
the law of police searches. On Tuesday, the justices will hear
arguments in Illinois vs. Wardlow, No. 98-1036, posing the question
of whether a person's unprovoked flight at the sight of an
approaching police officer is such inherently suspicious behavior
as to justify a stop and frisk. And last month, the court agreed to
decide whether a law enforcement agent's action in looking for
drugs by manipulating bus passengers' carry-on luggage with his
hands is a ``search'' that is illegal in the absence of a reason to
be suspicious of a particular passenger. That case is Bond vs.
United States, No. 98-9349.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other developments at the court on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Execution
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the Clinton administration's advice, the court turned
down an appeal by a Nevada man sentenced to death for a double
murder he committed in 1993 at the age of 16. He argued that the
Senate's ratification in 1992 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits capital punishment for
crimes committed before the age of 18, pre-empted Nevada's law and
meant that his execution would violate international law.
</P>
<P>
   When the appeal, filed on behalf of Michael Domingues, reached
the court last spring, the justices sought an opinion from the
administration. In a brief filed last month, the administration
said the juvenile death penalty provision was not binding because
the Senate, at the request of President George Bush, had explicitly
refused to consent to that provision, instead adding the following
language to the treaty: ``That the United States reserves the
right, subject to its constitutional constraints, to impose capital
punishment on any person duly convicted under existing or future
laws permitting the imposition of capital punishment including such
punishment for crimes committed by persons below 18 years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendant's lawyers also argued that, apart from the treaty,
the execution of juveniles has become so disfavored around the
world as to violate basic norms of international law. In addition
to the United States, only Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Saudi
Arabia permit capital punishment for crimes committed by people as
young as 16. The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that such executions
did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishment. The case Monday was Domingues vs. Nevada,
No. 98-8327.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition
</P>
<P>
   The court cleared the way for the United States to extradite a
man wanted in Spain on charges of participating in terrorism on
behalf of Basque separatism in the late 1980s. Ramon Aldasoro
Maguna-Celaya, a Spanish citizen, argued that the evidence against
him had been obtained in Spain by the torture of his alleged
accomplices in the crimes of murder, robbery, and an attack on the
barracks of the Spanish civil guard.
</P>
<P>
   He initially won a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from the
federal District Court in Miami. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Atlanta, overturned that ruling on the ground that the
evidence of torture was too equivocal to cast doubt on the
evidence. The case was Maguna-Celaya vs. Haro, No. 99-5526.
</P>
<P>
   Beachfront Begging
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down a First Amendment challenge to a
regulation in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that prohibits ``soliciting,
begging or panhandling'' along a five-mile strip of Atlantic Ocean
beachfront as well as on a promenade and on the sidewalk in front
of the commercial establishments across Highway A1A from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Smith vs. Fort Lauderdale, No. 99-377, was brought by
the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter as a class
action on behalf of homeless people who beg for money or food along
the beach. The challenge failed both in federal District Court in
Miami and in the 11th Circuit, which agreed with the city that
begging ``adversely impacts tourism.'' The appeals court agreed
with the plaintiffs that begging was a form of speech, and that the
beach area was a public forum in which speech is protected by the
First Amendment. But it said the begging ban was ``narrowly
tailored to serve the city's interest in providing a safe, pleasant
environment and eliminating nuisance activity on the beach,'' and
was therefore constitutionally permissible.

 &HT;    Wal-Mart gives action figure the take-down
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chastened by an Atlanta-area college instructor and
one of its own store managers, Wal-Mart has pulled an action figure
from its shelves: a WWF wrestler who carries around a woman's head.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokesman John Bisio said Monday that complaints from
Sabrena Parton, an assistant professor of communications at
Kennesaw State University, and from the manager of a Wal-Mart store
spurred the company to pull Summer Slam '99: Road Rage Al Snow. The
toy _ modeled after Al Snow, a World Wrestling Federation
competitor who carries a female mannequin's head on a stake _ comes
with a woman's head with the words ``Help Me'' scrawled across her
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our management has decided it is at least a questionable
item,'' Bisio said from the company's Bentonville, Ark.,
headquarters. ``So we are removing it from the shelf, probably
permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Kinnick _ who with Kennesaw State colleague Parton
co-authored an essay in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper
protesting the toy _ was jubilant at news of Wal-Mart's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific to see corporations do the right thing _ and
that a couple of Cobb County moms can make a difference,'' said
Kinnick, 36. ``My sons are 6 and 11: What kind of message would
this toy send them about brutalization of women?''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the toy's manufacturer, Jakks/ Pacific in Malibu,
Calif., and its licenser, the WWF, said they were unfamiliar with
the toy and were not aware of any complaints about it. A spokesman
for Toys R Us, which also sells the toy in stores and on its Web
site, did not return a phone call.

   The 30-year-old Parton, while shopping with her infant daughter,
was shocked to see the toy in a store near her home several weeks
ago. When she pointed it out to the manager, he agreed that the toy
was offensive and filed a joint complaint with Wal-Mart
headquarters. Parton then learned from her students that Snow
actually does carry a woman's head on a stake in televised
wrestling matches, and when he shouts, ``What do you want?'' the
crowd bellows the sexual innuendo, ``Head!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see if this was an adult novelty item, people could
make a choice about whether to buy it,'' Parton said. ``But the
label says it's recommended for children ages 4 and older. That's
terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after her visit, Parton said, the toy was still on
Wal-Mart and Toys R Us shelves, and she and Kinnick decided to
publish their essay in the Sunday edition of the
Journal-Constitution.

FINDING FAME WITTILY, WITH COWARD AS GUIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Spelling in quotes cq.)

<P>
   One evening in March 1961, Noel Coward had dinner with Elaine
Stritch, who was to star in his forthcoming Broadway musical,
``Sail Away.'' Coward, the author, composer, lyricist and director
of the show, wrote in his diary that Ms. Stritch was ``wildly
enthusiastic and very funny'' and would be wonderful in the role of
the cruise director on a British ship. He had also heard that she
was a woman with problems, and added: ``However, I think I shall be
able to manage her. If I can, all will be fine and dandy, if not ze
scenes will be terribile. I must engage an expert understudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, after that passage was read back to Ms. Stritch, she
laughed and said, ``Not only didn't he get an expert understudy,
but I ended up playing both parts.'' When the musical was trying
out in Philadelphia, Coward suddenly merged her character with that
played by the opera singer Jean Fenn. Ms. Stritch became the
romantic leading lady as well as the comic centerpiece of the show.
</P>
<P>
   For her this was a breakthrough. ``That was relatively
revolutionary then,'' she said. ``It used to be that the soprano
got the guy and the funny girl went off with the 11 o'clock number,
laughing hysterically, never to be heard from again.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Stritch drew rapturous reviews on Broadway and
later in London, the musical was not a success. Since then _ in
contrast to other Coward shows _ it has rarely been performed.
Wednesday night, 38 years after the musical's premiere, it is being
staged in a concert version at Weill Recital Hall, with Ms. Stritch
in her original role. Featured in the cast are Marian Seldes,
Gordon Connell, Jane Connell and Alison Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   The production, which is to run through Nov. 13, is in honor of
Coward's centenary. Ms. Stritch said that she was reviving it ``for
Noel,'' and because the show was for her ``one of the most
unbelievable learning experiences.'' It was also a pivotal moment
in her career. Following ``Sail Away,'' she went on to star in
shows by Edward Albee and Stephen Sondheim.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea for a revival of ``Sail Away'' this year began
with Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater.
A great admirer of Coward, he had thought about staging it for one
night at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Bishop had been there on the
closing night of the Broadway production and thought that Ms.
Stritch gave ``the single greatest musical comedy performance I
have ever seen in my life _ and I never forgot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stritch remembered her first meeting with Coward. After
appearing on Broadway in ``Bus Stop'' and singing ``Zip'' in the
1952 revival of ``Pal Joey,'' she was starring in the musical
``Goldilocks'' by Walter and Jean Kerr, with a score by Leroy
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The leading man, Barry Sullivan, had been replaced by Don
Ameche, and the show was in trouble in Philadelphia. After a
performance one night Ms. Stritch was in her dressing room, ``in
tears, drinking a Dewars and soda.'' There was a knock on the door.
``Stritchie,'' said the visitor, inventing a nickname that he would
use all his life. ``It's Noel Coward.'' He took one look at the
distraught actress, excused himself and returned with the Kerrs and
the producer Robert Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stritch recalled, ``He took them into my dressing room and
said, `I'm veddy veddy sorry to tell you that you have no book, no
score, and you have an absolutely brilliant young performer who is
in tears, drinking in her dressing room.'' She said that she
remembered the event as if it were a scene in a play: ``It was the
opposite of being sent to your room for something you didn't do. I
had a champion. And the next thing I know: `Sail Away.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s after sailing on a cruise ship, Coward had
conceived the show as a vehicle for Ethel Merman or Rosalind
Russell. The original title was ``Later Than Spring,'' and a song
by that name was in the musical when the author finally wrote it
more than two decades later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stritch said that when Coward asked her to come to his suite
during the Philadelphia tryout, she fully expected to be fired.
Instead he said he was expanding her role: ``You're going to play
two parts, the part that you're playing now rather well, and you're
going to play Miss Fenn's part.'' She recounted what Alice Pearce,
who was also in the cast, said about Miss Fenn: ``First they cut
her hair, then they cut her part and then they fired her.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress spent the next day, Sunday, learning her new
dialogue and songs (including ``Later Than Spring'' and ``Something
Very Strange''), and, filled with adrenaline, charged onto the
stage for the Monday opening. ``The romantic qualities that I have
in me came alive,'' she said. After the opening, exhausted, she
lost her voice and missed the next performance, but then returned
to the show. When ``Sail Away'' opened in New York, Howard Taubman
of The New York Times said she gave ``what must be the performance
of her career.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical itself had a modest run and then moved to London.
Once again the reviews were favorable for her, less so for Coward _
but the run was somewhat longer. The actress soldiered on and grew
closer to the author. ``Noel was crazy about me because I delivered
for him,'' she said. They became good friends: ``You went out with
Noel and you felt so feminine,'' she said. ``It took me days to
plan a wardrobe. How you wanted him to be proud of you.''
</P>
<P>
   In his company, she also felt obliged to be funny, to match him
wit for wit: ``It was like we had a script going,'' she said. ``He
brought it out of me. It was a challenge, and I meet challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   But her most interesting visit with Coward was when he was not
funny at all. One evening he asked her to have supper with him in
his suite at the Savoy in London. ``It was his birthday,'' she
said, ``and I didn't know it. So I got all emotional about that. We
had a few drinks. Noel tipped a few, but he was so elegant that you
never thought of him as someone who had a problem with alcohol. He
was so meticulous and so beautifully groomed. In my estimation, he
was an alcoholic. It takes one to know one, which is rather
frivolous. But I never met an alcoholic I wasn't crazy about.'' Ms.
Stritch, who is diabetic, stopped drinking some years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner Coward played the piano, then started to cry. ``He
said he had fallen in love and it was an impossible situation,''
Ms. Stritch said. ``As he talked about it, I referred in my mind to
that lyric, `a talent to amuse.' When people who have that quality
get to that line, it's almost hard to go on with the song. It
usually means the other side of the coin is not so good, and I
think that really applied to Noel.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they started talking about death. ``A real fun evening,''
she said. As she recalled, Coward told her there was only one thing
that frightened him about dying: ``I don't think I'm going to be
remembered.'' She thought quickly and said that anyone who had
written ``Brief Encounter'' (the movie based on his play ``Still
Life'') was going to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of time, she said she had no hesitation
about returning to her role in ``Sail Away'': ``I don't feel the
least bit about age. The script is about an older woman with a
younger man. Today it would have to be a love affair between a
woman of, let's say 70, and a man of 50.'' Speaking of age reminded
her of her favorite birthday greeting. When an actress friend of
hers turned 60, Ms. Stritch, who was nine years older, sent her a
telegram: ``Welcome to my decade. I can only stay a minute.''

REAL NETWORKS SAYS IT WILL MAKE SOFTWARE MORE SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real Networks Inc., maker of a popular software program for
playing music on personal computers, has vowed to make changes in
its product after a Boston-area programmer found that the company's
software transmits information about users' music listening habits
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmer and consultant Richard Smith of Brookline,
Mass. found that a Real Networks product called Real Jukebox
collected the information without warning users. As a result, Smith
said, the software could violate the privacy of millions of
Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times published a story about Smith's discovery
Monday morning. By afternoon, Real Networks said it would publish a
software ``patch'' that would prevent Real Jukebox from collecting
the information. This patch will be available for download over the
Internet at http://www.real.com/rjcentral/privacyupdate.html.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect and value the privacy of our users, and we deeply
apologize for doing anything that suggests otherwise,'' said Rob
Glaser, chairman and chief executive of RealNetworks.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people have downloaded free copies of Real Jukebox
over the Internet. The software allows a user to play music CDs on
a desktop computer and copy the CD onto the computer's hard drive,
using the popular MP3 music format. These MP3 files can then be
loaded into portable music players such as Diamond Multimedia's Rio
or Creative Labs' Nomad, which can replay high-fidelity digital
music without using a CD or tape.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Real Jukebox can be connected over the Internet to
CDDB, a database containing listings of millions of CDs. By linking
to CDDB, the computer can generate a listing of every music cut on
the disk. This enables users to make accurate playlists of their
favorite music.
</P>
<P>
   But unbeknownst to users, when they connected Real Jukebox to
CDDB, the software also sent electronic messages to Real Networks.
Among other things, the messages revealed what CD the user was
listening to, what music recordings were stored on the user's hard
drive, and whether the user had a portable MP3 player such as the
Rio connected to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it included a unique serial number, called a GUID,
attached to each copy of Real Jukebox when a user registers the
software. When they register, users are asked for their names and
e-mail addresses, so Real Networks would be in a position to
recognize individual listeners by their GUID numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, whenever anyone used Real Jukebox while connected
to the Internet, it would be possible for Real Networks to know
that user's taste in music. ``They've got your registration
information, so they've got the option of monitoring all the CDs
you listen to,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an industry gadfly, has previously revealed privacy flaws
in Microsoft Corp.'s popular Office software suite. He also took
part in the investigation that tracked down the creator of the
Melissa computer virus that attacked thousands of computers earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks says it was collecting the data to build a general
or ``aggregate'' picture of the listening habits of Real Jukebox
users. ``They were using the GUIDs to aggregate data, not to
identify and monitor individual users' listening habits,'' said
Thomas Frank, Real Networks' chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Aggregate data, in which individual identities are not revealed,
is routinely collected by Internet companies. They use the data to
send targeted advertisements to users, based on their tastes and
interests. But Smith warns sometimes Internet companies take the
concept too far by using targeting methods that reveal the identity
of individual listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, said the Real Jukebox incident
illustrates the need for federal laws to protect the privacy of
Internet users. ``I think we obviously need some rules that are
going to protect the collection of personal information,'' he said.

COURT TO DECIDE WHAT POWER POLICE HAVE WHEN SOMEONE RUNS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a scene played out all the time across
America.
</P>
<P>
   A patrol car cruises a high-crime neighborhood. The police
officer inside scans the streets for signs of trouble. Suddenly, a
young man sees the cop and bolts down an alley. The officer jumps
out of his car and chases him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court could use an Illinois case to make this
common scenario a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the high court will hear arguments on the case,
which raises the question of whether police chasing people because
they run is unconstitutional or if the mere fact that the people _
who otherwise are doing nothing illegal _ flee is enough reason for
officers to suspect that they have committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement groups argue that it's common sense to believe
that people do not run from police unless they have something to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police can't be expected to shrug their shoulders and look the
other way at obvious and highly suspicious behavior,'' said Robert
T. Scully, executive director of the National Association of Police
Organizations, which represents 4,000 law enforcement groups with
more than 220,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Scully said that forbidding police to chase people who run would
make their job ``extremely difficult'' and result in a ``more
dangerous society.''
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights watchdog organizations contend that pursuing
someone just because that person runs violates the Fourth
Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in many neighborhoods, innocent young men may
have good reason to be afraid of the police and feel that they
should get off the street before a cop starts questioning them,''
said Susan Herman, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a
member of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   She said running should not be considered a crime just because
it happens in a high-crime neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in a nice, white suburb, it's all right to go for a jog or
to walk away from police, but in a mostly black, poor city
neighborhood it's not?'' Herman asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois case began on Sept. 9, 1995. Sam Wardlow was
standing in front of a building in an area of Chicago known for its
heavy drug activity when he spotted uniformed officer Timothy Nolan
driving an unmarked police car.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wasn't doing anything unusual or suspicious, Wardlow
began running down the nearest alley. Nolan, seeing Wardlow
fleeing, jumped out of his car and began chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   When he caught Wardlow, Nolan found a white envelope in his
pocket. Inside was a Colt .38 revolver loaded with five bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow, a convicted felon, was not supposed to possess any
weapon; so police charged him with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow was convicted of unlawful possession of a weapon by a
felon and sentenced to two years in prison. But his conviction was
overturned in 1998 by the Illinois Supreme Court, which ruled that
the ``sudden and unprovoked flight of a suspect upon seeing police
... is insufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of involvement
in criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosecution emphasized that Wardlow's flight
occurred in a neighborhood known for heavy drug trafficking, the
court ruled that innocent activity doesn't become sinister simply
because it takes place in a high-crime area.
</P>
<P>
   The court said police need an ``independently suspicious
circumstance'' that, considered in conjunction with the flight,
creates a reasonable inference of a guilty conscience.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois court's decision was based on a 1968 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling _ Terry vs. Ohio _ in which the high court said police
cannot stop and begin questioning citizens unless the officers have
``reasonable suspicion'' that criminal activity is afoot.
</P>
<P>
   But according to legal experts, the Supreme Court has never
spelled out exactly what constitutes suspicious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because each case is different, the court has been reluctant
to lay out what specific actions are suspicious and which aren't,''
said Louis Michael Seidman, a law professor at Georgetown
University here.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, lower courts have been divided over whether the
mere act of fleeing constitutes ``reasonable suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Seidman said the Supreme Court now has the opportunity to end
that dispute. ``The way every cop on the street does his or her job
could change with this decision,'' he said.

`DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE': A SINGLE GIRL TAKES ON THE CALIFORNIA
FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her latest novel, ``Daughter of Fortune,'' Isabel Allende has
abandoned the magical realism that animated her acclaimed first
novel, ``The House of the Spirits'' (1985), to write a conventional
historical drama _ one of those event-crammed sagas featuring a
beautiful, plucky heroine, a mysterious, elusive lover and a
cardboard supporting cast of thousands. The resulting book reads
like a bodice-ripper romance crossed with Judith Krantz, with
plenty of feminist and multicultural seasoning thrown in to update
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine of ``Daughter of Fortune'' is a familiar type: an
orphan taken in by a wealthy family and brought up to be a proper
lady. Her path toward respectability, however, takes an unexpected
detour when she meets a handsome young man with a dangerous sexual
allure. She will fall head over heels in love and embark on a
series of picaresque adventures that will teach her the
consequences and rewards of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In this case that heroine is a pretty young thing named Eliza,
who is discovered one morning in 1832 in a soap crate outside the
door of the Sommers family mansion in Valparaiso, Chile. The lady
of the house, Rose Sommers, promptly adopts the girl as her own
despite the petulant protests of her puritanical brother, Jeremy.
The English-born Rose, we later learn, has had a turbulent past
herself: As a young woman she created a scandal by pursuing a
passionate affair with a married opera singer, and she has spent
the rest of her life as a spinster daydreaming of her long-lost
love.
</P>
<P>
   When Eliza is 16 she meets one of Jeremy's employees, a moody
young man named Joaquin Andieta whose lower-class background makes
him an inappropriate suitor in her family's eyes. Like so many
other socially mismatched couples in Ms. Allende's fiction, the
pair soon fall madly love and begin meeting in secret. By the time
Eliza learns she is pregnant, however, it is too late: Joaquin has
left home to join the flood of Chilean fortune-hunters journeying
north to California in search of gold.
</P>
<P>
   These developments, of course, provide Ms. Allende with a
springboard for a series of crises, melodramas and catastrophes.
Eliza decides to follow Joaquin to California and stows away on a
ship. It's not long before she has become severely ill and suffers
a miscarriage that nearly claims her own life. She is saved by Tao
Chi'en, the ship's cook, who conveniently happens to be a doctor
skilled in the use of Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
   When their ship docks in San Francisco, Eliza tags along after
Tao disguised in men's clothing as his mute and simple-minded
brother. Once she regains her health, she sets off on her own in
search of Joaquin, leaving Tao behind to set up a medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her travels, she sees lynchings, executions and
all the fearsome brutalities of frontier justice. Tao, on his part,
bears witness to race-baiting and gang warfare and decides to
devote himself to rescuing ailing Chinese prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel Ms. Allende uses Eliza's and Tao's
adventures as an excuse for hackneyed historical observations about
the gold rush madness of the 1850s _ much the way she used her
hero's peregrinations in ``The Infinite Plan'' (1993) as an excuse
for cliched remarks on the 1960s. Her descriptions of the greed and
lawlessness of the California frontier feel perfunctory and
secondhand, as do her predictable paeans to the opportunities
afforded immigrants by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vices of gambling, liquor and brothels rule,'' Eliza
declares, ``but for me this land is a blank page; here I can start
life anew and become the person I want.'' Finally, she thinks, she
is ``flying free, like a condor''; she has become one of those
people who are ``masters of their destiny, of the ground they walk
on, of the future, of their own undeniable dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides such sentimental disquisitions on the American dream,
Ms. Allende crams this novel with feminist lamentations on the
deplorable state of women's rights during the 19th century. We're
repeatedly told how Chilean women were ``trained since early
childhood for a life of virtue, faith and abnegation,'' how ``their
fate was a marriage of convenience and motherhood.'' We're told
that Chinese girls, like Tao's sister, who was sold into
prostitution, were treated as worthless chattel, and that Chinese
women were expected to wait on their men like slaves. As for women
on the American frontier, they were forced to work as prostitutes
and barmaids _ save the fortunate few who marry rich men, or
manage, like Eliza, to survive on wit and luck and will.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allende does little to dramatize her feminist sentiments _
she simply hammers her points home with dogmatic asides, and
starkly lighted tableaux of women being abused and taken advantage
by men. Her people are equally simplistic and trite: evil outlaws,
greedy opportunists and whores with hearts of gold. Eliza may
evolve from a hapless victim into an independent-minded dreamer,
but she never becomes more than a paper-doll figure of womanly
survival, just as her friend Tao remains a cut-out symbol of
Eastern mysticism and wisdom: a pair of two-dimensional characters
in a one-dimensional book.

JUSTICES TO REVIEW POLICE SEARCHES BASED ON ANONYMOUS TIPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide under
what circumstances a police officer may rely solely on an anonymous
tip to search a person suspected of engaging in illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The case from Florida addresses the constitutionality of a Miami
police officer's decision to stop and frisk a youngster after an
anonymous tipster told her only that a black boy in a plaid shirt
standing in front of a pawn shop with two friends was carrying a
gun. Officer Carmen Anderson, having no knowledge of the tipster's
motives or credibility, searched the boy, uncovered a concealed gun
and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida judge dismissed the case, saying the officer had
violated the boy's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable
searches by frisking him for no other reason than that she had an
anonymous tip. The judge said the tip provided no specific
information about criminal wrongdoing, and, therefore, Anderson had
insufficient reason to search the boy, referred to in court papers
only as ``J.L.''
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court, however, reinstated the criminal case,
ruling that police officers should have broad authority to conduct
searches based on anonymous tips. Prohibiting officers from
frisking a person suspected of carrying a gun could subject them to
the deadly circumstance of waiting until the suspect actually
brandishes the firearm, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida Supreme Court, agreeing with the trial judge,
threw out the case. The court said the anonymous tip provided only
innocent details of the suspect, such as his race, shirt and
location. The information from the tipster did not establish that
J.L. was engaging in suspicious, criminal behavior and, hence, gave
the officer no reasonable suspicion to conduct a search, the state
court said.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the
state's appeal, Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth said
police would put the public and themselves in danger if they were
constitutionally barred from searching a suspect who they have been
told might be armed. Saying police often approach suspects with
concealed weapons, Butterworth argued that officers should not be
required to adopt the ``less intrusive'' alternative of waiting for
the suspect to remove his weapon before acting.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett Brummer, a Miami public defender representing J.L.,
urged the justices in vain to reject the state's appeal. Brummer
argued that the tip failed to provide sufficient detail of criminal
behavior that would have given the officer constitutional authority
to stop and frisk the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the anonymous tip referred only to innocent,
presently occurring details (sex, race ... location and clothing _
information available to anyone passing the boys on the street),''
Brummer wrote in a brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Florida vs. J.L., by July.
</P>
<P>
   In other high court action, the justices:
</P>
<P>
   _ Agreed to decide by July whether a hospital receiving federal
Medicare funds becomes a federal facility, making crimes committed
within the hospital _ such as theft, embezzlement and bribery _
federal offenses. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled
that federal criminal law applies in such cases;
</P>
<P>
   _ Let stand without comment an 11th Circuit decision upholding
the constitutionality of a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., ordinance
prohibiting ``soliciting, begging or panhandling'' in public
places. Civil libertarians had challenged the ordinance as a
violation of the First Amendment free-speech rights of the
homeless;
</P>
<P>
   _ Refused to disturb a Louisiana appeals court decision that
newspapers can be held liable for violating a state wiretapping law
by accurately reporting information gleaned from an illegal
wiretap. Central Newspapers Inc. challenged the law as a violation
of the newspaper's First Amendment right of freedom of the press.

 &HT;    Fee-banning ballot to be decided today in California; courts may
decide elsewhere
 &HT;    By Andrew Meadows
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fees banks charge for using ATM machines to
withdraw money increasingly are under attack by state governments,
cities _ even the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The latest battleground is San Francisco, where residents will
vote today on a measure to ban the fees. Connecticut, Iowa and
Santa Monica, Calif., already have banned the charges, which
nationwide average $1.27 per transaction, according to a study by
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said last month it is considering abolishing them
on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are fed up with ATM fees and the general trend
in banks to gouge them with fees,'' said Jon Golinger, director of
the California Public Interest Research Group, which is pushing the
fee ban in San Francisco. ``This has become a big consumer issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But not in Georgia _ so far. In the Atlanta area, the charge
averages $1.38, according to Bankrate.com. That is above the
national average, but there is no anti-fee fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Banking Commissioner Steve Bridges said his office has
fielded under 10 complaints regarding ATM fees in the past year. He
said he thinks consumers know they can avoid ATM fees either by
wisely managing their cash or using their own banks' machines.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also say they haven't heard much complaining from
Georgia consumers. However, state Sen. Ed Harbison (D-Columbus),
vice-chairman of the Senate Banking &AMP; Financial Institutions
Committee, said the issue may come up next session.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any evidence of abuse we should look into it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Large interstate banks say no one but Congress can tell them
what to do. As a result, they say, the bans on fees will only
affect state-chartered banks and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ability do state and local entities have to regulate
federally chartered banks?'' said Mathew Street, associate general
counsel for the American Bankers Association. ``I would say none.
As this issue goes forward, it is the question that will be
answered in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks maintain that the fees are simply paying for the growth of
the ATM network, not adding to the bottom line. Consumers should
look at the fees as the cost of conveniently accessing cash, the
banks say.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are often doubled, though, when both banks assess them.
This can cause fees in excess of $3 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., banks
generated $489 billion in revenue 1998. About $20 billion was
fee-based revenue, an 8 percent increase over 1997. Fee-based
revenue includes, but is not limited to, ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have the fees, we wouldn't be able to put out the
number of ATMs we have,'' said Joe Brannen, president and chief
executive officer of the Georgia Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Brannen said the fees simply generate enough revenue to keep the
ATM network growing.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America, SouthTrust Bank and SunTrust Bank all declined
to disclose the costs to set up and maintain an ATM, citing
proprietary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bernhardt, a professor of marketing at Georgia State
University, doesn't entirely buy into the argument that fees simply
cover costs. Bernhardt said banks use fees to supplement revenues
lost because of low interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said fees are rising across the board; from ATM fees to
bounced check fees to stop payment fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is earnings pressure out there, and the banks have got
to make it up in fees,'' Bernhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether state banking law has precedent over
federally chartered banks is just starting to unfold in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Iowa, banks scored a victory when the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said federal law prohibits a state from
regulating national banks' ATM fees. The decision threatens that
state's 8-year-old ban on ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Division of Banking is appealing the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the state Supreme Court is set to make a
decision by the end of the year on that state's ATM fee ban which
was instituted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said a ruling in
favor of the state's ATM fee ban could cause other states to
implement their own measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other states around the country will follow our
lead,'' he said. ``It will send a powerful signal to the banks that
we can stop the fees that have nickled and dimed and, now, dollared
consumers to distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Thorne of Atlanta said he's fed up with fees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Thorne, a SouthTrust customer, was on his lunch hour
when he used a Bank of America ATM despite facing a $3 surcharge;
$1.50 from Bank of America and $1.50 from SouthTrust.
</P>
<P>
   For Thorne, fees are a necessary evil of being able to get money
on an hour lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you don't like, but you have to
put up with it anyway.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FOR A THERAPIST, THE RETURN OF A FREEWHEELING
PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like his wife, the fashion photographer Lillian
Bassman, Paul Himmel isn't much interested in the past.
</P>
<P>
   After he gave up photography in 1969, when he was 55, and became
a psychotherapist, he and Ms. Bassman decided they no longer needed
separate studios in their Upper East Side carriage house. They
rented out the downstairs studio and in the process jettisoned
practically all the fashion work he had done since the mid-1940s
for magazines like Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Also thrown away were
almost all the negatives of the portraits he had taken for Theater
Arts magazine, Himmel recalled in a recent interview at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Ms. Bassman's negatives ended up in the garbage as well.
And after she, too, stopped accepting fashion assignments in the
early 1970s, the couple went off the photography world's radar.
While Ms. Bassman confined her camera work to personal projects,
Himmel built up his psychotherapy practice.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, their photographic past caught up with them.
Martin Harrison, a photography historian and curator from England,
was staying at the Himmel home when he noticed a garbage bag in a
darkroom that had been damaged after a rainstorm. The bag held some
of Ms. Bassman's negatives, most dating from the 1940s and 50s,
that had been salvaged during a house cleaning, put away and
forgotten. Her subsequent, darkly romantic ``reinterpretations'' of
those early images led to exhibitions in the United States and
Europe. Suddenly Ms. Bassman, then in her 70s, was again a hot
fashion photographer.
</P>
<P>
   In quick order, Himmel the photographer was also rediscovered. A
small selection of his noncommercial work was exhibited at the
Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo in 1996. And a retrospective of
his published and personal work opened last month at the James
Danziger Gallery (851 Madison Ave., at 70th St.).
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the show is a book, ``Paul Himmel: Photographs''
(Assouline), that was designed by Ms. Bassman, who began her career
as the assistant to Alexey Brodovitch, the brilliant and
influential art director at Harper's Bazaar in the 1930s, '40s and
'50s. In the introduction, Harrison quotes a Brodovitch reference
to Himmel: ``Of all my proteges, he was the one who best understood
what I meant about movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In her 1992 book, ``The New York School: Photographs 1936-63,''
Jane Livingston highlighted the work of 16 photographers, many of
whom _ among them Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Robert Frank and
Lisette Model _ were influenced by Brodovitch through the rigorous
photography courses he offered. The work of these photographers
flouted the rules of photography and showed a romanticism that had
nothing to do with the heroics of the self but rather with a grainy
film-noir reality that was sometimes brutally frank and yet often
surprisingly lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   Himmel was not among the 16 photographers, but his consistently
freewheeling and experimental work stamps him as a member of this
school. As a young man he aspired to be a dancer, and his work
seemed to have a striking affinity for the kind of choreographed,
evanescent movement that Brodovitch aimed for in a 1945 book of his
own photographs titled ``Ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   What he learned from Brodovitch, Himmel said, was ``that it's OK
not to do what the camera tells you to do. To that extent he was a
tremendous influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmel's interest in photography began in his early teens
because a close friend was an avid photographer. Self-taught, he
photographed friends and the streets of New York. But photography
for him was a hobby, and he earned a master's degree in adolescent
psychology and taught biology. He kept up his amateur photography
and followed the work of Farm Security Administration photographers
like Dorothea Lange.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the mid-'40s, Himmel decided to spend his summer
vacation as a photographer's assistant at the Vogue studios. From
the moment of his first sitting he was hooked. Helping John
Rawlings as he photographed Marlene Dietrich, Himmel recalled,
``really threw me.'' Dietrich was ``extravagantly pleasant _ very
campy,'' he remembers.
</P>
<P>
   At summer's end Himmel gave up teaching and, like many aspiring
young photographers, took Brodovitch's ``Graphic Journalism''
course. ``He liked what I did journalistically,'' said Himmel. ``So
he gave me an assignment for Harper's Bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmel quickly became a fashion photographer who didn't simply
pose models as static, rarefied creatures on city streets, but made
them part of the streetscape. His mastery of movement in street
photography gave these fashion pictures a special immediacy and
vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he did a test series of models mixed into the crowds at
the Grand Central Terminal concourse. Photographed from above, the
models _ who were directed to stand still _ were transformed into
islands of tranquillity among the swirling, milling, dizzying,
abstracted crowds. These are the only fashion negatives Himmel has
saved, and photographs made from them are in the Danziger show and
accompanying book.
</P>
<P>
   Himmel's work appeared in the country's major illustrated
magazines. Three of his pictures were included in the monumental
1955 ``Family of Man'' exhibition organized by Edward Steichen at
the Museum of Modern Art. Among them was his lyrical portrait of a
pregnant Ms. Bassman, her dreamy profile contrasted with a
profusion of bold silhouettes of potted plants.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few years of doing fashion photography, Himmel grew
increasingly bored with it. ``I was always interested in the
extremes of it, the limits of where it could go,'' he explained.
``I was never interested in straight fashion photography, and of
course later on what they wanted was the straight stuff.'' By 1950
fashion editors were also losing interest in his photojournalistic
style, preferring more conventional poses.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Himmel had pursued his own projects: photographing
boxers in a gym, people at a horse show, circus performers and
ballet dancers (published as ``Ballet in Action'' in 1954). In his
circus series is an extraordinary example of Himmel's ability to
fool the camera into showing a rope twirler seemingly enveloped in
a big undulating bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Himmel also experimented with attenuated silhouettes of nudes.
In his final photographic series, he made strikingly abstract color
prints from black-and-white negatives, using color photographic
paper and solarizing the images with colored light.
</P>
<P>
   But the more Himmel experimented, the less commercial work came
his way. Finally he simply switched careers.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have any regrets? ``What kills me now,'' he said, ``is I
didn't save the theater personalities' pictures. I wish I had. The
only picture I have left of that is Bert Lahr.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have any plans to pick up the camera again?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go back to photography,'' he replied, ``I would
have to go back with an idea. I haven't thought about that
seriously. To the degree that I have, I haven't come up with
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmel remains a psychotherapist. In his spare time he has been
producing meticulous three-dimensional needlepoint wall art. He has
also been creating assemblages _ small, still, delicately
surrealistic worlds out of found objects. One includes his
photographs of attenuated nudes.

 &HT;    Competition, interest rates cutting into USFS
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Increased competition may have investors in U.S.
Franchise Systems sleeping a bit uncomfortably in the near future,
President Mike Leven warned Monday. At the same time, the company
reported that third quarter earnings increased substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Leven said that while franchise sales, unit growth and brand
awareness have been strong over the last few months ``we are not
impervious to the increasingly downward trends in the lodging
industry''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company has been hit by increased competition in the
mid- to low-priced market and will be affected by higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The company also might have to take a write-down on a $15
million loan to one of its hotel ownership groups and lose the
interest income. Should that happen, it would mean a 9 cents a
share hit to 2000 earnings, Leven said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the company expected to earn between 70 cents and 75
cents a share in 2000. Now, he said, the company will not ``even be
close to that that number.''
</P>
<P>
   The warnings came as Atlanta-based USFS reported third quarter
net income of $3 million, or 15 cents a share, compared to
$109,000, or 1 cent per share, for the same period a year earlier.
Net income from continuing operations was 16 cents a share, up from
1 cent a share for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That was in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose 108 percent to $7 million, compared
to $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with our earnings,'' said Leven. ``Basically, I
think what happened is that we failed to look at some things that
were going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said openings of its successful Microtel Inn &AMP;
Suites brand fell in the third quarter. The company had expected to
open 20 new Microtel properties, but opened only 12. Leven said
overhead also increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that created an environment in which we have to say we
can't make the earnings next year on the base business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is ranked among the top hotel franchise companies
with its Microtel Inn &AMP; Suites, Hawthorn Suites and Best Inns &AMP;
Suites Brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a small company doing the best we can with what we
have,'' he said. ``I think the industry is going to be softer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Woodworth, a vice president with PKF Consulting in Atlanta,
said he expects the lodging market to be flat ``with little or no
growth in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The company ``indicated caution,'' said John Rohs, an analyst
with Schroder Securities in New York. And that spooked some
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what scared most investors,'' he said. ``It makes it
sound like this is not the kind of problem that is going to get
solved in one quarter and it is going to take a little time to work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohs said the company's properties are in a highly competitive
segment of the lodging industry _ the mid- and lower-priced market.
As a result, USFS's outlook is ``murky'' in the short term, but
``the long-term outlook is positive,'' Rohs said. ``The have a
particularly good product with Microtel and a good management
team.''

   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ (Exclusive) The question of China's
entry into the World Trade Organization may not be dead for this
year, officials say. The U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, announced Monday that she expected formal negotiations
with China to resume this month on its entry into the World Trade
Organization, and some officials said she may travel to China
before a trade meeting in Seattle at the end of the month if there
is enough progress that President Clinton could announce a deal in
Seattle. But in public, Ms. Barshefsky _ once burned when the
president turned down her advice to take the April deal _ is being
quite cautious. ``We have got to see,'' she said Monday, when asked
about the possibility of a deal. ``There is quite a bit of work to
go.'' By David E. Sanger.

the city's monthly payments to the museum and end his campaign to
evict the museum and remove its Board of Trustees. By David

   ONLINE-ADS (Undated) _ Convinced that this yuletide season will

expensive war to bring their names to consumers through TV
advertising. There is little evidence that such exposure in a
crowded market will prove to be a cost efficient way to attract new
customers. In fact, Amazon.com recently said it would triple
holiday ad spending, a move that gave stock analysts pause and sent
its stock price plunging. The upstarts may be buying air time at
the expense of other important components, such as customer
service, inventory, and simple Web design. By Leslie Kaufman.

NEW DELHI GOVERNMENT CRITICIZED FOR SLOW RESPONSE TO CYCLONE
DEVASTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The eastern state of Orissa remained largely
cut off from the rest of India on Monday, four days after the most
ferocious cyclone in recent memory tore through coastal areas with
160 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   Army rescue teams have been unable to reach the regions most
devastated by Friday's storm. Flood waters are still moving in
torrents across many roads. Where the ground is higher and the
pavement dry, tens of thousands of refugees have set up camp,
sleeping on the blacktop.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people remain homeless, untold numbers are
dead, and so many are hungry that sporadic food riots have broken
out.
</P>
<P>
   Orissa's capital, Bhubaneshwar, has the look of a place that was
destroyed by the stomping of a malign giant, with 90 percent of its
trees uprooted, billboards torn to pieces, and most electric and
telephone lines snapped and frayed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 94 bodies have been recovered, state officials in
Bhubaneshwar said Monday, but the death toll is expected to go far
higher, perhaps into the thousands. Most of the affected areas are
backward villages difficult to get to even under the best of
circumstances. It may be a week or more before they are reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens of thousands of people are marooned, and we have lost
contact with hundreds and hundreds of villages,'' S.T. Misra,
Orissa's deputy secretary in charge of relief operations, said in
an interview from one of the state capital's few working phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to establish communications with the various district
headquarters by tomorrow, but those villages that are just a
collection of mud huts, I would suppose they have been washed
away,'' Misra said. ``The death toll may go into the thousands, but
that is just a guess. The simple truth is that no one can yet begin
to calculate the extent of the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Orissa, with a population of 35 million, is one of India's
poorest states. The districts that appear to be the worst hit are
Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Cuttack and Jajpur, Misra said.
</P>
<P>
   The army has begun the arduous task of clearing roadways of
felled trees. Air force helicopters have begun air-dropping dried
food and fresh water. Naval ships carrying medicines, potable water
and emergency generators have positioned themselves near the port
of Paradip, but will not be able to enter until the channel is
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal for help has been put out by the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, asking donors
for more than $3.3 million for emergency relief. The organization
sent an assessment team into the area Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation is extensive, even more than we could have
imagined,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, the head of the regional
delegation for South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For days, entire families have squatted under thin sheets of
plastic without food or drinking water. Some of the hungry have
attacked trucks carrying emergency supplies. Buses have been
stopped and ransacked as people searched for food. A helicopter
that had carried Defense Minister George Fernandes for a first-hand
look at the damage was beset at one point by a protesting mob.
</P>
<P>
   Monday brought some good news, however: a respite from the rain.
The storm has moved further inland, and its winds have decreased to
40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials have called the storm ``a national calamity''
and sanctioned an immediate infusion of $70 million in aid. But
Monday morning many Indian newspapers faulted the New Delhi
government for its continuing lack of preparedness in a country
challenged by nature with such a continuing succession of
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it is only too well known, those who are
entrusted with this task _ especially if they work for government
departments _ do not respond with a sense of urgency and are
insensitive to the travails of those who badly need their help,''
read an editorial in The Hindu, a usually temperate daily.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of India said: ``From all accounts, there are
contingency plans; a disaster management scheme has been devised
for the very purpose of dealing with cyclones. However, there is
the same desperation, the same abject surrender each time nature
vents her fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's cyclone was the second to hit Orissa within a two
weeks. It churned off the coast for several days, gathering
strength from the sea before racing to shore. While some
meteorologists had urged people to evacuate low areas, others
played down the seriousness of the danger.

 &HT;    Military air shows: Public's right to see or tragedy-in-waiting?
 &HT;    By Russell Carollo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The F-18 jet fighter crash that killed two
members of the Navy's Blue Angels demonstration team in Georgia
last week is among more than 100 aviation incidents linked to
military air shows since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Never-before-released computer records show that 42 of those
incidents were major accidents that killed at least 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were at least six civilians, one described by
Navy records as an adolescent ejected from a parked aircraft at an
airshow in Pennsylvania in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The military argues that air shows allow the public to see what
it is paying for and serve as a recruiting tool. Critics say the
price may be too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we're not considering stopping our participation
in air shows,'' Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said on
Monday. ``Our flying teams are the best of the best. Accidents are
extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Air shows, Campbell said, are one way the military communicates
directly with the public, showing people how their tax dollars are
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They serve to inspire participation and encourage young men
and women to serve in the defense establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer records came from the safety centers for the Army,
Air Force and Navy, which also investigates Marine Corps accidents.
The Dayton Daily News newspaper obtained the records through the
federal Freedom of Information Act during an 18-month examination
of military aviation safety.
</P>
<P>
   The crash involving the Blue Angels occurred as the team
prepared for a show at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the crash were Lt. Cmdr. Kieron O'Connor of
Burtonsville, Md., who joined the Blue Angels in September 1998,
and Lt. Kevin Colling of Castle Rock, Colo., who joined the team in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy canceled a show at Moody Air Force Base scheduled for
last weekend and another show in Jacksonville, Fla., scheduled for
this coming weekend. A show is still scheduled at Naval Air Station
Pensacola, Fla., scheduled for the weekend of Nov. 12-13.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Naval Safety Center's computer database, the
accident in Georgia was among 36 aviation incidents involving the
Blue Angels since 1980, and it was the first fatal accident
involving the team since 1985, when the team was involved in a
mid-air collision at Niagara Falls, N.Y., killing a 32-year-old
lieutenant commander.
</P>
<P>
   Those 36 incidents occurred between April 1980 and March 1998,
the date the Daily News records were updated, and accounted for two
deaths, eight injuries and $51.5 million in damages _ not counting
the latest accident.
</P>
<P>
   In all, eight people were killed in 16 major accidents involving
the Blue Angels since 1972, Col. Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1996, a Blue Angels F-18A Hornet headed for Traverse
City, Mich., sustained more than $75,000 in damage near
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton when a refueling
receptacle cover was sucked into an engine.
</P>
<P>
   In all three services, there were at least 105 aviation
incidents, ranging in severity from minor emergencies to fatal
crashes, linked to air shows, rehearsals or demonstration teams.
Those accidents cost at least $284 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News records end in early 1998 and vary somewhat among
the services, which keep separate databases. Army and Air Force
records date back to 1972, but Navy records begin eight years
later, in 1980. In addition, Army records are incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The Army had the highest number of dead, 68. Forty-six of those
were killed in a single accident on Sept. 11, 1982, in Mannheim,
West Germany. Six others were killed and 16 injured in a single
crash at Fort Campbell, Ken., on June 18, 1996, when two UH-60
Blackhawk helicopters collided during a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen others were killed in incidents the Army described as
``demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy accounted for the largest number of incidents with 60,
including 13 major accidents in which 17 people were killed. Three
others were identified as missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force accounted for the largest dollar loss, $134.5
million. Much of that came from a single crash, on Sept. 14, 1997,
when an F-117 Stealth Fighter crashed into an apartment complex in
Maryland. The pilot ejected, but the plane was destroyed. The cost
was estimated at $51.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Campbell said the Air Force Thunderbirds accounted for 10
deaths since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Following that accident, Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was concerned about
the cost of risking front line aircraft in air demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those 117s are about $100 million a copy if you look at total
program costs,'' he said during a hearing. ``That's a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious Air Force accident on its safety center
database came on March 13, 1987, when a KC-135 tanker crashed at
Fairchild Air Force Base, Wash., killing seven people. The plane
was practicing a routine for a newly formed air demonstration team
called the Thunderhawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Thunderhawks, planned to be the former Strategic Air
Command's official air demonstration team, never flew in an air
show and were disbanded following the fatal crash.

   Asked if continuing the air shows was worth the death toll, Col.
Campbell said, ``We don't think anything is worth loss of life.
Every accident is preventable. Accidents occur whether you fly
training missions or demonstration missions.

   ``But that doesn't mean when accidents happen we're going to
stop what we're doing.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHEN TV CHANGED AMERICAN POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wis., Ala.)  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(With TV-CENTURY)

   On a sidewalk in the shopping district of a small Wisconsin
town, Hubert H. Humphrey stops passers-by and hands out business
cards. ``Good to meet you,'' he says over and over. ``I hope you'll
be at the election booth tomorrow, April 5. Let me give you one of
my cards.'' Those cards might as well say ``Willy Loman for
President.'' With his baggy overcoat and his hat at an angle that
should look jaunty but only manages to seem sad, Humphrey looks
desperately old-fashioned compared with the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever John F. Kennedy, his opponent in this 1960 presidential
primary, steps out of his car, young women rush at him to get
autographs. The camera follows Kennedy as he wades into an
energetic and grasping crowd in the kind of scene that has become
commonplace for rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that primary, the Kennedy-Nixon debates allowed
voters to see how Kennedy and the camera adored each other, and
television permanently transformed American politics. But the
visual evidence of that immense cultural change is all here,
captured months earlier in Robert Drew's ``Primary.''
</P>
<P>
   A restored version of that groundbreaking cinema verite work
begins ``A Century of Reality,'' a monthlong series on Turner
Classic Movies. The documentaries range from chestnuts to oddities,
but by far the most revealing are Tuesday night's political
documentaries by Drew. Three years after ``Primary,'' with Kennedy
in the White House, ``Crisis'' eavesdropped as Robert F. Kennedy,
the attorney general, forced a defiant Gov. George C. Wallace to
allow black students to enroll at the University of Alabama.
Sophisticated and influential in themselves, these films are also
fascinating documents that chart how the camera has affected
politics and government in the last four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Primary'' will be shown in a restored version, its
sound is shaky and its black-and-white photography seems quaint.
But these dated elements seem at odds with the film's modern feel,
which flows from its camera-savvy subjects and sleek editing style.
At a rally full of men and women who look as if they have stepped
out of a 1950s Sears catalog, all the Kennedys seem impossibly
glamorous and young. Jacqueline Kennedy shyly speaks a single line
of Polish and the flattered crowd goes crazy. Meanwhile, Drew's
camera closes in as she nervously twiddles the fingers of her
white-gloved hands behind her back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Robert Kennedy steps on stage to charm voters with wry
humor about his enormous extended family. And the candidate himself
_ warm, commanding, ever so slightly aloof _ exudes Hollywood-style
magnetism. The idea of politics as performance, so taken for
granted now, started in rooms like this.
</P>
<P>
   So did much of what we know as cinema verite. The photographers
on ``Primary'' included three of the most dynamic documentary
filmmakers of the last decades: Richard Leacock, Albert Maysles and
D.A. Pennebaker. There is a direct line, in fact, from ``Primary''
and ``Crisis'' to ``The War Room,'' Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus'
engrossing and demystifying look behind the scenes at the 1992
Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crisis,'' filmed in June 1963, captures Robert Kennedy having
breakfast at home with his children and meeting with his brother at
the White House. He knew that Wallace intended to stand on the
university steps, blocking the two black students when they arrived
to register. The Kennedys discuss if and when to call out the
National Guard. If troops were put on alert in advance, the
Kennedys would look like the heavies; but if they waited it would
take another day to mobilize the soldiers and the students would
have to walk away in temporary defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And even with troops standing by, there would be strategic
problems. Robert Kennedy is heard on the phone talking to a
National Guard officer, planning how to move Wallace physically.
``I'm not very much in favor of picking the governor up,'' Kennedy
says. It would be better ``if you had enough people just to push
him aside.'' He doesn't need to add that hauling off a governor
would not have created a picture that generated support for the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the acute sense of image-making that Drew and his
subjects share, there are moments in ``Crisis'' that are jolting in
this age of instant communication and 24-hour television news.
Robert Kennedy stayed in Washington while a deputy attorney
general, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, accompanied the students up the
university steps and confronted Wallace. Although dozens of
television cameras were filming the scene, the man in charge got
his minute-by-minute information by phone. ``Is he getting to talk
to the governor?'' Kennedy asks anxiously into the speakerphone on
his desk. Today, every television viewer in the country could
witness such a confrontation while it was unfolding on CNN, MSNBC
and Fox News. As that political era fades into history, that change
is the one that makes ``Crisis'' seem most like a message from the
past.

PUERTO RICO AND PENTAGON FAIL TO FIND COMPROMISE ON TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior officials from Puerto Rico and the Pentagon
ended emergency talks Monday without finding a compromise solution
to the six-month stalemate over whether the Navy can use a target
range on the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The setback means that President Clinton now faces a politically
delicate decision over whether to order resumption of live fire
combat training on the target range, despite the objections of
Puerto Rico's political leaders, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Hispanic
lawmakers in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says it needs a presidential go-ahead by mid-November
if a Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS
Dwight D. Eisenhower is to train on Vieques before sailing for the
Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine
pilot mistakenly bombed a rangvation post, killing a Puerto
Rican security guard working for the Navy and injuring four other
civilians working on the range.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, a Democrat with
close ties to Gore and Mrs. Clinton, adamantly ruled out further
discussions with the Pentagon unless the Navy first agrees to
permanently end 58 years of bombing on an island that is home to
more than 9,300 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, reiterating a hard-line at the outset of two days of
meetings in the nation's capital including one with Mrs. Clinton,
said his administration would immediately seek a federal court
injunction to stop any resumption of Navy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain very hopeful that the president will come down with a
decision that will prevent future bombing,'' Rossello told
reporters. ``But again, the courts are available for an injunction
basically preventing further bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-ditch effort to find a compromise took place during a
90- minute meeting at the Pentagon between the governor's chief of
staff, Angel Morey, and two Pentagon officials _ Rudy deLeon,
undersecretary of defense for personnel, and Robert Tyrer, chief of
staff for Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, later
said that no decisions were made and that no follow-up meetings
were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Morey said that neither the Pentagon nor Puerto Rico offered
concessions to reach a compromise. Morey said he emphasized that
Puerto Rico's demand that the Navy withdraw from Vieques was a
matter of principle rather than a matter of negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's position remains: ``Not one more bomb _ not now,
not Dec. 1, not at the end of the year, not in the new
millennium,'' Morey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They explained their needs and I explained our position,'' he
continued. ``If they can find a way to reconcile their needs with
our position, then we are moving forward in this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Morey and Rossello said no further talks with the Pentagon
or the Navy will be scheduled because the Navy has not accepted
Puerto Rico's demands for a permanent end to bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., in
a bid to pressure the White House, says that he plans to convene an
emergency session of the Senate Armed Services Committee if the
White House decides to deploy the Eisenhower battle group without
live fire training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Warner introduced a sense of the Senate resolution last Friday
demanding that Clinton not deploy the Eisenhower battle group until
he reviews the combat readiness of the armada and notifies Congress
that the forces are ``free of serious deficiencies in major warfare
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton awaits recommendations from his defense secretary on the
Navy's future use of Vieques. Morey said he has asked the White
House for a face-to-face meeting with the president before a final
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Cohen received recommendations from a four-member
panel appointed at the request of the president to look for a
compromise. The Pentagon review panel recommended reducing live
fire combat training on Vieques from 180 days a year to 130 days a
year, during a five-year phase out of Navy operations on the
33,000-acre island.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said Monday that Gore has told him that he supports
Puerto Rico's demands for cessation of bombardment and Navy
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to the conclusion that the Navy should leave Vieques
and look for other sites for their training,'' said Rossello,
Gore's fund raising chief in Puerto Rico. Rossello said he would
welcome a public statement by Gore, as Bradley has made.

IN EAST TIMOR, BUILDING A NATION FROM THE BASICS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ Even before the recent violence that
destroyed most of East Timor's buildings, the creation of a newly
independent society and economy here presented a harsh case study
in development from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a spokesman for the World Bank compares the task to landing
on a desert island and trying to build a nation from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from roads, ports, airfields and power plants, East Timor
has almost none of the basic elements of a functioning nation: no
budget or banking system, no judiciary or law enforcement, no civil
service or government institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Its educational, health care, trade and agriculture systems are
a shambles. Most of its people are subsistence farmers; most are
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-member assessment team led by the World Bank received an
immediate initiation into the problems ahead when it arrived here
last week and began its work from a tent city without electricity
or running water. The food is military rations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extremely unusual conditions for us,'' said the
director of the mission, Klaus Rohland, who runs the bank's
operations in the Pacific Islands.
</P>
<P>
   He said his team's task _ in advance of an international donors'
conference next month _ is urgent and delicate.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited window of time before international attention
moves elsewhere, he said, funds must be raised soon. But if the
team's efforts are not carefully concentrated, they could do as
much harm as good, skewing East Timor's economy and creating social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Timor can expect huge international interest maybe for
the next three to four years,'' he said. ``After that it's yet
another Pacific island. So whatever money comes in now, if it is
not spent properly it's wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without these potential problems, Rohland said, the
elements of a functioning society are a complex Rubik's Cube of
interrelated institutions: ``No education system without
infrastructure, no civil service without development of the private
sector: They are all linked.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the pitfalls, he said, was the inevitable
economic distortion of the huge international assistance program
that was being established, creating a voracious service economy
that would eventually shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Since Indonesia annexed the former Portuguese colony as its 27th
province in 1976, East Timor has been administered by Indonesia,
with Indonesians running everything from schools to power plants.
</P>
<P>
   With its formal grant of independence last week, East Timor
faces the challenge of managing its own affairs for the first time
since it became a colony more than 400 years ago. It is utterly
unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Under a U.N. administration that will run East Timor during a
transition period of two or three years, the small land of 800,000
people will be home to thousands of foreign officials, aid workers
and peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will this inflate the economy, Rohland said, but also
will create a temporary demand for jobs designed to support the
foreign workers, stimulating urban migration.
</P>
<P>
   This would shift the focus from East Timor's long-term economic
foundation, agriculture, and could leave the capital with a
potentially dangerous population of unemployed young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can already see all these young men running around in the
city center,'' Rohland said. ``The priority is to get them back to
the villages where the real work needs to be done. It's a dangerous
mixture: a huge number of unemployed young people, a total
destruction of the social fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of destruction by military-backed militias in
September, after East Timor's vote for independence on Aug. 30,
pushed the territory back to ground zero.
</P>
<P>
   But it was already the poorest of Indonesia's provinces, said
Sarah Cliffe, an economist for the World Bank who is a member of
the assessment team.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's investment budget here was almost double per capita
that of other provinces, she said, but the ``development outcome''
was at the bottom _ the fewest schools, clinics and other basic
services per person of any province.
</P>
<P>
   That discrepancy could support a widespread analysis that much
of Indonesia's spending here went to support its huge military
presence, which at one point reached 24,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, East Timor's very poverty is the most hopeful
factor that will contribute to the territory's eventual recovery,
Rohland said. Ninety percent of its economy has been based on
agriculture, particularly the plantations that produce coffee, the
territory's leading export.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that makes me feel more optimistic,'' he
said. ``This is not a developed economy that has been bombed back
to the Stone Age. It was already a poor country.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the World Bank team here, Graham Barrett, said
the bank would set up a trust fund for donors to which it would
contribute up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The money will come in grants, not loans, to the fledgling
nation, he said. ``This is a country that has no need of an instant
debt load.''

OF CAMERAS AND CONSEQUENCES AT A WOMEN'S PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the course of a somewhat strained exchange with the chief
medical officer at the Valley State Prison for Women in central
California, Ted Koppel announces that for the moment he is acting
as an advocate for the prisoners who have been complaining to him
about their medical care.
</P>
<P>
   That should startle few viewers of ``Crime and Punishment,'' a
weeklong series about the largest women's prison in the United
States, which began on Friday on ``Nightline.'' The sympathetic
hearing Koppel gives the prisoners' allegations is fairly typical
of television's approach to a perennial subject and is in marked
contrast to the skepticism with which he treats the responses of
Dr. Anthony Di Domenico.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Di Domenico is asking for it. In countering charges
that the prison's medical staff is doing unnecessary cervical
examinations, he suggests that many inmates ``deal in a great deal
of fiction'' and that some ``like to be examined _ it's the only
male contact they get.'' Even after Koppel cautions him, ``That's
an extraordinary thing to say,'' the doctor repeats that ``maybe
there's some gratification on their part from the exam.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the interview, Di Domenico's boss, Dr. Susan
Steinberg, flew down from Sacramento to meet with Koppel, and
before you could say pre-emptive protection, Di Domenico, who had
lately been described by Steinberg as ``a very dedicated,
compassionate physician,'' was reassigned to a job in which he
would have no contact with patients. She assured Koppel that ``this
doctor will never have patient care again in the Department of
Correction.''
</P>
<P>
   What do we have here? Hard-hitting journalism or an example of
bureaucratic timidity confronted with the power of television?
Although Di Domenico may have made few friends with his benighted
comments about the women in his care, and he assuredly committed
the television crime of insensitivity, Koppel provided no evidence
to support the inmates' stories of medical misdemeanors, notably
unnecessary cervical examinations. (``It doesn't matter what you go
in there for,'' one woman says, ``he wants to give you a PAP
smear.'') Steinberg reports that in her year and a half in her job,
she has never received a complaint from Valley State about
physicians' doing inappropriate pelvic examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it beyond belief that prisoners (and their lawyers) might
lie about this or other complaints to which Koppel gives much
attention and his own implied backing. When it comes to prisoner
behavior, Koppel, the inmates' advocate, plays psychologist: ``It's
easy for frustration to turn to anger and for anger to evolve into
psychosis in a place like this.'' An inmate in a maximum-security
section puts the situation in straighter language: ``There's an
awful lot of disrespectful people housed back here.''
</P>
<P>
   In a homily that sets the tone for his report, Koppel says:
``The women here have been sentenced to forfeit their freedom, not
their dignity or their self-respect or their health.'' Nobody is
likely to quarrel with that. But he does little to explore what
``dignity'' and ``self-respect'' mean in prison. He calls strip
searches, vividly described here, ``the final indignity,'' but the
program notes how difficult it is for warders to control prisoners'
access to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel promises one admitted addict _ who confesses, ``I love
drugs, and life doesn't really matter to me without it'' _ help in
getting a job, and she pledges in a teary scene that she will
reform. It's effective television, but Koppel, a journalist after
all, not a social worker, does not exert himself in evaluating the
credibility of inmates' accounts of their records or their
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that some of the women have committed ``quite
horrific crimes'' and quotes a correction officer on the duty to
keep criminals ``on this side of the wall'' for society's
protection, but the chronic message of the series is that most of
the women are victims of abuse by families, boyfriends, society and
the prison system. We are supposed to take their word for it. The
approach succumbs to the fashion for stories of sexual abuse and to
television's craving for human interest, even at the expense of
straight reporting, a disappointment coming from the usually
businesslike Koppel.
</P>
<P>
   As for Di Domenico, should his crudely expressed opinions and
benighted insinuations be enough, without solid evidence of
malfeasance, to blacken his career and disqualify him from a job
that for all Koppel and ``Nightline'' viewers know, he was doing in
a professional manner? His removal was a quick and easy way for his
superiors to get rid of a nationally televised embarrassment, and
so, perhaps unintentionally, a famous journalist's reputation and
reach became weapons to punish this doctor for his words, not any
documented deeds.

Disney's core business _ amusement parks and family movies _ Disney
is still the best in the world. That's why Hong Kong officials are
willing to spend billions of dollars to develop the latest Disney

up $300 million. Hong Kong needs Disney to attract tourists its

JUSTICES REFUSE TO REINSTATE SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused without comment
to reinstate a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by an employee of
the Texas comptroller's office who had claimed unwanted touching
and lewd comments from a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Jean Shepherd, who has held a variety of posts in the
comptroller's office, had claimed that colleague Jodie Moore in
1993 often touched ``various parts'' of her and would make comments
about her body.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd alleged that she complained to her bosses, Fern
Francis-Jackson and Grundy Wiley, about the harassment but nothing
was done.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd suffered a nervous breakdown in the winter of 1994,
which she said resulted from the harassment, and was admitted to a
psychiatric ward for a week. She was then placed on a medical leave
of absence, not returning to work until June 20, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During her hospitalization, Wiley was fired and Francis-Jackson
was demoted because of their failure to handle Shepherd's
complaint's adequately. Moore, on his own initiative, transferred
to another department.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd sued the comptroller's office in Texas state court Jan.
17, 1997, alleging that the agency should be held liable for the
harassment she endured. The agency then asserted its right to have
the case heard by the U.S. District Court for Southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The district court without comment dismissed the case.
</P>
<P>
   On appeal, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
ruled March 16 that Shepherd had failed to prove that the agency
tolerated the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find, based on a consideration of all the circumstances,
that Moore's conduct did not render Shepherd's work environment
objectively hostile or abusive,'' the 5th Circuit ruled. ``We find
each comment made by Moore to be the equivalent of a mere utterance
of an epithet that engenders offensive feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   In her unsuccessful appeal to the Supreme Court, Shepherd argued
that the 5th Circuit was too strict in deciding how egregious
office behavior must be before it reached the level of illegal
sexual harassment under Title VII of the federal 1964 Civil Rights
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repeated efforts to look down petitioner's dress or blouse,
and regular unwanted stroking of petitioner's arm, the court
reasoned, could not support a Title VII claim _ no matter how often
they occurred _ because they were not as severe as actually
grabbing a woman's breast,'' wrote Shepherd's lawyer, Eric
Schnapper of Seattle, in a legal brief to the high court. ``Since,
on the 5th Circuit's views, none of these abuses were serious
enough to support a hostile-environment claim, Title VII would
allow an employer to knowingly tolerate or even encourage the
obnoxious conduct that occurred in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Peter Costea, who represented Shepherd in the
lower courts, assisted Schnapper on the brief.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, representing the state
comptroller's office, successfully urged the justices to reject the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the severity of Moore's conduct was not
sufficiently egregious to constitute a hostile work environment
claim,'' Cornyn wrote in a brief to the justices. ``The 5th Circuit
correctly labeled the comments made by Moore as `boorish and
offensive.' Necessarily, the 5th Circuit held, based on a
consideration of all the circumstances, that Moore's conduct did
not render Shepherd's work environment objectively hostile or
abusive.``

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAGOSA SPRINGS, Colo. _ Nestled in the San Juan National Forest
in southwestern Colorado is a small rectangle of mountains and a
valley that straddles the meandering East Fork of the San Juan
River.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the rectangle's 2,780 acres are indistinguishable from
the surrounding landscape, a dream scene of 1.8 million pristine
acres at the Continental Divide, where the only sounds are the
water rushing over rocks, the wind and the occasional cry of birds
high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Like more than 50 million other acres inside the United States'
national parks and forests, only a fraction of the total, the
rectangle of acreage is privately owned. It was one of thousands of
land grants made available, in some cases almost 140 years ago, for
homesteading, mining operations and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the private tracts remain undeveloped, owners
of the rectangle here are planning to build a members-only resort
on 200 acres that they call Piano Creek Ranch, where membership
shares cost $385,000 to $535,000.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to accommodate 395 families, the resort would include
spacious houses, lodges, a golf course and an equestrian center. A
ski area would be built on another part of the rectangle. Already,
175 families have signed up, and ground breaking is scheduled for
next June, with completion planned in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists say developments like Piano Creek represent
only the beginning of a major problem throughout federal lands. It
is ``the undiscovered crisis,'' says the National Park Trust, a
nonprofit group that buys land and donates it to the park system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the results of the booming economy and a lot of
new disposable wealth,'' said Steve Thompson, senior vice president
of the Trust for Public Land, another nonprofit organization that
works to preserve national park lands and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``With population pressures and beautiful places disappearing,
people of means are saying, `I'll get my little corner of
Paradise,' and they do what they want with it,'' Thompson said.
``They have the legal right to do it. But it's sad that resources
that are so spectacular, so beautiful would not be made available
to a broader audience, only to a limited group.''
</P>
<P>
   And with land prices soaring in areas within some of the
country's more popular parks and forests, the federal government
and nonprofit agencies that buy land for preservation may be unable
to compete with private investors. Paul Pritchard, president of the
National Park Trust, predicted, ``In five or 10 years, we'll be
priced out of the market in high-demand parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The private ownership rights were honored when Congress began
designating national parks and forests in the 1890s, and through
recent years most of the land owners have either kept their tracts
in a natural state or sold them to the federal government for
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the San Juan forest, and with growing frequency
elsewhere, owners of ``inholdings,'' as they are known to the
federal government, are developing acreage for commercial gain,
setting off intense fights with preservation groups and community
organizations concerned that development could damage the ecology
by disturbing wildlife and scarring landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a major concern,'' Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt said of private development inside federally owned lands.
``We need the resources to buy them out before problems start, and
there are willing sellers for most of them. But we don't have the
money, so the willing seller decides to sell on the open commercial
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the major federal land management agencies _ the
National Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of
Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Land Management _ provide
Congress with a list of privately held property they want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The park service list alone has a backlog of 10,184 private
tracts in 145 parks _ more than 1 million acres in all _ that
officials say would cost the government $1.35 billion to buy for
preservation. The National Park Trust estimates that 20 percent of
the privately held land within national parks and forests is ``in
imminent danger'' of development.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress never appropriates enough money to satisfy all the
needs, so which properties are bought depends on the threat of
development, the willingness of the owner to sell and the price.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Babbitt said, the four agencies have received a
combined $300 million to $400 million annually for the acquisition
of private land. As a result, conflicts are brewing throughout the
country as more developers build on their land inside national
parks and forests and market it for profit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the National Park
Service is trying to buy 88 acres within the Monocacy National
Battlefield, a major Civil War site, to prevent any development of
housing subdivisions and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of 11,000 acres within the Bitterroot National Forest
in western Montana resisted efforts to sell the land to the federal
government and, instead, sold recently to a company headed by Craig
Barrett, chief executive of Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that his group did not intend to develop the land.
But preservationists are skeptical and they complain that because
the acreage is a patchwork of about 14 separate tracts, the private
ownership makes it difficult for the federal government to manage
the public lands around them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, developers
are planning to turn an old 20-acre mining site into a remote lodge
with 30 lodges. For access, which the federal government is
required to provide, the developers are asking the park service to
improve a 10-mile road through park land that would cross a valley
creek 27 times. Park officials fear that the improvement will
encourage other land holders to develop sites near the road.
</P>
<P>
   Those fights are similar to the conflict here. Dan McCarthy, a
Chicago businessman and majority owner of the San Juan property,
once considered building a large ski resort on the land but said he
was persuaded by members of his family to abandon the plan because
of the potential impact of the traffic and people. More recently,
the 81-year-old McCarthy agreed to sell the tract to developers
whose idea for a country-club-like project more suited his
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely sensitive to the environment,'' he said in an
interview. ``And I am concerned about what happens to the East Fork
after I die, whose hands it might be in. My kids like it the way it
is, but someone might come along and they might feel like selling.
I think this is the best practical answer.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people disagree with him. While recognizing
that as a property owner, McCarthy can do whatever he wants with
his tract, a coalition of environmental groups, Friends of the East
Fork Valley, and residents of Pagosa Springs, the nearest town,
have vowed to fight the project as inappropriate for the site.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the lavish resort would disrupt elk migration
routes, threaten lynx, deer and other wildlife and destroy
landscape that remains as it was when wagon trains rolled westward
across the same access road that would serve the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep thinking that every time you develop something,
wildlife can go over the next hill into the next valley,'' said
Mark Pearson, chairman of the Sierra Club's National Wildlands
Committee. ``Well, this is the last next valley. There is no other
place wildlife can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is helping lead a campaign to stop, or at least delay,
the Piano Ranch project by challenging developers as they seek
permits from federal, state and local governments for necessities
like road improvements, electric lines and sewage operations.
Opponents also say they intend to appeal any approval by the Forest
Service, which is required for construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cancer in the heart of a national area,'' said Betty
Feazel, 83, who has lived on an 800-acre ranch at the foot of the
access road to the Piano Creek site since 1922 and remains a friend
of McCarthy despite the development plans. ``I don't think he
realizes how much impact this thing is going to have. People are
going to be crawling all over the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jo Bridges, a district ranger for the San Juan National
Forest, said that unless an environmental-impact study concluded
that development of Piano Creek posed insurmountable problems to
the forest, she would approve the project, as the first level of
review, and ``development will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said that opponents of the development would appeal her
approval to the Forest Service regional office and, if necessary,
to headquarters in Washington. Beyond that, either side could
appeal to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Sanders, chairman of the development company that is
buying the land from McCarthy, said in an interview that if Pearson
and others would only listen, they might be convinced that the
impact of the project on the area would be small and certainly less
than the ski resort once under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he thought the opponents' public campaign had been
disingenuous, filled with half-truths and overstatements to attract
more allies. He cited as an example assertions that the project
would cover all 2,780 acres of the rectangle. That was wrong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not easy to believe a developer, that I could have
good intentions,'' he said, pointing out that he could just as
easily have built residential subdivisions. ``But I am trying to
protect the environment. I'm attracted to this area for the same
reasons other people are. Environmentalists want to see the land
remain pristine, and so do our members.''

WAKING UP TO GUMBEL, SERVED IN A NEW BLEND
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During Monday's premiere of ``The Early Show,'' CBS's entry into
the morning-show wars, Bryant Gumbel's smartest move was his first.
He announced that he and his co-anchor, the virtually unknown Jane
Clayson, had had their ``enthusiasm tempered enormously by a major
tragedy,'' the Egyptian airliner crash on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably that news prevented the CBS stars from jumping up
and down with excitement. But it doesn't explain the pokey pace and
cloned feel, suggesting that ``The Early Show'' is in an amoebalike
state of development. So far it has a noisy location, a cipher of a
co-anchor and Bryant Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel (secret weapon or disaster in the making?) is the most
intriguing and curious part of this project. Warmth, fuzziness and
chipper personalities are now at a premium in the morning, and he
would have been an unlikely choice if not for his fabulously
successful run on ``Today.'' But will he lead ``The Early Show'' in
a less cloying direction than the competition or will he become
less acerbic to survive? Monday sent mixed signals. Surely Gumbel's
stature helped get him an interview with President Clinton, taped
on Sunday. Yet the interview was soft and unsurprising. Asked about
polls that suggested he would be a liability campaigning for Al
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president said voters wanted
to make up their own minds.
</P>
<P>
   The show's dampened enthusiasm didn't prevent endless plugs.
Kevin James, the star of the CBS working-class sitcom ``The King of
Queens,'' gave a supposedly comic but genuinely unfunny tour of the
upscale Fifth Avenue neighborhood surrounding the ``Early Show''
studio. And the relentlessly self-promoting Donald Trump, who owns
the building, greeted the hosts and got in a plug for an insurance
company. That's what a serious presidential candidate does, right?
</P>
<P>
   It is now required, of course, for morning shows to feature a
set with a window onto the sidewalk and forays by the anchors into
the crowd. The noise of trucks and sirens Monday sometimes made it
difficult to hear the anchors and Mark McEwen, the weather and
entertainment reporter, when they were outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Clayson did a stiff, rote interview with the
author of a book about marital infidelity near the end of the show,
she had every reason to look grim. Anyone flipping to NBC would
have caught Mariah Carey's live performance in Rockefeller Plaza on
``Today.'' Originally booked for ``The Early Show,'' Ms. Carey
bolted to the competition last week, citing fears that CBS could
not get the permit for an outdoor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' has a seamlessness and rhythm that helps explains its
popularity. ABC's ``Good Morning America'' has improved in ratings
and appeal by bringing in Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer,
demonstrating the drawing power of familiar, likable personalities.
This week ``The Early Show'' will bring on Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, Gore and Bill Bradley on consecutive days, and it has at
least a half-dozen regular segments still to be unveiled. But
nothing iconoclastic is planned. Call it what you like, this truly
is The Bryant Gumbel Show, his to succeed in or fail.

BOSTON LAUNCHES AN ANTI-CANCER CAMPAIGN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cities often undertake campaigns to fight crime or
litter.
</P>
<P>
   This city is fighting its No. 1 killer: cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, every household in Boston, in theory,
has been mailed a brochure describing how to prevent cancer and to
detect it early if it develops.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-million English-and-Spanish brochures, Boston's
largest public health mailing ever, are the flashiest element of
the city's ``crusade against cancer,'' but they are only one of
many.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's municipal employees are allowed to take four hours off
each year for cancer screening _ a rule that city officials say was
the only one of its kind in the nation until Springfield, Mass.,
adopted a similar rule this week. Over the last several months,
about 1,600 chemotherapy patients have been given free rides to and
from their sessions, thanks to hospitals and taxis participating in
the city's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities and states run a variety of anti-cancer programs,
as does the federal government. But over all, said Donald J.
Gudaitis, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society's
New England division, ``This is the most visionary public health
initiative ever undertaken in any city around prevention and early
detection of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a local crusade may seem logical at a time when the death
rate from heart disease has been dropping dramatically and cancer,
the nation's No. 2 cause of death, kills more than half a million
Americans every year.
</P>
<P>
   But Gudaitis also attributed the anti-cancer campaign in Boston
to a particular asset: a personally interested mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino's father died of prostate cancer, and the
mayor, who does not normally play up his personal life, said in a
telephone interview that he saw his father ``go from a big brawny
guy to 70 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you ask yourself, why?'' Menino added. ``I want to try to
help other people out.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, it seems, he wants to help the poor. Boston, like
many other cities, has found that cancer death rates are especially
high in poor and minority neighborhoods. Patchy health care makes
poor people less likely to get checked for cancer, and thus more
likely to die from it.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Menino convened a panel of medical experts
and cancer survivors to help decide what to do. The process, which
led to the crusade against cancer, is continuing, said John Rich,
medical director of the Boston Public Health Commission, but the
panel established three initial goals: that all Boston households
receive information on cancer prevention, that all Bostonians
receive appropriate screenings, and that all cancer patients have
transportation to and from treatment sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation may seem a minor issue compared with the first
two goals, but not to chemotherapy patients, said Maureen Sullivan,
vice president of the Massachusetts Bay region of the American
Cancer Society who is a cancer survivor. She said it might not be
bad getting to chemotherapy sessions, but she added, ``Let me tell
you, coming home can be really awful, and not only for you but for
everyone else on that bus with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has introduced other help on wheels: a mobile mammography
van that has been booked solid since it began its rounds six months
ago. Officials say the city is fighting cancer in small ways as
well _ supplying sunscreen to its outdoor workers in the
summertime, for example _ and in bigger ones: Menino supported a
ban on smoking in Boston restaurants, despite heavy opposition from
restaurateurs. The crusade against cancer also includes television
advertising and a new city agency, the Office on Cancer Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign costs the city little, Menino said; perhaps
$100,000 for the mammography van, about $250,000 for the brochures
and nothing for the transportation and time off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Boston is undertaking an anti-cancer campaign only
now, when the disease has killed millions for decades, those
involved with the campaign cited two factors: the accumulation of
research findings on cancer prevention and widespread
disillusionment with the prevention promise offered by health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look at the actual synthesis and explosion, if you will,
of information on the relationship between life-style factors and
cancer in the last 20 years, it really has moved beyond just
smoking as a major cause,'' said Dr. Graham Colditz, director of
education at the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention, which is
participating in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Colditz said the center determined that at least 50 percent of
all cancer cases could be prevented through behavioral changes
alone. In addition, he said, the screenings could prevent deaths
among those whose cancer would be detected early.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure advises people to eat a healthy diet, to get at
least 30 minutes of physical activity every day, to keep their
weight down, to drink less alcohol, to avoid smoking, to avoid
sexually transmitted diseases and to protect themselves from the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was news to Mary Caulfield, a 58-year-old retired
resident of the Dorchester section of Boston. But she said, ``I
think a lot of newcomers, foreigners, probably don't understand
even things like immunizations.''
</P>
<P>
   The brochure was mass-mailed in English and Spanish, and is
available in nine other languages, including Portuguese and creole,
the principal languages of the Cape Verde islands, and Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What the Boston campaign will attempt next remains under
discussion. Among some ideas mentioned by participants: persuading
private employers to give employees four hours off for cancer
screening, making it easier for Bostonians to bicycle or jog to
work and making programs that help smokers quit available to anyone
who wants them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Menino said the four hours off for screening has led to
detection of some early cancer, and nearly 5 percent of the women
who use the mammography van have found a suspicious lump. Nearly
one-fourth of those who use the van said it was the first time they
had gotten a mammogram, the added.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the crusade against cancer is
expected to yield only gradual, cumulative results. Certainly, the
immediate effect of the brochure mailing seemed a bit
underwhelming: Of more than a dozen people interviewed Monday on
the streets of Dorchester, an ethnically mixed community, most said
they had paid little attention to the brochure, although some said
they had set it aside to read later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm just too tired to read,'' said Esther Ellis, 71,
who nonetheless was getting her annual mammogram at a local health
center. ``I just leave it to God. God respects my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Navarro, a flea market vendor, said he did not recall
getting the brochure. But when he read it in Spanish on the spot,
he expressed surprise at what he learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking?'' he exclaimed. ``I know it's bad for you, I know
it's bad for your liver, but I didn't know it causes cancer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   David Sheets, a 45-year-old friend of Navarro, said that he had
saved the brochure at his South End home to read later, but that
the idea of cancer ``doesn't bother me yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother died of it, my father died of it,'' Sheets said.
``It doesn't faze me.''
</P>

By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, most of Pamela Titzer-Garrison's family history
was locked away in her father's rapidly fading memory.
</P>
<P>
   Then her uncle _ her father's last surviving sibling _ died, and
the Saginaw, Texas, mother knew it was up to her to chronicle her
family's past. Not just for her father, but for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Indiana and found a distant relative that had some
written records, so that kind of gave me a start,'' Titzer-Garrison
says. ``I came here because the library kept showing up on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Titzer-Garrison is doing research at the Family History Center,
located in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
southwest Fort Worth. It is one of two local branches of the Family
History Center run by the Mormon church, which maintains one of the
world's most extensive genealogical research databases.
</P>
<P>
   Titzer-Garrison is researching information about her
great-great-grandfather, Johann Titzer, who immigrated to the
United States from Germany between 1844 and 1850 and settled in
southern Indiana. The center's Peggy Besselievre guides her through
an Internet search of German maps.
</P>
<P>
   Titzer-Garrison knows that Johann Titzer and his two brothers
were Catholic. She knows they were farmers and that he had seven
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' she says. ``I was up till 1 a.m. the other
night. I found a town in Germany with the name Titzer. I couldn't
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Besselievre, who runs the center with her husband, Philip, says
this is typical of those tracing their genealogy. Pieces of
information usually provide the impetus for more research.
</P>
<P>
   There are now an estimated 100 million Americans like
Titzer-Garrison who are tracing their family history, digging for
their roots, says Kathleen Hinckley, author of ``Locating Lost
Family Members &AMP; Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know that your great-great-grandfather was in the
Civil War or the gold rush, you not only have a greater
appreciation of American history, (but) that becomes the driving
force to do more research,'' Hinckley says.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves' descendants face obstacles
</P>
<P>
   Americans' interest in family history first peaked after the
critically acclaimed TV miniseries ``Roots'' aired in 1977. Now,
the Internet is helping create an even bigger boom as people of all
ages trace their roots. Some are are even forming teams to research
their family history, and many are seeking help from genealogists
and family-history detectives like Hinckley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody I know anticipated this level of
interest,'' says John Wylie, a professional genealogist and
co-founder of GENTECH, a nonprofit national education organization
that promotes the responsible use of computers in family history
research.
</P>
<P>
   Wylie says that once people are hooked by the Internet, they
continue their search by using libraries and the National Archives,
and by joining one of approximately 3,000 genealogical
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet provides a window to the past,
genealogists stress that using the information superhighway is just
one step in a laborious process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning genealogists make hasty decisions and go off
climbing the wrong tree,'' Hinckley says. ``The Internet opens the
door into the wide world of genealogy, but there are more original
records scattered in courthouses and libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of genealogy Web sites: free sites that are
generally paid for by advertising, and fee-based sites that require
users to buy a product or a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based sites are the largest, Wylie says, but only a few _
among them www.ancestry.com _ are up and running.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison. there are approximately 51,000 free sites. That
does not include another 100,000 sites that people have established
for their own families.
</P>
<P>
   Even using all the sources available, experts say that tracing
your heritage can be tricky, especially for African-Americans who
are descendants of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Because census reports only recorded the names of free people,
slaves were excluded. Birth dates and locations may be inaccurate
because many slaves didn't know where or exactly when they were
born. And family members were often sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram asked Hinckley to find out as much
about this reporter's family as possible for $300. She and Wylie
are professional genealogists who will do the detective work for a
fee.
</P>
<P>
   After nine hours of research, Hinckley was able to construct a
family pedigree that spanned four generations and more than 100
years. But there wasn't much information beyond names, birth dates
and marriages. Census tracts showed whether ancestors could read,
owned or rented a home, and what they did for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley says the material was fairly easy to collect because my
family lived in one place for the most part. But to trace my
family's history back to the time of slavery would have been more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Jones, an author and storyteller living in Washington, D.C.,
says African-American family history often is more anecdotal than
it is documented.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' mother, for instance, has done a formal genealogy of her
side of the family, while her father did it through storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telling of stories is not just an African-American thing,
but a primal thing in humans, from cavemen gathered around the fire
to yuppies communicating through e-mails,'' Jones says.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that families save their stories in other ways,
too, such as listing all the addresses where they've lived and the
types of cars they've owned, and saving tapes from their answering
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have the voices of people you loved,'' Jones says.

<P>
   Mormon church keeps extensive files
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church, however, may be the best source for tracing
family history. Located in Salt Lake City, the church has been
involved in genealogy since its founding nearly 170 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The church's goal is to help its members find names of deceased
persons to baptize by proxy, an ordinance that Mormons believe
gives the dead the opportunity to embrace the faith in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church is considered the world's largest collector of
genealogical data, with 2 billion rolls of microfilm, 700,000
microfiches and 280,000 books in its Salt Lake City library.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people worldwide visit the library every year to
research their family tree, says Elaine Hasleton, the library's
public affairs supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have census records, federal and state records from 1790 to
1920,'' she says. ``We have probate records, land records, cemetery
listings, and family history books that we obtain through
individual donations.''
</P>
<P>
   The library also catalogs purchase records, immigration records,
county histories and several large databases, among them ancestor
files and an international genealogical index.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, those two files hold about 340 million names from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Mormon church also launched its own Web site,
www.familysearch.com. It contains links to 400 million names dating
to 1500, many with family pedigree charts, and gets 8 million hits
a day.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the Mormon church has dispatched
members throughout the world, first to hand-copy and then to
photograph and microfilm parish and civil records.
</P>
<P>
   The church has approximately 3,400 Family History Centers
throughout the United States and in 72 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Titzer-Garrison traveled 20 miles from her home in Saginaw to
the Fort Worth branch to do her research. Although her trip didn't
produce a lot of new information, she gained some insight about
German culture from the center's volunteers. She believes that her
great-great-grandfather was probably a member of the German army
because all young men were required to serve.
</P>
<P>
   She is determined to continue her quest for information and to
pass it on to the next generation of her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hooked,'' she says.

How to climb your family tree
</P>
<P>
   Researching family history can be a time-consuming project.
There are no shortcuts, and those who really want to find their
roots must be ready to invest time and maybe some money. Here's a
look at the resources available as you begin the search.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet:
</P>
<P>
   A few of the better Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   GENTECH, genealogy support organization, www.gentech.org.
</P>
<P>
   Mormon genealogy site, www.familysearch.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation,
www.ellisisland.org.
</P>
<P>
   Rootsweb, www.rootsweb. com.
</P>
<P>
   Links to more than 55,000 Web sites, www.cyndislist.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips:
</P>
<P>
   Visit the library; it will have such things as obituaries and
local history.
</P>
<P>
   Attend a class. Local genealogy societies sometimes offer
workshops on surfing the Net for family history.
</P>
<P>
   Read a book; there are many on how to research your family tree,
including Kathleen Hinckley's ``Locating Lost Family Members &AMP;
Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to relatives, especially grandparents. They are a great
source of family history.
</P>
<P>
   Check for name changes; somewhere along the line a relative may
have changed the spelling of his or her last name or shortened it.
It may also have been recorded incorrectly in official records or
on headstones.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Send.com is buying its 15 minutes of fame right now.
</P>
<P>
   The year-old Internet gift site has raised only $10 million in
venture capital funding so far, but it has committed to spend $20
million for television advertising on such top-rated shows as Ally
McBeal, Frasier and Monday Night Football in the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Its budget would be substantial for even a big retailer like
Amazon.com, which is said to have spent $17 million on television
for all of 1998. But for tiny send.com, which has negligible
revenue and no profits, it is stunningly audacious.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has borrowed against investors' pledges of more
capital to pay for his ad spending spree, Send.com chief executive
Michael Lannon sees little choice. ``Not every company is going to
survive this Christmas,'' he said. ``We are treating the next eight
weeks like an election campaign. Both we and our investors believe
that customers are going to vote on who the leading gift site is,
and only one candidate wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that this holiday season will be make-or-break,
e-retailers are burning through resources as they race one another
to bring their names to consumers through TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that such exposure in a crowded market
will prove to be a cost-efficient way to attract new customers. In
fact, Amazon.com recently said it would triple holiday ad spending,
a move that gave stock analysts pause and sent its stock price
plunging. Moreover, in some cases, the start-ups are buying air
time at the expense of other important components, such as customer
service, inventory and simple Web design.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies say they feel compelled to spend everything
they have (and more) and hope the financial markets will refill
their coffers after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In all of 1998, Internet companies _ including portals and
online brokerage firms, as well as e-retailers _ accounted for $323
million in TV ad spending, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, an advertising monitoring service. In the first half of
this year, they spent about $400 million on TV, and media buyers
estimate that spending in the second half will far surpass that and
push the sum for the year well past the $1 billion mark.
</P>
<P>
   Though retailers and other gift sites are leading the charge,
almost every site is desperate to register with consumers in the
end-of-year buying crush. Total Internet sales of products and
services like travel are expected to be $6 billion in November and
December, according to Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of e-tailers have sold their souls to the TV networks,
gambling that they can drive massive customers through the site
through mass advertising,'' said David Cowan, a partner in Bessemer
Venture Capital, a Silicon Valley firm that has helped finance such
Web start-ups as Etoys and Mothernature.com. ``This season will be
a proving ground for the TV networks to flex their muscles as the
true portals of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   As more Internet companies feel the need to match their
competitors' presence on television, the higher the cost of being a
noticeable player in the TV market will be. ``The price of entry
for an annual plan might be $40 to $50 million a year _ $8 to $10
million a quarter,'' said David Smith, the principal in Mediasmith
Inc., a San Francisco agency that plans and buys ad time for
Interactive firms. ``That is a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, an established retailer typically
spends 3 percent to 4 percent of its revenue on advertising,
according to Burt Flickinger III, managing partner of Reach
Marketing, a consulting group in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc., one of the United States' largest retailers, with $9
billion in expected 1999 revenue, allotted $157 million for
television advertising last year, reports Competitive Media. And
Gap is ubiquitous on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom Inc., the department-store chain with more than $5
billion in revenue last year, has just announced its biggest
national TV and print campaign ever. The $17 million effort will
promote _ what else? _ Nordstromshoes.com, its newest Internet
retailing site.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the feeding frenzy has been a boon to the Old Media
concerns that e-companies tend to mock as dinosaurs. Newspapers,
magazines and radio stations have all seen a generous flood of
media dollars. But TV outlets, with their relatively high rates,
have been swimming in Internet funds.
</P>
<P>
   At the major networks, fees for 30-second ads on top programs
like E.R. and Monday Night Football cost a substantial premium over
last year. For 30-second spots on the Super Bowl, average prices
rocketed from $1.6 million on Fox TV last January to $2 million for
ABC's broadcast in January 2000, partly on the strength of Internet
demand.
</P>
<P>
   CBS Inc. has been trading on the desperation of Internet
companies by offering television time in exchange for stock in
those ventures. ``We've been swapping equity for branding,'' said
company spokesman Gil Schwartz, who said the network now has stakes
in 13 companies. Four of the companies, including CBS marketwatch
and cbsmedscape.com, are public, and CBS' stake in those firms is
worth more than half a billion dollars, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with television is a new and unproven strategy
among Internet companies. Even a year ago, most Internet companies
concentrated their ad dollars online. ``Last Christmas, merchants
were allocating 70 to 80 percent of their marketing budgets online
largely at portals,'' said Ken Cassar, a digital commerce analyst
at Jupiter Communications, a new media consulting firm. ``Today,
that is flipped, with the majority being spent on traditional media
and most in television.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have led to the transformation of marketing
across the industry. There is a general belief that online
advertising through banners and portals like Yahoo! and America
Online is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, Internet companies have enlisted executives from
marketing giants like Pepsi and Procter &AMP; Gamble, which have a
history of using television to increase customer awareness of their
branded products. But most important, television in particular is
perceived as a king maker based on a few Cinderella stories last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year in business, Etoys, a Web-based toy seller,
did $2 million in sales. Then the credit-card consortium Visa
decided that a good way to support e-commerce in general during the
Christmas season was to air an ad for the retailer showing children
snuggled in bed as parents clicked away to get their presents.
Etoys' revenue jumped to $23 million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year there was relatively little ``dot com'' advertising.
Now the ads flow together one after another through the commercial
breaks.

CLINTON TO GIVE PEACE TALKS A NUDGE DURING SUMMIT  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ President Clinton pledged ``there is nothing I
would not do'' to secure peace in the Middle East as the Israelis
and Palestinians embark on the final but most difficult phase of
their seven-year negotiations Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined Middle East leaders for a two-day summit that
also commemorates the memory of Yitzak Rabin. The slain Israeli
prime minister signed the 1993 Oslo Accord, a product of secret
negotiations that provided the current blueprint for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The president met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, and Barak
and Arafat later met. All three will meet Tuesday as Clinton
attempts to nudge the peace process toward its final leg.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will launch talks Nov. 7 to begin resolving the
most contentious remaining issues such as the status of Jerusalem,
Palestinian statehood, refugees, Jewish settlements and prisoners.
They want a framework for an agreement set by February and a final
treaty crafted by September.
</P>
<P>
   Barak suggested the possibility of a three-way summit similar to
the 1979 Camp David negotiations. He also reportedly sketched for
Clinton a ``red-linend issues on which Israel will not
negotiate, although details were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was premature to speculate on a second Camp
David summit. Two decades ago, the United States hosted intense
talks that led to the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. The
Camp David Accord was one of President Jimmy Carter's biggest
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule anything out,'' Clinton said of a Camp David
sequel. ``As you know, going all the way back to '93, there is
nothing I would not do if I thought it would genuinely help to
build a lasting peace in the Middle East. There is nothing I would
not do, and I'm prepared to reaffirm that to Prime Minister Barak
and to Chairman Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official suggested a U.S.-led summit may be held if
the initial two-way talks next week go well. ``We are entering a
100-day period, which is fateful,'' the official told reporters.
``Now the talks will start with the teams, but if they are positive
and successful there might be a chance for a trilateral summit
meeting in January or February.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat declared himself ready to ``seize the opportunity'' for
peace but also complained of Israel's continued expansion of Jewish
settlements and affirmed his continued position that ``Holy
Jerusalem'' will be the capitol of an independent Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I can seize this opportunity with your assistance
and the assistance of the others so that we can revive the peace
process and put it back on track,'' Arafat said as he met with
Norway's Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat welcomed a Camp David-style session. ``As far as the
process is concerned, we would agree at any way that would be
suggested by those involved in the peace process _ the
international community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking during a separate session with Bondevik, said
there were limits to what the United States could accomplish. ``The
hard decisions have to be made by the parties,'' Clinton said.
``The States can help with financial support, with military
support, with moral backup.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was important to keep negotiations on the timetable.
``So I will do what I can to get this thing going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the focus now is on
structure, process and organization rather than on substance.
</P>
<P>
   King Harald of Norway hosted a commemorative dinner in memory of
Rabin. It also marked the anniversary of the 1993 Oslo Accord, the
agreement by which Israel allowed Palestinian control over the Gaza
Strip and portions of the West Bank. There have been a series of
interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin, who won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, was assassinated in 1995 by
a Jewish extremist opposed to the Oslo pact. King Harald called
Rabin a ``soldier of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is November again,'' recalled Leah Rabin, referring to the
month of her husband's death. ``It is his spirit and legacy which
has brought the parties of the peace process back here to Oslo
where it all began.'' Rabin was shot leaving a peace rally for the
Oslo Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now turning to you Chairman Arafat and to you Prime
Minister Barak,'' Leah Rabin said. ``It is your commitment to now
find the right formula to finish what my husband started and had to
pay the highest price for, his life. It is now up to you. Is it too
much to ask for?''

 UNDATED: commercial breaks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Levitan says getting a brand out to consumers is much
tougher now than when he co-founded iVillage, a community site
established in 1995. Now he is chief executive of Flooz.com, which
essentially allows shoppers to buy a gift certificate that can be
redeemed at select Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which was relaunched this fall, calls its currency
flooz and e-mails it to customers. ``Earlier on, if you made a big
noise and were provocative, that was enough,'' he said. ``Now
everyone is provocative and irreverent.''
</P>
<P>
   To rise above the din, Levitan is betting roughly half the
company's $16 million in funding on marketing in the next 10 weeks.
He also gave up a significant share of stock options (he won't say
how many) to actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to engage her as
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to the uncertainty, many young Internet companies
are beginning their TV ads in a big national push without testing
them in smaller markets. Send.com, for example, had done only radio
commercials before it jumped into the national television market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, industry consultants suspect that some Internet
retailers are shortchanging key operations, like improved Web
design that will keep shoppers coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times, companies have called up and said basically:
`We have this ad campaign planned. It is $20 million. We have
already shot the commercial and booked the air time. It is running
in three weeks. But we have discovered our Web site is no good.
What should we do?''' said Jakob Nielsen, a Web designer in Silicon
Valley. ``The answer is, you are sort of doomed,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if everything runs smoothly _ if customers arrive and they
find good service _ some Wall Street analysts are beginning to
question whether such big expenditures can be a cost-effective way
to attract new customers.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Amazon.com indicated that it would spend well
over $100 million this holiday season to keep up with the Joneses _
news that meant its cost of acquiring new customers was going up
for the near future and sent its stock price plunging.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wall Street is signaling that it is worried about costs,
e-tailers are turning a deaf ear. Peter Neupert, chief executive of
Drugstore.com, an online pharmacy that has spent heavily on ads,
estimates that it cost his site $63 in the third quarter to acquire
each new customer. ``We expect that number to go up _ not down,'''
he said.

   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ (Exclusive) The question of China's
entry into the World Trade Organization may not be dead for this
year, officials say. The U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, announced Monday that she expected formal negotiations
with China to resume this month on its entry into the World Trade
Organization, and some officials said she may travel to China
before a trade meeting in Seattle at the end of the month if there
is enough progress that President Clinton could announce a deal in
Seattle. But in public, Ms. Barshefsky _ once burned when the
president turned down her advice to take the April deal _ is being
quite cautious. ``We have got to see,'' she said Monday, when asked
about the possibility of a deal. ``There is quite a bit of work to
go.'' By David E. Sanger.

   ONLINE-ADS (Undated) _ Convinced that this yuletide season will
be make-or-break, e-commerce companies are engaged in a very
expensive war to bring their names to consumers through TV
advertising. There is little evidence that such exposure in a
crowded market will prove to be a cost efficient way to attract new
customers. In fact, Amazon.com recently said it would triple
holiday ad spending, a move that gave stock analysts pause and sent
its stock price plunging. The upstarts may be buying air time at
the expense of other important components, such as customer
service, inventory, and simple Web design. By Leslie Kaufman.

A SMALL-SCREEN BURST OF VERITE FROM THE BEST OF THE CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  (With TV-CENTURY-CHOICE) 
(nk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlie Tabesh, vice president of Turner Classic Movies, a cable
television channel devoted to classic movies, knew that despite
being a confessed ``film fanatic,'' he had a significant gap in
film knowledge, one that corresponded to a gap in his channel's
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen `Hoop Dreams' and `The Thin Blue Line,' and they
really had an enormous impact on me,'' Tabesh said. ``And I thought
there had to be other films that had had enormous impact on people
over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Resolving to learn more, Tabesh began collecting books about
documentaries, then decided to provide an outlet for the classics
of the form. The result is a festival that TCM is calling ``A
Century of Reality,'' an assemblage of the top examples of
documentary film in the 20th century. These include early efforts
like ``Nanook of the North,'' Robert Flaherty's portrait of an
Eskimo hunter, and ``South,'' Frank Hurley's exploration of the
polar expedition of Sir Ernest Shackleton, on through examples of
the Soviet avant-garde films of the late 1920s to a collection of
World War II films and contemporary classics like ``Harlan County,
U.S.A.'' and ``Hoop Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival begins Tuesday night with three films by Robert
Drew about the political career of John F. Kennedy. ``Primary,''
widely labeled as the first use of cinema verite as we have come to
know it, is a behind-the-scenes look at Kennedy's underdog campaign
against Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey in Wisconsin's Democratic
presidential primary in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   It is followed by ``Crisis,'' a minute-by-minute account of the
confrontation between the Kennedy administration and Gov. George C.
Wallace over the admission of the first black students to the
University of Alabama in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The Drew trilogy concludes with a short film made the weekend
after the Kennedy assassination, ``Faces of November,'' which has
never been presented on television. All three films have freshly
restored prints. A fourth film, ``Four Days in November,'' by Mel
Stuart, follows.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which runs on Tuesdays throughout this month, may
be the most comprehensive exploration of the best documentaries of
the 20th century ever presented on television. But TCM did not do
it because its vast libraries contained these films. In fact, the
channel owned almost none of them until Tabesh set out to acquire
the rights to them.
</P>
<P>
   Tabesh found himself fascinated by the history of the
documentary but realized he knew little about it. ``I've never been
to film school,'' he said. ``I'm just a buff.''
</P>
<P>
   He consulted some film experts, including the director of the
Independent Film Association, Betsy McLane, and bought a batch of
books, including ``Documentary Film Classics'' and ``Documentary: A
History of the Nonfiction Film.''
</P>
<P>
   The research turned up lists that had many of the same titles.
``There were films I knew we just had to have,'' Tabesh said. ``We
had to include the Leni Reifenstahl films from before the war. We
needed those early classics like the Shackleton film. And I wanted
to have the Soviet movies because they were so experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   His research turned up some gems that are not widely known
outside documentary circles, including one made by John Huston in
World War II, ``The Battle of San Pietro,'' which presented combat
so realistically that the Army decided not to release it, and a
film about the Spanish Civil War called ``The Spanish Earth,''
narrated by Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling the collection was time-consuming, Tabesh said, but
not expensive. The time was spent locating the films, because,
Tabesh pointed out, there is no central studio library that houses
many of them. Many are owned by governments, including the German
government, which Tabesh said still has a claim on the Reifenstahl
Nazi films. Educational institutions own some, and so do museums;
the Museum of Modern Art has the rights to the Hemingway Spanish
Civil War film, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Some had to be purchased from the British-based film library,
Janus Films, Tabesh said. But with interest in them not especially
intense, and with few television outlets willing to present them,
none of the films were dauntingly priced. ``For the most part, this
was very inexpensive,'' Tabesh said. He declined to put an overall
price on the festival.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tabesh said, he became convinced early on that the key to
the festival was the acquisition of the three Kennedy films made by
Drew _ and the filmmaker had them.
</P>
<P>
   Now 75 and living in Brooklyn, Drew is still an active
filmmaker. He has two in the early stages of production, one about
pain and what can be done about it, the other about his exploits in
World War II, when he was shot down behind enemy lines in Italy and
survived many close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Drew was relatively unknown in the late 1950s when he first
encountered John Kennedy. He had been looking for someone with the
qualifications for a film idea he had long been contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   Having read ``The Education of Henry Adams,'' Drew said, he was
struck by the author's contention that he was the last man who
would truly know everything, but that someone would be born at
about the time of his death who would come to think he could ``see
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew said he saw Kennedy give a speech in Detroit early in his
campaign, and ``at once I knew I had found that man. Kennedy really
did believe he could see it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced he was in the presence of an extraordinary figure,
Drew approached Kennedy and asked if he could be allowed what was
then unprecedented access to his campaign.

 UNDATED: his campaign. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinema verite in 1960 did not mean a hand-held camera or a
camera tucked away in someone's brown-bag lunch. In those days it
meant a team of two or three people, one lugging a bulky camera,
another toting bulky sound equipment and possibly a third to carry
extra film and equipment. All of that had to be hauled from place
to place as the subject of the film moved through the day. Nothing
about the effort was unobtrusive. The secret, Drew said, was
winning the subject's trust and doing nothing to violate it.
</P>
<P>
   Drew said Kennedy embraced the idea quickly. But he had to
persuade Humphrey. ``I don't think Humphrey understood what I was
doing, but I don't think it mattered. He was so tied up in his own
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Allowed to travel with both men, Drew knew quickly he was
capturing moments that no filmmaker ever had before. ``We were
getting reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed he had made something groundbreaking, though
the network news departments at the time did not agree. ``Primary''
was turned down. ``Elmer Lower of NBC told me I had some pretty
good footage,'' Drew said. ``The networks just didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was eventually shown on stations owned by Time
magazine. But Kennedy loved the film, and that connection led to
``Crisis,'' which was the fulfillment of Kennedy's promise to Drew
to allow him inside the day-to-day events of a White House crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On that film, made for ABC News, the challenge was to persuade
Gov. Wallace. Once inside the Wallace camp, Drew said, the access
was complete. And Wallace even found he liked the film. Drew said
it had been his experience that the subjects of his films always
believe they look great and the opposing side looks foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The final Kennedy film came about because Lower, at that point
president of ABC News, asked Drew after the assassination to go to
Washington and ``make one of your films.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew was unsure what that meant in the context of the Kennedy
funeral. So he decided, he said, ``to film the events backward.''
Instead of showing the funeral, he turned his camera on the faces
of the people watching the events. ABC never ran the film.
</P>
<P>
   Drew said that whenever he has screened the three films
together, as he has on occasion at schools, the effect is always
the same. ``Nobody applauds. They just walk out looking kind of
shaken.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Drew said he was delighted that TCM has chosen to
give some recognition to great documentaries. ``I think it's a
well-thought-out list,'' he said. ``And I'm happy my films are in
there.''

JUDGE DISALLOWS GAY-PANIC DEFENSE IN SHEPARD MURDER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A district court judge in Laramie, Wyo., ruled Monday
that lawyers for a man accused of murdering a gay college student
last year may not use a gay-panic defense in the trial to justify
the actions of their client.
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling carries no weight beyond Wyoming, some legal
experts and gay rights advocates said it amounts to a political
victory for gays and lesbians at a time when a growing number of
defense lawyers are using the strategy of casting the defendant as
victim _ with some success _ to obtain lighter sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But others expressed anger at the ruling, saying that it
reflects the growing influence of gay and lesbian groups that have
always demanded compassion and equal justice and now appear as
vengeful rather than sympathetic, denying the accused his only
possible defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we want, justice or revenge?'' said William K. Dobbs,
a lawyer and gay rights activist in New York. ``Gay political
capital has become so substantial that it can now be used to
railroad others and compromise the ability of a defendant to get a
fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, Barton R. Voigt, told the lawyers that
their efforts to demonstrate a panic defense was little more than
an attempt to show that their client, Aaron J. McKinney, suffered
temporary insanity or diminished capacity when he admittedly killed
the student, Matthew Shepard, by beating him with a pistol during a
fit of ``homosexual rage.'' Neither defense is recognized by
Wyoming law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if relevant,'' the judge said of gay panic as a defense,
`'the evidence will mislead and confuse the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of their plan, defense lawyers rested their case Monday
after calling the last of just seven witnesses. Closing arguments
are scheduled for Tuesday, after which the jury will begin
deliberations. Following any guilty verdict, arguments will begin
on the penalty phase, in which Voigt said he might allow testimony
on McKinney's past as a victim of homosexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In a gay-panic defense, a phrase that does not exist in statute
law, a defendant tries to win sympathy from the jury by
characterizing the victim as a homosexual predator and by
demonstrating that the defendant found his homosexual advances were
so repugnant and offensive, he resorted to violence. In a sense, it
suggests self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has gained widespread use in recent years although
only rarely has it persuaded juries to find defendants guilty of
lesser crimes. Perhaps in response to more tolerant attitudes, in
general, toward gays and lesbians or to intense lobbying efforts
against such legal ploys by gay and lesbian activists, juries more
often have ignored the defendant's psychology as a reason to excuse
a violent act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a desperate defense, to begin with,'' said Nanci
Clarence, a criminal defense lawyer in San Francisco who has worked
many cases involving gays as victims and witnesses. ``You are
asking jurors to buy the notion that internalistic homophobia can
be used to justify killing. That's a lot to bite off.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, who is 22, has confessed to killing Shepard, and
prosecutors who have charged him with first-degree murder say they
will seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in opening arguments last week, his lawyer, Jason Tangeman,
told the jury that McKinney's `'five-minute emotional rage''
against Shepard followed homosexual advances that reminded McKinney
of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child. Therefore, Tangeman
argued, his client deserves no more than a conviction for
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say attempts by lawyers to mount such a defense
have grown in recent years out of need, as society has become more
tolerant of alternative lifestyles. Beatrice Dohrn, legal director
of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay advocacy
group in New York, said historically lawyers could win lighter
sentences, even acquittals, for defendants accused of violent
crimes against gays simply by playing to a jury's homophobic bias.
</P>
<P>
   But as Americans have grown more accepting of gays and lesbians
and more states are recognizing a victim's sexual orientation as a
basis for prosecution as a hate crime _ 38 states now have such
designations although the federal government does not _ defense
lawyers are finding they can no longer expect juries to respond
based purely on prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Dohrn said, lawyers began designing a strategy
that paints the defendant as victim, selling juries the idea that
the defendant was either acting out of self-defense against
homosexual advances or as a consequence of suspended rational
thinking because a homosexual advance unloosed painful memories of
the defendant's own experience with sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of cases increasing, a colloquial phrase,
gay-panic defense, gained currency within the gay and lesbian
community even as most juries demonstrated an unwillingness to
consider the defendant as a victim. But occasionally, the tactic
has worked.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1998, the same day Shepard was found outside of
Laramie tied to a fence and unconscious, a jury in Honolulu found a
man guilty of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, for beating to
death a gay man who had made sexual advances toward him. The
defendant, Stephen Bright, had been charged with the second-degree
murder of Kenneth Brewer, but successfully argued in court that he
was acting in self-defense, fearing that he would be assaulted for
resisting Brewer's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, who testified that he was not gay, was sentenced to one
year in prison and fined $2,000, prompting gay and lesbian
advocates in Hawaii to complain that the jury gave in to
homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, juries in more than a dozen cases around
the country have rejected gay panic as a defense. Perhaps the most
celebrated case involved Jonathan Schmitz, a guest on the Jenny
Jones talk show who shot and killed a gay man, Scott Amedure, who
admitted during a television taping that he had a crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   After one Michigan jury's second-degree murder conviction was
overturned on appeal, a second jury convicted Schmitz on the same
charge. He had argued that his response was justified for the
humiliation he suffered. The judge did not agree and sentenced him
to 25 to 50 years in prison.

NEW BREED OF BANDS DOESN'T NEED AN ATTITUDE TO ROCK FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unless you're a HUGE Creed fan, or one of their moms, would you
recognize any one them walking down the street?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Creed, a Florida quartet that sounds like Pearl Jam's younger
brothers, is on the road supporting ``Human Clay,'' the band's
second CD and the most popular in the country. Four million people
bought Creed's first CD, ``My Own Prison,'' and thousands are
showing up for their tour, which stops at Dallas' Starplex on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a band that's basically four nondescript-looking _
and, many would argue, nondescript-sounding _ young musicians who
play no-frills, grunge-influenced rock 'n' roll and sing about
basic hopes and frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not alone. Witness the success of other regular-guy
bands such as matchbox 20 (8 million CDs sold), Our Lady Peace
(which opens for Creed at Starplex), Canada's Barenaked Ladies,
Collective Soul and New Orleans' Cowboy Mouth, which recently
headlined a show in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although these bands don't all sound alike, they are bound
together by their often straight-ahead rock 'n' roll and their lack
of image: They don't dress up like drug-addled space aliens, they
don't flash jewelry and furs, they don't sing about committing
suicide or hating the whole world. They don't go in and out of
rehab or get arrested for having a pound of cocaine on their tour
bus. They release CDs, they tour, they get large numbers of people
to sing along and have a good time, and then they do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be based on image,'' says Creed bassist
Brian Marshall, calling from backstage before a show this week in
Colorado Springs. ``We don't get a lot of attention from ``Rolling
Stone'' and MTV, and that's fine with us. The songs are meaningful
and uplifting at points and can work on a vast audience.''
</P>
<P>
   And that could be a working definition of all of the above
bands. Their music is usually about everyday concerns and joys, and
the music rocks without being as hard and angry as Rage Against the
Machine, Korn or Limp Bizkit. Its familiarity is its greatest
asset.
</P>
<P>
   Several musicians and record-company executives say there are a
lot of rock fans who live average, everyday lives and want to hear
music that speaks to their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hootie and the Blowfish outsold Nirvana _ they BOTH tied into
the nation's consciousness,'' says Fred LeBlanc, vocalist and
tireless drummer with Cowboy Mouth, whose sturdy pop and energetic
shows have earned the band a large following throughout the
Southeast. ``People listen to music to find things that relate to
them, and that's what a lot of these bands do. We speak the
language. Everybody knows about love and trying to keep a job and
maybe doing a job you don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc compares the current crop of regular-guy bands to
everyone from Chuck Berry to the Clash to New Wave acts such as the
Replacements. In each case, the performer was writing about
everyday enjoyment and frustration, be it Berry's anthems to cars
and dating in the 'the Clash's portrayal of unemployment in
the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   He knows firsthand how unexciting this can be to the media:
Years ago a record company executive told him mainstream press
would never write about the band because ``I didn't have a drug
addiction, I wasn't worshipping Satan and I wasn't trying to commit
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The label _ my record label _ told me that people weren't
interested in people playing music and celebrating life,'' says
LeBlanc. ``I'm not gonna put a needle in my arm to get copy in
``Rolling Stone'' _ sorry. I'm not even gonna say I do _ and
believe me, a lot of those stories about musicians' drug problems
are planted.''
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, that's not what a lot of music fans want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience for these bands is baby boomers on down to
18-year-olds,'' says Steve Brown, the rock buyer for Tower Records
in Dallas. ``It's just safe, good-time rock 'n' roll _ it's not as
hard as Rage Against the Machine and it's not Britney Spears. Young
people 18 to 24 like it, and it's also palatable to older rock
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of songs about being unhappy _ they just want
rock music, and these guys give it to 'em without all the
peripheral stuff, like who in the band was arrested. People are
tired of Axl Rose and guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And young fans also want a band they can see regularly and watch
develop. Major bands that only put out a CD and tour every three or
four years seem remote, and it's hard to build a fan/band
relationship with acts that come and go on the strength of one big
hit single.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the pop stuff, they have one hit and do really well
but they don't deliver beyond that,'' says Eric Lawrence, Our Lady
Peace's manager. ``Fans want to believe in a band and the band's
career. They want to buy into a band and go see them. These bands
have all been around a while and continue to put out good
records.''

 &HT;    The bear necessities: Compound gives pair all the comforts of
home and more
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pandastic!
</P>
<P>
   Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang will arrive in Atlanta Friday morning
after a long-long flight from China. They'll have jet lag from the
time change and 19 hours in the air. Just as human travelers would,
they'll be confused. Nervous. Easily annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll have to settle into a brand-new, unfamiliar home at
the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   So the least you can do, when you get to see them starting Nov.
20, is to pronounce their names correctly. Nothing less than the
future of giant pandas could be at stake!
</P>
<P>
   Pandas are emotionally sensitive, especially when they're young,
says Zoo Atlanta Director Terry Maple, who's also a psychology
professor at Georgia Tech. And unless the cubbies acclimate, they
may never mate and procreate.
</P>
<P>
   So remember this:
</P>
<P>
   Lun-Lun rhymes roughly with ``loon-loon.'' And Yang-Yang is
pronounced ``yong-yong,'' like ``song-song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to say Yang-Yang like `bang-bang,' ''
says Zoo marketing director Gail Eaton. ``The pandas will be
confused anyway, and they're used to hearing their names in a
Chinese accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the folks at Zoo Atlanta have thought of everything, or so
they hope. The bears' living area is lush and spacious, complete
with gray boulders, new grass and bamboo _ their main food _
sprouting up just outside their steel-fenced compound.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 million facility, the most expensive and advanced panda
habitat anywhere, gives the young bears plenty of room, and, if
they so desire, complete privacy, even from each other.
</P>
<P>
   It has indoor and outdoor facilities, the former of which has
thick-glassed, 25-foot-long windows for gawkers to peer inside. The
pandas can easily retreat to two skylight-lit, climate controlled
``dayrooms'' if the weather turns bad. And if one gets in a mood to
be alone, it'll be free at all times to roam alone to a private
cage, separated from an adjacent one by a small door. Indoor rooms
are decorated with wallpaper made of enlarged photographs of bamboo
jungles.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a private space for making hay, called a ``cubbing
den,'' and another, smaller ``birthing den,'' should they do what
Maple hopes will come naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor area is equipped with log-made climbing towers,
carefully modeled to resemble similar play areas in their old home
at a panda research facility in Chengdu, China. Trees in the zoo
habitat aren't big enough for climbing, but they have been fitted
with electric-wire collars to keep the cubs from trying _ and
falling. And small swimming pools are located both in outdoor and
indoor areas, because pandas love to splash around.
</P>
<P>
   If the pandas want to sneak away from prying eyes, they can at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   Or so they'll think. Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun will be able to avoid
the gaze of people they can see, but specially trained keepers will
sit in a control room 24 hours a day, at least for the first six
months. With 16 globe-shaped camera installations, the keepers will
be able to see or videotape each bear, 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, Maple says, because Zoo Atlanta's $22 million
panda program is aimed at helping scientists better understand the
animals, which almost never mate in captivity. The goal is to solve
the mating puzzle so that pandas, a critically endangered species,
will one day produce healthy offspring routinely.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington's National Zoo, one of only two other American
zoos with giant pandas, there have been several stillbirths. At
least one baby survived but was rolled on by its mother and
suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Zoo recently had a successful birth, the result of
artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money for Zoo Atlanta's project has been raised both
from big corporations and from personal contributions. The money
will keep flowing in, Maple says, ``because people just seem to
love pandas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful animals, different from any other. We'll be
inundated with visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the goal of the panda project is to get the bears to make
love, not money.
</P>
<P>
   If the cubs learn to like each other enough to play together,
Maple says, then it's probable they'll connect, emotionally and
physically, in more important ways.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they're too young to be interested in sex, and
wouldn't know what to do if they did. He's hoping that by the time
they're 5, they'll jive, and Lun-Lun will give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Maple and his crew of professionals will give the bears all the
help they need. If one wants to be alone and the other doesn't, a
keeper will separate them. And fighting won't be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely they will breed, but we really just don't know,''
Maple says. ``The way I believe it happens is through rough and
tumble play. That helps them develop the proper behaviors
associated with mating. It takes maturity and time. But our plan is
to have a baby panda in three years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   After a flight from Chengdu on a domestic carrier, the pandas
are scheduled to leave Beijing at 5:10 p.m. Thursday, Atlanta time,
via United Parcel Service. They'll make a stop in Anchorage,
Alaska, then continue on to Atlanta, where they are expected to
land at Hartsfield International Airport about 9:30 Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Two veterinarians and a panda keeper will check on the bears
almost continually en route.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of reporters from around the country will be at the UPS
hangar near Hartsfield Airport to greet the bears, along with
perhaps 100 other people. But no one except Maple and a few
associates will be allowed near the specially designed cages.
Security will be heavy to prevent overzealous media types from
running out for a scoop.
</P>
<P>
   The cages will be spirited to Zoo Atlanta in a brown UPS van
almost immediately, and within an hour the pandas will be
introduced to their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Given their temperament, it's likely Yang-Yang and Lun-Lun will
find places in their habitat to be alone, at least until they sleep
off their jet lag, Maple says. Zoo officials can only guess how
long it'll take them to become bright-eyed and frisky. The Nov. 20
target date for public viewing might have to be changed if the
pandas don't respond well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what they'll do,'' Maple says. ``We'll have a
schedule that gives them some quiet time. We're just going to do
the best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The bears will be placed in quarantine, seen and touched by only
a few people for a while, Maple says.
</P>
<P>
   So remember, try to pronounce Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang correctly.
And Lun-Lun's the female, so don't say ``Come here, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The way zoo folks see it, you can't be too careful.
</P>
<P>
   Maple's hoping the pandas won't be as anxious as the zoo folks.
Because he concedes that the bamboo eaters have the whole harried
zoo staff pretty, well, bamboozled. Maybe even a bit . . .
pandanoid.

 &HT;    COLUMN: `Liberal' is mentionable, and that's revolutionary
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two South Carolina Republicans were eating barbecue at
a rally for Sen. John McCain a few weeks ago when one voiced the
opinion that Bill Bradley, should he win the Democratic nomination,
would be a formidable opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a basketball player, people like him . . . and he's a
liberal,'' he explained. His friend nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In that passing assessment there may be the evidence of a
significant political shift.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these Republicans worries about Bradley will seem
justified a few months down the road is not the point here. It's
the underlying assumption that to be liberal _ though the word was
pronounced with as much disgust as ever by this conservative voter
_ would give Bradley an advantage in a national election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The political winds of the past decade or so have not reversed
themselves in a year or so. Bradley doesn't bill himself as a stern
liberal, the way Gov. George W. Bush calls himself a compassionate
conservative. It shows how much the very meaning of the words
liberal and conservative have shifted rightward, that McCain _
hawkish, small-government and pro-life _ is characterized by some
as the liberal side of the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the sense of what the South Carolinians were
talking about is detectable in the way the candidates are
presenting themselves this year and how they stack up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The ``l'' word isn't being tossed at opponents with the same
swagger, and the ``c'' word doesn't have the same cachet. If
there's such a thing as a modish political position this year, it's
probably a Ventura-esque disdain for all the old labels.
</P>
<P>
   The change in tone could be heard in last week's Democratic and
Republican debates in New Hampshire _ the way the candidates
answered, but even more so in what the voters asked. They were the
questions of an electorate little inclined toward any ideological
labels, and at least interested in the power of government activism
to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic debate, Gore raised doubts about the viability
of Bradley's big spending proposals, but did not attempt to brand
him as a elitist liberal, the words Gov. Roy Barnes used in
Georgia. On the stump in New Hampshire, energetically condemning
offshore drilling and outlining a national crusade for education,
Gore in fact has seemed far more the inheritor of Hubert Humphrey's
mantle than the dour Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican debate the following night, Steve Forbes, Gary
Bauer and Alan Keyes continued to espouse one or another form of
unbending conservatism, but they were the pack behind the absent
Bush and McCain, conservatives with a more flexible approach. Pat
Buchanan, the fiercest conservative flag-bearer of four years ago,
was absent from the stage altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The climate for liberalism seems more promising in part because
so many establishment conservatives have put their money on Bush
and have little reason to raise their voices at the moment. But
something has changed since the days when candidates in the
farthest districts of Massachusetts and New York were inventing
ingenious ways to call themselves conservatives. Liberal, whatever
it means, is no longer synonymous with doormat.

 &HT;    Group plans offer for Avado Brands
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A management group led by Chief Executive Tom E.
DuPree Jr. plans to make an offer to buy Madison, Ga.-based Avado
Brands.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement coincided with the release of the restaurant
chain's third quarter results, which fell short of analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   DuPree said submission of an offer is ``imminent.'' He declined
to say how much the group, which includes about a dozen top Avado
executives and senior leaders of its four restaurant brands, would
pay for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board of directors is expected to form a special
committee, comprised of the three independent directors, to
evaluate the management proposal and other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we have done enough evaluation to believe our
proposal will have merit,'' DuPree
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question mark is that if they do make a bid for it, is
it one that will be financed and what's the price.'' said Barry
Stouffer, an analyst with J.C. Bradford in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the price was not likely to be much higher ``than where
the stock was in August _ the $7 to $7.50 (a share) range.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was once the largest Applebee's franchisee in the
nation. Formerly known as Apple South, Avado operates Don Pablo's
Mexican Kitchen, Canyon Cafe Southwestern Grill, Hops
Restaurant-Bar-Brewery and McCormick &AMP; Schmick's.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture of 279 Applebee's restaurants was completed
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the company announced it had hired BancBoston
Robertson Stephens to explore new strategies to ``maximize
shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also reported its third quarter results. Net income
was $2.4 million, or 10 cents a share, compared to $24.4 million,
or 58 cents a share, for the like period in 1998. The 1998 results
included a $19.6 million, or 44 cents a share, after-tax gain
related to asset disposals.
</P>
<P>
   First Call had an 18 cents a share estimate.
</P>
<P>
   DuPree said the company was affected by higher-than-expected
costs associated with a Don Pablo's marketing campaign. The
company's sales were negatively impacted by severe weather in Texas
and along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues for the quarter ended Oct. 3 were $157.3 million, down
from $204.4 million for the same period a year earlier. The company
said lower sales reflected the completion of the divestiture of the
Applebee's division. Net sales for the four core brands were $157.3
million, up from $135.2 million.

RACING YACHTS SAILING ON EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., R.I.)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years of planning, design and fixation on the tiniest details
have finally come to this: Catching a light breeze in its sails, a
mighty yacht heaves its sleek form through the chilly New Zealand
waters with sailors straining to understand every nuance of its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Forged by computers, with scale models in wind tunnels and in
towing tests, and by imagination, some of the most unusual vessels
built to ply the seas are setting out to make all the effort
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the America's Cup is under way in Auckland, New
Zealand, and teams from around the world are beginning a long
competition to see if one of them has the boat and the crew capable
of taking the world's most prestigious sailing trophy from the New
Zealand team that captured it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the wooden boats with billowy cotton sails of
yesterday, or even the fiberglass hulls and sheets of woven
synthetic fibers common today, the cup challengers and defenders
steer craft that their builders say shove sailing technology right
to its edge, pushing their materials to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the pinnacle of boat building,'' said Ted Brown,
construction manager for AmericaOne, one of five American groups
vying for the cup. ``This is as high-tech as you can get and
probably the biggest challenge of anyone's boat-building career.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other leading contenders, AmericaOne, representing the St.
Francis Yacht Club of San Francisco, has constructed two boats with
slightly different capabilities to vie against each other and
against competitors in the initial series of elimination races.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 11 teams from seven nations will begin a second
series of round-robin races to determine which will challenge Team
New Zealand. The Prada Challenge team from Italy and boats from
AmericaOne and another American syndicate, Young America, led the
pack after the first round, which ended last Thursday. The eventual
winner will face the New Zealanders, who are known for sailing
innovations and who will be fielding two new boats under their
Black Magic banner. That best-of-nine match is to begin Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The boats are very similar in design and construction because
all must adhere to the rigid International America's Cup class rule
that has governed this type of yacht since the 1992 competition.
The design is based upon a mathematical formula that balances
waterline length, sail area and displacement such that adding
significantly to one dimension requires adjusting the others. Yet,
even within these strictures, designers and builders say there is
room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the rule book and find opportunities to do
better,'' said Duncan MacLane, design and technology manager for
Young America, the syndicate representing the New York Yacht Club
in its bid to regain the cup.
</P>
<P>
   The trophy, first won by the schooner America in 1851 in a race
against British yachts, resided in a case at the club until 1983,
when Australia II, with its innovative winged keel, ended the
longest title defense in sports history and took the cup to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the San Diego Yacht Club recaptured the cup in 1987
and defended it three times before the Royal New Zealand Yacht
Squadron took it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Young America hopes that its two new yachts, the product of
years of research and testing, will return the cup to New York next
year after a 17-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   Putting boats into the water is the end of a design and building
process that takes many teams two or three years, progressing from
initial designs, one-third scale models tested in water tanks and
wind tunnels, to computer programs designed to predict performance
under expected conditions in the Hauraki Gulf off Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that some teams spent up to $10 million for
research and design, plus $3 million to $5 million for each
custom-made boat.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, an America's Cup yacht is 75 to 78 feet long and
weighs 45,000 to 48,000 pounds. The yachts are very much alike but
in races that take two or three hours that are decided by one
boat's crossing the finish line a minute or two ahead of another,
anything that affects speed and performance by even 1 percent is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The designs call for precision measured in thousandths of an
inch, and the use of materials and methods normally seen in the
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most critical parts of the yacht is the hull, and the
building material of choice has become carbon fiber composites,
displacing wood, aluminum and even fiberglass because of their
strength and light weight. Used extensively in aircraft, composites
are made of fibers bonded by a resin or polymer glue that are
applied in layers to build up a structure and hardened by heat for
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Like expert cooks, builders use similar recipes for constructing
hulls of composites, but vary their techniques to squeeze
improvements from the process that they hope will result in a
better boat coming out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   AmericaOne's two boats were built by Westerly Marine of Costa
Mesa, Calif., and Brown, the construction manager, said that about
17,000 hours of labor went into each craft. ``Even though we use a
lot of state-of-the-art machinery, actual construction requires a
lot of time-consuming, hands-on labor,'' he said. ``It takes some
finesse to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Goetz of Goetz Custom Sailboats in Bristol, R.I., who built
the two yachts for Young America, says oven curing makes the
material stronger while allowing use of less resin, which means
less weight. ``The idea is to make the boat as light as possible
but strong enough to stay in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   A boat starts out as a designer's computer files, some of which
are used to guide laser or mechanical cutters that carve out wooden
molds that define the shape of the hull. These plywood forms, cut
in precise shapes and sizes, are lined up in an exact sequence at
intervals, like ribs, to define the boat's shape. Then this
skeleton is covered with thin, wooden strips, and then plywood and
a layer of either carbon fiber or fiberglass to produce a shell
over which the actual hull is built.
</P>
<P>
   The hull built over the mold is to consist of a core of
honeycomb material, made of aluminum or a tough synthetic product,
sandwiched between two layers of carbon fiber skin. Each layer of
skin is made by putting down successive sheets of resin-impregnated
carbon fiber, which comes in 12-inch-wide rolls, and heating the
material for hours at 220 degrees Fahrenheit to cure it into a
hardened material.
</P>
<P>
   To heat a hull that is almost 80 feet long, builders encase the
mold in an insulated structure built inside the warehouse-like
buildings they use for normal boat construction. This giant oven, a
building within a building, not only is heated to cure composite
materials, they say, but also helps hide the design from potential
spies from rival groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Different builders vary the sequence for heat-curing the
composite sandwich hull, with some curing the inner layer first,
and then applying the honeycomb and second layer to the first
before the next warming cycle to activate and harden the resin.
Goetz puts the first composite layer and the honeycomb together for
the initial heat treatment, he said, but first puts the entire
structure in a giant nylon bag and pumps the air out. This
compresses the materials and squeezes out air pockets for a
smoother seal.
</P>
<P>
   After the final cure, the hull is removed from the mold and
checked for unevenness and flaws, Brown said. If needed, the
surface is sanded and imperfections filled with resin compound
before the boat's shape is checked against the designer's original
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The owners and designers are not the only ones to inspect the
hull. To check compliance with America's Cup hull rules, race
officials visit each completed shell and drill a half-dozen core
holes in it to see if it meets regulations for maximum thickness
and materials. ``The holes are easy to repair, but seeing your boat
drilled is a very unsettling experience,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   After the boat is painted (with as little paint as possible, to
save weight), the hull is turned over and internal supports added
before the deck, also made of composites but built and cured
separately, is attached. Then the boat's mast, boom, rigging and
other hardware are added to complete the vessel before it is partly
disassembled for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Cup challengers need to get their hulls built as precisely as
possible to take advantage of their research. Young America team
members enlisted Brown &AMP; Sharpe, a manufacturing company in North
Kingston, R.I., which specializes in precision measurement, to help
with making their boats and aligning appendages and other parts
when attached.
</P>
<P>
   The company used a new laser scanner capable of measuring
complex curved surfaces to check the Young America hulls with an
accuracy of one millimeter over 70 feet, a level not previously
possible, said MacLane, Young America's design and technology
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could evaluate the mold before we put the carbon fiber
on,'' MacLane said, ``and the more accurate the mold, hopefully,
the more accurate the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   There are early signs that the New York group may have achieved
some of its precision goals. When the first boat arrived in
Auckland, it was immediately noticed that it had a shiny, black
hull much like Team New Zealand's yachts. However, the hull of the
American boat is not painted and the blackness is the natural color
of its carbon fiber components covered with a clear seal.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Baird, the Young America team captain, told onlookers that
the hull was unpainted because it was made exceptionally smooth and
did not need paint to cover up fillers normally used to repair
imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   Another noticeable feature on the new boat was a wing mast,
similar to the kind seen on the New Zealand boats in the last
competition. This mast, and the other poles and pulleys on the
boat, was made by Hall Spars of Bristol, R.I., of carbon fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago, masts for large sailing boats were
usually made of aluminum and were little more than tall, hollow
poles. Now, racing boat masts are taking on the shape of airfoils,
with contours similar to those of thin airplane wings placed
vertically in the deck to direct airflow during certain maneuvers
to improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   A third major area of research is sail design, with teams
changing the shapes, sizes and materials used for sails to make
them more versatile, durable and lighter. Young America and America
One are working with teams from North Sails Inc., an international
sailmaker, on new types of sails for their boats.
</P>
<P>
   North Sails has developed a process it calls 3DL that produces a
laminated, one-piece sail that can be molded in three dimensions
into any shape to give it the characteristics desired by a
designer. Mainsails traditionally are made by assembling numerous
panels of cloth to form curved shapes, a design that puts undue
pressure on seams that causes them to stretch and distort the
shape.
</P>
<P>
   With 3DL technology, technicians in the manufacturer's plant in
Minden, Nev., use a designer computer graphics file to create an
electronic mold that instructs a large, flat surface machine the
size of a sail to bend itself into the desired shape. A single
sheet of Mylar plastic goes over the mold and a device on an
overhead gantry moves over the surface putting down a specified
pattern of structural fiber threads made of tough material like
Kevlar. Once the reinforcing yarn is in place, a second sheet of
plastic film goes on top to sandwich it in and the whole mold is
encased in a vacuum bag to compress the laminate. A moving heat
source then passes over the sail to cure it and set its shape.
</P>
<P>
   The finished, one-piece sail can weigh up to a third less than a
conventional sail, and it holds its shape better under a wide range
of wind and sea conditions, users say.
</P>
<P>
   A set of sails made of composite materials costs $30,000 to
$50,000 and each boat requires more than a dozen sets for the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the designing, planning and building for the America's
Cup challenge is over, but as the boats battle one another in the
coming months, each team will have opportunities to adjust and
refine its designs and tactics, reacting to competitors'
innovations and skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of smart guys trying to win the cup and nobody
has a monopoly on good ideas,'' said MacLane of Young America. ``We
just hope we are smarter and made the right choices.''

ALTERED ITINERARIES AS THE WORLD HEATS UP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 7) 
(jt) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It probably isn't necessary to cancel or change vacation plans
just yet, but global warming _ if it develops as forecast _
promises in time to revise travelers' lists of preferred
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   A warmer, more pleasant England, for instance, might replace an
extremely hot Greece as a summer vacation spot of choice.
Beachgoers, skiers, scuba divers, autumn leaf-peepers, anglers and
just plain sightseers all may have to find new places to go, and
some of today's prized destinations may wither as new ones blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Or so says a recent study conducted for the World Wildlife Fund
by the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in
England.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual surface temperature of the globe has already
risen by about 1 degree or a little more over the last century; in
many parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the warming has been much
greater.
</P>
<P>
   Computer models of the atmosphere forecast a further rise of 2
to 6 degrees over the next century, with a best estimate of about
3.5 degrees, if industry and motor vehicles continue to spew
heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air at today's rates. By
comparison, the world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the
depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some regions would warm more, some less, and some may actually
cool. But in any region where the average annual temperature rises,
climate experts say, high summer temperatures are expected to
become even higher. In general, climatic zones would shift
northward in the Northern Hemisphere, southward in the Southern,
and from lower to higher altitudes globally. And everywhere, the
sea level would rise _ by about 20 inches globally over the
century, according to best estimates _ with potentially grave
consequences for beach resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Projections of this sort are inherently chancy, but they are all
that scientists have to go on. So the climate experts at East
Anglia used computer models to look at the possible effect of
global warming on 10 of the world's favorite tourist destinations
over the next century. And while the study was geared toward
Britons, it has relevance for Americans, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _Rising seas and a subsequent increase in beach erosion could
eliminate many beaches and even submerge large parts of some
popular islands, like the Maldives. Florida could be particularly
vulnerable to beach erosion, the study said. Some Caribbean islands
could be similarly affected, said David Viner, a co-author of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   _Higher temperatures could kill coral ecosystems, eliminating
scuba-diving meccas from the Caribbean to the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
   _Ski resorts at lower elevations, like those at Garmisch in
Germany and Kitz-buhel in Austria, might suffer from less snow,
causing skiers to crowd higher-elevation resorts. Similar shifts
could take place in North America.
</P>
<P>
   _Rising temperatures could encourage the spread of malaria from
North Africa to southern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   _Hotter summers in the eastern Mediterranean, where the number
of days with temperatures higher than 100 degrees would increase,
may discourage summer visits to Greece and Turkey. But summer
weather in England should become warmer and more reliable,
encouraging many Britons to stay home and attracting more foreign
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In many tourist areas, the study said, warmer temperatures might
stimulate disease outbreaks, more forest fires and more air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   A warming climate, Viner said, could shift the range of some
sport fish; in the United States, anglers pursuing these fish make
major contributions to local economies. Trout and salmon, for
instance, are cold-water fish, and previous studies have shown that
their habitat and range could be substantially reduced as streams
warm up. On the other hand, the range of warm-water species like
bass could expand.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have also suggested that in New England, trees with
relatively dull fall colors, like oaks and hickories, could
eventually move up from the Middle Atlantic and replace the
brilliant maples that draw crowds of foliage admirers every autumn.
</P>
<P>
   How soon might these consequences be felt? Assuming the
forecasts are reasonably accurate, it depends largely on whether
climate change proceeds smoothly or in abrupt temperature jumps.
</P>
<P>
   One example of how global warming might be a mixed blessing: In
Alaska, where substantial warming has already taken place, the
tourist season has been lengthened. But if it gets warm enough, the
thawing of Alaska could eliminate many of the subarctic charms that
make it so attractive.

 &HT;    `One of the greatest': Walter Payton 1954-1999
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Payton's soft-spoken nature won him the nickname
``Sweetness.'' The powerful running style that earned him a place
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame proved that moniker to be a
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, the NFL's all-time leading rusher, died Monday of liver
disease that was untreatable because of cancer. He was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who rushed for 16,726 yards during his 13-year career
with the Chicago Bears, disclosed in February that he was suffering
from primary sclerosing cholangitis, a rare disease that scars and
blocks the bile ducts of the liver. During treatment for that
disease, doctors discovered that Payton had advanced bile-duct
cancer. The malignancy prevented Payton from receiving a new liver,
according to his physician, Dr. Greg Gores, of the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Payton died at his home in Barrington, Ill., a suburb of
Chicago, about noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter was an inspiration in everything he did,'' said NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who called Payton, ``one of the
greatest players in the history of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tremendous grace and dignity he displayed in his final
months reminded us again why 'Sweetness' was the perfect nickname
for Walter Payton,'' Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Payton's health were prompted last week when his
son, Jarrett, a freshman running back at the University of Miami,
left the team and returned to Chicago. On Sunday, radio stations in
New York and Philadelphia reported erroneously that Payton had
died. A family friend told the Associated Press on Sunday that
Payton's condition had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 12 months have been extremely tough on me and my
family,'' Jarrett Payton said Monday at a news conference in
Chicago. ``But through these difficult times, we've learned a lot
about love and life. From the days in February when my dad told the
world about his liver disease, the outpouring of love and support
from around the world astounded even him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a runner, the 5-foot-10, 220-pound Payton could run over or
around would-be tacklers. Payton was an exceptional receiver _ he
holds the Bears record with 492 career catches _ and a punishing
blocker. He also was known for a powerful stiff-arm and his
extraordinary ability to leap over pileups near the goal line.

   ``There were guys who ran with the ball better, faster,'' said
New Orleans Saints coach Mike Ditka, who coached Payton for six
seasons in Chicago. ``But I don't think anyone ever ran with more
determination than Walter. . . . The will is a powerful thing, and
Walter had a great will and heart. When you look at Walter, his
impact on the game was on the field and off of it. He was the
epitomy of class. He handled himself with such humility and
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Drafted fourth overall in the 1975 draft, Payton played on only
two winning teams in his first nine seasons with the Bears. In
1977, in only his third year in the league, Payton won his first of
two MVP awards by rushing for 1,852 yards and 14 touchdowns, both
career highs. He ran for 275 yards against Minnesota that season,
which still stands as the NFL's single-game rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka arrived before a strike-shortened season in 1982, and the
Bears made the playoffs four seasons in a row, 1984-87. Payton and
the ``Monsters of the Midway'' defense led Chicago to a 46-10
victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX in 1986.
Payton gained 61 yards in that game but did not score.
</P>
<P>
   Having surpassed Jim Brown's NFL rushing record by more than
4,000 yards, Payton retired after the 1987 season, and the Bears
immediately retired his No. 34 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to set the record so high that the next person who
tries for it, it's going to bust his heart,'' Payton once said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1993, his first
year of eligibility, and he asked Jarrett to be the first son to
present his father for induction in the Hall. Payton still holds
nine NFL and 28 Bears records. Payton played in nine Pro Bowls and
missed only one game, during his rookie season after a coach
wouldn't let him play because of a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, born in Columbia, Miss., attended Division I-AA Jackson
State and led the NCAA in scoring in 1973 with 160 points. A
two-time All-American in college, Payton finished fourth in 1974 in
voting for the Heisman Trophy, which was awarded to Ohio State's
Archie Griffin for the second year in a row. Payton left college as
the NCAA's all-time leading scorer with 464 career points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first running back that I ever saw that I
respected,'' former Bears linebacker Mike Singletary said. ``He
gave me a new respect for running backs. The way he prepared made
me believe that he could have been a great defensive player. But
his attitude for life was what made you want to be around him. He
was definitely a bright spot wherever darkness appeared.''

THE FRAGILITY OF FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driving a car is far more risky. Earthquakes can kill more
people. Fatal illness can be equally inexplicable. But when a plane
falls out of the sky, the living world catches its breath, knocks
on wood, and ponders the fragility of a perfect October day.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a relentless media assault that makes us all into
electronic rubberneckers, we pick over the clues and engage in wild
speculation _ and the less of that applied to EgyptAir's Flight 990
the better. The heat of conspiracy theories surrounding the crash
of TWA's Flight 800 to Paris in 1996 _ that it was caused by a
missile attack, a terrorist bomb, a criminal act _ has cooled to
the relatively mundane conclusion of a fuel tank explosion.
</P>
<P>
   We feel a kinship with the 219 EgyptAir victims, and not just
because they plunged into waters south of Nantucket. Air travel has
become common enough for many of us to have been on that model
plane, or flown that route, or departed from that airport. So there
but for the grace of God go we: Virginia Chaplin and Richard Brokaw
of Maine, newlyweds in their 70s who planned a vacation down the
Nile; Salah Adam of Toronto, with his wife and two small children,
missionaries en route to refugee camps in Sudan; Jan Duckworth, 69,
of Denver, one of 54 people who boarded the plane as part of a tour
booked through a Boston travel agency. And the others.
</P>
<P>
   Air travel is familiar, even common, but there is still a small
shudder at the hubris of man to be hurtling, like Icarus, toward
the sun.

CAPETOWN   CONSIDERS OFFERING A GUIDE TO ITS BETTER BROTHELS

<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ This city's brothels, the unwanted
stepchildren in the venerable roster of tourist attractions here,
would like nothing more than to be brought into the family. An idea
floated by the tourism chief may finally give the ``good'' ones the
very imprimatur of legitimacy they crave.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the growing number of visitors inquiring about Cape
Town's thriving illegal sex trade, the tourism manager here has
begun talking about helping tourists find safe sex by identifying
brothels that are well run.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan isn't likely to land the brothels a plug in the
Michelin Guide (the businesses are still illegal, after all), it
would be the closest they could ever come to earning a Good
Housekeeping seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the idea has touched off a predictable stir on radio
call-in shows and a spate of headlines about the city's efforts to
``lure'' sex-hungry tourists. But they are missing the point, says
Sheryl Ozinsky, Cape Town's tourism manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly not going to promote the industry,'' she
said. ``We are merely trying to come to terms with an industry that
has existed for thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But how to do it _ and whether to do it _ is a delicate question
in South Africa. Few countries have been hit harder by AIDS, and
anything that might worsen the crisis is met with scrutiny. More
than 3.6 million of the country's 44 million people are infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, a particularly painful burden
as the nation tries to build a strong post-apartheid economy.
</P>
<P>
   The country hopes the tourism industry will help drive that
economy, and Cape Town is the industry's crown jewel. Set around
spectacular Table Mountain and overlooking the waters of the
Atlantic Ocean, Cape Town has drawn visitors ever since Dutch
explorers settled here in the middle of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the city continues to draw more tourists than any other
place in the country, tourism officials say. More than 100
brothels, employing from five to 25 women (and in a few cases,
men), cater to a fair number of those visitors, said Jill Sloan,
the director of the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force
in Cape Town, known as Sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat wants to make the sex industry safer for sex workers and
their clients, including tourists, by identifying brothels where
customers are least likely be beaten, robbed or infected with HIV
and where workers are most likely to be paid adequately and treated
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   By recognizing such brothels, Sweat thinks it can induce others
to follow along and help curb the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In October, as part of a pilot project by Sweat, a code of
standards was adopted by a handful of gay brothels that hope to end
up on any official list created for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Potgieter thinks his club, where such standards are
already in place, should be on top of the list. The club, which is
called Paradise and caters to straight men, was the first to ask
tourism officials about setting up a referral system for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about my girls,'' said Potgieter, 50, whose club is
officially licensed as a massage parlor. ``They're like family.
It's not always a pleasant job, so I have to respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Set on the sixth floor of an unassuming commercial building in
the city's central business district, the ``adult salon'' feels a
bit like the spas at trendy American clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A few soft lights lead the way past racks of towels to the
salon's eight rooms. Bottles of baby oil sit on glass stands inside
and terry cloth robes hang behind the doors. Next to the oils there
are condoms, male and female.
</P>
<P>
   By Sweat's account, Potgieter runs a good business. But even if
organizations like Sweat can come up with a list and monitor the
places on it, how to pass on the information is the tricky
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know the way forward, to tell you the truth,'' Ms.
Ozinsky said. ``We're trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bray, general manager of the Cape Sun Intercontinental,
one of Cape Town's biggest hotels, said the idea might make sense.
He knows that the sex industry is not going away. So, rather than
see it ignored, he too would like to see it managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter where you
are. I think you have to come to terms with it and find the best
way to manage it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But what of Cape Town's image? And the country's moral fabric?
</P>
<P>
   Would the city, asked one angry caller to a radio talk show,
move into the ranks of cities like Bangkok and Amsterdam, which are
often noted for their bordellos?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, said Bray and others, who said Cape Town could
take comfort in the experiences of a city like Hamburg, which, they
said, has learned to manage the sex trade without allowing the sex
trade to manage the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why it should be seen negatively,'' Bray said.
``If you deal with prostitution openly and transparently, and it's
managed and controlled, it should not shut us off from the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Awa Marie Coll-Sack, policy director for the U.N.'s AIDS
program, said other countries had helped curb the spread of HIV by
working with prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, where prostitution remains illegal, the police
worked with prostitutes and social workers to encourage safer sex,
she said in a telephone interview from Geneva. In Ms. Coll-Sack's
native country, Senegal, where regulated prostitution was legal
even before AIDS, the infection rate has remained considerably
lower than in many other African nations.
</P>
<P>
   But, she warned, the threat of HIV infection among prostitutes
and their customers has not been eliminated in either place. ``You
can't just say that because of a law, everything is safe, '' Ms.
Coll-Sack said.

SMITH REJOINS GOP, SEEKS ENVIRONMENT PANEL LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is poised to alter the course of its
environmental committee for the first time in decades by selecting
a pro-business leader as its next chairman _ either James M. Inhofe
of Oklahoma or Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who Monday rejoined the
Republican Party and made a bid for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Not in 30 years has a pro-business senator chaired the powerful
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and its most recent
head, the late Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, was dubbed
by environmentalists as one of the ``greenest'' leaders on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Smith made an open plea for the post, which would have
been rightfully his had he not left the Republican Party in August.
Renouncing his switch to be an independent, Smith declared he was
switching back to the GOP and implied becoming chairman was his top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``To assume the chairmanship would give me the opportunity to
help accomplish what my goal has been all along _ to make
conservative policy the national policy,'' Smith said. ``It would
be irresponsible of me to delay this announcement as it could
potentially jeopardize the chairmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   After Smith, Inhofe is the second-most senior Republican on the
committee. In the opinion of the Sierra Club, the decision between
the two is a ``competition between bad and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith considers himself an environmentalist, both he
and Inhofe have low ratings from the League of Conservation Voters,
which ranks public officials according to how they vote on
environmental issues. While Chafee rated a 70 _ meaning he voted on
the side of environmental groups 70 percent of the time _ Smith's
lifetime average is 36. In the previous session of Congress, his
rating was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe's numbers are lower still, with a lifetime average of 7.
In the previous session, he rated zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either one is bad news for the environment,'' said Allen
Mattison, spokesman for the Sierra Club. ``Smith is slightly not as
bad as Inhofe, which is about as faint praise as I can give. But
comparing yourself to Inhofe and saying, `I'm an environmentalist,'
is pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hickey, a spokeswoman for Smith, responded: ``Sierra Club
thinks environmental protection lies in the federal government. We
think its best left in the hands of localities.''
</P>
<P>
   To business leaders, the selection of either senator would be
welcome after years of battling the restrictions of the
Environmental Protection Agency with little congressional help.
Both Smith and Inhofe have worked on their behalf in the past,
advocating fewer federal restrictions on costly environmental
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Inhofe unsuccessfully opposed an
EPA initiative to lower the percentage of sulfur in gasoline. And
he successfully defeated a measure that would have required
chemical facilities to divulge the dangerous contents inside the
plants, citing national security.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has more of a mixed record that includes some measures
environmentalists support, such as helping pass the 1996 battery
recycling law and pushing Congress to restore money to the federal
Land and Water Conservation Fund in 1997. But his pet project, a
redesign of the superfund program, has come under harsh attack from
conservationists. Although Smith says his bill would speed the
cleaning up of hazardous waste by exempting some small businesses
and redefining liability, environmental groups worry Smith would
weaken hazardous waste laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would weaken the aspect of the law that makes polluters pay
for the mess they created,'' Mattison said. ``We're afraid that if
Smith is in the chairman's seat, this will move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is Smith's intent. In a statement released
Monday, he spelled out his enthusiasm for running the committee and
for rejoining the party he left in a fit of pique earlier this
year. At the time, Smith said he was leaving the GOP out of
principle as he launched his grass-roots presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign ground to a halt last week, and Smith dropped his
bid without having ever gotten more than 1 percent in the polls.
Then, after Chafee's death, Smith hinted at a party re-switch. He
made it formal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have received thousands of calls, letters and e-mails from
wonderful people who agree with me that we, as conservative
Americans, need to unite and advance a strong, forceful agenda,''
Smith said. But, he said, ``they pleaded with me to come back and
fight within the party. People that I respect and trust told me _
in no uncertain terms _ that I had become a lightning rod for
divisiveness, not the rallying and unifying factor that I had hoped
to be in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Smith said, he technically never left the GOP. The
reason: The town councilors who approve party switches had not yet
held a meeting since Smith filled out his party card three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, during all these weeks of controversy, I've actually been
a Republican after all!'' Smith said.

A TRUE PATH TOWARD MIDEAST PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Oslo, where Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Yasser
Arafat, and President Clinton have gathered to honor the
assassinated Israeli peacemaker Yitzhak Rabin, all the public talk
has been of process and timetables. ``I would feel that real
progress had been made if they made agreements about the modalities
under which they will proceed,'' Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But issues of substance can no longer be postponed. Barak's
commitment to a compressed calendar _ a framework for agreement by
February and a final-status accord by the end of next year _
compels the parties to clarify their positions now.
</P>
<P>
   The contours of Israel's stance were described Monday in the
Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. The central point of an account leaked
to the paper by the Barak government is that the framework
agreement in February will authorize the Palestinians to establish
an independent state before the signing of a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain irony in the rationale for this sequence,
given the history of Israeli opposition to a sovereign state for
Palestinians. The Barak government recognizes that a Palestinian
state must come into being before a final agreement is reached,
because at present neither the PLO nor the Palestinian Authority
can sign what Ha'aretz calls ``an international agreement that
settles the conflict between two sovereign states.''
</P>
<P>
   If that agreement is to prohibit the Palestinian state from
forming alliances with other parties hostile to Israel, as Barak
will insist, then the guarantee must be given by the new state, not
by a precursor organization. In this manner form becomes content;
the diplomatic calendar dictates the substance of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators are also talking about expanding Jerusalem to
include Palestinian neighborhoods, making possible an undivided
city that may nevertheless serve as capital for two separate
states. Rabin's goal, a negotiated peace agreement, is no longer
the mirage of visionaries.

FRIENDS, FAMILIES RECALL PERSONALITIES OF FLIGHT 990 DEAD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One passenger was once kidnapped by Kurdish rebels.
Another couple were missionaries going to visit refugees in the
Sudan. A woman from Chicago was traveling as a birthday present to
herself. She had just turned 80.
</P>
<P>
   And a retired surgeon, who loved ``working cattle'' on his
family's Colorado ranch more than anything else, pushed himself to
go on a two-week Egypt tour because ``he kind of thought his time
was limited,'' his son said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On EgyptAir Flight 990, they were among the 217 people on board,
all now presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping sense, the passenger list, released Monday by the
airline, wasn't that different from the profiles of other New
York-to-Cairo flights. Nearly a third were Egyptian and nearly
two-thirds were American or Canadian tourists, all steeling
themselves for an 11-hour flight over the Atlantic, anticipating
going home, a trip of a lifetime or simply an adventure among
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline's manifest tells no stories about the people in
the almost-full flight. That was left to friends and relatives
Monday. They told fascinating stories, everyday stories that
revealed character. They told stories you might hear if you sat
next to the person on the airplane, full of facts, dreams, fears
and hope of what awaited them in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   It's what binds the 217 now, the people they left behind, their
friends and families telling stories about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about my dad was that he liked people. He had a
lot of patience,'' said Kevin McCulloch, 36, whose father, Tom, 72,
was on the flight. Tom McCulloch, a retired surgeon from Durango,
Colo., was traveling with a friend, John Voelker, 70. They had both
signed up for an Elderhostel two-week trip that was to be full of
lectures on ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad would get out on the ranch whenever he could. Even when
he was practicing, he would take off Wednesday afternoons and by 1
p.m. he was out working cattle,'' Kevin McCulloch said. ``My mom
died 10 years ago this month, and my dad had never done any
traveling before that. He kind of thought his time was limited and
he needed to get out and see some of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From Toronto, Salah Adam, his wife Saline and their two
children, Joshua, 4, and Rebecca, 22 months, were on their way to
Sudan for a wedding, to see family and friends and then to visit
refugee camps. It was only natural for them. They were
missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Rhodes traveled from Chicago. She had turned 80 on July
11, and Egypt was the latest in her long life of travel, which
included visits to China, Russia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and all over
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had some challenges with arthritis, but she had no problem
figuring out how to get around. She had an independent spirit and
was outspoken and opinionated _ just about everything,'' said the
Rev. Leonetta Bugleisi of Beverly Unitarian Church in Chicago. ``I
think Egypt was one of the last wonderful places that she hadn't
gotten to. She had a little anxiety about planning, though. And she
had made some tongue-in-cheek jokes to her friends that she might
not come back from this trip alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about flying, of course, aren't unusual. Harry Kolander,
79, of San Ramon, Calif., worried about his wife, Imilda, 66,
traveling alone. His diabetes made it difficult for him to travel,
and he encouraged her to continue to see the world without him. In
1991, she had visited Turkey and was one of five people held
hostage by Kurdish rebels for three days, escaping with the tour
director by scrambling over a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Imilda Kolander boarded a flight in Los Angeles and met in New
York with a group organized by Grand Circle Travel in Boston. On
the way to the Los Angeles airport, Harry Kolander told the Contra
Costa Times, his wife talked about something bad happening on the
flight. He said she told him, ``If that will happen, I do hope it's
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Also boarding an American Airlines flight in Los Angeles were
four Orange County women who played cards together every Thursday
night for years, the youngest was 57, the oldest 82. Their names
were Judy Bowman, Beverly Grant, Sheila Jaffee and Tobey Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   The four, who joined the EgyptAir flight in New York, had spent
a year of Thursday nights planning an agenda as they played cards,
talking about motoring down the Nile on a cruise ship to Luxor and
Aswan, perhaps riding a camel to the Pyramids outside Cairo and
then heading north to the Sea of Galilee in Israel to walk where
Jesus walked.
</P>
<P>
   In West Point, Miss., Edmund Miller Sr., and his wife Hannah,
both in their 70s, were excited about the same trip _ they, too,
had booked the same tour.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Miller was a retired Navy captain, and he had settled in
the northeastern Mississippi town of 12,000 people because it was
where he grew up. His grandfather was pastor of the First Baptist
Church at the turn of the century, said the current pastor, the
Rev. Gary Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were Christians,'' the minister said. ``They were very
much looking forward to the trip to Israel. They loved this church.
And they were both loved here. Hannah Miller was a very giving
person, concerned particularly for the elderly. She made sure two
people in particular were watched over. I've talked to one of them
and it's very hard, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Elzanaty will tell you it's hard for all those left
behind now.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his mother and father, Abdu and Fawqia Elzanaty of the
Heliopolis section of Cairo on the flight. All four of the couple's
children now live in the United States, so the parents visit for
two or three months every year. But at the end of each year's trip,
Hisham Elzanaty said, his parents are always eager about getting
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to get them to stay longer,'' said Hisham
Elzanaty, 40, the second oldest child. ``They always like to get
back to their nest in Cairo. But when they are here, they make so
many friends. My father, he's friends to all my friends. He's
worked all his life. He's a contractor for an oil company, and he's
out of the house at 9 in the morning and not home until 9 at night.
That's pretty good for someone 74. He had a big presence in life.''
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss my parents. I'll miss their presence,'' Hisham
Elzanaty said. ``You miss the thing that you lean on, and now it's
sort of like I'm on my own. I have a wife, three children, and
another one due in three weeks, but you always look for your
parents no matter how old you get. You still may think you're a
little kid sometimes, and you want them to lean on.''

TEXAS JUDGE REFUSES TO STOP FORMER PLAYMATE'S BANKRUPTCY CLAIM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the second time in a week, a Texas judge refused
to stop former Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith from pursuing her
bankruptcy claim in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris County Probate Judge Mike Wood on Monday
declined to grant an injunction preventing Smith from continuing
her bankruptcy trial that started last week, lawyers said the judge
again expressed ``strong concern'' that the bankruptcy court may
interfere with his jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Wood's ruling presumably means that Smith's
bankruptcy trial, which resumes Wednesday, will be completed
Friday, as scheduled. The bankruptcy court's jurisdiction to
enforce any orders could be challenged after it makes a final
ruling, lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel L. Bufford in Los Angeles has
raised concerns about jurisdiction by issuing an order in May that
Smith is entitled to half of the wealth amassed by her deceased
billionaire husband, J. Howard Marshall II. Her lawyers have said
the fortune is worth more than $1.6 billion, and Smith should get
$820 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bufford did not make the ruling based on the merits of the case,
but to sanction Marshall's younger, son, E. Pierce Marshall, 60, of
Dallas, for allegedly destroying evidence and not showing up for
depositions. E. Pierce Marshall, who took over his father's oil
business, claims he was willed the entire fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 31, who was married to J. Howard Marshall II for 14
months before he died in 1995 at age 90, claims he promised her
half of his wealth if she married him. She maintains E. Pierce
Marshall defrauded her out of her inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall's attorney Don Fogel said Monday that
Bufford's rulings may not only affect his client, but also other
parties who claim they are owed a piece of the estate.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's elder of two sons, J. Howard Marshall III, 63, of Los
Angeles has sued his brother in Houston's Harris County for
fraudulently denying him half of the estate he says he is owed. E.
Pierce Marshall says the father disinherited the elder son over a
1980 business dispute. Bufford did not allow the elder son to
intervene in the bankruptcy matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Harris County) court is very concerned that the
bankruptcy court, if it enters the judgment (Smith) seeks, would be
interfering with the court's jurisdiction and the rights of other
claimants,'' Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Other entities making claims to the fortune are Yale University,
where the deceased Marshall earned a law degree, and Haverford
University in Pennsylvania, where he earned an undergraduate
degree.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fogel said Wood told attorneys Monday that if Smith's bankruptcy
was in a Houston federal court, the presiding judge would have
likely postponed the proceedings pending the outcome of the probate
case. Fogel said all federal bankruptcy judges have to follow the
same jurisdiction laws, and he did not know why Bufford is not
postponing the matter in his court.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorneys have claimed that they are not interfering
with Wood's jurisdiction because they are only making claims
against E. Pierce Marshall in bankruptcy court, not against the
estate.
</P>
<P>
   But since E. Pierce Marshall's wealth primarily comes from the
family business willed to him, Fogel said it would be impossible
for Bufford issue a monetary judgment against his client without
dividing the estate.
</P>
<P>
   E. Pierce Marshall's attorneys have denied their client did
anything to warrant such severe sanctions in bankruptcy court. They
said the evidence that was allegedly destroyed were business
documents that their client routinely discarded and which were
easily available through other sources.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said that a lawyer handling the estate's taxes
has possession of some of the documents and has been unwilling to
give them up. They said E. Pierce Marshall has no authority to tell
the lawyer to give up the documents. &QL;

EXCURSION TO MONTEVIDEO  
 GRAND CANYON FROM ABOVE

   Excursion to Montevideo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. During a short visit to Buenos Aires this fall we will have a
free day and wondered if it would be possible to take a day tour of
Montevideo with an English-speaking guide. _ Anthony A. Leach,
Eastham, Mass.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The best way to get across the Rio de la Plata from Buenos
Aires to Montevideo, Uruguay, is by ferry or plane.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry takes two and a half hours and costs $107 round trip
and $53 one way on both lines that operate on the route:
Ferry-lineas, telephone (54-11) 4314 0228, fax (54-11) 4314 1190,
and Buquebus, telephone (54-11) 4316 6500, no fax.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``hydrofoil'' may call up an image of speed. And, in
fact, the hydrofoil takes a mere 45 minutes across the Rio de la
Plata to Colonia, Uruguay, a town that's worth a visit if you have
the time. But coursing through Uruguay's hilly terrain by bus adds
three hours of travel time.
</P>
<P>
   The hydrofoil run by Ferry-lineas is about $66 round trip and
$31 one way, and the bus to Montevideo is $16 round trip, $8 one
way.
</P>
<P>
   Five hydrofoils and five ferries depart on weekdays from Buenos
Aires during the summer. The first ferry leaves at 8 a.m. and the
first hydrofoil at 8:20 a.m. Returning from Montevideo the last
ferry leaves at 6:40 p.m. and the last hydrofoil at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With limited time, you may want to consider flying one or both
ways. The flight is only 40 minutes, and for much of the day planes
leave almost every hour between Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos
Aires and Aeropuerto Internacional Carrasco, about a half-hour
outside of Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
   The three main airlines that fly the route are Lapa, Aerolineas
Argentinas and Pluna. A round-trip ticket costs $150 and one way is
$68.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are interested in shopping, a half day is all it
takes to see the city's highlights. English-speaking tours usually
cover the Ciudad Vieja, the Colonial Town Hall, the Cathedral,
Centenario Park, the Cerro (from which one can see the city) and
the highway along the Rio de la Plata.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies in Monte-video you might try for half-day
tours are Jetmar, (598-2) 902 0793, Viajes Bueme, (598-2) 902 1050,
and M.T. International, (598-2) 902 2672. A private tour costs $46
a person but if you join a group of 5 to 15, the price drops to
about $15. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer, these companies offer sightseeing in the morning,
a visit to a shopping center in the afternoon and then transfer to
the airport or a hotel. In addition to the charge of $46 a person
for sightseeing, tack on $24 for the shopping stop and $12 an hour
for waiting time while you roam the aisles. &QL;

   Grand Canyon From Above &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are hoping to visit the Grand Canyon next year.
Can you tell me about tours by helicopter or small plane? _
Salvatore R. Conte, Morristown, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While the battle over aircraft noise over the Grand Canyon
continues, so do the flights. To comply with a 1987 law, the
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Park Service are
working to ``substantially restore natural quiet in the Grand
Canyon National Park.'' Proposals presented by the agencies call
for increasing the ``quiet zone'' and for limiting air-tour flights
over the park to 88,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obvious difference between airplane and helicopter
tours is cost, with helicopter trips being $80 to $90 more. But
there are other differences, too: A helicopter flies lower (at
least 500 feet above the ground versus 1,000 feet for a plane) and,
says Ron Williams, president of AirStar Helicopters, it flies more
slowly _ 69 to 104 miles an hour (converted from knots) versus a
plane's 104 to 115 miles an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aerial tours from Grand Canyon National Park Airport are offered
on helicopters that carry 4 to 6 passengers and on planes that
carry 9 to 19. There are basically two routes, which are given a
variety of enticing names by tour operators:
</P>
<P>
   _ The central corridor: A tour of 25 to 30 minutes by a
helicopter that heads basically north along the canyon's Dragon, or
central, Corridor to the North Rim, does a 180-degree turn and then
heads south.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big circle (called East Rim, for shorthand, below): A tour
of 40 to 55 minutes by helicopter (45 to 50 minutes by plane) that
travels over the Colorado River, the Painted Desert and the eastern
canyon and then across the North Rim before turning south at the
central corridor.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the clearer maps of the both routes, you may want to
look at the Kenai Helicopters Web site, www.flykenai.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The companies with flights from Grand Canyon National Park
Airport _ rates including taxes and fees _ are these:
</P>
<P>
   AirStar Helicopters, (800) 962-3869, fax (520) 638-2607;
www.airstar.com. Most flights are by helicopter. Central corridor
by copter: $94. East Rim by copter $161; by Cessna 207, which
carries nine passengers, $71, $51 for those under 15.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon Airlines, (800) 528-2413 or (520) 638-2407; on the
Internet at www.grandcanyonairlines.com. A single type of flight is
offered: over the East Rim aboard a 19-passenger modified Twin
Otter. Cost: $75, $45 age 2 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Kenai Helicopters, (800) 541-4537; www.flykenai.com. Central
corridor: $99, $89 ages 12 and under. East Rim: $155, $145 ages 12
and under.
</P>
<P>
   Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters, (800) 528-2418 or (520)
638-2419, fax (520) 638-3235; www.papillon.com. Central corridor:
$99, $80 ages 2 to 11. East Rim: $159, $128 ages 2 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   For those setting out from Las Vegas, two carriers operate
flights over the West Rim of the canyon that also offer views of
Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Papillon, mentioned above, (888) 635-7272, fax (702) 736-0099,
has a 90-minute helicopter flight at a cost of $257.
</P>
<P>
   Scenic Airlines, (800) 634-6801, fax (702) 638-3275,
www.scenic.com, has a long and short flight aboard a Twin Otter;
both have the same itinerary. The 80-minute version is $162, $132
for ages 2 to 11; the 60-minute version is $110, $90 for ages 2 to
11. &QL;

   Vast Arizona Caves Will Open to the Public &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, two spelunkers, Randy Tufts and Gary Tenen, set out in
search of undiscovered caves in southern Arizona. After wriggling
through a crawl space that was about 10 inches high and 2 feet
across, the men discovered what today is known as Kartchner
Caverns, a seven-acre cave system in the Whetstone Mountains, 40
miles southeast of Tucson. The caverns include two galleries the
size of football fields, each with 100-foot ceilings and 26 smaller
chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years and $28 million after the caverns were first
discovered, the public is about to get its first look at them.
Kartchner Caverns State Park _ named after the family that owned
the land and helped preserve it _ is scheduled to open Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The caves took more than 330 million years to evolve. Rock
formations include thousands of stalactites; a 21-foot-2-inch-long
soda straw _ the longest mineral formation of its kind in the
United States; and one of the world's most extensive formations of
brushite moonmilk (microscopic calcite crystals).
</P>
<P>
   Fossils were discovered in the caverns as well. Paleontologists
found the skeletal remains of an 80,000-year-old Shasta ground
sloth, the head of a 34,000-year-old horse and an 11,000-year-old
bear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures inside the cave average around 68 degrees, with 99
percent humidity year round. Tours of the Rotunda and the Throne
Room in the upper chambers, which last about an hour and are nearly
a mile in length, leave approximately every 20 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 550-acre state park has hiking trails, picnic areas and a
Discovery Center that provides educational information about the
caverns including interactive exhibits, among them the
``Underground Journey,'' a computer-simulated tour of the cave
system.
</P>
<P>
   Kartchner Caverns State Park will be open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Reservations are highly recommended. Admission is $10 a car. Cave
tours are $14; $6 for children 7 to 13. Information: (520) 586-2283
or www.pr.state.az.us.

   A Depot Is Saved, A Museum Born &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Science City, a 55,000-square-foot science museum, will open on
Nov. 20 inside the recently restored and expanded Union Station in
Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   A visit there is likely to engage both history and science
buffs. Built in 1914, Union Station, the second-largest railroad
station in the country (Grand Central Terminal in New York is the
largest), is a superb example of Beaux-Arts architecture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the last five years, a combination of private
contributions and public funds has been used to restore the train
depot to its original glory. The total cost of the renovation was
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the renovation process, city planners were looking for
new uses for the building and turned to the Kansas City Museum for
ideas. Science City took form, and a new addition to the west of
the station's north waiting room was built to house the museum. The
depot will also house numerous restaurants, shops and theaters,
making it an appealing evening destination as well.
</P>
<P>
   Science City will feature more than 50 hands-on learning
environments, including the space center and the media lab. Each
was designed to be as realistic as possible, and visitors are
encouraged to get involved by using the museum's computers,
simulators and other props. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Science City, 30 West Pershing, Kansas City, Mo. 64108, (816)
460-2222, will be open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is
$12.50, $11 for seniors and $9 for children 4 to 12; children under
3 are free. &QL;

BUSH BRUISED AFTER LEAPING TO AVOID RUNAWAY TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush sustained minor
injuries Monday when he dived to avoid flying debris from a runaway
flatbed truck while he was jogging along Austin's Town Lake trail.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination
sustained cuts and bruises on his leg and hip and was treated at
the scene. The accident did not delay Bush's trip later Monday to
New Hampshire, where he is scheduled to continue his campaign
Tuesday, beginning with a stop in Dixville Notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close,'' said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker, referring
to the distance between the hurtling trailer and the governor. ``He
turned around and saw the truck coming at him, and he dove.
Apparently, it was out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, after arriving at New Hampshire's Berlin Airport, told
reporters he feels sore, but fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I needed to I could go out and run three miles,'' he said,
adding that he does, however, sport ``a significant strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he feels lucky to have avoided more serious injury and
was ``very concerned'' about Sergeant Roscoe Hughey, a Texas
Department of Public Safety officer who was assigned to Bush's
security detail and was following him on a bicycle. Hughey was hit
by debris from the truck. He was taken to the hospital with
injuries that were not life-threatening, Austin police spokeswoman
Tracy Karol said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Buchman, another Austin police spokesman, gave the
following description of the accident:
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who often jogs 4 to 5 miles a day, was jogging midday on a
popular trail in Austin that borders Town Lake. He heard a truck
approaching fast behind him on the adjacent Cesar Chavez Street.
When Bush feared it might hit him, he jumped out of the way. The
truck was a combination cab and flatbed trailer. The trailer
portion of the truck, which was carrying debris in a dumpster,
separated from the cab and turned on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The debris came flying at Bush, but he apparently sustained his
injuries when he dived out of the way and hit the trail, a Bush
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to initial reports that the truck ran Bush off the
road, Buchman said the truck stayed on the road and Bush was on the
trail. The debris scattered along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is owned by Long Horn Disposal of Austin. A company
representative could not be reached for comment. The truck was
carrying a dumpster filled with concrete and wood, police said.

   After the accident, Bush used Hughey's cell phone to call his
protective detail, which in turn called 911. Bush then remained at
the scene until police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation of the incident is underway, but police said
there is no indication that Bush was the target of an intentional
attack.

   Bush said the accident wouldn't curb his jogging on public
streets.

   Minimalist Shoreham Adds 90 Rooms &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Shoreham, a boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan that has
become popular in the fashion industry for its location and chic
minimalist decor, has doubled in size. The hotel, at 33 West 55th
Street off Fifth Avenue, bought an office building next door and
created 90 rooms and 2 suites, giving it a total of 176 rooms and
suites. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the slightly larger older rooms, the new ones have stark,
modern lines and a beige-dominated color scheme set off by steel
and aluminum fixtures and lots of mirrors _ including the long wall
of the tub-showers. Instead of the perforated steel headboards of
the older rooms, though, the new wing features Ultrasuede padded
walls (and in some cases, ceilings) cut out for botanically
inspired backlighted murals.
</P>
<P>
   The baths are set off by shoji-style translucent walls. Each
room has a television-VCR and a CD player. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The expanded Shoreham has also added a business center, a board
room, a bar and a 45-seat restaurant, serving Asian-inspired French
cuisine in a room with full-length windows that can open to the
street in good weather. La Caravelle, the acclaimed classic French
restaurant, also remains in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rates range from $275 for a standard double to $425 to $1,000
for a suite, and include Continental breakfast. Reservations: (212)
247-6700 or on the Web at www.shorehamhotel.com. &QL;

   Treasures of Maharajah In San Francisco &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive international exhibition examining the artistic
traditions of the Punjab under Sikh rule is on view at the Asian
Art Museum of San Francisco until Jan. 9. ``The Arts of the Sikh
Kingdoms'' features more than 160 rarely seen objects drawn from 19
public and private collections in India, Pakistan, North America
and Europe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is divided into eight thematic sections that provide
a historical overview of Sikhism, a monotheistic Hindu sect founded
in north India, beginning with the origins of the religion around
1500 and continuing through the period of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects on display are vividly colored paintings on
cloth and paper, decorative ceramic tiles, intricately patterned
pashmina scarves and shawls, and an array of metal weaponry. Also
included are a number of 19th-century paintings, drawings and
photographs made by Western visitors to the Sikh court at Lahore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition focuses on the reign of Ranjit Singh, the
celebrated Maharajah of Lahore who reigned from 1801 to 1839 and is
still revered by Sikhs. Although modest in his personal appearance,
he created a court of dazzling brilliance for the benefit of
foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the exhibit is his opulent gold-covered throne; made
by a Muslim craftsman and drawing on Hindu forms, it epitomizes the
eclectic nature of artistic patronage at the court, a recurring
theme. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Asian Art Museum is in Golden Gate Park. Admission is $7, $5
seniors and $4 ages 12 to 17; closed Monday. Information: (415)
379-8801 or www.asianart.org.

   Assisi Church, Shattered by '97 Quake, to Reopen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28, a commemorative mass will reopen the Upper Church of
the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, which was badly damaged in
an earthquake just over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive restorations have taken place during this time. The
bell tower and the tympanum of the left transept were repaired, the
main vault was reinforced with a carbon-fiber structure, and the
frescoes lining the walls of the Upper Church were cleaned of the
dust that settled on them when pieces of the vaulted ceiling fell
into the nave during the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The damaged vault sections have all been rebuilt, but the only
fallen frescoes that have been reattached are those representing
the four saints on the entrance arch, widely attributed to the
school of Giotto.
</P>
<P>
   The other frescoes, including Cimabue's St. Matthew and Giotto's
St. Jerome, are still in the hands of restorers trying to
reassemble the thousands of pieces into which they broke. Work is
expected to take at least another two years.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica will be open daily 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. On Sunday,
Nov. 28, it will be open to the public from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.; the
commemorative mass is for invited guests. For information, call
(39-075) 819 001 (the general number). Next year, another number,
(39-075) 819 0284, will be in service.

SINGLE TRAVELERS ARE BEING HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 7)  
(lb) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tour companies say they are hearing clients voice an increasing
distaste for the single supplement, the additional fee for those
occupying a room alone.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cali, senior vice president for marketing at Grand Circle
Travel in Boston, for example, said the clients he met on two
recent trips complained to him a lot about this extra charge, which
some catalogs list at 25 percent of the quoted price of a trip. A
friend who travels often says she believes supplements add 30
percent to her land costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cali said that among his company's clients who are 65 and over,
nearly 50 percent of the women and 14 percent of the men were
traveling by themselves, and that ``they want us to be more
single-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies catering to travelers 45 to 65 years old are
trying to accommodate those wanting single rooms; demographics
demonstrate how the chorus is likely to rise. Martha Farnsworth
Riche, a former director of the Census Bureau, says this age group
is increasing so rapidly that it is in effect a ``new country,''
populated by people still working, in good health and in their
prime spending years. They frequently travel alone or, if with
friends, seek the privacy of a single room.
</P>
<P>
   In a U.S. population totaling 270 million, Ms. Riche said in a
discussion at the Journalism and Women Symposium in September, 57
million _ 21 percent _ were in the 45-to-65 group in 1998, with the
baby boomers pouring in at the young end. She said Census Bureau
statistics indicated that this bloc would number 62 million by next
year, and 73 million by 2005, an increase of almost 18 percent in a
decade when the overall U.S. population will be growing 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Riche, who heads her own demographics organization in
Bethesda, Md., emphasizes that these people will be active because
``healthy life expectancy is growing just as fast as the older
population.''
</P>
<P>
   Working With Hotels
</P>
<P>
   Big tour operators I talked to said they were closely examining
the changes that are coming with the surge in those enjoying what
Ms. Riche called their ``20 new years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, Saga International in Boston, which
sells tours directly to people over 50, has been highlighting
``single rooms at no additional cost'' on brochures for some trips.
Kerry Chrisley, a spokeswoman, said 10 percent to 25 percent of her
company's clients got single rooms. ``We try to foster
relationships with our hotels,'' she said, so that when extra
single rooms are needed, the hotel is willing to be accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Single rates without surcharges are more often found on trips
using only one hotel or residence. A Saga trip to Costa Rica is
typical. A one-week stay at the San Jose Palacio is offered nine
times early next year at a price of $1,099 to $1,299 a person,
including air fare from Miami, whether two are in a room or one.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle, which also markets directly to over-50 travelers,
has some single rooms with no extra charges in its listings, for
example, 13-night visits to the Nautilus Hotel on the Costa del
Sol, and offerings in Majorca. Cali said that five to 10 rooms out
of 25 on a regular departure might be singles. A 1997 survey of
clients indicated that 36 percent were not married, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Price range is also a factor in the surcharge, and less
expensive trips are more likely to have no extra fee. Smithsonian
Study Tours appends a note giving the extra cost for a single room
to virtually every listing. (On the Oxford study tour, all rooms
are singles.) But the brochure for Smithsonian Odyssey Tours, a
less expensive line operated by Saga, says: ``A limited number of
single rooms are available on each tour at the best rate possible
or at no additional charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Lucash of Middletown, N.J., said she looked for places
that cater to solo travelers, not in hopes of meeting Mr. Wonderful
but because she did not want to spend her vacation surrounded by
couples.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, places that charge a single supplement seem to
discourage solo travelers. At a resort in Playa del Carmen, Mexico,
she said, ``When I went in to dinner, the maitre d' graciously
pulled out the chair at a table for two, and that was where I was
supposed to spend my vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lucash said her trip was saved when she met three women from
Toronto and they hung out together. Organizations like Club Med
that seek to match up single travelers, even if they do not succeed
in finding a roommate, usually have a dining-room plan that does
not leave singles stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Mantegazza, president of Globus and Cosmos Tourama in
Littleton, Colo., which takes 2.5 million clients a year on its
tours, said that his company saw changing patterns reflected in its
recent demographic survey. ``The boomers turning 50 and entering
this market are more travel wise, more open to experiences,'' he
said. ``Their sheer numbers alone force us to review what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier senior market,'' he added, ``was more balanced in
the number of couples and single travelers. The new senior market
is much more driven by single women: divorced, widows and `travel
widows.' The boomers are used to going out on their own if the
partner does not want to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Retirees, he said, have a lot of time and want to be active on
their vacations. Now, people still working want to vacation longer
in one place and examine it in more depth _ for example, to
experience ``the real Asia'' by taking tai chi classes or learning
to cook dim-sum.
</P>
<P>
   The design of tours, formerly focused on the
five-cities-in-10-days model, he said, is also affected by the
popularity of cruises and all-inclusive resorts, which do not
require daily repacking and moving.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Anthony, president of Saga, concurred on the increasing
demand for in-depth and educational travel, which meshes easily
with the use of one hotel as a base for exploration. ``We find that
single people can meet with others or explore on their own,'' he
said. ``If one person in a couple wants to stay behind, this is
manageable.''
</P>
<P>
   Being based in one place makes it easier for the operator to
offer a lower surcharge or none, because it will deal with only one
hotel and the longer stay increases an operator's leverage.
``Single travelers have paid a lot, a penalty,'' Anthony said. ``We
try to make a name for ourselves in avoiding this. For two years,
we have had a London Christmas for singles that sells well, and we
look to continue expanding that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Globus, Mantegazza said, has been seeking to make the prices
more attractive to single travelers. The company's numbers allow it
to negotiate vigorously for better rates, but there is still
another anomaly: ``Europe has been in a boom,'' he said, and
``hoteliers are not always responsive. If things slow up, we will
be able to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Lucash noted, there is a second problem: eating alone.
The options are opening up here, too, because of more older
travelers and an increasing number of women traveling on expense
accounts. And more and more, travelers complete their business but
stay over Saturday night to avoid higher fares, yet dislike being
compelled to have a room-service dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Business travel magazines have recently spotlighted restaurants
that provide big tables where solo diners are grouped together, and
arrangements for eating at the bar or in the bar area. I recently
found that the Holiday Inn at the Salt Lake City airport was able
to provide an acceptable Saturday afternoon supper at the bar for a
stomach from another time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Marya Charles Alexander in South Pasadena, Calif., has been
harvesting such tidbits in her newsletter ``Solo Dining Savvy,''
published six times a year. (She also publishes a yearly list of
100 best choices.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alexander urges single diners who have a bad experience to
write the restaurant, or her, rather than make a scene on the spot.
She says she gets news from restaurateurs about what they offer to
attract solo diners. She finds that single diners increasingly
consider themselves worthy of good treatment and are assertive
about their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter costs $29 a year; the ``100 Top'' $9.95. Solo
Dining Savvy, P.O. Box 1025, South Pasadena, CA 91031; (800)
299-1079.
</P>
<P>
   The single supplement is not immutable. For those willing to
share if they can find a suitable single, many tour companies, in
addition to newsletters and membership groups like Jens Jurgen's
Travel Companion Exchange in Amityville, N.Y., (516) 454-0880,
offer ways for people to connect with others. Some tour companies
offer singles-only trips, especially at slow periods. Tours to some
areas _ India, for example _ use hotels built with only single
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations create difficulties. Americans who book a
single room abroad are sometimes surprised by what they find,
probably because they were looking for a 300-square-foot U.S.-style
hotel room, with two beds or a double bed. What they more often
find is a rather cell-like room with a single bed, a desk-dresser
and a shallow cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   Operators try to warn Americans that Europeans build single
rooms on the less desirable sides of hotels, the trade-off for
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   I got a typical European single for a health conference in
Zurich, Switzerland, years ago. What really stunned me was the
vista: a huge clock tower just outside the one window. It stayed
lighted all night. But by the end of the week, it seemed like a
friend.

SHUSTER CASE CLOSES AS TWO AIDES PLEAD GUILTY TO MISDEMEANORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Citing a recent Supreme Court ruling that raised the
bar in proving political corruption cases, federal prosecutors
Monday dropped a sweeping indictment against a former high-ranking
Congressional aide and a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ann Eppard, former chief of staff for US Representative
Bud Shuster, the powerful House transportation committee chairman
from Pennsylvania, and lobbyist Vernon Clark were allowed to plead
guilty to misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   Eppard admitted receiving several payments totalling $15,000, an
interest-free $30,000 loan, and meals, lodging, travel and
entertainment totalling $12,000 from lobbyist Clark while working
for Shuster. She must pay a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was representing two Boston businessmen whose
property was threatened by the Big Dig, pleaded guilty to making
the payments to Eppard and to a separate charge of filing a false
income-tax return. He was fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Joseph L. Tauro declined the government's
request to place Eppard and Clark on probation for a year, saying
it wouldn't benefit society.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing appeared to mark the end of a five-year federal
investigation of Shuster, who has been a key player in helping
Massachusetts obtain funding for the Big Dig, and had allegedly
been the ultimate target of the probe that snared Eppard and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney Ben T. Clements told the court that a plea
agreement between the government and Eppard and Clark stemmed from
a recent Supreme Court ruling ``that narrowly construed the
gratuities law'' that had been used to indict the pair last year.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled unanimously last April that jurors couldn't
convict Sun-Diamond Growers of California of giving $5,900 in
illegal gratuities to former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy
because there was no evidence that the gifts were linked to any
official act.
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that it isn't enough for prosecutors to show
that gift-givers wanted to curry favor with officials in a position
to help them. Rather, the court said, prosecutors have to tie the
gift-giving to an official act performed or about to be performed.
</P>
<P>
   In a press release issued Monday, US Attorney Donald K. Stern
said Clark's clients were seeking government action on the Big Dig
when Clark made the payments to Eppard.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is no evidence of a quid pro quo, these payments
are nonetheless illegal,'' Stern said. ``The machinery of
government is corrupted by under-the-table payments designed to
smooth the way for lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   But attorney Richard Egbert, who represents Eppard, lashed back
at Stern, saying that if he had evidence that the machinery of
government was corrupted, ``Then he should have continued the
prosecution of these indictments instead of dismissing them. If he
had such evidence and dismissed these cases, he should consider
whether or not he should be in the position he holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Egbert described Clark as a longtime friend of Eppard and
described the three $5,000 payments he gave her through an unnamed
relative as consulting fees. The $30,000 loan she received from
Clark was a bridge loan that she used to buy a condo and later
repaid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no evidence that it was an effort to influence and
no evidence that it did influence her,'' Egbert said. He noted that
as part of the agreement, Eppard wasn't charged with willfully
committing a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Egbert said the government brought a broad and sweeping
indictment against Eppard involving corruption, mail fraud, wire
fraud and embezzlement ``based on an erroneous understanding of the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington attorney Barry Simon and Boston attorney Terry Segal,
who represented Clark, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stephen Delinsky, who represents Shuster, said Shuster
has ``enormous respect and admiration'' for Eppard and Clark and
that the outcome of the case validates his longheld belief in their
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Delinsky said the Supreme Court ruling in the Sun-Diamond case
``refocuses prosecutors' investigations onto the traditional
notions of what corruption means: selling your office in exchange
for money, bribery. When people think of corruption that's what
they think of. They don't think of gratuities.''

JUDGE RESINSTATES SUBSIDIES FOR BROOKLYN MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had run roughshod over
the First Amendment, a federal judge ruled Monday that the mayor
had no right to cut off city subsidies to the Brooklyn Museum of
Art for displaying art that he considered ``disgusting'' and
``anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-page decision, US District Judge Nina Gershon charged
that the mayor had violated the museum's free speech rights by
forcing a choice between city funding and closing the controversial
exhibit. She ordered him to restore the subsidy, barred him from
denying or delaying future payments, and warned against any attempt
by the city to evict the museum or to interfere with the museum's
directors.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the museum's board, Robert S. Rubin, hailed the
decision as ``a victory for the citizens of New York and for
freedom of expression across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani denounced not only the ruling but also Gershon, calling
her ``totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's chief lawyer said he would file an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case erupted a month ago, when the museum opened
``Sensation,'' an exhibition of works by young British artists that
included such provocative exhibits as a dead shark floating in a
tank of formaldehyde, a sliced-up pig, and _ most offensive to the
mayor _ a painting of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani threatened to withhold city funding, amounting to over
$500,000 a month or one-third of the museum's operational budget,
if the exhibit was not canceled or the painting of Mary was not
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's board refused to back down, and sued the city and
the mayor, accusing them of violating its First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers had argued, in a court hearing last month,
that the First Amendment does not require the government to
subsidize art.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon agreed that the government has no obligation to provide
benefits, but called that only half the argument. Subsidies, once
provided, may not be denied ``if the reason for the denial would
require a choice between exercising First Amendment rights and
obtaining the benefit,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is,'' she elaborated, quoting from one of many US Supreme
Court rulings, ``it may not `discriminate . . . in its subsidies in
such a way as to aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the judge said, is just what Giuliani did: ``The facts
establish an ongoing effort . . . to coerce the Museum into
relinquishing its First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also rejected the city's argument that taxpayers
should not have to pay for expression they dislike. She noted that
federal taxes subsidize the mailing of magazines many find
objectionable, and that state taxes pay the salaries of professors
who give controversial lectures.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's lawyers had argued that he cut off subsidies not
because of the ``Sensation'' show's contents but rather because the
museum, in its handling of the show, violated its lease with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Gershon rejected this argument as a ``pretext'' and a ``sham,''
finding ``no language in the lease . . . that gives the Mayor or
the City the right to veto works chosen for exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that the city's lawyers, at one point in the
hearing, ``admitted the obvious'' _ that Giuliani's action was
``directly related . . . to the content of the exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added, ``There can be no greater showing of a First
Amendment violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling does not end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do city lawyers plan an appeal, but the museum plans to
seek judicial approval to make Monday's temporary injunction
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, City Hall's lawyer, said he would try, in opposing
a permanent injunction, to introduce a new argument, based on an
article in Monday's New York Times that detailed how the museum
raised funds to put on ``Sensation'' from donors who had a
commercial interest in the exhibit's artworks.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Monday morning to Gershon, Hess alleged that such
``unethical conduct'' by the museum amounts to a violation of the
requirement of its lease that it limit the use of the museum
building to a `public purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess asked Gershon to reopen the case in light of the Times's
``extraordinary revelations.'' She turned down this request before
handing down her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams Monday afternoon both rejected Hess's accusation and
derided it as legally irrelevant. Such questions do not, he said,
go to the ``core reality of this case _ that the mayor has punished
the museum for the content of its art.''

IN ITS FIRST LIVE TEST, ISRAEL'S ARROW II INTERCEPTS INCOMING
ROCKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Passing its first major antiballistic missile test,
the new Arrow II missile successfully intercepted and destroyed a
dummy incoming rocket over the Mediterranean on Monday, the Israeli
air force reported.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was a critical rite of passage for the joint
Israeli-American Arrow II program, the only antiballistic-missile
defense system under active development with the capacity to
demolish warheads high in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The first two $170 million batteries of the Arrow II are being
installed here. Military officials here say they expect the system
to become operational early next year. The U.S. Congress recently
appropriated $42 million for the third battery, raising the total
direct American contribution to $83 million in the current fiscal
year. About two-thirds of the cost of the program is being covered
by Israel's defense budget, although American military aid is
underwriting much of the expense.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyed missile, an earlier generation Arrow programmed to
mimic the trajectory of an enemy scud, was launched from an Israeli
warship and shot down by an Arrow II at 11:42 a.m. local time, the
air force said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Israeli military did not provide details, the Arrow
II is widely believed to have been launched from an air force base
20 miles south of Tel Aviv. The Arrow II was designed to knock out
missiles up to 30 miles away at altitudes of up to 25 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was intended to test not just the missile itself,
but also the Israeli-designed Green Pine radar and Citron Tree
``fire management.'' The radar and targeting systems had previously
been tested only by their Israeli manufacturers, Elta Electronics
and Tadiran Systems. ``The Green Pine fire-control radar obtained
the target, and the Citron Tree calculated the intercept, upon
which the Arrow hit and destroyed the target,'' the Defense
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, an Arrow II was reported to have hit a
``virtual'' target in its first airborne test. This first live
exercise with an incoming warhead was originally scheduled for a
year ago, but was postponed because of undisclosed technical
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   After further analysis of the test Monday, the Israeli military
is generally expected to proceed almost immediately with deploying
the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything to create an initial operational
capability within the coming months,'' Ilan Biran, a manager of the
Arrow program before stepping down last month as the Defense
Ministry's director-general, told Israel Radio last weekend. ``I
want to assume that by 2000 we will have this basic capability and
that we will build our forces to full capacity in the coming years,
with up to three full batteries that will be able to shoot down
ballistic missiles in the air.''

 &HT;    Falcons: Everything better after win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was fun again Monday to be a Falcons player.
</P>
<P>
   Players were celebrating Sunday's 27-20 victory against
Carolina, and right tackle Ephraim Salaam was able to pick up his
mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at you differently,'' Salaam said. ''You might get
a smile now when you're putting gas in your car, or a hello when
you go to the mailbox. It's like the world is much friendlier when
you win.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's it like at the mailbox when the Falcons lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go,'' Salaam said. ``I just let my mail accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Marty Carter said he has been picking up his mail
all along. But it was less painful Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel better,'' Carter said. ``It's like anything in
life. You get a win the day before, you know, and you feel better
getting up. My neck is not as stiff; my limp isn't as bad with the
win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons get no rest, with a home game on Sunday against
Jacksonville (6-1), one of the best teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   With a bye the next week, however, players might be tempted to
look forward to better things. If the Falcons could steal an upset
victory over the Jaguars, they would return from the bye with road
games at Tampa Bay (3-4) and Carolina (2-5) before a home game
against New Orleans (1-6).
</P>
<P>
   Could the Falcons be looking at 6-6? Looking ahead, however,
might have been one of the Falcons' many problems this season.
Players did not look ahead in 1998, when the Falcons went 14-2
season and played in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're looking ahead, then we've got more problems than we
thought,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``Last year, we were great at
just focusing on the game we were about to play. Like New England.
We went up there (Nov. 8) and beat the heck out of them (41-10) and
didn't even think about San Francisco the next week. Then, we beat
San Francisco (31-19).
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, before the season even started, everybody was
talking about the whole season, about the Super Bowl being in
Atlanta and making the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won Sunday, Carter said, in part because they did a
very good job of not looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Free safety) Eugene (Robinson) said it best,'' Carter said.
`He said on every series, `Just think about this series and nothing
else.' We . . . were just thinking about making plays on that
series.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's game, right guard Gene Williams is doubtful, with a
high right-ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory over Carolina will make getting ready for
Jacksonville easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun when you win; that's why we play,'' kicker
Morten Andersen said. ``Everything is easier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when you win, there aren't that many mistakes,''
defensive end Lester Archambeau said. ``When you go into film, you
look for good things you did instead of not wanting to see the
mistakes you made and getting chewed out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can handle it a lot easier when you win,'' Reeves said.
``It makes it a little bit easier to look at film and makes it a
little bit easier to go to sleep. But if we look any further than
the next opponent, it's a huge mistake. There is no way we can get
to .500 if we don't get No. 3 first.''

BUSH SUFFERS MINOR INJURIES AFTER AVOIDING OVERTURNED TRUCK  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush escaped with only minor
injuries to his leg and hip Monday as he dived to avoid debris
flying from a waste disposal truck that overturned next to the Town
Lake hike and bike trail.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the governor's security detail _ Department of
Public Safety Staff Sgt. Roscoe Hughey _ was knocked off his
bicycle and sustained injuries that required treatment at
Brackenridge Hospital. Hughey, 39, was released after treatment for
a cut on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a freak accident. It was a close call for the governor,
and a close call for our guy,'' said DPS spokesman Tom Vinger. ``He
(Hughey) got knocked around pretty good, quite a bit of trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinger and Austin Police Department spokesman Tracy Karol said
Bush was running west on the trail about 12:06 p.m. CDT when an
eastbound tractor truck pulling a dumpster-topped trailer
overturned on Cesar Chavez Boulevard. Debris from the trailer _
brush, concrete, wood and wire _ flew across the jogging trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It overturned and sprayed debris,'' Vinger said. ``It was from
a demolition, from a construction site.''
</P>
<P>
   In the area where the accident occurred, the riverside
dirt-and-gravel jogging trail runs next to the road like a
sidewalk. Garbage from the wreck fanned out from the street to the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the end of a three-mile run when I heard the noise,
looked back, saw it start to tip and my instincts were to dive,''
Bush told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
said he scraped his right leg and hip when he dived behind a bridge
support. He said he was not struck by the debris from the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a significant strawberry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was pleased to learn that Hughey was not seriously
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very lucky and so is the DPS agent. I was very concerned
about him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, the governor's press secretary, said Bush saw the
trooper buried in the debris and picked up the officer's cellular
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor used the officer's phone ... to call DPS at the
(governor's) mansion, and then they called 911,'' Edwards said.
``The governor stayed with Roscoe (Hughey) until he was put in the
ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   An eyewitness, construction worker Joe Cardinas, told KTBC-TV in
Austin that emergency medical personnel tried to treat Bush at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to tend to him, but he was more concerned
about the (trooper),'' Cardinas said. ``Of course, the guy was
buried under the debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned to the mansion after the accident, changed clothes
and left on a trip to New Hampshire for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) knew his (Hughey's) injuries were not life
threatening,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughey has been with DPS for six years and on the governor's
security detail since last December, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinger said there was no reason to believe the truck's driver
was trying to hit Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Vinger nor Karol said the cause of the accident had been
determined, and neither had any information on the truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   Bush runs for exercise at least five days a week.

 MURDERS HIGHLIGHT VIOLENCE IN WORLD OF STOCK FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When two young stockbrokers were found shot to death
in an affluent New Jersey suburb last week, the headlines may have
conjured up an image of well-tailored suits and polished wingtips,
a carpeted blue-chip world where violence is usually a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both victims, Albert Alain Chalem, 41, and Maier
Lehmann, 37, worked in the seedy world of ``penny stocks,'' cheap
but very risky securities that are easily manipulated by insiders
at the expense of naive public investors. This is not an elegant
world: The now-indicted penny-stock brokerage firm where Chalem had
worked once arranged to receive its mail at Body by Boris, a
commercial gymnasium in Red Bank, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, even this gritty stretch of Wall Street had
been considered relatively safe territory, where bribes were far
more likely than bullets. The killings last week, although still
not definitively linked to the victims' business life, nevertheless
underscored what people who have studied the industry for years had
already concluded: Violence among people involved in stock fraud is
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal cases prosecuted against penny-stock figures in the
past two years have offered many examples that point to this new
brutality:
</P>
<P>
   Claudio Iodice, a stock promoter, was accused by federal
prosecutors in Manhattan of threatening a knife attack against the
family of a penny-stock company's chairman. He strongly denies the
charge but has been unable to stand trial because he swallowed what
his lawyer called ``a very caustic substance'' that required the
removal of his esophagus. His lawyer said that the injury was
accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Barclay Davis, another New York City stock promoter, has pleaded
guilty to charges that he tried to hire a hit man to attack his
67-year-old accountant, who had agreed to testify against Davis in
a stock manipulation case.
</P>
<P>
   On a tape recording in that case, Davis directed the hit man,
actually an undercover agent, to attack a speculator who he thought
was trying to drive down the price of the penny stock Davis was
promoting: ``I want him hospitalized. Broken legs, whatever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Richard Hosang pleaded guilty in March to federal conspiracy
and money-laundering charges in a stock manipulation case in which,
prosecutors said, he and some associates had beaten up a rival
stockbroker and hung him from his heels out of the ninth-story
window of a Manhattan office building.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in a federal penny-stock fraud conspiracy case
filed this summer in Tampa, Fla. _ including Philip Abramo,
identified in the indictment as a member of the DeCavalcante crime
family _ were accused of using their ``relationship to the Mafia''
to threaten uncooperative brokers, threats that became more potent
after the murder of a Bahamian connected to a company controlled by
the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The same defendants were also accused of taking handguns and a
baseball bat into the Drake Hotel in Manhattan to threaten another
penny-stock operator whom they suspected of swindling them out of
$1.7 million. The defendants deny the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits in penny-stock fraud can be as good as the profits
in cocaine, prostitution and loan sharking, and it's always been a
lot safer,'' said John Woods, the editor of Stock Watch, a news
service based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that monitors that
region's penny-stock industry. ``Now, with this frothy market, it
is a lot more profitable than it has ever been before, but it is no
longer as safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings, which were a hot topic of conversation last week
in circles ranging from securities law to Internet chat rooms,
occurred late on the evening of Oct. 25 in the scenic horse-country
town of Colts Neck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The two victims, their cellular phones nearby, were found inside
the lavish mansion where Chalem lived with his girlfriend, whose
family owned the home. Both men had been shot repeatedly in the
head, and there was no sign of forced entry or burglary.
</P>
<P>
   igators have not ruled out the possibility that a personal
motive, unrelated to their business dealings, may have led to the
deaths. But John Kaye, the Monmouth County prosecutor, who is
overseeing the case, said that investigators strongly suspected
that the killings stemmed from the men's tangled and clearly
questionable business activities.
</P>
<P>
   They operated an Internet stock-promotion Web site _
StockInvestor.com _ that featured an analyst's reports that were
outdated and, according to the analyst, pirated from other Web
sites without permission. Lehmann had a criminal record for mail
fraud and, without admitting or denying his guilt, had paid
$630,000 to settle regulatory charges that stemmed from a 1997
stock manipulation case.
</P>
<P>
   Chalem had spent more than a year as a broker for A.S. Goldmen &AMP;
Co., a penny-stock firm based in Iselin, N.J., that was charged
with fraud and racketeering in a case filed in July by the
Manhattan district attorney's office. Officials of the firm have
denied any wrongdoing. Goldmen is the firm that had its mail
occasionally forwarded to the Body by Boris gym.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, people who have reviewed the two men's dealings with
regulators say that both victims had provided information to
law-enforcement or regulatory agencies in recent years, prompting
some speculation that the killings were carried out either in
retribution or as a way of preventing further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Penny-stock swindles have been a fixture of every stock-market
boom since World War II, several white-collar crime experts pointed
out. But in the past, such schemes were typically carried out
without visible violence, perhaps as a way of ensuring that
securities fraud, as a nonviolent crime, would remain a low
priority for law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooler, wiser heads knew that you didn't want to attract
attention by having people showing up dead in million-dollar
mansions,'' said Howard Sirota, a defense lawyer experienced in
white-collar crime cases. ``But this new, younger breed has all
come of age in a market that goes up and up and up. They feel
invincible, and they have gone completely over the top now.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bruno, who was one of the federal prosecutors that
handled the Davis case, said that it has become increasingly
dangerous to interfere in stock promoters' carefully choreographed
efforts to manipulate the prices of penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this current environment, anyone who seeks to undermine the
carefully structured penny-stock deals places themselves at risk of
suffering extremely violent consequences,'' Bruno said Monday. One
factor contributing to this rise in violence, several former
law-enforcement officials said, may be the invasion of the
penny-stock business by organized-crime figures from Russia and
Eastern Europe, who have a reputation for extraordinary
ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of engagement have changed dramatically,'' said
Martin Pollner, a former director of law-enforcement for the
Treasury Department who is now with the Manhattan firm of Loeb &AMP;
Loeb. ``We sort of `tamed' other elements of organized crime, but
with the new wave coming in, those old rules no longer apply. We
are back to the old Al Capone days.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even the traditional crime families seem to be resorting to
increasingly violent methods to enforce stock-fraud activities,
perhaps because of growing competition from the recent arrivals,
suggested Norman Willox, chief executive of the National Fraud
Center, a consulting firm in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have redefined what organized crime is in the
United States, helping to create an environment in which any
organized-crime group will work with any other for common ends, but
with very little or no trust between them,'' he said. ``As a
result, there clearly has been an increase in violence in this
area, and I think it is going to increase. We haven't even seen the
tip of the iceberg yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have acknowledged at Senate hearings this
year that elements of organized crime have made visible, although
limited, inroads into the penny-stock world. But balancing that
ominous development, they said, has been the increased cooperation
between the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and federal
and state prosecutors around the country, especially in the New
York region and in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have felt in the past that our civil remedies were simply
not enough to achieve deterrence in the penny stock world,'' said
Richard Walker, the director of enforcement for the commission.
``They were just considered a price of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the risk that convicted penny-stock swindlers will go to
prison has greatly increased, Walker said. ``I think our efforts
have had bite and impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increased enforcement pressure may even be one factor
contributing to the increased violence, especially regarding
attacks on people believed to be cooperating with the authorities,
Walker said. ``Clearly, the consequences are far more serious for
people if they are caught, and it may well have led to greater
desperation among the people involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods, the Vancouver editor, said that crime figures are no
doubt balancing any perceived increase in the riskiness of stock
manipulation against the ``absolutely astronomical'' rewards being
generated by the extraordinary stock-market boom. That boom is
luring neophyte investors who are easy prey for the unscrupulous,
especially those hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the sources of this new violence, many experienced
securities lawyers are predicting that the killings last week will
merely intensify the federal interest in pursuing penny-stock
cases, especially those involving organized-crime connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see a huge effort to crack down on
everyone who is involved in organized crime on Wall Street,'' said
Sirota, the lawyer. ``You just can't go around killing cooperating
witnesses.''

WALTER PAYTON, 45, FOOTBALL GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss.)  (Eds: A longer version of this story is also being filed.) 
(mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Payton, the Chicago Bears' running back whose
single-minded aggressiveness and singular combination of power and
speed made him the leading ground-gainer in pro football history,
died Monday at his home in Barrington, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He
was 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from liver disease. Last Feb. 2, during
an emotional news conference in Chicago, Payton disclosed that he
had a rare liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis, in
which the bile ducts of the liver are blocked. He said the doctors
told him he would need a liver transplant within two years. A week
later, after further tests, doctors told him he needed a transplant
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He was said to have been on a waiting list with 12,000 others at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Dr. Greg Gores of the Mayo
Clinic said Monday that Payton had developed liver cancer, which
kept him from being a candidate for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from 1975 through 1987 for the Bears, who endured many
mediocre seasons before becoming winners, he set a host of National
Football League records. He retired with career marks for rushing
yards (16,726) and attempts (3,838), combined yards (21,803
rushing, receiving and returning), rushing touchdowns (110),
100-yard rushing games (77) and 1,000-yard rushing seasons (10).
</P>
<P>
   He set a one-game rushing record of 275 yards against the
Minnesota Vikings in 1977. He was twice (1977 and 1985) voted the
league's most valuable player and nine times voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen and Emmitt Smith subsequently broke the record for
rushing touchdowns. Payton's other career records still stand.
</P>
<P>
   After Payton's retirement, he turned his full attention to the
business career he had begun during his playing days and earned far
more than he ever had on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Finks, the late general manager of the Bears, once described
Payton as ``a complete football player, better than Jim Brown,
better than O.J. Simpson.'' On Monday, Dick Butkus, the Bears' Hall
of Fame linebacker who retired two seasons before Payton arrived,
called him ``a perfect example of what a true back was supposed to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 1/2 inches and 204 pounds, Payton was not big for a
running back, but his strength and conditioning were legendary. He
could bench-press 390 pounds and do leg-press series with more than
700 pounds. He could throw a football 60 yards, punt it 70 yards,
kick a field goal of 45 yards and walk across a football field on
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fred O'Connor, the Bears' former backfield coach, once said:
``The first time I saw Walter Payton in the locker room, I thought
God must have taken a chisel and said, `I'm going to make me a
halfback.'''
</P>
<P>
   One part of Payton's conditioning regimen took on mythic
proportions in the football world. For several months before the
start of each NFL season, he would run up a steep hill near his
Illinois home about 20 times a day. Sometimes he would bring along
teammates or local college players. ``I enjoy seeing them try it
once or twice, and then vomit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he routinely carried the ball 20 or more times a game
and was known as one of the best blockers among running backs,
Payton was never seriously injured. In his 13 professional seasons,
he missed only one game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka, who coached Payton during the last half of his pro
career, called him ``the very best football player I've ever seen,
period, at any position.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was given his nickname, Sweetness, by teammates in the
Senior Bowl college all-star game. He was unsure whether it
referred to his sweet movements on the field or to the sweet,
sincere personality and high-pitched voice that made him sound like
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a selfless team leader, Payton would hand the ball to
an offensive lineman after scoring a touchdown because, he said,
``They're the ones who do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, the
first year he was eligible, and to the College Football Hall of
Fame in 1996. He played in nine Pro Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   For his induction ceremony at the Hall of Fame, he chose as his
presenter his son, Jarrett, then 12 years old. In his speech,
Jarrett said, ``Not only is my dad an exceptional athlete ... he's
my biggest role model and best friend.'' The son, a freshman
running back and kick returner at the University of Miami, returned
home Wednesday to be with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 33 and in his final season, Payton's devotion to
football was undiminished. ``This is something I want to do,'' he
said, ``something I love to do. Money isn't everything. Do you get
married because of money? Do you have kids because of money? It's
like something you have to fulfill in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Jerry Payton was born July 25, 1954, in Columbia, Miss.
He was one of three children of Peter Payton, a factory worker, and
his wife, Alyne.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Payton carried the ball in high school, he gained
65 yards. During his final two years he scored in every game and
made the all-state team. He also long-jumped 22 feet 11 1/4 inches,
averaged 18 points a game for the basketball team, played baseball
and was a drummer in the band.
</P>
<P>
   Although major colleges sought him, he followed his brother to
the predominantly black Jackson (Miss.) State College, now Jackson
State University. As a junior he led the nation in scoring with 160
points, and his career total of 464 points set what was then an
NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Jarrett, Payton is survived by his wife,
Connie; a daughter, Brittney; his mother, his brother and a sister.

NO TIMETABLE FOR RESTORING PAKISTANI DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistan's new military ruler, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, refused Monday to be pinned down on when he would
restore democracy as he faced more than an hour of questions at his
first news conference since he seized power in a coup three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though he fielded questions with the ease and finesse of an old
political pro, the general left no doubt that he was running
Pakistan, a nuclear power with a population of 150 million, and
that he alone would decide when the people would be allowed to pick
their own leaders again.
</P>
<P>
   Will the return to democracy be achieved through elections or a
revival of Parliament, he was asked. ``Frankly, I haven't
decided,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Will he allow voters to register their support or disapproval of
the coup in a referendum? I'll talk it over with my council of
advisers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that he will stay in power for a decade or more?
Musharraf ducked the question, saying only that he was determined
to revive the country's economy, wipe out public corruption and
disentangle the bureaucracy from politics before stepping aside _
an agenda that some political analysts say will take years, if not
a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go according to the needs and requirements of
Pakistan,'' he said. ``That will be supreme in my mind, and not
international demands.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new regime would set up a National Accountability
Bureau to go after corruption, starting from the top down.
``N-A-B,'' he said, spelling out the new agency's initials. ``We
will nab everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf has already indicated that Nawaz Sharif, the prime
minister who was toppled on Oct. 12 when he tried to fire the
general, was at the top of the list of high-level officials to be
prosecuted on corruption charges. Sharif has been under house
arrest at an undisclosed location since the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf also suggested that Sharif may be charged with
conspiring to destabilize the armed forces _ a crime of high
treason in Pakistan. Whatever the charges, the general said Monday,
Sharif will have a chance to tell his side of the story at his
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more remarkable than any of the specific statements was
the general's obvious relish for the spotlight on a set in the
state-run television studio.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a hundred reporters shouting sometimes difficult
questions at him, he displayed an ability to evade unwanted
queries, offering quotable maxims as substance and occasionally
giving off a flash of steely, soldierly resolve. He spoke in a
fluid mix of English and Urdu, often starting a sentence in one
language and ending it in the other.
</P>
<P>
   On Pakistan's relations with its bigger neighbor and archrival,
India, Musharraf diplomatically insisted that he wanted peaceful
coexistence, but also said the countries' rancorous dispute over
the Himalayan territory of Kashmir _ a conflict that flared
violently this summer _ was still the paramount issue for him.
</P>
<P>
   He warned India: ``Hostility will be met with hostility. Peace
will be met with peace. I will defend the honor of this country. No
one threatens us without getting a threatening response.''
</P>
<P>
   The general also made clear that he had no intention of spending
any of his own political capital to sign the nuclear test ban
treaty that American diplomats had been pressing for but that the
U.S. Senate recently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would encourage a national debate, but described the
treaty as a contentious issue that could stir up anti-government
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to get involved in the CTBT would be unfair,'' he said
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. ``I would not want to do
that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The general reserved his most scathing, wry comments for Sharif.
The prime minister had announced that he was firing Musharraf as
the army chief of staff while the general was flying back to
Pakistan from Sri Lanka, and the coup was well under way by the
time he landed.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said the armed forces' ``spontaneous'' decision to
move against the prime minister had not set a precedent that could
be used to justify a military takeover whenever a civilian leader
tried to fundamentally change the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, he said, did not give the prime minister ``a
right to remove a chief as if he is a peon outside his office.'' Of
Sharif's decision to hire Musharraf a year earlier, the general
remarked with an amused smile, ``He may be repenting now.''
</P>
<P>
   After answering questions for more than an hour without so much
as a sip of water, the general told the reporters that they were
welcome to keep firing more at him _ but with deadlines rushing in,
Pakistani reporters called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded by asking them, in Urdu, to deliver this message:
Tell the poor we will always stand by them. Tell the rich: ``Stop
bleeding this country. Stop your corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for us to come together to rebuild Pakistan,'' he
said.

 &HT;    EGYPTIAN FAMILIES OF CRASH VICTIMS MAKE SAD VOYAGE TO U.S.
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: With coverage of EgyptAir crash.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ With the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, Egyptian
sisters Rania and Suha El-Shagie(CQ) went, in one week, from the
joy of marriage to the grief of widowhood.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, they flew to the United States with others in
mourning, seeking to identify their loved-ones' remains.
</P>
<P>
   The journey came after a day of logistical preparations,
emotional outbursts and, finally, subdued waiting in the same
airport where victims' families had hoped to greet Flight 990 a
day-and-a-half before.
</P>
<P>
   But, the airplane had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near
Massachusetts Sunday, apparently killing all 217 aboard. The dead
included two flight attendants betrothed to the two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed so perfect. He was everything to me,'' said
a red-eyed Suha El-Shagie as she and her sister waited in the
dining hall of Cairo International Airport where relatives were
awaiting their flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Suha, 26, and Rania, 23, just a week ago had completed the bulk
of the paperwork for their marriage and the two flight attendants,
Mohammed Galal and Hassan Farouk, respectively, left the next day
on the ill-fated Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Flying was the centerpiece of their relationships, as all four
had met as flight attendants. Although last week, they completed
the paperwork in the long process of formal Muslim weddings, they
had not completed all the Islamic and social steps needed to start
their lives together in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The women had a feeling they would never get the chance. Both
received ominous calls from the men before their last flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'I don't know why I'm so worried this time. I feel
like I need to talk to you before I get on the plane,''' Rania
recounted from her long-distance conversation from Farouk.
</P>
<P>
   The two women sat listlessly early Tuesday, crying often and
awaiting a journey they were about to begin with family members of
the 62 Egyptian passengers on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting to depart, some began to strike up conversations
and form friendships with people they had only met through the
tragedy. One man questioned the wisdom of taking the trip, all
expenses paid, by EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   They were headed to New York and then Rhode Island, to await the
recovery and identification of the victims' remains.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on Monday, all-but-ruled out the prospect for
survivors of the crash when they switched the operation to a
recovery effort. They had found seats, life vests, one body and a
major chunk of wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   There were reportedly 106 Americans on the flight and most were
apparently tourists or visitors to Egypt. U.S. Consul General Roger
Pierce said that he had no reports of Americans, except for those
holding dual Egyptian-American citizenship, residing in Egypt who
were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   So, the focus Monday was on getting paperwork completed for the
Egyptian family members to go to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference room in the high-rise, downtown U.S. Embassy _
the largest U.S. Embassy in the world _ some of the 5,000 embassy
staff issued on-the-spot visas that normally take two days to
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emotional thing and we've been working very long
hours,'' Piece said.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir pledged to compensate the victims' families and pay all
expenses for their flight and undetermined stay at a hotel near
where the wreckage is being unloaded. The airline is only taking
one family member for each victim.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Ibrahim Saleh Sa'ad, 42, prepared to go identify his
brother, Talat(cq), a Lt. Colonel in the Egyptian army. There was a
group of about 30 army officers on the flight after attending a
training course in communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was happy and everything was OK,'' Sa'ad, an agricultural
expert for the Egyptian government, said of a phone call he
received from his brother before the ill-fated flight.
</P>
<P>
   He said Talat leaves behind three children, from nursery school
to 19 years old, and his wife, Salwa Shami.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is totally collapsed. My father is in worse shape,'' Sa'ad
said, with obvious anxiety about his first trip to the United
States. ``I already feel like I have lost something very essential
that was a part of me. Now, I don't know if I am going to find a
corpse or not, or if I will find half a corpse. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the family decided not to hold a funeral until Talat's
body is recovered. They will bury him in their rural town of Shebin
El-Koum in the Nile Delta. Before his trip, Sa'ad said, Talat had
joked that if anything happened to him he wished to be ``buried in
the countryside with my mother.''

SEARCHERS BEGIN RETRIEVAL OF REMAINS, WRECKAGE FROM FLIGHT 990

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ As hope of finding survivors evaporated, search
crews collected human remains and a large piece of a doomed
EgyptAir jetliner from its ocean grave Monday, and detected pinging
sounds believed to be from one of the plane's two so-called black
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology Navy salvage ships steamed for the wreck site
off the coast of Massachusetts in advance of a gathering autumn
storm that was expected to transform Monday's ideal, summer-like
search conditions. And National Transportation Safety Board
chairman James E. Hall warned Monday it would be ``36 to 48 hours''
before the Navy vessels could be positioned for recovery
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, who were assembling a team up to 1,000 members
strong, made plans for a temporary morgue at Quonset Point. They
also made it clear: finding the cause of the crash early Sunday
morning could take months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be looking at a long investigation,'' said Hall, who
flew over the crash site Monday. ``We have a very difficult job of
recovery ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The first family members arrived in Rhode Island Monday. NTSB
managing director Peter Goelz said an assistance center, staffed by
the NTSB, EgyptAir and the Red Cross, has been set up for them at a
Newport Hotel. The families will receive twice-daily briefings
there.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lincoln Almond pledged full assistance from the state. ``I
know that all Rhode Island will open its hearts to the victims from
wherever they come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 family members from the United States and the
Middle East are expected to arrive here during the next two days, a
painful journey to be near those who died and learn all they can
about how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir Flight 990, en route to Cairo from New York's John F.
Kennedy Airport, plunged from the sky, dropping almost 14,000 feet
in just 36 seconds. The 10-year-old jetliner, with at least 217
people on board, had been airborne about 30 minutes and was
cruising south of Nantucket at 33,000 feet when it disappeared from
radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   A clear cause for what sent the Boeing 767-300ER plane into a
fatal dive remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, President Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
warned against early, unfounded speculation that the crash was due
to a terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, where he was attending Middle East peace talks, Clinton
said he was not aware of terrorist threats that could be linked to
the crash. ``If there have been any such threats, I do not know
about them,'' he said. ``Nothing has been ruled in, nothing has
been ruled out. And I hope no one will draw any conclusions one way
or another until we finish the work.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mubarak, speaking on CNN, said ``Sabotage? I don't think
that, or a terrorist act? I don't think that. But I cannot
foretell. We are waiting until the investigation comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Mawn, special agent in charge of the Boston office of the
FBI, said ``there is no indication of criminal activity'' thus far.
Nevertheless, agents assisted in the investigation and in
cataloguing each piece of wreckage as evidence. Mawn urged
Nantucket beachcombers to turn in anything from the plane that
washes ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials somberly announced that an extensive
search of the area 60 miles south of the island had turned up no
signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average life expectancy in water temperatures of 58
degress is about five to six hours,'' Coast Guard Rear Admiral
Richard M. Larrabee said. ``We have far exceeded that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said recovery crews found ``a significant piece of the
aircraft,'' but he would not describe it. The metal piece was
hauled from the water by a crane on a Coast Guard vessel early
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``at least one'' signal, presumably from the flight data
recorder or its cockpit voice recorder, was detected Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a pinger signal, at least one that we are working
with right now,'' Larrabee told reporters. ``Our efforts today will
be to try and, as best we can, identify the location of that target
so that when the Navy vessels arrive here we'll have a location for
them to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The 767's ``black boxes'' _ its original flight data recorder
which monitors 55 different aspects of the plane's flight and
performance, and a cockpit voice recorder _ have underwater
locating beacons that can work in depths up to 20,000 feet and
persist for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit recorder can also capture noises in the airplane,
including a straining engine or the sounds of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an explosion on board in the range of the cockpit
area microphone, it would pick it up,'' said a federal investigator
who spoke under the condition of anonymity. ``We would hear the
rise and fall of the blast signature.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the airplane's transponder, a device which sends
information to air-traffic control radar, was working for the first
30 seconds of the plane's nosedive from 33,000 feet, investigators
hope the two recording devices were functional as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the plane's systems, the transponder is powered by
electricity generated from the plane's twin engines. Aviation
specialists said it is likely that those on board were well aware
of the plane's rapid descent.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent disasters, TWA Flight 800 and Pan Am Flight 103,
both the black boxes and the transponders stopped when the plane
lost power and therefore could not provide clues about the cause of
the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   John Hansman, a professor of aeronautics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said a working transponder indicates that
much of the cabin was intact.
</P>
<P>
   The transponder is located in the nose of the airplane and the
antennas are a third of the way down the fuselage, ``so there was
structural integrity through the front half of the airplane,''
Hansman said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one radar tape shows the plane breaking apart after the
transponder stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   The only fatal crash of a Boeing 767 due to mechanical problems
occurred in Thailand in 1991. A Lauda Air jet crashed there after a
thrust reverser, designed to slow the plane upon landing by
redirecting the engines' exhaust, accidentally deployed as it was
climbing to 24,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA ordered airlines to install locking mechanisms on all US
Boeing 767s. A high-ranking EgyptAir official said the airline did
so on the ill-fated jet in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reviewed the paperwork and found that the modification was
done. We checked that very carefully,'' said Mustafa El Gammal,
general manager of EgyptAir for quality assurance control. He spoke
before boarding a flight in Cairo bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know anything yet. We need data. Data is the key to
any understanding,'' he said. ``The (flight data recorder) must be
found, otherwise nobody knows anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides dozens of US tourists, the Pentagon said the EgyptAir
plane carried about 30 Egyptian military officers, many of them
army pilots. They had been flying AH-64 ``Apache'' attack
helicopters during training exercises in the United States. Three
of the officers were brigadier generals.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir said the passengers included 106 Americans, including
54 bound for a two-week trip to Egypt and the Nile, 62 Egyptians,
22 Canadians, three Syrians, two Sudanese and one Chilean. The full
passenger list was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With more precise radar data from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Coast Guard narrowed its search to a
40-square-mile patch of ocean 250 feet deep. There, they found
``small portions of the aircraft, primarily seats and cushions, the
remains of people's clothing and paperwork,'' Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said he had no information that any of the recovered
items showed burn marks or anything else that would indicate a fire
or explosion. He said while one body has been recovered, ``we have
begun to see evidence of further human remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Collection of those remains, Hall noted, ``has been extremely
limited and we may be looking at a more extended period than in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as officials awaited a National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration vessel with side-scan sonar to begin
mapping the ocean floor in an effort to pinpoint the areas of
debris, Coast Guard boats continued to search the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who do this business for a living, this is
certainly another one of those tragedies that is very difficult for
all of us to deal with,'' Larrabee said. ``Our thoughts and prayers
are with those victims and all of the families as they deal with
this very traumatic event.''

BUSH AVOIDS SERIOUS INJURY AS GARBAGE TRAILER FLIPS OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By THOMAS TERRY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush received a few scrapes and
bruises on Monday when he dodged a garbage truck trailer that
flipped over and scattered debris onto a trail where he was
jogging.
</P>
<P>
   A state trooper riding behind Bush on a bicycle during the
midday jog along Austin's Town Lake was not so lucky. Agent Roscoe
Hughey was hospitalized after being hit with some of the truck's
contents, officials said. He was released after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard a large boom and saw a garbage truck lose control;
its trailer flipped and sent construction debris flying everywhere.
Next thing we saw was a hand reaching up out of the debris,''
Ernest Bedford, a city inspector who was working nearby, said of
the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Bush told The Associated Press by telephone
from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the end of a 3-mile run when I heard the noise,
looked back, saw it start to tip and my instincts were to dive,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he scraped his right leg and hip when he dived behind a
bridge support. ``I've got a significant strawberry,'' Bush said,
adding that he was pleased that Hughey was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cardenas, a city inspector who witnessed the accident, said
Bush was ``startled'' after the accident but got up quickly as 15
to 20 state troopers converged on the scene within 30 seconds and
surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver was taken from the scene and questioned by
Austin police. A police spokeswoman said the accident was under
investigation. She declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old boy was going too fast,'' Cardenas said. ``Way too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Department of Public Safety,
said the incident shows how ``things come when they're least
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just highlights that danger comes in many shapes and forms
in protecting the governor,'' Vinger said. ``It was just a freak
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident did not alter Bush's campaign schedule, which
includes a major education address in New Hampshire today,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's third education speech, focusing on school
security, comes as rival Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, has begun
nipping at his heels in first-test New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   According to a New Research 2000 poll, Bush is leading McCain
39-27. That reflects a drop of 23 points in Bush's lead since
August.

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES N.Y. CITY CANNOT CUT OFF FUNDS FOR BROOKLYN
MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge ruled on Monday that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani violated the First Amendment when he cut city funding and
began eviction proceedings against the Brooklyn Museum of Art for
mounting an art exhibition the mayor deemed offensive and
sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn ordered
the mayor to resume the city's monthly payments to the museum and
end his campaign to evict it and remove its Board of Trustees over
an exhibition that includes a painting of the Virgin Mary on a
canvas adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no federal constitutional issue more grave,'' the
judge wrote in her 38-page decision, ``than the effort by
government officials to censor works of expression and to threaten
the vitality of a major cultural institution as punishment for
failing to abide by governmental demands for orthodoxy.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called Judge Gershon's decision ``the usual knee-jerk
reaction of some judges'' and said the city would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials immediately hailed the decision. ``This is a
victory for the citizens of New York and for freedom of expression
across the nation,'' Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the museum's
Board of Trustees, said at an afternoon news conference. ``We
believe that the people of New York and the nation are intelligent,
independent-minded, and as guaranteed under the First Amendment,
able to decide for themselves what exhibitions to see, books to
read and opinions to express.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon's ruling came in the form of a temporary
injunction against the city. The museum will now seek a permanent
injunction. Giuliani described the ruling as ``precipitous'' in
light of a story in The New York Times on Sunday that described how
museum officials raised money for the exhibition by soliciting
hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies and individuals
with a commercial interest in the display.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani ordered lawyers for the city on Monday to seek
permission from Judge Gershon to ``follow the money trail'' by
taking sworn statements from museum officials and others involved
in the exhibition, ``Sensation,'' which includes works by some of
Britain's leading artists.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Judge Gershon on Monday morning, the city's
corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, asked her to hold off on her
ruling until the city had had time to investigate the exhibition's
financing. Judge Gershon rejected the request and issued her
decision, but city officials vowed to pursue the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all about dollar signs,'' Giuliani said on Monday.
``It isn't about free speech. It's actually a desecration of the
First Amendment, as much as it is a desecration of religion, to use
the First Amendment as a shield in order to take money out of the
taxpayers' pockets in order to put that money into the pockets of
multimillionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd Abrams, the museum's First Amendment lawyer, charged
that Giuliani was simply seizing on the financial issue to shift
attention from his own ``lawless behavior'' and ``to avoid First
Amendment talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is always gratifying to receive a ruling that vindicates
the First Amendment,'' Abrams said on Monday, ``but it is a little
sad to even be here today. The events that led to this lawsuit
should never have happened. The behavior of the mayor that led to
it should never have occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   It was clear Monday that both sides regarded Judge Gershon's
ruling as merely the next milestone in a case that has transfixed
the city with its implications for cultural institutions, the First
Amendment and the political future of a mayor who is considering a
campaign for the U.S. Senate. Lawyers for the museum said that they
might try to depose the mayor and other top city officials as they
prepare their request for a permanent injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, in his letter to Judge Gershon, accused the museum's
director, Arnold L. Lehman, of showing ``lack of candor'' when he
was questioned by city lawyers about the exhibition's finances. He
also criticized Lehman for approving ``willful lies to members of
the press regarding the financial involvement of Charles Saatchi,''
the British advertising entrepreneur who owns the ``Sensation'' art
collection. Saatchi, who has made millions of dollars buying and
selling contemporary art, has pledged up to $160,000 toward the
costs of staging ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   An internal museum memorandum that was described in court papers
shows that Lehman endorsed a decision by a high-ranking museum
official to conceal that fact in an interview with a reporter from
The New York Observer. Rubin strongly defended Lehman's actions in
putting together the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum, the director, the staff acted responsibly and
appropriately in this matter,'' Rubin said during the press
conference as Lehman looked on, at times fighting back tears. ``I
personally and the trustees stand by Arnold and the staff, and they
have had, do have and will have our continued support.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ethical propriety of soliciting donations from
those who stand to gain financially from an exhibition, Rubin
replied: ``I will not respond to that directly, because I do not
think that this is the appropriate forum for a discussion of museum
exhibition funding practices, and I am not prepared to answer any
question on that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The city, which provides about a third of the museum's annual
$24-million operating budget, began withholding the museum's
monthly subsidy in October. The November subsidy, for nearly
$500,00, was due on Monday. But city officials did not send either
payment, saying they did not want the museum to spend city funds
while they are pursuing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to ask the judge if we can put the money in an
escrow account because this whole thing has not unraveled,'' Hess
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday's ruling did not break much new legal ground. Judge
Gershon cited a long line of legal precedents that forbid public
officials from using their control of government funds to punish
unpopular or offensive speech. And in word and deed, Giuliani made
it abundantly clear that he was acting against the museum because
he disapproved of the art in ``Sensation,'' particularly a portrait
of the Virgin Mary by artist Chris Ofili. Ofili, a Roman Catholic
of Nigerian descent, decorated the painting with a clump of
elephant dung and cutouts from pornographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and several Catholic leaders took great offense to the
painting, but Judge Gershon said this was no basis for trying to
``coerce the Museum into relinquishing its First Amendment
rights.'' She quoted from a 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision
overturning a New York statute that authorized the state to deny
licenses to motion pictures thought to be sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the business of government in our nation,'' the
Supreme Court ruled, ``to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a
particular religious doctrine, whether they appear in publications,
speeches, or motion pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon noted that among the museum's collection of 1.5
million artworks are many reverential depictions of the Madonna.
``No objective observer,'' she wrote, ``could conclude that the
Museum's showing of the work of an individual artist which is
viewed by some as sacrilegious constitutes endorsement of
anti-religious views by the city or the Mayor, or for that matter,
by the Museum, any more than that the Museum's showing of
religiously reverential works constitutes and endorsement by them
of religion.''

SEARCHERS BEGIN RETRIEVAL OF REMAINS, WRECKAGE FROM FLIGHT 990

   NEWPORT, R.I. _ As hope of finding survivors evaporated, search
crews collected human remains and a large piece of a doomed
EgyptAir jetliner from its ocean grave Monday, and detected pinging
sounds believed to be from one of the plane's two so-called black
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   High-technology Navy salvage ships steamed for the wreck site
off the coast of Massachusetts in advance of a gathering autumn
storm that was expected to transform Monday's ideal, summer-like
search conditions. And National Transportation Safety Board
chairman James E. Hall warned Monday it would be ``36 to 48 hours''
before the Navy vessels could be positioned for recovery
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, who were assembling a team up to 1,000 members
strong, made plans for a temporary morgue at Quonset Point. They

   ``We don't know anything yet. We need data. Data is the key to
any understanding,'' he said. ``The (flight data recorder) must be
found, otherwise nobody knows anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides dozens of US tourists, the Pentagon said the EgyptAir
plane carried about 30 Egyptian military officers, many of them
army pilots. They had been flying AH-64 ``Apache'' attack
helicopters during training exercises in the United States. Three
of the officers were brigadier generals.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir said the passengers included 106 Americans, including
54 bound for a two-week trip to Egypt and the Nile, 62 Egyptians,
22 Canadians, three Syrians, two Sudanese and one Chilean. The full
passenger list was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With more precise radar data from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the Coast Guard narrowed its search to a
40-square-mile patch of ocean 250 feet deep. There, they found
``small portions of the aircraft, primarily seats and cushions, the
remains of people's clothing and paperwork,'' Larrabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee said he had no information that any of the recovered
items showed burn marks or anything else that would indicate a fire
or explosion. He said while one body has been recovered, ``we have
begun to see evidence of further human remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Collection of those remains, Hall noted, ``has been extremely
limited and we may be looking at a more extended period than in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as officials awaited a National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration vessel with side-scan sonar to begin
mapping the ocean floor in an effort to pinpoint the areas of
debris, Coast Guard boats continued to search the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who do this business for a living, this is
certainly another one of those tragedies that is very difficult for
all of us to deal with,'' Larrabee said. ``Our thoughts and prayers
are with those victims and all of the families as they deal with
this very traumatic event.''

MERCHANT MARINE TRAINEES ARE FIRST TO FIND CRASH SITE AND ITS GRIM
DEBRIS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass.)   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, a terse alert crackled from the radio of
the Kings Pointer as the training ship steamed across the Atlantic
south of Cape Cod: a Boeing 767, Egyptair Flight 990, had
apparently gone down south of Nantucket. Ships in the area were
urgently needed to help search for it.
</P>
<P>
   That alert radically transformed what had been the ship's
routine annual fall ``liberty run,'' in which cadets from the
Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., venture out to sea
for a training mission before heading to Boston for several days of
shore leave.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after that alert, 17 cadets who were the equivalent
of college upperclassmen found themselves, along with 9 instructors
and crew, circling at dawn through a spreading pool of jet fuel and
grabbing with gloved hands at hundreds of fragments of wreckage,
luggage and human remains that came bobbing to the surface around
them.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, their vessel was the first _ by more than an hour _
at the crash site, and it quickly became clear that what the cadets
and crew hoped would be a rescue mission was something far grimmer.
When the alert first came in, four people were on duty: three
cadets, all under 21, and a recent graduate, Bryan Grube, 24, who
had volunteered to serve as an officer on the training run while on
vacation from his position on an oil tanker on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Grube reflected on the events of the next few hours,
which he said were still tumbling in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the academy, we receive training in ship's medicine, CPR,
trauma, but I've never seen anything like it,'' he said. ``I'm 24
years old. I'm just out of school a few months now. I've lived a
pretty quiet life. I never thought I'd see something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Grube and other crew members and cadets described in interviews
Monday how the ship stumbled on the crash site 10 miles from the
spot identified by the Coast Guard as the last known location of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   After the radio alert, they headed east at the 12-mile-an-hour
top speed of the ship, until, at 5:55 a.m., the growing cluster of
cadets and crew members on the bridge noticed a spot ahead where
the sea surface, which was otherwise lightly ruffled, appeared dark
and flat.
</P>
<P>
   They were still about an hour from the theorized crash site,
said the ship's commander, Capt. Robert Allee of the Maritime
Service. When he stepped outside of the bridge cabin, the breeze
hit him, and immediately so did ``the overpowering odor of fuel,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, only a few floating plastic shopping bags floated in
the black surface of the water, said Benjamin Lyons, 20, a
fourth-year cadet from Glyndon, Md. But as the rest of the cadets
were roused by orders from the bridge and the ship came to a stop,
objects large and small slowly rose to the surface in a surreal
upside-down rain of wreckage, belongings and remains, several
members of the crew said.
</P>
<P>
   Allee notified the Coast Guard, but it would be more than an
hour until the first helicopters and rescue ship, the cutter
Monomoy, arrived. In the meantime, they were alone at the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered his ship's white 16-foot inflatable rescue boat
lowered into the water to begin collecting material before the wind
carried it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a training ship _ these are college-age youngsters on
board _ but they all did their duty and performed very
professionally,'' the captain said. ``It started to sink in to them
as the day wore on that they were in the midst of a real tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to accounts provided by the Coast Guard and aviation
officials on Sunday, the cadets and crew said Monday that they
retrieved only partial remains, not a body.
</P>
<P>
   Grube said many objects could be seen floating suspended beneath
the surface, adding that at one point the ship's depth sounder,
which had been steadily reading depths of around 180 feet, suddenly
jumped to 5 feet. ``You have to wonder if that was a piece of the
aircraft that was down there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did his stint in the little boat, filling plastic bags and
buckets with pieces of beige foam, with airline tickets, passports,
toys and many, many shoes _ large and small. Nothing appeared
burned, the cadets said.
</P>
<P>
   But every object spoke of the immensity of the tragedy when an
airliner goes down, he said. ``You would see little teddy bears,
plane tickets, wallets, all these remnants of what was,'' Lyons
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and the others continued to work through the morning, but a
breeze began to disperse the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours after the cadets first encountered the crash site,
at 2 p.m. on Sunday afternoon, the Coast Guard released the Kings
Pointer from the search for victims and wreckage, transferring its
lode of recovered material to other ships.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said he was proud to think that the cadets probably saved
many hours of flying time by rescue craft searching for the crash
site. But he was still shaken, and would be for days to come, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grube said: ``You expect a nice quiet trip up to Boston, but you
never know. One of the rules out here is to keep a sharp lookout at
all times. It's actually required by law. You just never know what
you'll ever see.''

 &HT;    Henderson health a key for Hawks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forward Alan Henderson has one goal in mind as the
Atlanta Hawks prepare for the new season, starting tonight against
the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal for this season is simple,'' Henderson said. ``I want
to play in all 82 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Good health is a prerequisite for Henderson, who has missed a
number of games with injury during his four-year career. Henderson
played 79 games as a rookie in 1996-97, but played only 30 games
the following season and 69 games in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson played 38 games in the lockout-shortened 1999 season
but missed the final week of the regular season and the playoffs
after he was struck in the eye by Cleveland's Cedric Henderson (no
relation). Alan Henderson has battled weak ankles, now made
stronger by exercise; assorted muscle pulls; and a prolonged bout
with pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, Henderson says, he has emerged stronger for his
battles. Financially, he is established, as he starts the second of
seven seasons in a $40 million deal. Physically, Henderson says, he
has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks bigger, maybe 6-9,'' center Dikembe Mutombo said. ``I
think he's grown to about 6-9.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 6-10, Deek. I've been 6-9.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Al, you were never 6-9.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no argument that Henderson has played bigger than
6-foot-9, especially in 1997-98 when he averaged 14.3 points,
averaged 6.4 rebounds, shot 48.5 percent and was named the most
improved player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time he had been honored. At Indiana, he was
Big 10 player of the year. For his work as a high school player in
Indianapolis,he recently was named one of the 50 best players in
Indiana history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Henderson would like to participate in more than a modicum
of NBA team success. Of 13 roster players, only he and Mutombo have
played more than two seasons in Atlanta. Better than others, they
know the onus of consistent playoff failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the mission, to get to the Finals,'' he said. ``But
saying that, it bothers me that people point to the players last
year and talk about what a disaster it was. Sure, it was bad
getting swept by the Knicks (in round 2), but we were out of
players. I was out. (LaPhonso Ellis) was out. Mookie (Blaylock) and
Steve (Smith) were worn out. It's not like the team quit.''
</P>
<P>
   On more than one occasion, Henderson has stated his belief that
trading Blaylock and Smith was an over-reaction. But that doesn't
mean he can't accept his new teammates _ all seven of them _ or
that he has lost faith in his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a chance to be pretty good, real good, in
fact,'' he said. ``There's a lot of talent in this locker room. All
we got to do is get on the ball, kick it out to the one, two or
three man (guards and small forward) and get it pushing. We'll come
behind them and fill the lane. (Last year,) we had to work hard
just to get a shot. But if we get a few easy baskets, that can make
a big difference. You get 15, 20 fast-break points in a game, come
the fourth quarter you'll be a lot fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lenny Wilkens has so many options, Henderson said, that
the Hawks constantly can present a different look. ``Just look at
how many guys we can have playing (the) three (position). Four
different guys. That's incredible. We've got a lineup to fit every
situation. A lot of talent. It's gonna be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to complete the picture, Henderson says, he needs only good
health.

COMMENTARY: UNCONTESTED CONTESTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va., Miss., Ky.)  By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy Election Day, America!
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but here in New York City we have a lot
of interesting decisions to make Tuesday, on issues ranging from
charter revision to the identity of the next Staten Island district
attorney. Voter participation is expected to climb into the double
digits.
</P>
<P>
   This is an off year for New York politics. But in Kentucky
they're having an election for governor, and the incumbent, Paul
Patton, still appears to be worried that nobody will show up to
vote. Patton is being challenged by a Republican named Peppy
Martin, who made a splash the other day by saying that the
governor's wife's first husband had been ``assassinated.'' (The
Republican chairwoman apologized on behalf of the party.) Voters
who find Ms. Martin a little intense have a third option in the
Reform slate, whose gubernatorial hopeful likes to introduce the
candidate for lieutenant governor as ``Kathy Lyons, my running mate
and concealed-deadly-weapon-permitee.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd rather be voting in Mississippi, where the polls
show a really close race to succeed Gov. Kirk Fordice, who has been
involved in an ongoing struggle to dump his wife of 44 years and
marry the woman who had been his girlfriend in high school. Need I
tell you that this has turned out to be a family-values election?
Each of the gubernatorial candidates has been vying to prove that
he is the least likely to take a state plane to the beach for a
date with his inamorata or get involved with a struggle over how to
evict his spouse from the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the kind of issue that could liven up a political
campaign, but those of us who live in safe districts dominated by
one party hardly ever get that sort of excitement. I remember one
year in which our congressman's main challenger was a convicted
arsonist, but the more typical story is Venerable Incumbent vs.
Underfunded Hopeless Newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   I want to live in a place like Virginia Beach, Va., which is
presently the site of a very hot race for the state legislature.
``I've gotten at least three hold-for-a-message-from-the-governor
calthree pieces of mail a day,'' says Karen Jones Squires, a
local voter. The two candidates in her district are expected to
spend up to $1 million dollars to win a job that pays $18,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Now when it comes to state legislatures, I am extremely well
informed _ i.e., I know the name of the guy who represents my
district. But all my expertise goes for naught, because in my
neighborhood the incumbent legislator always wins, frequently
through the cunning tactic of being the only name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty typical. The real dirty little secret of American
democracy is how many of our elections are really nothing of the
sort, because the districts are drawn to give one party or the
other an enormous advantage. About 80 members of Congress had no
major party rival last year, including 18 of the 23 House seats in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, where eight of 11 congressional races were
uncontested last year, the Democrats are now in danger of losing
their control over the state legislature. That would mean the
Republicans could redraw the district lines next year so more of
their candidates could win the meaningless, uncontested contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire future of Virginia will be decided in these
elections,'' hyperventilated Gov. James Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, even the battle for gerrymandering rights is fixed in
most Virginia districts _ 61 out of 100 seats in the House of
Delegates are basically uncontested, and almost all the others are
shoo-ins. If I lived there, I'd be really disappointed if my
neighbor got to decide the entire future of Virginia while I got
stuck with a race with only one name on the ballot. But people seem
pretty philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago our senator worked hard to win, and the
sentiment is that it's nice to see that this year he doesn't have
to spend his time and money getting re-elected,'' said Robert
Rummells, a Virginia Beach Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones Squires, on the other hand, has had enough attention.
``It was interesting for a short while but now it's annoying,'' she
said. ``I feel like writing in somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable for a person who's been trapped in a
perpetual phone loop with the governor, but I want power. In my
next life, I want to be reincarnated as an undecided voter in a
swing district.

WALTER PAYTON, 45, FOOTBALL GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss.)  (Eds: An abridged version of this story, slugged
OBIT-PAYTON-ABRIDGED, is also moving.) (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Payton, the Chicago Bears' running back whose
single-minded aggressiveness and singular combination of power and
speed made him the leading ground-gainer in pro football history,
died Monday at his home in Barrington, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He
was 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications from liver disease. Last Feb. 2, during
an emotional news conference in Chicago, Payton disclosed that he
had a rare liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis, in
which the bile ducts of the liver are blocked. He said the doctors
told him he would need a liver transplant within two years. A week
later, after further tests, doctors told him he needed a transplant
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He was said to have been on a waiting list with 12,000 others at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Dr. Greg Gores of the Mayo
Clinic said Monday that Payton had developed liver cancer, which
kept him from being a candidate for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Playing from 1975 through 1987 for the Bears, who endured many
mediocre seasons before becoming winners, he set a host of National
Football League records. He retired with career marks for rushing
yards (16,726) and attempts (3,838), combined yards (21,803
rushing, receiving and returning), rushing touchdowns (110),
100-yard rushing games (77) and 1,000-yard rushing seasons (10).
</P>
<P>
   He set a one-game rushing record of 275 yards against the
Minnesota Vikings in 1977. He was twice (1977 and 1985) voted the
league's most valuable player and nine times voted to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen and Emmitt Smith subsequently broke the record for
rushing touchdowns. Payton's other career records still stand. The
only player within 3,000 yards of Payton's rushing total is Barry
Sanders, who retired before the 1999 season, having gained 15,269
yards with the Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   After Payton's retirement, he turned his full attention to the
business career he had begun during his playing days and earned far
more than he ever had on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Finks, the late general manager of the Bears, once described
Payton as ``a complete football player, better than Jim Brown,
better than O.J. Simpson.'' On Monday, Dick Butkus, the Bears' Hall
of Fame linebacker who retired two seasons before Payton arrived,
called him ``a perfect example of what a true back was supposed to
be.'' &UR;  &LR; And Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, praised Payton as
``an inspiration in everything he did.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 10 1/2 inches and 204 pounds, Payton was not big for a
running back, but his strength and conditioning were legendary. He
could bench-press 390 pounds and do leg-press series with more than
700 pounds. He could throw a football 60 yards, punt it 70 yards,
kick a field goal of 45 yards and walk across a football field on
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Fred O'Connor, the Bears' former backfield coach, once said:
``The first time I saw Walter Payton in the locker room, I thought
God must have taken a chisel and said, `I'm going to make me a
halfback.'''
</P>
<P>
   One part of Payton's conditioning regimen took on mythic
proportions in the football world. For several months before the
start of each NFL season, he would run up a steep hill near his
Illinois home about 20 times a day. Sometimes he would bring along
teammates or local college players. ``I enjoy seeing them try it
once or twice, and then vomit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he routinely carried the ball 20 or more times a game
and was known as one of the best blockers among running backs,
Payton was never seriously injured. In his 13 professional seasons,
he missed only one game, when he had an injured ankle during his
rookie season. Missing that game grated on him for years, and he
blamed an assistant coach for not letting him play.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka, who coached Payton during the last half of his pro
career, called him ``the very best football player I've ever seen,
period, at any position.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was given his nickname, Sweetness, by teammates in the
Senior Bowl college all-star game. He was unsure whether it
referred to his sweet movements on the field or to the sweet,
sincere personality and high-pitched voice that made him sound like
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a selfless team leader, Payton would hand the ball to
an offensive lineman after scoring a touchdown because, he said,
``They're the ones who do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, the
first year he was eligible, and to the College Football Hall of
Fame in 1996. He played in nine Pro Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   For his induction ceremony at the Hall of Fame, he chose as his
presenter his son, Jarrett, then 12 years old. In his speech,
Jarrett said, ``Not only is my dad an exceptional athlete ... he's
my biggest role model and best friend.'' The son, a freshman
running back and kick returner at the University of Miami, returned
home Wednesday to be with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 33 and in his final season, Payton's devotion to
football was undiminished. ``This is something I want to do,'' he
said, ``something I love to do. Money isn't everything. Do you get
married because of money? Do you have kids because of money? It's
like something you have to fulfill in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton seemed almost hyperactive, never wasting a moment. Paul
Zimmerman wrote in Sports Illustrated: ``You get a feeling of
electricity. Sparks seem to shoot from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparks flew when Payton carried the ball. He was aggressive
rather than graceful. He ran with power and would never go out of
bounds if he could pound out an extra yard or two. He excused the
way he punished tacklers by saying: ``What about the pain they've
dealt out to me? Pain is expected in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Youngblood, a defensive end for the Los Angeles Rams, said:
``I remember a block he threw on me once and I thought he opened a
hole in my sternum, he hit me so hard. I said, `Walter, what are
you doing?' He said, `You were in the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Payton did not run over defenders, he disposed of them with a
stiff-arm to the head. Everson Walls, a cornerback who spent most
of his career with the Dallas Cowboys, recalled: ``I caught his
stiff-arm once, under my chin. It bent my head back, and where your
head goes, your body goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton did not apologize for his aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my running comes by instinct,'' he said. ``I don't try
to define it or explain it, only to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Walter Jerry Payton was born July 25, 1954, in Columbia, Miss.
He was one of three children of Peter Payton, a factory worker, and
his wife, Alyne.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, Walter was a good student more interested in
music than sports. In ninth-grade, he was a long jumper on the
track team and played drums in the school band at his segregated
high school. After school, he played and sang in jazz-rock combos.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided football, partly to avoid competing with his older
brother, Eddie, a star running back. After Eddie graduated, the
coach asked Walter, a sophomore, to try out for the team. He agreed
only after the coach allowed him to stay in the band.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Payton carried the ball, he gained 65 yards. His
school merged with an all-white school in his junior year, and
during his final two years he scored in every game and made the
all-state team. He also long-jumped 22 feet 11 1/4 inches, averaged
18 points a game for the basketball team, played baseball and was a
drummer in the band.
</P>
<P>
   Although major colleges sought him, he followed his brother to
the predominantly black Jackson (Miss.) State College, now Jackson
State University. As a junior he led the nation in scoring with 160
points, and his career total of 464 points set what was then an
NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   The only time he finished second in anything was during a
televised ``Soul Train'' dance contest. Years later, his college
coach, Bob Hill, said, ``He still swears that if he'd had a girl
who could dance better he could have won that contest.''
</P>
<P>
   At 20, he had a bachelor's degree in communications, earned in
three and a half years, and began work on a master's in education
for the deaf. He studied hard, he wrote in an autobiography,
``Sweetness,'' ``to help dispel the myth that athletes in general
and black athletes in particular don't have to work to get their
diplomas and that they don't learn anything anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL's 1974 draft, with the fourth choice overall, the
Bears picked Payton. He promised, ``When I get through with
Chicago, they're going to love me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The Bears gave him a $126,000 signing bonus, a
team record, and in his first season he led the league in kickoff
returns. In 1977, he had that 275-yard rushing game against
Minnesota and at 23 he was voted the NFL's most valuable player, at
the time the youngest ever to win the award.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a three-year contract, starting in 1978, with annual
salaries of $400,000, $425,000 and $450,000, dizzying numbers then.
After the 1983 season, he signed the NFL's most lucrative contract
to that point, with an annuity that guaranteed him $240,000 a year
for life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the Bears, who had become a winning team, reached their
conference championship game. In 1985, after a 15-1 season, they
routed the New England Patriots, 46-10, in Super Bowl XX, their
first NFL championship in 23 years. Payton rushed 22 times for 61
yards and was often used as a decoy. ``When they're keying on you,
you can't mind,'' he said. ``I don't mind being the rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's last season was 1987, when he had to share his position
with Neal Anderson. Still, he did not act his age of 33. On the
first day of training camp, when others were dehydrated, he took
extra sprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about old,'' he said then. ``When you
mention that, it kind of ticks me off. What is old?''
</P>
<P>
   But later that season, he broke down in the locker room and
cried. He realized it was time to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``I feel I'm the problem here. A lot of
times I feel I don't even belong here. These are feelings I've
never felt before. It's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed football, but when it ended, it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean I miss it,'' he said. ``It was a job. It was
work. I knew I had to go to work, so I might as well enjoy it. I
enjoyed it to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed the business career that followed, too. During his
playing days, he had founded Walter Payton Inc., with offices now
in Hoffman Estates, outside Chicago. After retirement, he devoted
more time to the company's investments, mainly in real estate,
restaurants, timberland, travel agencies and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   He began to race cars and boats. He owned an auto-racing team.
He was a partner in as many as 20 restaurants and nightclubs. He
was involved in promotions, endorsements and charities and was a
highly paid motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He became a member of the Bears' board of directors. He held a
15 percent interest in a group that bid in 1993 for an NFL
expansion franchise for St. Louis. That would have made him the
league's first black owner. The franchises went instead to
Jacksonville and Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He also found more time to spend with his family. In addition to
his son, Jarrett, he is survived by his wife, Connie, whom he
married in 1976; a daughter, Brittney; his mother; his brother,
Eddie, and a sister.
</P>
<P>
   After football, Payton remained sensitive to his image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't perceive myself as being better than anyone,'' he once
said. ``I shovel my driveway. I go to the grocery store. I pump my
own gas. Some athletes don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And in retirement, he had no regrets. ``What are you going to
do, erect a statue that says, `May he rest in peace?''' he asked.
``If you could go back and change things, you might not be the
person you are right now. And I'm pleased with the way I am now.
There were times it was frustrating and there were times it was
jubilant. Overall, it's been a lot of fun.''

RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN UNDER INVESTIGATION IS DETAINED IN HUNGARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One of Russia's most prominent businessmen has been
detained in Hungary at the request of Russian law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Monday that Anatoly Bykov, an aluminum
factory chief from Siberia, had been apprehended recently by
Hungary's border police. The Russian authorities have opened a
criminal investigation of Bykov's finances and are seeking his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has a dismal track record in arresting and convicting
corrupt officials and businessmen. But stung by accusations that
Russians have moved billions of dollars through foreign bank
accounts to avoid taxes and, perhaps, launder money, the Kremlin is
making an effort to demonstrate that it is serious about fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   And it has no loyalty to Bykov. As chairman of an aluminum
factory in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Bykov has often been
in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   He emerged as a political rival to Aleksandr I. Lebed, the
former general who is now the governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk
region. More recently, the Russian press has reported instances
that suggest that Bykov has laundered money and has organized
contract killings _ allegations that Bykov has strenuously denied.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov has been living abroad, apparently in an effort to avoid
prosecution at home. He has given television interviews from
undisclosed locations proclaiming his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bykov sought to run for parliament on the ticket
headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist politician.
Members of parliament enjoy immunity from prosecution, and Bykov's
recent interest in politics was widely seen as a bid to protect
himself from the police.
</P>
<P>
   Bykov denied that he had purchased a place on Zhirinovsky's
slate and insisted that he had developed a new-found love of
politics. In a television interview last month, he asserted that he
had been planning to enter politics before he was accused of
financial irregularities and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only improve the situation by our concrete actions,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Central Election Commission put an end to Bykov's
candidacy. It barred him from running on the grounds that he had
failed to disclose all of his property holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his supporters in Krasnoyarsk, Bykov was trying to
contest that ruling from his foreign hideaway. But things went from
bad to worse when he was detained at the request of Interpol and
the Russian interior ministry. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass
reported Bykov was detained by Hungarian border guards on Monday at
the Hungarian-Yugoslav border.

 &HT;    Governor Bush leaps to safety after truck nearly runs him downBy
Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush narrowly avoided flying
debris when an out-of-control tractor trailer overturned Monday
near where the Republican presidential front-runner was jogging on
the north shore of Town Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush suffered minor bruises and scrapes to his right leg and hip
when he dove away from the Longhorn Disposal truck, which spilled
some of its load of concrete rubble and broken tree limbs onto the
hike and bike path.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was treated at the scene and later traveled to New
Hampshire on a campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the end of a three-mile run when I heard the noise,
looked back, saw it start to tip and my instincts were to dive,''
Bush said via telephone from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he scraped his right leg and hip when he dived behind
a bridge support. ``I've got a significant strawberry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Roscoe Hughey, part of the governor's security
detail, was treated for minor injuries and released after being
struck by some of the trash. Hughey was riding a bicycle near the
governor, who is a familiar figure on Austin's jogging trails.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Hughey, 39, was in pain Monday, and as a member
of the governor's security detail would not discuss the incident.
Traffic was rerouted for several hours until the mess was cleaned
up.
</P>
<P>
   A witness, Ernest Bedford, 50, a pipeline inspector for the city
who was working nearby, said he didn't hear any brakes squeal, just
``a big, loud bang.'' Bedford said he saw Bush in the clear but
``the other guy was reaching his hand up out of the debris.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used Hughey's cell phone to call security agents at the
Governor's Mansion, and they called 911, said Linda Edwards, Bush's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The governor told Vikki Branning, the Austin Emergency Medical
Services paramedic who treated him, that ``he didn't want to go to
the hospital,'' said Warren Hassinger, an EMS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hassinger said Hughey was taken to Brackenridge Hospital because
he suffered injuries to his right side and was having trouble
walking. ``He got knocked around pretty good,'' said Tom Vinger, a
spokesman for the Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they did not know why the truck went out of
control, but had no reason to suspect that the driver, who was not
injured, intended to hit the governor. Sally Muir, a spokeswoman
for the Austin police, said the driver, whose name was not released
pending an investigation, has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Desormeaux, manager of Longhorn Disposal, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the accident won't stop him from jogging on public
streets. ``I intend to go jogging (again) on the very same spot,''
Bush said.

BUSINESS SUPPORT DECLINES IN BRITAIN FOR ADOPTION OF THE EURO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a remarkable decline in support for adopting the
European single currency, British businesses are evenly split on
whether to abandon the pound sterling, a survey showed Monday _ a
sharp contrast to strongly favorable sentiment about the euro a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of the survey, conducted by the Mori polling group
and commissioned by The Financial Times, coincided with other signs
of boardroom disaffection not just with the single currency but
with what respondents called the failure of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government to promote the advantages of joining the
euro bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the euro _ and Britain's broader attitude toward
the rest of the European Union _ has come to form the central
political division in this country, the last major European economy
to resist joining the 11-nation euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey results also suggested that the euro's decline
against major currencies including the dollar, the yen and the
pound since its creation in January has mirrored the drop in
British corporate support. That augurs badly for Blair, who had
viewed the nation's executives and managers as a pool of support
for adoption of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The survey among 1,000 businesses of varying sizes found that 52
percent of those surveyed were in favor of abandoning the pound in
favor of the euro soon after the next national election which will
take place, at the latest, in 2002. That figure contrasted with 63
percent in a similar survey a year ago, which had been widely
regarded as a sign of a broad business support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major setback for the government,'' said Nick
Herbert, the head of Business for Sterling, saying the results
``give the lie to the pro-euro lobby's claim that business favors
the euro.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the survey results was timed to coincide with the
annual conference in Birmingham this week of the Confederation of
British Industry, the main employers' group, which castigated
Blair's government for its caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``British business would like to see the government leading the
debate on the pros of the euro,'' the group's president, Clive
Thompson, said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The employers' group maintains that British participation in the
euro zone of nations has ``the potential to deliver significant
benefits to the U.K. economy enabling British companies to
participate fully in a more complete and competitive single
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's circumspect approach partly reflects political
concern _ that a majority of British voters, encouraged by some
mass-circulation newspapers, do not want to lose the pound. The
authorities have said they will decide about euro membership only
after a referendum following the next election and only if the
currency meets a series of economic criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the government's attitude had ``delayed serious
debate longer than necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, rejected that
argument in a radio interview Monday, saying the government had
consistently advocated ``a strategy of prepare-and-then-decide''
and would insist that the European currency met British economic
criteria as a condition of entry. ``I believe we should be
applauded for our consistency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey suggested that British business generally looked
askance at such assurances. While 80 percent of those responding
said the government was right to insist on economic criteria, 76
percent thought political considerations would dictate the final
decision.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the British economy seems well out of sync with
Continental Europe, but in a way that the government praises as a
sign of Britain's flexibility and vibrancy. Unemployment around 5
percent, for example, is roughly half the Continental European
average.
</P>
<P>
   But reflecting British concerns about inflationary pressure,
benchmark interest rates of 5.5 percent are more than twice the
euro zone's 2.5 percent. At the same time, Britain has taken issue
with Continental European proposals to standardize some taxes
across the European Union in a way the British fear would damage
London's status as the leading European financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrisome to the government is the way the opposition
Conservative Party has been able to mine a seam of British popular
mistrust of the euro, making it a centerpiece of political debate.
</P>
<P>
   William Hague, the Conservative leader, who is stridently
opposed to the government's euro policies, extended his assault on
European economic practices Monday by assailing efforts to
harmonize taxes throughout the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Confederation of British Industry conference, he
compared highly taxed Continental European economies to ``great
stumbling mammals'' destined for extinction, while the ``lean,
low-tax nation state'' would survive and prosper. He extended the
Darwinian metaphor, labeling the Labor Party a ``woolly mammoth''
of big government and over-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison backfired somewhat when Matthew Taylor, a
spokesman for the pro-European Liberal Democrats, reminded Hague
that ``the woolly mammoth died out because it became isolated and
frozen out in the cold _ which is exactly where William Hague's
Britain would be left in Europe.''

WILL SALE OF BLASS LEAD TO A NEW IMAGE?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bill Blass wardrobe for Madonna? Suits for Sting?
</P>
<P>
   Those were a couple of the marquee names bandied about as
potential Blass customers by Charles A. Koppelman, a partner in CAK
Universal Credit, which last week worked out a deal to finance the
purchase of Bill Blass Ltd. through bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In the transaction, which an executive who worked on the deal
said is expected to bring Blass, 77, more than $50 million, the new
owners will be Haresh T. Tharani, the chairman of the Resource
Club, a Blass licensee, and Michael Groveman, who's been with the
Blass company 10 years and is chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't Sting be someone who wears Bill Blass?''
Koppelman said last Friday. It may be wishful thinking, but given
Koppelman's ties to the entertainment industry (he is the former
chairman of EMI-Capitol Records) and the fact that the Blass label
has lost ground to companies that court celebrities, it may not be
such an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Blass is going to be more valuable in 10 years
than it is now,'' Koppelman said, adding that while Blass' name may
hold more meaning with an older generation, he has a strong brand
identity that can be exploited. ``It's Coca-Cola. It's Bill
Blass.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppelman suggested there may be room for mass-marketing the
Blass style. ``For example, we could make a great case for going
back into the archives and bringing forward some of Bill Blass'
early couture designs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such decisions will be up to the company's new owners. Groveman
said: ``There are a lot of places to grow this brand. It's been
undermarketed for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will matter to stores and Blass fans is who will
design the label.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Blass jokingly said that he'll ``soon be found on
Fiji.'' Aside from the fact that Blass probably wouldn't care for
the food or the climate there (are there antiques on Fiji?), he may
find that key retailers, like Saks and Neiman Marcus, will be eager
to see that he has some hand in the design. Groveman said that
Blass does about $1 million in retail sales each season with Saks
in New York. Another possibility is that the owners will look for a
high-profile designer to give the brand heat.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the principals will speculate about the future of
the collection line, where suits retail for about $4,000, it seems
unlikely it will be stopped, given the company's niche in that
market.

U.S. SAID TO BE WORKING ON NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of secret exchanges with Beijing
over the past two weeks, the White House is racing to close a deal
by the end of this month that it hopes will pave China's way into
the World Trade Organization, even if Congress cannot pass judgment
on the agreement until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a phone call from President Clinton to President
Jiang Zemin late at night on Oct. 16, Washington and Beijing have
since engaged in what one official called an ``intense set of
interactions.'' Nonetheless, senior administration officials say
that there is only a 50-50 chance they will be able to close the
huge deal, which Clinton now views as his best shot at stabilizing
U.S. relations with China during his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has never publicly described that call, nor has
it described an internal strategy debate presided over by the White
House chief of staff, John Podesta, over how to close the elusive
deal. But according to Chinese and U.S. officials, Clinton offered
in the call to make the first move to break a long stalemate in the
talks, volunteering to send China's leaders the details of a deal
he characterized as Washington's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Those details have not been disclosed, but areas up for
discussion include telecommunications, financial services, textiles
and anti-dumping sanctions, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative reveals how desperately Clinton is attempting to
put back together the huge trade deal he walked away from in April,
a move his aides say he now deeply regrets.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the White House say that the deal offered in April
would still not satisfy the administration, one top official mused
last week, ``If we could get it again, we'd probably take it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment of maximum U.S. leverage to strike a deal is fast
approaching, as Clinton prepares to open a meeting of the world's
trade ministers in Seattle on Nov. 30. That session is expected to
set the agenda for a new round of global trade talks that will take
years _ and which China can influence only if it clearly is about
to join the group that sets the terms of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's conversation with Jiang, trade officials have
been working to put together a draft of an agreement, based on the
U.S. understanding of the deal that didn't happen in April. But the
process is made more difficult by continuing disagreements between
China and the United States about what concessions China's premier,
Zhu Rongji, brought with him on that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House's decision to publish a long list of
those concessions so inflamed some powerful Chinese business
executives and their political patrons that China has been forced
to pull back, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is no longer clear that China is still willing
to let U.S. firms own 51 percent of Chinese telecommunications
companies. But if the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, struck a deal that gave U.S. telecommunications firms
less of an inroad into the booming Chinese communications market,
she would have to make the case that she extracted other
concessions that went beyond China's offer in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly still want a deal and want it soon,'' one
administration official who has been in touch with the Chinese said
recently. ``But it's becoming clear it won't be exactly the same
deal. The politics have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mysteries that the White House has not yet solved is
whether Jiang is still committed to striking a deal, especially at
a moment when he is under growing economic pressure at home.
Clinton was clearly frustrated in New Zealand in early September,
when Jiang dragged his feet in restarting negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His Oct. 16 call was followed up a week later with a trip to
China by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. While Summers was not
sent to negotiate _ Jiang and the country's top trade negotiators
were all in Europe _ he saw Zhu and after a three-hour meeting
reported that the embattled prime minister was still committed and
eager for China to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure created by opening China's markets, Zhu
once again told Summers, would help spur China's own reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's political enemies have seized upon the list of
concessions that the White House published in April to help
undermine a deal. And U.S. diplomats say that China's leaders
appear concerned that in the last year of his presidency Clinton
lacks the clout to push the deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses would have to approve a change in the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which requires Congress to
review China's trade status annually, a vote that gives many in
Congress a chance to voice their disapproval of China's human
rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its ballooning trade
surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade status would be implicit in any deal that got
China into the World Trade Organization. But under one scenario now
being discussed in Ms. Barshefsky's office, the United States would
reach an agreement with China but would invoke a seldom-used
provision of the World Trade Organization's rules that would
prevent China from enjoying some of the trade benefits with the
United States until a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get a deal through Congress, even in an
election year,'' Rep. David Drier, the Republican who heads the
House Rules Committee, said in an interview last week. ``If
American industry says it's a good deal, I think that would be
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky is being unusually tight-lipped about the talks,
which would mark the biggest trade deal in her tenure and a major
part of Clinton's foreign-policy legacy. She does not want to
appear too eager to strike a deal, always a dangerous negotiating
position. And her influence in the White House remains murky: Her
advice that Clinton take the April deal was overruled, after Robert
Rubin _ the Treasury secretary at the time _ and other
administration officials said that it could not get through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Ms. Barshefsky announced that she expected formal
negotiations with China to resume this month. ``We have got to
see,'' she said Monday, when asked about the possibility of a deal.
``I'm neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I'm actually a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of work to do as we look ahead,'' she
said, noting that China would also have to conclude deals with
Europe, Canada and Latin America, though those would probably
closely follow whatever agreement was struck with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials close to Ms. Barshefsky say she may travel to
China before the Seattle trade meeting if there is enough progress
to suggest that a deal could be wrapped up in time for Clinton to
announce it during the Seattle session.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky still has two big hurdles to clear.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is textiles: At a moment when the United States is
urging other countries to drop trade barriers, Ms. Barshefsky is
under pressure from members of Congress representing textile-making
states to force China to agree to an extension of import quotas and
tariffs on Chinese-made fabrics. The Chinese are resisting. But
they may agree in return for other concessions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the biggest stumbling-block: China's insistence
that the United States surrender its ability to invoke unilateral
trade sanctions against Chinese products that it determines are
being unfairly ``dumped'' at below-market prices in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a vital one for unions, which insist that
anti-dumping actions are critical to saving manufacturing jobs.
They are already putting pressure on Vice President Al Gore, who
has courted them assiduously, to protect their interests in any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his aides say, has no intention of getting near the
Seattle meeting.

CLIPPERS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine Cinderella with 240 glorious days to kill
before retreating to the bucket and sponge.
</P>
<P>
   Did you get there?
</P>
<P>
   OK ... with that imagery reconciled, let's introduce your
Y2Clippers, who lace up their glass Nikes tonight for the inaugural
regular season ballgame at Staples Center. Before we sabotage the
optimism, we must report that expectations finally are higher than
the curb.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers finished 5-3 in the recently completed Pumpkin
League, their best exhibition record since 1993, when 5-3 became
the preamble to a 27-55 season.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing Clippers may have enough talent and sass to
push their October run beyond the rank of aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made strides and I think we're ready,'' said power
forward Maurice Taylor, the incumbent go-to Clipper and the lead
variable in our insistence on icing down the glee over what should
be an entertaining season. ``It should be pretty exciting ... at
least for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so cryptic?
</P>
<P>
   Well, 240 days from now, Taylor and new teammate Derek Anderson
will be storming into free agency. Matching their salary requests
against owner Donald T. Sterling's history for hoop investments
(the highest-paid Clipper in Sterling history was Stojko Vrankovic
at $4 million and change per season), it's safe to imagine ``Mo''
and ``DA'' taking what should be over 30 percent of the Clipper
offense to other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as returning goes, that's over,'' Taylor said Saturday,
his 23rd birthday, and the day before the NBA deadline to sign his
vigorously requested, six-year, $70.9 million extension. ``I'm
playing my last year here.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a 6-foot-5 guard who thus far seems like a bonanza
dividend in the sign-and-trade evacuation of Lamond Murray, has
less verbal leverage. Injuries limited his bargaining power after
two seasons in Cleveland, so he's deferring all contract talk to
his actions - until the contract-expiration emancipation of June
30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So now that we've chased off the enthusiasm, let's attempt to
drag it back.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, Rodney Rogers, Lorenzen Wright, Pooh Richardson and
Darrick Martin are not here.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom is.
</P>
<P>
   While the dearly departed, aforementioned Clippers are decent
players, as well as fine fellows, they were afflicted with what
Taylor refers to as ``Clipper Syndrome.'' Their collective itch to
leave made Coach Chris Ford's first season in L.A. as warm and
fuzzy as a custody scrum.
</P>
<P>
   His second season could be defined by Odom, the 6-9 rookie from
Rhode Island, whose beguiling maneuvers and competitive spirit
should make these Clips superior to last season's 9-41 crew.
</P>
<P>
   In cahoots with Taylor, Anderson, and second-year center Michael
Olowokandi, Odom may be the front man in a promising quartet. They
will be abetted by the swashbuckling efforts of small forward
Tyrone Nesby, last season's CBA plum, who needs to fit his new
contract, refined perimeter touch and fortified ego into the
sixth-man role.
</P>
<P>
   Strongman Brian Skinner (6-9, 255 pounds) has emerged as a force
in the dawn of his second season, and appears capable of surpassing
Wright's contributions in low-post combat off the bench. He'll do
this without his predecessor's strategic pouting or superstar
delusions.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi has a bit more polish this season, to go with
healthier knees and a softer shooting touch (he made 71 percent of
his free-throw attempts in the exhibition spin after making just 48
percent last season).
</P>
<P>
   Veteran newcomer Eric Murdock and Troy Hudson, last year's
second CBA discovery, will swap time at point guard when Odom isn't
sliding into that spot.
</P>
<P>
   Could be about time to let the good times roll, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, even though Odom turns 20 Saturday, he is wise enough to
recognize the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect is something you earn,'' he said. ``We haven't done a
thing to switch that around.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but it should be fun watching Odom and the Clippers try.
</P>
<P>
   Odom played four positions during the exhibition trial, leading
the team in scoring (18 points per game) and rebounding (8) while
ranking third among Clippers in assists and blocked shots. He also
finished third among NBA employees in the Pumpkin League for
minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs the experience,'' said Ford, who maintains a posture
of cautious optimism when assessing the draft's fourth overall
pick. ``The entire season is going to be a learning experience for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting lesson could be taught when the Clippers'
almost maudlin declarations of team harmony are challenged by
adversity ... such as the typical rash of playing-time
confrontations. Or the twisted karma of shot distribution. Or the
reality of getting socked in the mouth by an elite team. Remember,
the Clippers' exhibition joy included an 0-2 finish against
contestants from last season's NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't splinter at the first sign of failure,'' said Ford,
who spent October attempting to school the Clippers in the finer
points of up-tempo offense and aggressive, trapping defense.
``Twenty-eight days go by pretty quickly. We'll see what happens
when we start playing for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel good about this team. I like their work ethic. I
like the general tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the pricey acoustics at Staples, it all may sound pretty
good.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the clock strikes midnight in 240 days.

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
POWER FORWARD:
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's 6-9 in your program, about 6-8 in real life, but Maurice
Taylor uses an ankle-cracking, left-to-right crossover as his
equalizer against the league's more vertically gifted ``four'' men.
He also offers a solid post-up game over each shoulder, and has
developed a dependable mid-range jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is strong enough to defend against most post low-post
heavies, but must prove he's a big-time rebounder for the Clippers
to exceed and agent David Falk to coax a maximum contract-extension
offer from potential suitors.
</P>
<P>
   The main reserve is Brian Skinner (6-9, 255), who gets into the
air quickly and has become a minor threat (to the defense) with the
ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap insurance is provided by free agent Anthony Avent (6-8).
</P>
<P>
   SMALL FORWARD:
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Odom (6-9) frequently is compared to Magic Johnson, but
for practical purposes, it might be better to think of him as a
taller, left-handed Scottie Pippen with a superior post-up game.
</P>
<P>
   If the wiry Odom can survive all the rough play the league can't
erase and keep defenders honest from the perimeter, he'll be
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Nesby (6-6) will provide thrills and chills as sixth man,
but needs to commit to the grunt work that launched his career last
season.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER:
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi (7-0), the No.1 pick in the 1998 draft,
enters his second season with improved skills and an mended left
knee. But Olowokandi and his critics need to realize that defense
and rebounding will measure his effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner plans to use his strength and quickness to irritate the
centers who get Olowokandi in foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Closs (7-3) could add a few minutes of shot-blocking help
if he decides to quit moping when he isn't used.
</P>
<P>
   OFF GUARD:
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson (6-5), acquired from Cleveland in the
sign-and-trade of Lamond Murray, was supposed to be moody, mouthy
and selfish. Since landing on Planet Clipper, he's been terrific
off the court and in all categories on it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Piatkowski (6-6), last season's starter, now has the role
of reserve sniper, spotting up when defenses double Taylor and
Odom.
</P>
<P>
   POINT GUARD:
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Eric Murdock (6-1), acquired from New Jersey where
injuries limited him to 15 games last season, probably starts. For
now. Murdock's wheels remain questionable, but he still has a jones
for stealing the ball and a reliable stroke from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Hudson (6-1) was all the rage after arriving from the CBA
last season, but his two-guard tendencies continue rising to the
surface. He's a sensational shooter, exceptionally quick, but needs
to make better decisions as a playmaker and use his physical tools
to be viable on defense.
</P>
<P>
   BENCH:
</P>
<P>
   Nesby, Hudson, Skinner and Piatkowski provide high energy and
some scoring pop, but not much experience.
</P>
<P>
   COACHING:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ford's second Clippers team has more athleticism and
firepower, but his biggest challenge is to conjure a better
defensive effort and prevent the young turks from assuming each
loss is the first symptom of ``Clipper Syndrome.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, worried that it could
be blamed if Yugoslavs freeze to death in the winter, has decided
to support a European-run pilot program to send millions of dollars
worth of heating oil to Yugoslavia, senior administration officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the pilot program goes well, Washington will consider helping
to expand the oil deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be supportive of any proposal that meets
humanitarian requirements and can assist the opposition, so long as
we are not bolstering the regime,'' a spokesman for the State
Department, James Rubin, said. He added that the United States
already provided tens of millions of dollars to international
groups toward that end.
</P>
<P>
   At first the administration had opposed the European proposal,
fearing that President Slobodan Milosevic would divert the oil to
his business cronies or to the Yugoslav military. The
administration also feared that by alleviating the hardships of a
cold winter, the oil might diminish public protests about his
government.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials said they had decided to back the
European plan for humanitarian reasons, and with an understanding
that the oil would go to two cities in southeastern Serbia that are
governed by opponents of Milosevic's Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union agreed to supply $5 million in heating oil
and to pay to transport it to the cities, Nis and Pirot, beginning
this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the project is seen as a success, the officials said, the
United States will consider supporting _ and helping to pay for _
an expansion to other Yugoslav cities. Yugoslavia is faced with
devastating energy shortages after the destruction of petroleum
refineries during NATO's air war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the United States remains
firmly opposed to other proposals offered by European nations to
end the economic and diplomatic isolation of Yugoslavia, in
particular one to allow international airlines to resume flights to
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of high-ranking Yugoslav opposition leaders now
visiting the United States has been pressing for American support
for the heating oil shipments. The opposition leaders are also
trying to display their solidarity to Washington and to portray
Milosevic as a wounded leader.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group, which is expected to meet with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright and White House officials later this
week, say the oil is needed to prevent a human disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without it, people will freeze to death,'' said Zoran
Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis and member of the opposition delegation.
``If the heating oil is not provided, it will be a great victory
for Milosevic, because it will just reinforce the position that the
West hates all Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation leader, Dragoslav Avramovic, a former central
bank governor and a candidate for prime minister in any
transitional government in Yugoslavia, said that Milosevic was far
weaker politically than was often portrayed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic situation of Milosevic is desperate,'' he said.
``Prices are increasing 10 percent a week, which is 50 percent a
month, and it is difficult to see how the regime will survive. He
is now the obstacle to the recovery of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party, said he was
convinced that Milosevic would soon be ousted from office, despite
his willingness in recent weeks to use violence to put down
anti-government street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is history,'' he said, drawing comparisons with the
final days of President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and President
Suharto of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dictator must be strong or he doesn't exist,'' he said.
``Ceausescu was very strong until two days before his execution.
Suharto was strong a month before he was gone. Milosevic now is
like a fireman with five different fires, and with very little
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation is also trying during its visit here to put an
end to the perception in Washington that the Yugoslav opposition is
fragmented, and that it is incapable of offering a serious
alternative to Milosevic and his loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genuine opposition is not divided,'' said Vladan Batic,
coordinator of the Alliance for Change, an opposition group that
has organized many of the recent demonstrations that have drawn
tens of thousands of anti-government protesters to the streets of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, a philosopher who was imprisoned in the 1980s for
trying to establish an independent student organization, said it no
longer mattered if there were policy or personality disputes among
the opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are not important now,'' he said. ``The people on
the streets are now the opposition.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's advisers, acknowledging they
were caught off guard by Sen. John McCain's recent rise in the
polls in New Hampshire, say they are bracing for a hard-fought
contest in the state that holds the first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still the indisputable front-runner for the Republican
nomination, and his advisers do not seem especially panicky about
McCain. Even so, Bush's advisers said that McCain's inroads
underscored a new reality for the governor of Texas: He can no
longer expect a blissful glide to the general election. They said
that McCain could complicate Bush's strategy for wrapping up the
nomination quickly and, if McCain wins in New Hampshire, he could
threaten the entire Bush juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly didn't feel it was going to narrow this quickly,''
said Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Bush's most influential
supporter in the state. ``But as John gets more visibility, some of
his warts are going to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person close to the Bush operation, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said, ``I don't want to say there was a
classic Texas arrogance, but their overall M.O. was not to directly
engage and stay above the fray. That now becomes an untenable
strategy because you're in a new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has embarked on an accelerated schedule in New
Hampshire. Last week, he opened his first television advertising
drive there (as did McCain), and on Monday he arrived in the state
for two days on the stump.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop will be Dixville Notch, a tiny enclave in the
north that incorporated years ago solely so it could cast the first
ballots in presidential campaigns. Bush will be the last major
candidate this year to pay homage to the voters in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush will deliver his third major education address
in New Hampshire. His first two speeches were in New York and Los
Angeles, with audiences that had a special connection to the
content of the speeches. The choice of New Hampshire appeared more
geared to Bush's need to shower more attention on the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers also said they hoped to pick up support in New
Hampshire by tailoring their television commercials to the local
audience. The campaign has begun running a commercial on the
governor's tax-cutting policies, which his advisers said was
popular in focus groups of New Hampshire voters. The advisers said
a Bush commercial about ``armies of compassion'' did not test as
well in the state, but was still popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has multiple messages,'' said Fred Steeper, Bush's
pollster. ``And what the research does is test which of those
multiple messages seem more relevant to the New Hampshire voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, after spurning two debates in New Hampshire _ and finding
himself under harsh attack by his opponents and local editorials _
Bush has agreed to take part in a forum on Dec. 2. Only weeks ago,
his campaign had said the governor would not debate until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say they are not overly concerned with McCain
because the senator is concentrating his limited resources on only
two states: New Hampshire and South Carolina. They also insist that
they had always intended to intensify their campaign schedule in
New Hampshire. Yet they also said they were moving more swiftly in
the state, not merely in reaction to McCain but to other realities
of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the state has moved up the date of its primary to
Feb. 1, which put more pressure on Bush to get his campaign in gear
faster. In addition, no one expected that so many major candidates
would withdraw from the race so early, including Elizabeth Dole,
former Vice President Dan Quayle and Pat Buchanan, who won the New
Hampshire primary in 1996 and is now seeking the Reform Party
nomination. McCain has picked up support from the narrowed field as
has Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is in a particularly enviable position because this state
has a history of rewarding mavericks, and of punishing front
runners. The senator has made this state a central focus of his
campaign. He has virtually ignored Iowa, where he is far less
popular, and has stumped in New Hampshire far more than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through some scares up there with President Bush,''
Steeper said. ``New Hampshire can always have upsets because it's a
small state and people react to retail campaigning. I take the
polls seriously: they probably reflect the state of the current
campaigns: There's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd said people should not underestimate the harm from The
Union Leader of Manchester, whose conservative editorials have
attacked Bush for ignoring the state, among other things. ``The
Union Leader every day is pounding Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In numerous interviews on the ground in New Hampshire in the
past several days, voters and strategists warned that Bush needs
more of a presence in the state. McCain has been attracting
exuberant, and large, crowds on his trips to the state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very possible that McCain could outwork Bush and pull an
upset that would send shivers through the Republican
establishment,'' said Dave Carney, a veteran Republican strategist
here who is not affiliated with any campaign. ``He's got the
personality that would definitely appeal to New Hampshire voters.
But George Bush is an excellent retail politician, he can talk to
people in a warm and friendly way.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Bush could also run into trouble from Steve Forbes, the wealthy
publisher who is well organized in New Hampshire and is expected to
spend huge sums on television advertisements against Bush _
commercials that could presumably help McCain as well. Thus far,
Forbes lags both Bush and McCain in polls. But if he gains ground
in the state, he could also eat into Bush's support from
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain, Bush and Forbes right now are clearly in the first
tier,'' said Steve Duprey, the state Republican chairman. ``McCain
has the advantage in that he is focusing on far fewer states. And
Bush is truly campaigning nationally. They are very different
strategies suited to different budgets.'' He said that while the
Bush campaign was ``taking some hits'' for not appearing more
frequently in the state, the campaign ``was not unmindful of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dennehy, McCain's New England political director, said of
the Bush campaign, ``All they care about is spending and staying on
message. I think the people of New Hampshire are smart enough to
understand the difference between that and straight talk.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Several recent polls in New Hampshire show that while Bush has
not lost significant support, McCain has gained as other contenders
dropped out. Two polls, for example, found that he still trails
Bush, but the gap has narrowed from 35 points to 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone survey taken by Research 2000, Oct. 20-21, Bush
was the choice of 39 percent of Republican voters, McCain was the
favorite of 27 percent. The poll was conducted statewide with 413
Republican primary voters. A poll in August found that Bush had 45
percent; McCain, 10 percent. Both polls have a margin of sampling
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Another poll, by Quinnipiac College, also found McCain within
striking distance of Bush, 41 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mr. McCain also has more widespread appeal across party lines
than Bush. Though a sizeable number of New Hampshire voters still
have no opinion of McCain, polls show that majority of people who
have an opinion, like him. That is true not only for both
Republicans and Democrats, but also the crucial independent voters
who can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary in New
Hampshire. Among those who have an opinion of Bush, polls show
Republicans like him, Democrats do not like him and independents
are evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush needs to start coming to New Hampshire a little more
because New Hampshire does strange things in the primary,'' said
Jim Sullivan, a Republican who is chairman of the town budget
committee in Hooksett, N.H. ``I don't think we like to be told who
we have to vote for. We need to see the candidate. That's what
makes New Hampshire unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Reed Paige Clarke III, a retired consular
affairs officer from Londonderry, N.H., warned Bush not to take New
Hampshire for granted. New Hampshire voters, she said, were ``more
offended by his not showing up here than by his being the heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who is 70, said that besides Bush, McCain was the most
viable contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks rather straight and right from the hip,'' he said.
``He doesn't bother walking around the corner when he can go right
straight through.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Mason of Meredith, N.H., a professor of business at
Plymouth State College who has followed the state's primaries for
years, said McCain was gaining steam because he was ``an antidote
to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how many Democrats I've heard say they're
going to vote for McCain,'' Mason said. ``It's definitely a Clinton
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that former President George Bush was not wildly
popular in the state _ particularly when he reneged on his
no-new-taxes pledge _ and that that could hurt his son. ``The old
man always took a beating in this state,'' Mason said. ``In this
state, with the Bush family, they've not been liberal enough for
the liberals and not conservative enough for the conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that McCain was so aggressive in New Hampshire
``because he realizes if he doesn't do well here, he's done.''

IN FIGHT AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS, EXPERTS LOOK FOR PRIVATE HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   International public health officials and scientists are trying
to enlist leading American philanthropists in plans to create a
$500 million to $600 million trust fund next spring to help stop
the spread of tuberculosis. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, executive director of the World
Health Organization, said in a recent interview that there is now a
consensus that a main obstacle to stopping the spread of TB is a
lack of drugs to treat the 8 million people who contract the
disease each year. She called the $100 million now being spent to
fight TB ``in no way sufficient'' to help poor countries stem the
disease that killed 2 million people last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland said the director of organization's ``Stop TB''
initiative believes that with a fund of $500 million to $600
million, ``the problem of access to drugs would be solvable.''
</P>
<P>
   The health organization began the initiative _ a partnership
with leading scientific labs and nonprofit anti-TB groups in
Europe, Asia and the United States _ after a White House meeting
last year that reflected growing alarm about the disease, the
world's leading infectious cause of death among adults.
</P>
<P>
   Brundtland was in New York partly to attend a meeting last
Thursday on the rapid spread of TB strains resistant to various
drugs _ strains that have been detected in more than 100 countries.
The meeting was sponsored by the Open Society Institute, a
foundation financed by George Soros, who has committed more than
$15 million to tuberculosis-related programs.
</P>
<P>
   Soros' foundation also financed a report released last week that
documented the rapid spread of drug-resistant TB to more than 100
countries and called for a new treatment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Soros said governments must do more
to fight the disease, as must ``newer, younger foundations with
greater resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Soros nor Brundtland would identify which foundations
they had in mind, but several participants at last week's meeting
said they clearly included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
which has assets exceeding $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corp., and his
wife committed $750 million over five years to speed the delivery
of vaccines against four childhood diseases to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Foege, a physician who advises the Gates foundation
on medical giving, said that apart from already contributing $25
million to help fund research on TB vaccines, the foundation has
made no decision about what else it might do. But he said last
week's meeting highlighted the need both for more money and more
thought about how best to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David L. Heymann, who heads the organization's division of
communicable diseases, said the partners in the TB initiatve would
work toward beginning a trust fund campaign or other programs by
next March, when public health and finance officials plan to gather
in Amsterdam to discuss the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement about how best to spend money to treat
tuberculosis. Some experts fear that expanding treatment for
patients with the drug-resistant strains _ which requires them to
take up to seven expensive drugs daily for 18 to 24 months _ would
divert resources from care for those who have strains that are not
drug-resistant. Only 20 percent of the latter group receive
adequate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Geneva Monday, Heymann said there
was a consensus at the New York meeting that action is needed to
contain the epidemic of drug-resistant strains, but not at the
expense of the other patients. Foege said the New York meeting
``moved the dialogue along so that people can stop fighting one
another and start fighting the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chen, executive vice president of the Rockefeller
Foundation, cautioned that while the meeting stimulated greater
concern about TB's spread, some experts were still not convinced
that ``buying drugs through a trust fund is necessarily the best
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Major questions about how best to allocate money remained, he
said, such as what experts in those poorer countries with high TB
rates want and whether their public health systems can support the
distribution of more drugs to patients and can monitor them to
insure the drugs are taken.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said the meeting also
emphasized that, despite substantial donor fatigue, ``TB is now on
our back door step. If we don't pay now, we'll pay later, and in
far greater amounts.''

 By JAIMEE ROSE 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  We're really hurting for Elaine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the Seinfeld sign-off, we've been desperate to hear
``get out!,'' dying to see her dance (well, maybe not), aching for
the laughs that only a show supposedly about nothing can bring.
</P>
<P>
   We say supposedly because we've made a discovery. Seinfeld was
not a show about nothing. Seinfeld was a show about hair.
</P>
<P>
   George was all about baldness, Jer ry's 'do was the paramount of
neatness, Kramer's crop was fright ening, and Elaine was the girl.
</P>
<P>
   And she had curls.
</P>
<P>
   She was one in a million, if you think about it. Prime-time
curls have mostly been reserved for redheads (Lucy, Carol Burnett,
Melissa on thirtysomething), or for crazy women (Lucy, Carol
Burnett, Melissa on thirtysomething). Long, sexy ma nes of curls
were not the providence of Melrose, did not live in the 90210 zip
code, were not around when Peggy Lipton was mod.
</P>
<P>
   That Girl had smooth hair even in New York; Ginger had it even
on her island. Farrah had serious hair, but none of the Angels had
to deal with the frizzies. For that matter, neither did Laurie
Partridge, Samantha Ste phens, Marcia Brady or those little girls
who lived on the prairie. When Larry dreamed of Jeannie, naturally
she had long, straight blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, it seems like prime-time got a perm. We have
noticed _ and we've counted _ at least a dozen actresses with long
curls in the spotlight now.
</P>
<P>
   There's ER's Julianna Margulies. She's old hair, just like her
show. There's Providence's Melina Kanak aredes. She's new. There's
the blond locks of Sarah Jessica Parker on Sex and the City and the
brown locks of Debra Messing (Grace on Will &AMP; Grace). They've been
around.
</P>
<P>
   New this year, there' s Amy Bren neman on Judging Amy, Jean
Louisa Kelly on Cold Feet, and Rebecca Gayheart of Noxema fame, who
is sometimes curly, sometimes straight on Wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   We're up to seven. There's more: Suddenly Susan's Kathi Griffin,
Moesha's Brandy, Ally McBeal's Lisa Nicole Carson. Of course there
is Felicity's Keri Russell, who chopped her long locks (horror!)
this season and nearly was disqualified from our curl club. And
maybe the award for the true Elaine tribute goes to Ally McBeal's
curly-haired secretary, played by Jane Krakowski and named,
honorably, Elaine.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets better. The world's highest-paid actress, Ms. Julia
Rob erts, has curly hair. One of the world's most lusted-after men,
Tom Cruise, is married to Nicole Kidman and her curls. The
highest-grossing film of all time, Titanic, starred Kate Winslet in
her pre-Raphaelite glory.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there's pop princess Jen nifer Lopez, movie star and
L'Oreal spokeslady Andie MacDowell, Chris tian pop artist Amy
Grant, even acclaimed actress Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   Plus Ally McBeal's Judge Whipper, played by Dyan Cannon, which
makes three for Ally, so far.
</P>
<P>
   We've come a long way from the days when Jan's real problem with
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, was the bitter hair envy shared by so many
real-life girls.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Hoyt, a 27-year-old curly-haired stylist at Salon
Phoenix, was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried everything,'' she said. ``I would wash it and lay on
my pillow with it wet to try to make it flat, or I would take a
curling iron and try to make the curl soft.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard having curls when the world was in pursuit of
Marcia. If nothing else, girls with curls always had to go home
after a trip to the salon for hair sculpture before the bathroom
mirror. Those straight-haired stlyists just never understand. Hoyt
would spend up to 90 minutes wrestling with her hair each day.
</P>
<P>
   `'I wanted it straight. I wanted her hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's more inclined to go for the Julianna, thanks to
loads of curl-control product on the market and her time at beauty
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in high school,'' she says, ``I didn't know how to
control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's overwhelmed by options. On the shelves at beauty
supply shop Ulta 3, a national refuge for product junkies, there
are 13 curl control products in one section alone. Frizz-Ease. Bed
Head. Ultra-control gel for brunettes. Light control mousse for
greying blondes. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the products for curly girls who still,
despite the coolness of Elaine and company, want straight hair. And
that's OK. Elaine even went straight sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   For this, there is straightening balm. Glosser. Wax sticks. Bed
Head Con trol Freak Frizz Control &AMP; Straight ener Serum.
</P>
<P>
   The label of Bed Head, by the way, reads like a poem to any
curly girl gone straight: ``A Control Freak's final step - styling.
Restrain your unruly, freakin' hair without a strug gle. Become
sleek and smooth in seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of money to be made in curl control.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt knows it; she does it. She still has clients who come in
for chemical hair straightening. These are the ladies who used to
roll their hair around juice cans, trying to flatten it out. These
are the girls who did backbends over the ironing board while their
mothers starched and pressed their hair into Marcia obliv ion.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, says Hoyt, people are leaving their curls
be these days (sometimes, herself in cluded).
</P>
<P>
   There are websites, with product testimonials (``gel, girls,
skip the mousse''), dedicated to living with curly locks. Actress
Rita Wilson is quoted in this month's In Style magazine on the
glories of being able to live with curls. Ally McBeal's new fall
season 'do makes the most of Calista Flockhart's natural wave.
(Which makes four for that show.)
</P>
<P>
   So maybe this is the new status hair. Maybe long curls will be
to the late '90s what Jennifer Aniston's layered Rachel 'do was to
the early '90s. (Aniston, by the way, straightens her naturally
curly hair.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of it may be that whole '90s ``simplify your life'' thing.
Part of it may be the products.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we just really miss Elaine.

   LONDON _ Lord Jakobovits, the outspoken former chief rabbi of
Britain whose views on individual responsibility endeared him to
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, died Sunday morning at his home
here. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a brain hemorrhage, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   As head of an organization that made him the acknowledged
spokesman for British Jews, Lord Jakobovits had extremely
conservative views on social issues. But he defied easy political
characterization because of his often expressed sympathies with
Palestinians in lands under Israeli control and his opposition to
international arms trading. He used his own identification as a
refugee from Nazi occupation and the historical Jewish experience
of rising out of poverty and oppression through self-help as a
common underpinning for what appeared to critics to be
contradictory values.
</P>
<P>
   He came under criticism in Israel when he warned publicly that
he believed that the future of the Jewish state was at risk if its
government did not seek a way for peace with the Arabs. At the same
time, he stirred the hostility of British liberals by denouncing
abortion, homosexuality, infidelity and easy divorce. He once
advocated genetic engineering as a way of preventing the birth of
homosexuals, and in a debate about AIDS he said he thught that
``more important than clean needles are clean conduct and clean
thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall and bearded, he spoke in a florid manner that lent him a
prophetic appearance and bearing. On arriving in London as a
teen-ager, he had refused to utter another word in German,
developing a rich English with a minimized middle European accent.
</P>
<P>
   Immanuel Jakobovits was born on Feb. 8, 1921, in Koenigsberg,
Germany. With the rise of Hitler, his father, Julius, also a rabbi,
decided in 1936 to send him to England, where he received his
education. He studied both Jewish and general subjects, receiving
his undergraduate degree from Jews' College, the principal
theological seminary for English Jews, his rabbinical diploma from
Yeshiva Etz Chaim and his PhD from London University.
</P>
<P>
   He flirted with the idea of becoming a scientist and later in
life published a well-regarded book, ``Jewish Medical Ethics.'' But
at his father's urging, he studied for the rabbinate, and at 20,
with most rabbis doing service in the war, he became a minister of
the Brondesbury Synagogue in northern London. At war's end,
Jakobovits moved to the South East London Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, he became the rabbi of the Great Synagogue in the
financial district, the oldest Ashkenazic temple in London,
although he had to minister to his congregation in temporary
quarters because the traditional building had been badly bombed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he married Amelie Munk, an extrovert daughter of a
French rabbi, and moved to Dublin to be chief rabbi of Ireland.
They promptly became a pastoral team, opening their house to crowds
of guests and reaching out to people in a way that gave the rabbi a
reputation for personal compassion to go along with his fame as a
strict community moralist. She survives him, as do their two sons,
four daughters and 38 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, he moved to New York to become rabbi of the Fifth
Avenue Synagogue for nine years. Looking back later on his
experience with his prosperous congregants there, Jakobovits wrote,
``My challenge has been to make Orthodoxy elegant and fashionable
and to show that you don't have to live in squalor to be a strictly
traditional Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he answered the call to London to become chief rabbi of
the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth of
Nations, the largest organization of synagogues in the United
Kingdom, which Parliament established in 1870. Although Reform and
Liberal congregations do not belong to the organization, its head
becomes the leading spokesman for British Jews.
</P>
<P>
   As chief rabbi, his first mission was to heal a split that
threatened the 350,000 Jews in Britain, a dispute between a leading
Orthodox scholar and his predecessor, Rabbi Israel Brodie.
Jakobovits then acted to reorder the balance of expenditures to
reduce the sum directed at synagogues and increase education
spending. He set up a trust and, in a few years, doubled the number
of places at Jewish day schools.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1985, a report by the archbishop of Canterbury, ``Faith
in the City,'' took the Thatcher government to task for
overemphasizing individualism as the driving force to end poverty
and social deprivation, Jakobovits responded with his own document,
``From Doom to Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that immigrants and the unemployed should follow the
example of Britain's turn-of-the-century Jewish population and lift
themselves up through hard work without looking to the state to
rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   The views harmonized perfectly with those of Mrs. Thatcher, and
it was a time when the Church of England was one of her harshest
critics. She reportedly told people that she wished Jakobovits were
the archbishop of Canterbury. And she saw to it that he was
knighted in 1981 and made a peer in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Since his retirement as chief rabbi in 1991, he had been a
relatively active member of the upper house, attending sessions in
his dark blue yarmulke and speaking out on matters of religion and
morality.
</P>
<P>
   In one speech against plans to relax laws that bar commercial
activities on Sundays, Jakobovits said, ``The loss of the Sabbath
will deprive Britain of the last visible vestige of national
spirituality and sanctification.''
</P>
<P>
   The hush in the ornate chamber was broken by shouts from an
Anglican admirer in the galleries. ``But it takes a Jew to tell
you,'' he said.

LAKERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Change coaches, change players, change buildings,
change the linens _ it really doesn't matter what the Lakers do
each offseason, the basic result will be the same: higher
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   They're considered an annual disappointment for not winning the
NBA championship, and every acquisition _ Shaquille O'Neal, Dennis
Rodman, Glen Rice _ raises hopes, fairly or not.
</P>
<P>
   Now they've done it again. The Lakers barely touched the
free-agent pool but still inspired championship predictions with a
single hire _ coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   A realistic expectation? Isn't that always the question?
</P>
<P>
   Here, an attempt at the answers in a brief conversation with
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the Lakers got the best coach $30 million could buy. Are
they really any better than they were in that horrid playoff
collapse?
</P>
<P>
   A. On the premise that it's never too early to burst bubbles,
the simple answer is no. Kobe Bryant, O'Neal and Rice make the
Lakers an automatic playoff team, but the supporting cast is
largely unimproved.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward remains a glaring weakness, and the combination of
Robert Horry and A.C. Green won't make anyone forget the previous
combination of Horry and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if Horry and Rick Fox don't rediscover their shooting
touch soon, the Lakers' bench will again be woefully lacking in
offensive punch.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So hiring a coach with six championship rings means nothing?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, it means the Lakers will pay attention to an
authority figure, which is an instant improvement. And Jackson will
in fact make this team better than the sum of its parts, but it
will take time.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, it took Michael Jordan and Co. months to get
comfortable in Jackson's offensive system, and by Jordan's account,
two years to truly thrive in it. Initially, the Lakers will
struggle no matter how much talent they have. But Jackson's
emphasis on the fundamentals will make O'Neal and Bryant better
team players. They respect his knowledge and are buying into his
team-first philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The egalitarian triangle offense also will allow role players
like Derek Fisher and Ron Harper to make consistent contributions.
But it won't solve their need for rebounding and defense in the
frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Hate to ask, but does that mean they're going to sign the
nutty guy with the tattoos and bad hair again?
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't expect it, largely because the front office is
absolutely opposed to the idea, and even owner Jerry Buss has
admitted misgivings about taking the plunge the first time. For
now, the Lakers will search the league for a saner alternative. But
if the Lakers don't have a solid starter by late January, brace
yourself, because Jackson won't stand pat.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So who are these ``saner'' alternatives?
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends on your definition. Another Jackson favorite,
the offbeat Bison Dele (formerly known as Brian Williams) has
retired from the Detroit Pistons, and is living in Santa Monica,
just close enough for Jackson to indirectly lobby him to return.
But getting Dele would require a trade.
</P>
<P>
   A less-complicated alternative would be to get Orlando veteran
Armon Gilliam. O'Neal is lobbying to acquire old friend Horace
Grant from Seattle (unlikely) or Antonio Davis from Toronto (more
likely).
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is Derek Fisher good enough to start for a championship
contender?
</P>
<P>
   A. Did anyone think Avery Johnson was before last season? Fisher
is an apt comparison, a younger version of the Spurs' point guard.
He's underrated and works his tail off, hustles on defense and
improves each season. He's also grasped Jackson's system well. Yes,
he's capable. In fact, he was the Lakers' most reliable shooter
throughout the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Glen Rice didn't seem too happy last season. Is he here to
stay?
</P>
<P>
   A. That may be up to him. He's a free agent next summer and
wants a huge new contract. If he can adapt to Jackson's offense, he
might earn a deal from the Lakers. But he's struggled so far, and
if he's still struggling in January, expect his name to appear in a
dozen trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Veteran teams like the Jazz, Pacers and Bulls have had the
edge in the playoffs in recent years. Aren't the Lakers too young
and immature?
</P>
<P>
   A. Two seasons ago, perhaps, when Bryant was still a teen-ager
and the core included O'Neal, Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones. But
this is a much different, much older team. Their average age is now
28, and five Lakers have logged at least 10 years in the league.
Bryant's even legal drinking age now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of those veterans, do John Salley, Ron Harper, Green
and Brian Shaw have anything left?
</P>
<P>
   A. In Harper's case, absolutely. His experience with Jackson's
Bulls will be invaluable, and he can start at either guard
position, provided his knees hold up. Salley and Green can add some
wisdom and, they hope, a few rebounds. But don't expect more than
10 to 15 minutes a game from Salley (who retired three years ago)
or more than 30 from Harper and Green. Shaw played just one game
last season but has performed well in his brief time with the
team. &QL;

KOSOVO AID GROUPS FALL SHORT AS WINTER NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUDENCANE, Yugoslavia _ A damp, heavy fog already envelops
Kosovo daily, and with winter just a few weeks away, the United
Nations and myriad humanitarian organizations are failing to meet
the expectations of the hundreds of thousands of homeless
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Although aid agencies have been trying to prepare for winter
since June, when NATO's bombing war ended and Kosovo's Albanians
streamed back into their ruined province from neighboring Albania
and Macedonia, a European Union commission survey says 300,000
people ``face the possibility of winter without adequate
accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanife Gega and her family of 12 are living in a tent in their
garden beside the burnt out shell of their house. The tent is where
they will spend the winter. Despite the United Nations' promises
that every family in Kosovo will have a dry room for the winter,
many families, the Gegas included, will be camping outside.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Gega family is Zejnije, 27, who is expecting a child
any day now. Her husband was killed in the war, and she is left
with two small children and one more on the way. She seems sad and
worried, and wears a constant frown. She will live in the tent,
along with her baby, as soon as she returns from the maternity
hospital, she said. ``We will do with whatever they give us.''
</P>
<P>
   Their house, like many in the village of Studencane, in southern
Kosovo, was burned with such ferocity that aid organizations have
categorized it as fifth class _ irreparable and fit only for
demolition. Relief workers have ruled out rebuilding such houses
this year and are concentrating only on partially damaged ones that
can be fixed quickly. In the meantime, the family has been given a
large green tent made of rubberized canvas, which can ward off only
some of the cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelter is by far our most acute problem in the village,''
said Hamzi Gega, 47, Mrs. Gega's brother. Grabbing folds of the
canvas tent in his hand, he says: ``It's not enough, it's not good
for winter. We get 80 centimeters of snow in this courtyard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter is not going to be easy,'' agreed Peter Kessler,
spokesman for the United Nations' refugee agency in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Studencane, lying among the foothills of Kosovo's southern range
of mountains, is just one of hundreds of villages that were shelled
and then torched by Serbian forces during their year-long rampage
to root out the Kosovo Liberation Army that was fighting Serbian
rule. Some 80 percent of the buildings here were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The upper part of the village is a jumble of burned walls and
rubble, dotted with a patchwork with bright blue United Nations
tarpaulins and white canvas tents among the debris. According to
Gega, of 1,618 houses in the village, only 13 are habitable. Only a
few new roofs have emerged amid the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Some 120,000 houses _ approximately half the homesteads of
Kosovo _ have been damaged in some way, aid organizations estimate.
But the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is
coordinating the relief effort, says it will only be able to repair
50,000 of those houses this winter, and even that task has them at
full stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and the
European Union's humanitarian agency, ECHO, are responsible,
together with the United Nations' refugee agency, for Kosovo's
multimillion dollar shelter program. Each agency has been dogged
with criticism for their short-sightedness and delays, especially
in the local press.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Zociste, just a few miles west of Studencane,
every house seems to have been scorched, including the 14th century
Serbian monastery at the top of the village. Amid such devastation,
villagers expressed frustration at how slow the aid is in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only half the roof tiles I need and no wood,'' said
Malush Shala, a retired postman. ``They keep saying: `In 10 days,
in 10 days.' If I had the money myself, I could finish it in
eight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedije Kabashi, 36, mother of four, did not wait for the aid
organisations. Her father stripped the roof off his house in
another village and used it to build her a new roof, providing her
with at least one dry room for the family of nine. Last week, an
Italian organization brought the materials for a roof for a second
room.
</P>
<P>
   The aid agencies talk of what they are achieving: nearly 30,000
shelter kits have been distributed, some 7,000 all-weather tents
and several hundred prefabricated houses have been brought in.
Kosovo residents have received some 11,000 stoves, and today a
transport plane flew into Pristina, bringing 60 tons of clothing
for women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The housing assistance given so far represents only a sliver of
what the aid organizations set out to do. Less than half of the
emergency roofing kits have gone out to villages, and only 1,500 of
the planned 12,000 kits of heavy duty hosiung materials. The U.N.
refugee agency has distributed only a third of its beams and heavy
plastic. The United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance
has yet to distribute any heavy-duty kits, and is only now bringing
the lumber into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, of the U.N. agency, blamed the sheer logistical
difficulty of bringing so much material into Kosovo, an
impoverished region even before the war and now so destroyed that
everything has to be imported. With Kosovo's main road and rail
links through Serbia and Monetenegro closed, and neighboring
Albania possibly even poorer than Kosovo, everything has had to be
shipped through a single narrow border post from Macedonia.
Competing with NATO military convoys, returning refugees and all
the province's commercial traffic, aid trucks stand backed up for a
mile and can be stuck at customs for up to six days.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency has finally managed to bring in everything it
needs, Kessler said, but is now battling to get goods out of
warehouses and to the villages before mud roads become impassable.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is no longer talking of housing people before the
onset of winter, but ``during the winter months.'' ``There is no
cut off date for this, people will be working on their houses all
winter,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 300,000 homeless are going to have to fend for
themselves. ``We are telling people that relatives are going to
have to support each other, neighbors are going to have to take
people in, as they have done before,'' he said. ``If people do,
everyone will get through the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of villagers have swarmed into the capital
Pristina and other towns, taking over the abandoned homes of Serbs
and Gypsies who have fled the province, or staying with relatives.
Local journalists estimate that the population of Pristina has
swelled to double the pre-war population, and may be as high as
400,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the most vulnerable, the old, young, and sick who cannot
survive the winter in tents, there will be approximately 11,000
places in buildings like sports halls or community centers in main
towns, the U.N. agency says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everyone likes the idea of moving again. Hanife Gega,
who fled to Albania during the war, says she cannot rely on her
neighbors since they all are in tents too. But asked if she would
leave to go to a collective center, she said no. ``The problem is I
cannot turn my back on this place. We have to stay here _ if only
we had the chance to rebuild.''

 &HT;    Gumbel on `Today': Competing with his old pals `doesn't hurt'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As part of an 11-city tour to promote
The Early Show, Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson recently visited CBS
affiliate WPEC-Channel 12. Gumbel addressed, among other things,
his pompous image, competing with Today co-anchor Matt Lauer and
why he came back to morning TV.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have a reputation for being arrogant. Does that bother
you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because everyone writes about it, people think it's a
reality, but it's not a reality. I've been in this business almost
30 years, and life isn't always going to go perfectly, and not
everyone is going to write wonderful things. The only things I can
control are my own performance on the air and the way I conduct
myself with my co-workers and people I report to.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much of your reputation has to do with your color?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nothing that happens in America is absent of color. So I
think it's naive to believe that judgments about me are absent of
that. I'm not baying at the moon, and I'm not crying about it; it's
just a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't it ironic that you're back on morning TV?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is a chance to build something from the ground up. This
is a chance to reverse a legacy of failure. . . . when I started
(on ``Today'') in 1982, there were concerns other correspondents
wouldn't talk to me, or that guests wouldn't come on the show, that
people would leave in droves and affiliates wouldn't take it. To
come from that point to this one is very gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened with ``Public Eye''?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't strong enough to force it to be what I wanted it to
be. I was too easily dissuaded of things as the new kid at the
corporation. I tried to be the good company guy . . . and it just
didn't work out. It was not a show I was very proud of, and, yes,
it was my fault. But having said all of that, the show was very
much numerically in line with what first-year newsmagazines do. It
was also very much in line with what new shows on CBS do. It wasn't
the Ishtar of television.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you learn from the experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's good to be hardheaded when you believe things should be
done a certain way. No man is an island. You can steal a star
quarterback, but if you don't surround him with a good running
game, wide receivers, an offense line, a defense, a coaching staff
and a scouting staff, he ain't going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you chafe at the fact that networks feel the need to build
amusement park-like studios to get people to watch?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I do. But you know what the reality is? If we were
going to start this program tomorrow, and we didn't have one of
those studios, you guys would write that CBS isn't making the
commitment. These studios are environments in which you think you
have the best chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will it be tough competing with your good buddy Matt (Lauer)?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's fine. It's not just my good buddy, Matt. It's my good
buddy (''Today'' executive producer) Jeff Zucker and my good buddy
Al Roker. Competition is fine. It doesn't hurt. In many instances,
it makes you better. We all said we're never going to say anything
personal about the other one, and I never will. They're very dear
friends of mine.

 &HT;    Growth of early morning audience raises stakes in ratings race
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with TV-GUMBEL.)
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We greet them every morning with our first cup of coffee. Katie
and Matt on ``Today''. Charles and Diane on ``Good Morning
America''. We welcome them into our homes like long-lost friends.
But don't let the good cheer, sleek studios and waving tourists
fool you. Beneath the sunny surface and friendly chatter, there's a
high-stakes war for early morning TV dominance.
</P>
<P>
   At risk: millions of advertising dollars and precious morning
television viewers. The competition heats up Monday when ``The
Early Show,'' CBS' morning news program with former ``Today''
co-host Bryant Gumbel and onetime ABC News correspondent Jane
Clayson, elbows its way to the morning news breakfast buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The heated booking wars have already begun. Thorny permit
problems kept ``The Early Show'' from getting Mariah Carey to
perform live in Central Park for Monday's debut. She'll appear on
rival ``Today'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing new. ``CBS This Morning'' has always lagged
dismally behind ``Today'' and GMA. During the week of Sept. 20, for
instance, ``Today'' averaged 5.6 million viewers, GMA 4.3 million
and ``CBS This Morning'' a paltry 2.7 million. ``CBS This Morning''
has lived in the basement primarily because the penny-pinching
network never devoted enough resources to it.
</P>
<P>
   But that's changed. CBS spent $30 million to build a
state-of-the-art indoor/outdoor studio on tony Fifth Avenue, it
tapped former ``Today'' executive producer Steve Friedman to
produce ``The Early Show'' and lured Gumbel back to the early
morning rat race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest investment that CBS has ever made in this
time period,'' says Andrew Heyward, CBS News president. ``And it's
a terrific time to be making a big investment given the morning is
a hotly contested, lively arena with plenty of room for us to do
better than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Early morning is the fastest growing segment on network
television. According to Nielsen Media Research, over the last five
years, the number of homes using television from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
has increased 11 percent. Growth from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. has been
even greater _ up 18 percent over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The networks also make a lot of money in the morning. From 1995
to 1998, revenues for the shows grew 37 percent to a combined $450
million. And for the first half of 1999, ``Today'''s revenues
increased 26 percent to $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Says GMA co-host Charles Gibson: ``It's not all altruism that
has brought the increased attention to morning television. This has
become a significant revenue source.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Gumbel: ``It's not likely someone is going to get up at 6
a.m. to watch a movie on HBO. There's isn't a ballgame on ESPN at 7
a.m. It's one of the few places where a network remains
preeminent.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to CNN, the Internet and the newsmagazine
explosion, viewers now expect to get a steady diet of hard news,
national news, global information, fashion tips and celebrity
gossip before they go to work or school. Since people are also
waking up earlier, the networks have been pressed to devote more
money to their morning shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of instant news anywhere, anytime has made morning
more valuable to the viewing public,'' says Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' upped the ante six years ago when it moved to a
glass-walled, street-level studio in Rockefeller Center. Six months
later, ``Today'' climbed into first place and hasn't looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the once top-rated GMA was struggling. Long-time
anchors Joan Lunden and Gibson left. GMA sank even further after
Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman were hired. Then Gibson returned with
ABC powerhouse Diane Sawyer. Since then, GMA has seen its total
number of viewers increase 29 percent. The show's splashy Times
Square studio is also moving GMA up in the ratings, with viewership
rising from 3.8 million to 4.5 million in a month.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: How long will Gibson and Sawyer play
good solider and stick with GMA?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open-ended thing,'' is all Gibson will say.
</P>
<P>
   Says Shelley Ross, GMA's executive producer: ``Charlie and Diane
aren't here under duress, pain and punishment. I guarantee, there
will be no radical changes. This is our show. This is who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will ``The Early Show'' be?
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see a traditional morning show format packaged into a
glossy, high-tech studio package. Hard news segments combined with
feature pieces, celebrity interviews and consumer-oriented tips
will be the norm. Former MTV VJ Martha Quinn and best-selling
author Lisa Birnbach (''The Official Preppy Handbook'') will offer
parenting tips on a weekly segment, ``Yikes! I've Grown Up.''
Former GMA correspondent Laurie Hibberd will look at what's hot in
pop culture in her twice-a-month report called ``The Hib List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to try and reinvent the wheel,'' says Heyward,
``but we're going to try to add some spokes of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest spoke, of course, is Gumbel. Considered to be one of
the best live interviewers on television, Gumbel helped make
``Today'' a morning show giant during his 15 years as co-host. But
the often smug anchor has many detractors who don't like his cocky
image. And there's a lot of pressure riding on those $5
million-a-year shoulders. The 51-year-old Gumbel, however, says he
doesn't feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how to gauge pressure,'' he said . ``There's
virtually pressure in everything you do, but most of it is
self-inflicted. The external stuff about what's going to happen
with the numbers, that's going to happen, period. We really can't
do anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders expect ``The Early Show'' will enjoy
respectable numbers during the first week as the curiosity factor
remains high. After that, it's anyone's guess how successful the
program will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a restaurant,'' says Thomas DeCabia, an executive
vice president and general manager at Schulman/Advanswers, a New
York media buying company. ``A new one opens up and everyone wants
to try it out. But will they go back to being a loyal patron?
That's how these shows are.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card in this whole war, however, is Clayson. Although
she has covered such high-profile stories as Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign and O.J. Simpson's civil trial, she's a
relative unknown. Her chemistry with Gumbel is key.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward says CBS looked at more than 300 tapes of potential
co-hosts and met with more than 100 hopefuls before hiring Clayson.
She also had ``a zillion and one'' conversations with Gumbel over
the phone. The network even dubbed the search Operation Glass
Slipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget Operation Glass Slipper,'' says Clayson, a 32-year-old
devout Mormon, ``this Cinderella is going to need some running
shoes. And I've got those.''
</P>
<P>
   And CBS has a snazzy studio across the street from Central Park.
Friedman says the network had no choice but to build its own lavish
set. ``It's the price of admission to get into morning
television,'' he says. ``If somebody's in Times Square and
somebody's at Rockefeller Center, you can't do a competitive
morning show on 11th Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The real race to watch will be between long-running GMA and the
upstart ``Early Show''. Friedman believes his show can catch GMA
whenever Sawyer steps down.
</P>
<P>
   GMA's Shelley Ross says she's not concerned _ yet. ``I feel
confident we will thrive and there is room for all of us,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Let the war begin.

 &HT;    Pumpkins get the cannonball test
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Finding folks willing to creatively
dispatch of unwanted pumpkins in the name of good, messy fun is
more difficult than one might think.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, firing one from a cannon like they do at the
World Punkin' Chuckin' Championships in Delaware was out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   We called 10 paving companies from Boca Raton to Fort Pierce
before one in Delray Beach agreed to steamroll our gourd. (And then
Hurricane Irene nixed that one.)
</P>
<P>
   We asked the Palm Beach County sheriff's bomb squad to blow one
up. They were amused, but cited the ``copycat'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   We begged the fire safety class at Indian River Community
College to ignite and extinguish one. It could qualify as a
training exercise for newly graduated firefighters, we bargained.
No dice. ``I wouldn't know how to light one on fire,'' an
instructor said. (Accelerant anyone?)
</P>
<P>
   We even badgered a tree-trimming business into letting us chuck
a punkin' into their tree shredder so we could hear it go SPLORK!
They weren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we abandoned some really bad ideas. Like the
friend-of-a-friend who offered to put it on the tip of a Nike
surface-to-air missile he had purchased on Ebay's Web site _ and
had delivered via UPS. (Apparently, one can own a missile for
``display'' purposes.) We nixed the Nike, reasoning that flattening
Riviera Beach just to vaporize oversized fruit was certainly
crossing the line.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, we found some souls just off their gourd enough to take
the pumpkin challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Punkin' punchin'
</P>
<P>
   Tool of destruction: Right foot, fist of champion kickboxer
Steve Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The 10-pound gourd was no match for the five-time world
champion junior-middleweight kickboxer. About four punches was all
it took to cave in the face of the challenger. Shepherd finished
the job with heel-first stabs with his foot. One nit: Shepherd, who
is retired from the sport at age 49 and now runs his own kickboxing
gym on Military Trail in West Palm Beach, asked that the pumpkin's
face first be weakened with knife punctures. ``Otherwise, I'll
break my ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   Smash rating: 5.5 out of 10. While not easily defeated, a
pumpkin does make a satisfying thud when struck with the human
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Mess rating: 4 out of 10. A pumpkin emits a nasty,
Frito-corn-chip-like odor when kicked apart.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``This went so well, I may come out of retirement,''
Shepherd said.
</P>
<P>
   Punkin' shootin'
</P>
<P>
   Tool of destruction: Double-barrel .687 Baretta shotgun fired by
skeet shooting champion Kent Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Result: With optimistic visions of evaporating gourds, we
pitched bagel-sized pumpkins 20 feet into the air for Taylor to
blast at Palm Beach Trap and Skeet in Wellington. (Don't try this
at home, kids. Taylor's a professional.) We soon discovered pumpkin
skin has a rawhide quality. Even with Taylor's expert aim, the
shotgun spray barely penetrated, giving the pumpkins only an
acne-like abrasion. To remedy this, Taylor took to lobbing his own
pumpkins Bronco Billy-style at closer range while cradling the gun
and then firing double blasts. The result: Fourth of July in
October!
</P>
<P>
   Smash rating: 7.5 out of 10. The pumpkins took a bullet better
than John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   Mess rating: 10 out of 10. Palm Beach Trap and Skeet wisely
anticipated a Mardi Gras-sized mess and put us at the farthest end
of the facility. While not nearly as goopy as a large pumpkin, the
mini-versions obliterated nicely when blasted up close. An
estimated 3 billion militant fire ants residing at the course won't
have to dine on a bare leg for at least three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``Without a doubt, this is the weirdest thing I've ever
shot,'' Taylor said, scratching his salt-and-pepper beard. But did
it qualify as skeet or trap shooting? ``It didn't really qualify as
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Punkin' truckin'
</P>
<P>
   Tool of destruction: The Brahma, the world's largest
street-legal pickup truck. The customized International Harvester
hauler runs close to 32 feet long, seats six comfortably and is
purchased at the Riviera Beach manufacturing garage by everyone
from cattlemen to Arab sheiks. Built by Jere Dixon, a 44-year-old
owner of a medical software company, the truck could haul 6,000
10-pound pumpkins without a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Punkin' pancake. Placing one 15-pound gourd in front of
the dual rear tires, Dixon peeled out. Pumpkin guts flew 30 feet
away. And the tires left a perfect souvenir treadmark on the orange
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Smash rating: 10 out of 10
</P>
<P>
   Mess rating: 9 out of 10. The devastation was total, but
surprisingly tidy. Except for some stray seeds and innards, the
pumpkin folded like a card table.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: ``That was so cool,'' Dixon said. ``Want me to do it
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Punkin' forkin'
</P>
<P>
   Tool of destruction: A mini-forklift used. We first squashed a
5-pound pumpkin with the forks. Then we tried to run over the
remainder with the vehicle's 6-inch-tall wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Result: While not explosive, the results were impressive.
Pumpkins do not take well to the blunt trauma of a shop forklift.
Especially after a dozen downward whacks. The forklift did excel in
running over the pumpkin _ sort of. Its wheels were too small to
hurdle the heap, but they spun on the skin and melted the adjacent
asphalt to create an orange cloud of acrid smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Smash rating: 7 out of 10. The pumpkin's stem acted in its own
defense, becoming a preventive keystone.
</P>
<P>
   Mess rating: 10 out of 10. Where there's smoke, there's doomed
pumpkin.

BOEING UNION SAYS WORKER STRESS NOT FACTOR IN 767 CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The International Association of Machinists Monday
defended Boeing union members work in building two 767-300
airplanes that rolled off the same assembly line and later crashed,
saying overtime stress and a contract dispute didn't create
problems in the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, an EgyptAir jetliner plunged into the
Atlantic Ocean, apparently killing the 217 people on board. The
EgyptAir 767 rolled off Boeing's Everett assembly line in 1989,
right before a Lauda Air 767-300, which crashed eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing crafted the twin-engine airplanes in the weeks just
before a labor dispute with Machinists, who were also complaining
about stress tied to overtime. The two airplanes that crashed were
among the last produced before Machinists struck on Oct. 4, 1989,
for 48 days.
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Bill Johnson said the labor situation simply wasn't
a factor in the quality of the aircraft. Even if there was a flaw
in the workmanship of either airplane, Boeing has enough
safeguards, such as multiple inspections, to catch any fatal flaws
in its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many checks...things can't slip through,''
Johnson, who is president of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 751, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is on a fishing trip right now,'' he said of the
search for clues as to the cause of the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pointed out the Lauda Air crash was tied to a design
flaw _ a thrust reverser fired during the flight sending the 767
into a fatal spiral and killing all 223 people aboard, according to
investigators _ not a manufacturing flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Some local financial experts echoed Johnson's assertion that
line workers weren't likely to shoulder the blame for the EgyptAir
accident. The airplane had been flying for a decade, according to
Bill Whitlow, a portfolio manager at Safeco Asset Management Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a coincidence,'' Whitlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators, led by the National Transportation Safety
Board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have just begun
collecting the remains of the airplane from the waters off
Nantucket. The federal answers to the questions surrounding the
EgyptAir crash may be months or years away.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the government has yet to render its final
verdict on what caused the fatal crash of 1996 TWA Flight 800 over
Long Island. That verdict is expected next year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also stressed that Machinists take great pride in their
work, even when they're fighting with their employer over wages and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that everyone is simply searching for answers in the
wake of the tragedy. But, he warned they shouldn't seize on the
fact that two 767s that were produced consecutively crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plane went down and no one knows why it went down,'' Johnson
said.

GORE, BRADLEY CAMPS SQUABBLE OVER AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Al Gore's campaign calls them dirty political
tricks. Bill Bradley's campaign thinks some in the Gore camp are
getting a trifle ``paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when James E. Sheridan stood in the
auditorium at Dartmouth College last week and asked Vice President
Al Gore what he would do to restore confidence in government after
``the behavior of some members of your administration.'' The Gore
campaign team smelled a rat.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan, a retired Chinese history professor from Northwestern,
also happens to be a volunteer for Bill Bradley's campaign and a
co-sponsor of a Bradley fund-raiser in Manchester Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bradley supporter, Lisa M. Stanley-Lupo of New Durham,
asked the former New Jersey senator about ``the behavior of the '96
Clinton-Gore campaign as it relates to fund-raising.'' And a paid
Bradley campaign staff member, Matt Rodriguez, was sitting in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forums are supposed to be for real voters to ask genuine
questions and learn more about the candidates,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, Gore's New Hampshire spokesman. ``Senator Bradley's
campaign is exploiting these opportunities just to play dirty
political tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Elleithee, Bradley's New Hampshire spokesman, called the Gore
charge ``completely and utterly ridiculous'' and denied any effort
to stack the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are registered New Hampshire voters who want to question
the candidate,'' he said. ``The fact that the vice president's
campaign is resorting to this really petty tactic begs the
question, `What is Al Gore afraid of?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, insisted Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore can handle any question he's asked, that's not the
issue,'' he said. ``The problem is that voters are being
manipulated and the New Hampshire primary is being exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign believes it has uncovered still more
shenanigans. Tuesday night the vice president will hold one of his
``open meetings'' in Derry with undecided voters. Marilyn Hoffman
of Londonderry received an invitation and called the campaign to
say she would attend. The trouble is, Hoffman is a committed
Bradley supporter and another co-sponsor of the senator's Saturday
night fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign disinvited her.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials suspect the Bradley campaign tried to pack the
hall in Hanover in hopes of posing planted questions and to cheer
on their candidate. The Bradley campaign denies all and accuses the
Gore campaign of ``silliness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're very paranoid,'' said Mark Longabaugh, the New
Hampshire director for Bradley. ``I also think it's curious they're
complaining about getting asked questions at a town hall meeting. .
. . Maybe the new Al Gore isn't as new as we thought he was if he
doesn't want to take questions from all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   Elleithee conceded that the campaign told supporters how to
apply for tickets to the event, but said that was the extent of the
campaign's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, in fact, notified CNN and WMUR-TV that
Rodriguez was sitting in the audience. And while CNN asked
Rodriguez if he wanted to pose a question to one of the candidates,
the Bradley campaign instructed him to decline the offer for fear
that they would be accused of trying to skew the event.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hannon, the political director for CNN and executive
producer of the town hall forum, said Monday that his network never
promised the campaigns that the audience would be made up of
uncommitted or undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would have been impossible in such a politicized
environment like New Hampshire,'' Hannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fowler, director of the Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth,
said she identified 115 groups, such as volunteer fire departments,
churches, and employers, and asked them to each submit five names
to be placed in a lottery for tickets. She also ran ads in the
local newspaper for people who wanted to place their own names in
the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 names went into the lottery, Fowler said, and 260
people were chosen to receive tickets. CNN then screened the
people, checking to see which candidate they were leaning towards
and what they would like to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fowler and Hannon said they do not believe it would have
been possible to heavily stack the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Gore people are trying to make an issue of that . . . I
don't think it serves their interests very much because it makes
them look like they're whining,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sheridan said no one told him to attend the town hall
meeting and no one ever told him what to say, either. He said he is
irritated that the vice president described him as a Bradley field
worker on ABC's Sunday morning talk show with Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the Bradley campaign had anything to do with that
question,'' Sheridan insisted Monday. ``I forumulated it myself and
I posed it. . . . I'm nobody's plant and I'm not a plant here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hoffman said she was just hoping to bring her two children,
ages 12 and 15, to meet the vice president and ask him about
federal funding for the arts, a pet cause. She said she did not
tell anyone from the Bradley campaign that she was going to go for
fear she might seem ``disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think of it as infiltrating, I thought of it as being
exposed to the vice president of the United States and a great
privilege,'' she said.

FRIENDS, FAMILIES RECALL PERSONALITIES OF FLIGHT 990 DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One passenger was once kidnapped by Kurdish rebels.
Another couple were missionaries going to visit refugees in the
Sudan. A woman from Chicago was traveling as a birthday present to
herself. She had just turned 80.
</P>
<P>
   And a retired surgeon, who loved ``working cattle'' on his
family's Colorado ranch more than anything else, pushed himself to
go on a two-week Egypt tour because ``he kind of thought his time
was limited,'' his son said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On EgyptAir Flight 990, they were among the 217 people on board,
all now presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping sense, the passenger list, released Monday by the
airline, wasn't that different from the profiles of other New
York-to-Cairo flights. Nearly a third were Egyptian and nearly
two-thirds were American or Canadian tourists, all steeling
themselves for an 11-hour flight over the Atlantic, anticipating
going home, a trip of a lifetime or simply an adventure among
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the airline's manifest tells no stories about the people in
the almost-full flight. That was left to friends and relatives
Monday. They told fascinating stories, everyday stories that
revealed character. They told stories you might hear if you sat
next to the person on the airplane, full of facts, dreams, fears
and hope of what awaited them in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   It's what binds the 217 now, the people they left behind, their
friends and families telling stories about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about my dad was that he liked people. He had a
lot of patience,'' said Kevin McCulloch, 36, whose father, Tom, 72,
was on the flight. Tom McCulloch, a retired surgeon from Durango,
Colo., was traveling with a friend, John Voelker, 70. They had both
signed up for an Elderhostel two-week trip that was to be full of
lectures on ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad would get out on the ranch whenever he could. Even when
he was practicing, he would take off Wednesday afternoons and by 1
p.m. he was out working cattle,'' Kevin McCulloch said. ``My mom
died 10 years ago this month, and my dad had never done any
traveling before that. He kind of thought his time was limited and
he needed to get out and see some of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   From Toronto, Salah Adam, his wife Saline and their two
children, Joshua, 4, and Rebecca, 22 months, were on their way to
Sudan for a wedding, to see family and friends and then to visit
refugee camps. It was only natural for them. They were
missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Rhodes traveled from Chicago. She had turned 80 on July
11, and Egypt was the latest in her long life of travel, which
included visits to China, Russia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and all over
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had some challenges with arthritis, but she had no problem
figuring out how to get around. She had an independent spirit and
was outspoken and opinionated _ just about everything,'' said the
Rev. Leonetta Bugleisi of Beverly Unitarian Church in Chicago. ``I
think Egypt was one of the last wonderful places that she hadn't
gotten to. She had a little anxiety about planning, though. And she
had made some tongue-in-cheek jokes to her friends that she might
not come back from this trip alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Worries about flying, of course, aren't unusual. Harry Kolander,
79, of San Ramon, Calif., worried about his wife, Imilda, 66,
traveling alone. His diabetes made it difficult for him to travel,
and he encouraged her to continue to see the world without him. In
1991, she had visited Turkey and was one of five people held
hostage by Kurdish rebels for three days, escaping with the tour
director by scrambling over a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Imilda Kolander boarded a flight in Los Angeles and met in New
York with a group organized by Grand Circle Travel in Boston. On
the way to the Los Angeles airport, Harry Kolander told the Contra
Costa Times, his wife talked about something bad happening on the
flight. He said she told him, ``If that will happen, I do hope it's
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Also boarding an American Airlines flight in Los Angeles were
four Orange County women who played cards together every Thursday
night for years, the youngest was 57, the oldest 82. Their names
were Judy Bowman, Beverly Grant, Sheila Jaffee and Tobey Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   The four, who joined the EgyptAir flight in New York, had spent
a year of Thursday nights planning an agenda as they played cards,
talking about motoring down the Nile on a cruise ship to Luxor and
Aswan, perhaps riding a camel to the Pyramids outside Cairo and
then heading north to the Sea of Galilee in Israel to walk where
Jesus walked.
</P>
<P>
   In West Point, Miss., Edmund Miller Sr., and his wife Hannah,
both in their 70s, were excited about the same trip _ they, too,
had booked the same tour.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Miller was a retired Navy captain, and he had settled in
the northeastern Mississippi town of 12,000 people because it was
where he grew up. His grandfather was pastor of the First Baptist
Church at the turn of the century, said the current pastor, the
Rev. Gary Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were Christians,'' the minister said. ``They were very
much looking forward to the trip to Israel. They loved this church.
And they were both loved here. Hannah Miller was a very giving
person, concerned particularly for the elderly. She made sure two
people in particular were watched over. I've talked to one of them
and it's very hard, very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Elzanaty will tell you it's hard for all those left
behind now.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his mother and father, Abdu and Fawqia Elzanaty of the
Heliopolis section of Cairo on the flight. All four of the couple's
children now live in the United States, so the parents visit for
two or three months every year. But at the end of each year's trip,
Hisham Elzanaty said, his parents are always eager about getting
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to get them to stay longer,'' said Hisham
Elzanaty, 40, the second oldest child. ``They always like to get
back to their nest in Cairo. But when they are here, they make so
many friends. My father, he's friends to all my friends. He's
worked all his life. He's a contractor for an oil company, and he's
out of the house at 9 in the morning and not home until 9 at night.
That's pretty good for someone 74. He had a big presence in life.''
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss my parents. I'll miss their presence,'' Hisham
Elzanaty said. ``You miss the thing that you lean on, and now it's
sort of like I'm on my own. I have a wife, three children, and
another one due in three weeks, but you always look for your
parents no matter how old you get. You still may think you're a
little kid sometimes, and you want them to lean on.''

`EARLY SHOW' WITH GUMBEL: MORE OF THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Whither Mariah?
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was the big controversy going into the debut of CBS' The
Early Show on Nov. 1, a fact that tells you all you need to know
about the state of network morning ``news'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Carey had been scheduled to belt out a couple of hits for
The Early Show, but when CBS couldn't come through with the
necessary permits in time for an outdoor concert, she took her
platinum pipes to NBC's Today show.
</P>
<P>
   CBS rebounded with a big star in a slightly different
demographic gal axy: Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This blockbuster replaced last week's Big Morning Show Story, in
which Early Show host Bryant Gumbel did or didn't dis his former
Today co-host, Katie Couric. That's fitting. Because all of these
shows, ABC's Good Morning America included, are a little about
what's said and a lot about who's saying it.
</P>
<P>
   You don't pick a morning show based on the stories and entertain
ment they offer. You pick Matt Lauer and Katie over Diane Sawyer
and Charles Gibson, or vice versa. (Actually, in Phoenix, you pick
Good Morning Arizona most of the time.)
</P>
<P>
   And now Gumbel and co-host Jane Clayson are thrown into the
fray, giving CBS its strongest morning-show lineup since people
lived in log cabins and watched television on coal-powered sets, or
so it seems. Can they compete?
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter? is the better ques tion. Does The Early Show
offer anything different, a compelling rea son to change your
morning routine?
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, no. The EgyptAir crash forced Gumbel and
Clayson into a hard-news format at the start _ they couldn't very
well ignore so gigantic a tragedy, so it's impossible to know how
the debut would have kicked off on any other day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, its competitors were covering the same story. And
like its competitors, The Early Show offers a set window for
gawkers to peer into, a jolly weatherman, an outdoor set for the
well-scrubbed talent to min gle with the unwashed, that kind of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But what The Early Show gives us that the other shows don't is
Gum bel. Love him or hate him _ actually, does anyone love him? _
the guy is a fascinating television presence.
</P>
<P>
   His interview with Clinton in the Oval Office, for instance,
found Gumbel in fine form. It's like riding a bicycle for this guy
_ time passes, he hops aboard and he's right back in the race,
peddling furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Just like old times: Gumbel looked over Clinton's head, at the
ceiling or past the president while asking such questions as how
Clinton would summarize, in one sentence, his presidential legacy.
He let the presi dent weasel out of a few questions _ neither
Clinton's answer nor Gum bel's follow-up to the previous query
mentioned the words ``impeach ment'' or ``Monica,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel did ask about the Mideast peace conference Clinton was to
attend, as well as how Clinton reacted to reports that Al Gore and
Clinton's wife, Hillary, might be harmed in their election
campaigns if the president campaigned for them.
</P>
<P>
   But the way he ended the interview was what made this classic
Bryant. He told the president that he under stood he would be
signing papers to finalize buying a new house in New York next
week. Did the president know where the nearest golf course was? No.
Gumbel informed him. And did the president know who was a member?
Uh, Bryant? Ding, ding, ding. Kudos to the chief executive in the
gray suit.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was Gumbel in a nutshell _ the solid information
about buying the house nearly bur ied amid the smarmy, self-serving
boast, all in one segment. The man is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Clayson isn't, particularly. It's ri diculous to talk about
their ``chem istry'' after only one show. Likewise, it would be
unfair to describe news reader Julie Chen as anything other than
competent.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not too early to say the whole gang could use a
little work on their man-on-the-street skills, the morning-show
burlesque routine that Couric and Lauer have developed into low
art. Despite a partial crowd, which included Clayson's parents and
a few guys from Bryant's alma mater, Bates College in Maine, nei
ther seemed comfortable; Gumbel, in particular, looked petrified
that someone might actually touch him.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet no one in that crowd belongs to his country club.
</P>
<P>
   Oops _ had to take a quick timeout to catch Couric's interview
with Stephen King. A quick flip back and I've missed . . . nothing.
Which is the point of how these shows are struc tured, after all.
If you have to go fish a brown sock out of the dryer, you don't
want to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which morning show you choose, believe me, you won't. &QL;

LAKERS PLAYERS SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT TEAM LACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Today's Lakers can't run a patterned offense
because the players don't seem to have any idea what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Phil Jackson was pretty harsh in his assessment of the Los
Angeles Lakers in his 1975 autobiography, ``Maverick.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he known then that 24 years later he'd be in charge of a
Lakers team with even less of a clue, Jackson probably would have
put his pen down and meditated instead of finishing his thought:
``I feel it's a ballplayer's responsibility to learn the plays but
it's also the coach's job to see to it that the plays are in fact
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it, straight from the Maverick's mouth: If the
Lakers don't look a whole lot more organized in March than they did
in October, if they never make it to June despite having two of the
game's marquee players, blame the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   We suppose Jackson could make like Charles Barkley and claim to
have been misquoted in his own memoirs. But then we'd have to play
back for him his words from the June 16 press conference in which
he was formally introduced as the Messiah, uh, Kurt Rambis'
replacement:
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I think the talent is here. The players
on this team right now have the ability to move into that next
step.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Jackson lobbied unsuccessfully for Scottie
Pippen and Shaquille O'Neal showed up at training camp heavier than
ever and Kobe Bryant broke a finger on his right hand and the
Lakers stumbled onto a new variation of Tex Winter's trademark
offense.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Bermuda Triangle and it can make victories
disappear so fast, Jackson has spent the past week bailing out
rising expectations with one hand and sending up S.O.S. flares with
the other to Michael Jordan and Bison Dele and Dennis Rodman, three
men who otherwise wouldn't belong in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flailing around and wasting so much energy, why not
just summon Magic Johnson out of retirement for a third curtain
call? Even at 40, the bulked-up guard would make a better power
forward than most of the names being bandied about. It's hard to
picture Dele right now collecting 14 points and 11 rebounds against
a Swedish basketball league team as Johnson did last week.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Lakers could resurrect the playing career of Rambis,
whose new job, after all, appears to be plugging holes as they
spring up. Last week found him sitting next to broadcaster Chick
Hearn, filling in for analyst Stu Lantz, who was recovering from
minor throat surgery.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be worth the steepest price of admission at Staples Center
to see if Rambis would have O'Neal's back after the way O'Neal
twisted the knife in Rambis' back last season.
</P>
<P>
   But we digress. Poor Jerry West, this is supposed to be his
luxury liner to steer, but he has bosuns Jackson and O'Neal barking
directions over his tense shoulders. If Jackson isn't pining over
Pippen or ruminating about Rodman, O'Neal is lamenting the loss of
released center Benoit Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   We'd rather have seen ``Eight-of-Ten'' than ``Big Ben'' on
O'Neal's sneakers last week. It'd be much better for the Lakers if
O'Neal was concentrating more on the free throws he was missing
than teammates who are gone. For the record, O'Neal used a
finishing flourish to improve his free-throw percentage during the
exhibition season to 37.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson told O'Neal over the summer to shrink his waist,
maybe O'Neal thought he said shrink his free-throw percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Why would O'Neal bother spending so much time dwelling on
personnel decisions that, unlike his free throws or weight, he
can't (or shouldn't be able to) control?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is hard to figure. His actions often contradict his
words.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the first few days of training camp telling people how
unfair it was to guard Glen Rice to be subjected to so many
offseason trade rumors. He spent the last few days of training camp
thinking aloud about how nice it would be to wrest Antonio Davis
from Toronto, which couldn't have been comforting to Rice and
Robert Horry, whose positions on the team these days are not guard
or forward but ``trade bait.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: With peacemakers like O'Neal, who needs
rioters?
</P>
<P>
   Forget Davis, we can do O'Neal one better. How about trading him
to Charlotte for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so that's not going to happen. The truth is, as much as the
Lakers' roster may need tweaking, the Lakers' attitudes need
tweaking more.
</P>
<P>
   Every team has holes. The best teams don't dwell on what they're
missing, they do their best with what they have. The Lakers have
the talent to challenge Portland and San Antonio and Utah for
supremacy in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But do they have the toughness, the tenacity and the
togetherness? We'll find out, starting tonight in Utah.

WITH DREAD, FAMILIES GATHER IN RHODE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Before EgyptAir flight 990 plunged into the waters off
Nantucket, Mass., life for sisters Rania and Suha El Shagie seemed
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   They had both been married the day before and their two
husbands, who were best friends and colleagues in EgyptAir, left
for work on the flight crew aboard the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Their honeymoons lasted one day.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Sherif, 26, a flight attendant, called his wife, Rania,
23, on Sunday from New York just before he boarded the flight.
Their rushed conversation now haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me before he left the hotel there was a long delay. He
said there was something wrong with the plane,'' said Rania with
tears welling in her eyes. ``He was very worried about the flight.
He told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rania and Suha were among the family members of the 62 Egyptian
victims of the aircrash preparing to take a chartered flight to
Rhode Island Tuesday to begin what will probably be a long,
torturous wait to identify the remains of their loved ones and, if
possible, bring them home for burial. The sisters' brown eyes were
reddened with sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And as they sat in a large banquet hall in Cairo International
Airport waiting for the 1:30 a.m. flight, Rania kept going over the
final conversation with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I don't know why I am so worried this time. I
never feel this way,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound flight had been delayed by 90 minutes in Los
Angeles before stopping at John F. Kennedy International Airport in
New York. LA airport officials said a routine inspection resulted
in the discovery of a flat tire, which was repaired. It was unclear
whether that was the problem Sherif was referring to, or if he
meant a more significant problem.
</P>
<P>
   As Rania dissolved into tears once again, her sister Suha, 24,
reached out and touched her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to eat something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An apple with one bite out of it and an unopened Pepsi sat in
front of Rania.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters sat waiting for the flight, reflecting on the
joy they felt when they officially registered their marriages on
the day before their husbands left to work aboard the flight last
week. The registry of marriage is a Muslim custom which precedes
the actual wedding day but legally means the couples were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seemed so perfect,'' said Suha, whose husband, Mohamad
Galal, 26, a flight attendant, is also believed to have been killed
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sisters. Our husbands were best friends. What could be
more perfect?'' she asked, her eyes reddened from hours of crying.
``And then in one minute it is all taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims had all received specially expedited
visas from the US Embassy Monday, and were filled with questions
and a sense of dread at having to come to America to wait for naval
vessels to search the deep, murky waters off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bereaved families gathered in clusters of grief.
They ate almost nothing, but they talked endlessly with each other.
They seemed to be bonding over their tragedy, realizing they were
in the company of perhaps the only people who could understand what
they were going through.
</P>
<P>
   The stories they shared were poignant, filled with the mystery
of fate.
</P>
<P>
   There was EgyptAir co-pilot Adel Anwar who was eager to return
home to prepare for his wedding, which was to take place on Friday.
He swapped shifts with a colleague and took a seat in the cockpit
of Flight 990, his brother Mohamed told reporters who swarmed the
airport here.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the 28 Egytian military officers who had been on
the flight huddled together. The military officers had been in the
United States for various training sessions. The surviving family
members shared the stories of their sons and brothers who are
believed dead in the crash. Although only one body had been
discovered by Monday, none of them seemed to hold out hope for
rescues. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Emad Rahim, 37, lost his younger brother, Amer, 31, who was a
strategic communication expert in the military and had been at a US
military training facility in Los Angeles. He confided to another
man who had also lost a brother that he was nervous about the
EgyptAir flight aboard a Boeing 777.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I am not so easy about flying on EgyptAir,''
he said, the remark sparking a small bit of nervous laughter
between the men.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to ease some tension.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the six executives of an Egyptian oil company
who were aboard the flight also gathered together.
</P>
<P>
   And amid these gatherings you could see people nodding and
listening and sharing conversations. But not everyone took part.
</P>
<P>
   One man sat with his head in his hands, crying. An unopened
Koran was on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Two men, Mohamed Rashad, a Muslim, and Magdy Mekahail, a Coptic
Christian, discovered that they had both lost their mothers-in-law
in the crash. Both of the men, as it turned out, were electrical
engineers. They pooled what little information they had about the
crash, trying to piece together all of the unanswered questions
they have. But mostly they talked about their mothers-in-law and
how much they meant to their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I guess we all need each other,'' said Rashad. ``If
we can't find answers, at least we can find some comfort. Everyone
here has lost so much.''

COMMENTARY: THE PRICE OF HARSHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Immigration and Naturalization Service took Cyrus
Atefi into custody one year ago for deportation to Iran. I wrote
about his case in February, thinking that he would surely be free
soon. But he remains locked up: a testament to the harshness of the
1996 Immigration Act.
</P>
<P>
   Atefi was eight months old when he came to this country from
Iran with his family in 1978. His father had been an official of
Savak, the Shah's intelligence agency, and they were given
political asylum. His uncle stayed behind and was tortured and
executed by the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, after his parents were divorced, Atefi went
wrong. He bought some methamphetamines for himself and four friends
and was convicted in the California courts of possessing the drugs
for sale. He was given a year on work furlough, the lowest possible
sentence, and was released after six months.
</P>
<P>
   He started to put his life back together. But then came a
mischance that could have come out of fiction. His probation order
forbade him to have a cellular telephone _ but he bought one for
his mother and kept the box. The box was found in his apartment,
and he was picked up and charged with violating probation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the California courts did nothing about that; he was
continued on probation. But because his parole officer was on
vacation, he was not released until Oct. 21, 1998. That was 10 days
after the 1996 Immigration Act made it mandatory to detain aliens
whom the INS decides to try to deport.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law calls for deportation of any alien convicted of an
``aggravated felony.'' It defines that term extremely broadly.
Atefi's drug offense, though the California courts treated it
lightly and he served only six months, was an aggravated felony.
</P>
<P>
   When the case came before an immigration judge, he ordered
deportation to Iran deferred because of the likelihood that Atefi
would be t there. The INS accepted that that order, not
appealing. But the judge refused to impose the permanent bar sought
by Atefi's lawyer, withholding of deportation, and he appealed that
to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The issue has not yet been
decided there.
</P>
<P>
   Atefi has been held in an INS detention center in El Centro,
Calif. His mother, who lives in San Diego, drove two hours to visit
him there every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the evening of Oct. 22 he was taken from his cell to
a room where he and 24 other detainees slept on the floor. The next
day he was taken by bus, in chains, to Yuma, Ariz., and from there
by plane to the Yakima County Jail in Washington State. I arranged
for him to telephone me collect from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the INS is running out of room,'' Atefi said. ``But the
convicted criminals here at least have a release date. There's a
23-hour lockdown, and we have nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I telephoned my mother. It was really horrible _ traumatic. At
least in El Centro she could see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with Atefi was strange. He sounds wholly American, which
is not surprising considering that he has lived here all but eight
months of his 22 years. He was restrained, well spoken. The thought
of his being deported, to Iran or anywhere, was odd. His mother,
sister and brother have all become U.S. citizens. He has used his
time in detention to take courses for his high school diploma. His
behavior has been praised.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked INS officials in Washington why Atefi had been
moved to the Yakima County Jail, they responded sympathetically.
They ordered him returned to El Centro Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS has been unbending in the face of appeals to release
him on bond. Its lawyers say they have no discretion to do so under
the 1996 act. His detention will not be reviewed, they say, until
the Board of Immigration Appeals acts on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 immigration law, with its accordion-like definition of
``aggravated felony,'' requires the deportation of people who have
overcome mistakes and are ready to contribute to this country. In
making their detention mandatory it substitutes iron rigidity for
the rule of reason. By such harsh treatment of immigrants we
citizens demean ourselves.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Cowboys have said all season that they don't know how good they
are. They should be more sure now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through two months they have proved they're good enough to beat
the second-worst defense in the league _ but few others.
</P>
<P>
   They are good enough to beat a former Super Bowl contender
without its quarterback. They can beat a one-shot wonder whose
quarterback is rated dead last in the league. And they can beat
that pitiful defense _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   The wins over the Washington Redskins were impressive. The
victories against Atlanta and Arizona don't exactly make the
Cowboys formidable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys haven't beaten anyone else. They failed against
the Philadelphia Eagles. They failed against the New York Giants.
And most recently, they failed against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't our day,'' safety Darren Woodson said after
Sunday's loss in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The victory over the Redskins a week earlier was a face-saver
for Dallas. But the Cowboys have lost three of their last four and
now enter a stretch that includes Minnesota, Green Bay, Miami and
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not play well,'' Cowboys defensive tackle Chad Hennings
said. ``That's a shot at the players, coaches, everybody across the
board. We didn't make the adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be a theme of late. The Cowboys led in each of the
losses. In each instance, the offense came to life only after the
opponent began having success. And in each instance, it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, Giants and Colts outscored the Cowboys in the second
half 51-14.
</P>
<P>
   Also, how about their non-division road record? The Cowboys have
lost eight consecutive times on the road when playing outside the
division. They haven't beaten a non-NFC East team away from Texas
Stadium since a victory in Pittsburgh on Aug. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bothersome,'' Woodson said. ``I don't see why we
shouldn't be able to win some of these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the Cowboys really aren't very good. On
cruise control they swept their division last year, but it was the
worst division in football. And while it's more competitive this
season, it's open to debate whether it's because of the East's
improvement or the parity that seems to have hit the league.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been excuses each time:
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, the Cowboys lost Michael Irvin to a neck injury
early and the offense never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, they were playing one of the top defenses in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   And in Indianapolis, well, Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison and
Edgerrin James didn't play like the league's future superstars.
They played like current ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them credit,'' Woodson said. ``They are a young,
explosive offense. In the second half, they made plays and we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the offense _ which managed only two touchdowns in two
weeks _ that took the heat after losses to the Eagles and Giants.
The defense can hang its head this week.
</P>
<P>
   James, whom the Colts took instead of Ricky Williams with their
first-round pick, managed one of the most productive days of any
running back in franchise history, a record that dates to the
Baltimore days.
</P>
<P>
   James rushed for 113 yards and caught passes for another 92. No
Colts back has achieved 100 in both facets in a single game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back (from a 17-3 deficit) the way we did says a lot
about our team,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   It may say more about the Cowboys. It wasn't long ago that the
Cowboys were the ones bubbling over with confidence even when
trailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the mystique the Dallas Cowboys have, and
they've earned that because they're the team of the '90s,'' Manning
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the time the playoffs roll around, the '90s will
be over.

28 EGYPTIAN MILITARY OFFICERS AMONG FLIGHT 990 VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At least 28 Egyptian military officers, including
three brigadier generals, were among the 217 people aboard EgyptAir
Flight 990, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   The US Embassy in Cairo described the Egyptian officers as
``military trainers.'' Other Clinton administration officials,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said most were pilots who
had just completed training in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign diplomat in Washington, asking not to be identified,
said the Egyptians were almost all ``young officers receiving
training. They were going home on that flight. They had just
completed normal training. It is something that is going on all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, US Consul General Roger Pierce described the training
in similar terms. ``It's very common. Hundreds of Egyptian military
are trained in the United States every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials were careful to avoid any suggestion that the
presence of such a large Egyptian military contigent was connected
in any way to the EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cairo airport, several grieving families described many
of the presumed dead officers as communications workers in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   One officer aboard the flight was identified as Khalid Ibrahim
Saad, 45, who was from a small town about 50 miles outside Cairo.
Saad had been undergoing military training in Los Angeles, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He joined out of love for his country. He died for the state
of Egypt, said his brother, Mustafa Saad, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Nine pilots and engineers also had been in Alabama for two weeks
flying and examining AH-64 ``Apache'' attack helicopters and other
equipment purchased by Egypt from the United States, a US official
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is one of the largest purchasers of military hardware,
buying billions of dollars worth of equipment over the years from
American companies. It also has one of the most extensive joint
training programs with he United States.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen stopped
in Egypt as part of a swing through the Middle East to watch a
joint US-Egyptian war games exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Cohen called his Egyptian counterpart, Defense Minister
Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, to express his condolenses
over the loss of life of the Egyptian officers, the US official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Embassy in Washington declined to comment about the
reports.

LAKERS POSITION-BY-POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
GUARDS: Depth and consistency in the backcourt were understated
weaknesses for the Lakers last season. Neither should be a problem
now. Once Kobe Bryant recovers from a broken hand, he will pair
with either Derek Fisher or Ron Harper to form a solid guard
tandem. In the triangle offense, any two-man combination from among
that trio can play together, and each brings something to the
table: Bryant's athleticism, Harper's triangle experience, Fisher's
all-out hustle and an improving outside shot. All three are good
defenders, and Bryant and Fisher have been among the better
triangle students.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran Brian Shaw will provide some added depth as the first or
second guard off the bench, and rookie Devean George impressed in
the exhibition season. Second-year players Tyronn Lue and Sam
Jacobson might be squeezed out of the picture. &QL; 
FORWARDS: The early returns are discouraging for the Lakers. At
power forward, the best they can hope for is to get a quality
quarter or two per night from some combination of Robert Horry,
A.C. Green, John Salley and Travis Knight, perhaps even Rick Fox.
That won't be good enough, so expect a trade for a legitimate
starter who can rebound and provide interior defense. Small forward
won't be a strength, either, if Glen Rice can't find his way in the
triangle offense. He shot 31.4 percent in the exhibition season and
rarely appeared comfortable. If he can't get untracked, he might be
traded.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Lakers have some depth at small forward,
with former starters Fox and Horry, plus George. &QL; 
CENTERS: Shaquille O'Neal is the most dominant big man in the NBA,
and he'll need every last bicep muscle to survive the season. Coach
Phil Jackson says O'Neal might play 40 minutes a game (it would be
a career-high) in lieu of any capable backups on the roster. Salley
and Knight will provide spot relief, but that will be insufficient
if O'Neal gets in foul trouble or has a flareup of his chronic
abdominal injury. By all appearances, O'Neal is ready for an
MVP-type season. He averaged 23.3 points, 12.5 rebounds and 2.5
blocked shots in the exhibition season. &QL; 
COACH: Jackson's .737 career winning percentage (656-234) is tops
in NBA history, and his six championships give him the locker-room
clout to cure much of what ailed the Lakers. They will not
underachieve under Jackson, or tune him out, but they will struggle
to learn his system. Jackson needs some more triangle-type players
and will scour the league for them over the course of the season.
Once he gets the right combination, and the current group gets
comfortable with the triangle, Jackson's mastery should become
apparent. &QL; 
BENCH: Improved over last season, but still a cause for concern.
Who's the energizing sixth man? Fox? Green? Harper? Fisher? Any of
them could be, but that remains to be seen. Fox and Horry struggled
as reserves last season, and Fisher has been far more productive as
a starter. Who provides rebounding off the bench? Who can anchor a
second unit? Where's the defensive stopper? Jackson's rotation will
be in flux for a while until at least a few of these questions are
answered. &QL;

EGYPTAIR PLANE HAD STATE-OF-THE-ART BLACK BOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AIRCRASH-RDP and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The EgyptAir Boeing 767 that crashed Sunday was
equipped with an unusually sophisticated black box, one that
recorded three times as many categories of data as the standard
required in the United States, Boeing said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Boeing delivered EgyptAir's 767, the United
States mandated that flight data recorders monitor 17 categories of
airplane operation. But EgyptAir ordered one with 55 data
categories, including monitors for fuel flow, autopilot status and
engine fires, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has already reported hearing pings from a flight
recorder, giving National Transportation Safety Board officials
cause for optimism that they can learn a great deal about the crash
without having to haul the whole plane from the water. But an
official of the safety board cautioned, ``We won't know till we
crack it open.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also encouraged because the plane's automatic
radio system, or transponder, continued to respond to radar signals
at least 36 seconds into the sequence of events that doomed the
plane, and if the transponder had power, the boxes may have, too.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, TWA Flight 800, the Boeing 747 that exploded off
the shore of Long Island, N.Y., in 1996, had far more elementary
electronics than the EgyptAir plane. The two black boxes on that
plane, the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder,
quit working within a fraction of a second of the explosion that
destroyed the aircraft. The lack of information from those devices
is one of the factors that has made that investigation so tedious
and long.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president for technical affairs of EgyptAir, Maged
el-Masri, told The Associated Press Monday that the flight data
recorder installed on the downed Boeing 767 could capture 200 to
300 types of data. A Boeing spokesman confirmed that the plane was
delivered with boxes that could record 55 types of data, but he
said he did not know if Egyptair had further updated its data
recorders, as many airlines have done over the years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 17 data categories that were required by the Federal
Aviation Administration when EgyptAir ordered the 767 shows the
position of the ``thrust reversers,'' which are used on the runway
to redirect a plane's exhaust and slow it down. The reversers were
blamed in the crash of a 767 in Thailand in May 1991. The recorder
notes, for each engine, whether the reversers were deployed, stowed
or in between.
</P>
<P>
   The extra data categories added by EgyptAir show, among other
things, fuel flow and various engine functions, throttle positions,
status of the autopilot and navigation systems, hydraulic and oil
pressures and whether engines were vibrating or on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will need the data recorders because of a paucity
of other evidence. In TWA 800, for example, other pilots reported
having seen a fire or explosion. In the EgyptAir crash, James Hall,
the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said
Monday, there had been no pilot reports so far of anything unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers did not know if the ping they heard was from the
flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder, which is
supposed to capture the last 30 minutes of cockpit sound. The
search equipment on hand cannot detect the source, Hall said,
adding that the equipment to locate it probably will not be in
place until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, please,'' he said, ``we are dealing with water 250
feet deep, and recovering and locating small objects like recorders
is a daunting effort.'' He cautioned that the investigation would
be lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy has a good record for finding black boxes, and the
investigators have a good record in using them to determine the
causes of crashes. In February 1996, for example, the Navy
retrieved a flight data recorder from a Boeing 757 from 7,200 feet
of water, after a crash off the Dominican Republic, and the safety
board quickly found evidence of a maintenance problem that probably
caused the crash.

   CAIRO _ Before EgyptAir flight 990 plunged into the waters off
Nantucket, Mass., life for sisters Rania and Suha El Shagie seemed
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   They had both been married the day before and their two
husbands, who were best friends and colleagues in EgyptAir, left
for work on the flight crew aboard the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Their honeymoons lasted one day.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Sherif, 26, a flight attendant, called his wife, Rania,
23, on Sunday from New York just before he boarded the flight.
Their rushed conversation now haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me before he left the hotel there was a long delay. He
said there was something wrong with the plane,'' said Rania with
tears welling in her eyes. ``He was very worried about the flight.
He told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rania and Suha were among the family members of the 62 Egyptian
victims of the aircrash preparing to take a chartered flight to
Rhode Island Tuesday to begin what will probably be a long,
torturous wait to identify the remains of their loved ones and, if
possible, bring them home for burial. The sisters' brown eyes were
reddened with sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And as they sat in a large banquet hall in Cairo International
Airport waiting for the 1:30 a.m. flight, Rania kept going over the
final conversation with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I don't know why I am so worried this time. I
never feel this way,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound flight had been delayed by 90 minutes in Los
Angeles before stopping at John F. Kennedy International Airport in
New York. LA airport officials said a routine inspection resulted
in the discovery of a flat tire, which was repaired. It was unclear
whether that was the problem Sherif was referring to, or if he
meant a more significant problem.
</P>
<P>
   As Rania dissolved into tears once again, her sister Suha, 24,
reached out and touched her arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to eat something,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An apple with one bite out of it and an unopened Pepsi sat in
front of Rania.
</P>
<P>
   The two sisters sat waiting for the flight, reflecting on the
joy they felt when they officially registered their marriages on
the day before their husbands left to work aboard the flight last
week. The registry of marriage is a Muslim custom which precedes
the actual wedding day but legally means the couples were married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seemed so perfect,'' said Suha, whose husband, Mohamad
Galal, 26, a flight attendant, is also believed to have been killed
in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sisters. Our husbands were best friends. What could be
more perfect?'' she asked, her eyes reddened from hours of crying.
``And then in one minute it is all taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims had all received specially expedited
visas from the US Embassy Monday, and were filled with questions
and a sense of dread at having to come to America to wait for naval
vessels to search the deep, murky waters off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bereaved families gathered in clusters of grief.
They ate almost nothing, but they talked endlessly with each other.
They seemed to be bonding over their tragedy, realizing they were
in the company of perhaps the only people who could understand what
they were going through.
</P>
<P>
   The stories they shared were poignant, filled with the mystery
of fate.
</P>
<P>
   There was EgyptAir co-pilot Adel Anwar who was eager to return
home to prepare for his wedding, which was to take place on Friday.
He swapped shifts with a colleague and took a seat in the cockpit
of Flight 990, his brother Mohamed told reporters who swarmed the
airport here.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the 28 Egytian military officers who had been on
the flight huddled together. The military officers had been in the
United States for various training sessions. The surviving family
members shared the stories of their sons and brothers who are
believed dead in the crash. Although only one body had been
discovered by Monday, none of them seemed to hold out hope for
rescues. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Emad Rahim, 37, lost his younger brother, Amer, 31, who was a
strategic communication expert in the military and had been at a US
military training facility in Los Angeles. He confided to another
man who had also lost a brother that he was nervous about the
EgyptAir flight aboard a Boeing 777.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit, I am not so easy about flying on EgyptAir,''
he said, the remark sparking a small bit of nervous laughter
between the men.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to ease some tension.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the six executives of an Egyptian oil company
who were aboard the flight also gathered together.
</P>
<P>
   And amid these gatherings you could see people nodding and
listening and sharing conversations. But not everyone took part.
</P>
<P>
   One man sat with his head in his hands, crying. An unopened
Koran was on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Two men, Mohamed Rashad, a Muslim, and Magdy Mekahail, a Coptic
Christian, discovered that they had both lost their mothers-in-law
in the crash. Both of the men, as it turned out, were electrical
engineers. They pooled what little information they had about the
crash, trying to piece together all of the unanswered questions
they have. But mostly they talked about their mothers-in-law and
how much they meant to their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I guess we all need each other,'' said Rashad. ``If
we can't find answers, at least we can find some comfort. Everyone
here has lost so much.''

GENERAL MOTORS DIRECTOR WHO LED MANAGEMENT SHAKE-UP TO RETIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Skedded earlier as AUTO-SALES)  
(ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ John G. Smale, the director who led a rare management
coup at the General Motors Corp. seven years ago this month, plans
to retire in May, a GM spokesman said Monay.
</P>
<P>
   The man Smale and the GM board installed as chief executive back
then, John F. Smith Jr., is likely to retire at the same time after
seven grueling years at the helm, according to board members and
others close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   While GM's board has not formally decided who would replace
Smith, its current thinking is that the changing of the guard could
be announced as soon as January, but would likely take effect in
May, according to board members and others.
</P>
<P>
   The next leaders of the company will likely come from GM's
current management team. The current thinking is that the board
will split the top job, giving Smith's title of chairman to Harry
J. Pearce, 57, who is vice chairman, and naming as chief executive
officer G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, GM's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith denied that his retirement was imminent. ``I don't have
any plans to retire,'' Smith said in a recent interview. He
nonetheless added that, ``we have a very strong lineup of
leadership executives and feel very comfortable with succession.''
</P>
<P>
   Smale, 72, who refused to comment on succession plans in a
recent interview, strongly suggested the board would not reach
outside the company. ``You can't really build an organization by
hiring everybody else's executives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exits of Smith and Smale would in some ways mark the end of
an era at GM. As part of the shake-up, Smale served as GM's
chairman from November 1992 to January 1996, when he handed the
mantle to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They have brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy
in the early 1990s, turning massive losses to record profits as the
economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Smale, Smith and their team have taken the company
apart and put it back together again. GM used to comprise seven
bureaucratic fiefdoms _ Chevrolet, Pontiac, Saturn, Oldsmobile,
GMC, Buick, Cadillac _ each operating almost independently but
sending profits into headquarters. GM now makes central decisions
about how to run seven similar businesses. It takes better
advantage of the economies of scale involved, both in North America
and in operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM has turned around,'' Smale said.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto industry experts give GM credit for the changes so far
but say that fixing the company is taking too long. ``In some ways,
they are getting it right, and I believe that they are slowly but
surely making real progress,'' said Robert A. Lutz, retired
president and vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. ``It is
grindingly slow.''
</P>
<P>
   For industry executives and experts who have watched in
wonderment as GM has failed to regain a shadow of its heyday in the
1960s when it sold more than half the vehicles in America, the
leadership change cannot come soon enough. Many believe the company
needs to bring in an outsider to shake things up and instill a
sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need some fresh blood,'' said Gerald P. Hirshberg,
Nissan's president of North American design who began his career at
GM.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs ``an outspoken, even controversial leader,''
said Gerald C. Meyers, the former chairman and chief executive of
the American Motors Corporation and a professor of organizational
behavior at the University of Michigan. He is critical of GM's
inability so far to build head-turning cars and trucks. ``Seven
years in the chair is long enough _ that is two product cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 61, has the strong support of his management team and the
board that elevated him to the top job. ``Jack is a great CEO,''
said Pearce, who refused to discuss succession. ``In the history of
GM, he will go down as one of the great chairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pearce would normally be next in line for both the
chairman and chief executive jobs, the succession became more
complicated when he was stricken with leukemia. He had a
bone-marrow transplant in September 1998. The board has been
delaying its formal decisions until it is clear whether Pearce is
well enough to take on the top jobs, and Smith has agreed to stay
until the board reaches a conclusion about Pearce's health, said a
person familiar with top-level discussions at the company.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case, GM's direction is unlikely to change because
its next leader will be someone who has been running the plays set
by Smale and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, viewed in the industry as a charismatic leader, began
working for the company as a product litigation lawyer at a North
Dakota law firm and rose to vice-chairman. Many outsiders view him
as the best GM has. ``It is a disaster that he has come up sick,''
said Meyers, the former AMC leader.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after his transplant, Pearce was given a clean
bill of health by his doctors, GM spokesmen said, and while he must
take temporary precautions while his immune system recovers _ like
avoiding large crowds _ he is back to a full-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner is regarded as a details-oriented young manager whose
claim to fame is turning around GM's Brazil operations then serving
as Smith's chief financial officer in the bleak, stop-the-bleeding
years of the early 1990's. While most who encounter Wagoner concur
he is extremely bright, some outsiders believe he is too green for
the top job.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the situation is reminiscent of the last time GM's
management turned over. The man Smale deposed, Roger Stempel, was
criticized for his go-slow approach to fixing the company's
problems and for a board that appeared to rubber-stamp management's
plans. To outsiders, the difference now is that after an
unprecedented economic expansion, GM is making money hand over
fist, and that a board member is coaching some of management's big
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Smale, the retired chairman and chief executive of Procter &AMP;
Gamble, has been the board's strong, steady voice for years. Unlike
any other G.M. director, he sits on all seven board committees, and
he is the chairman of the board's executive committee. Several
times a week, he is in contact with Smith, Pearce, Wagoner and
Ronald L. Zarrella, president of GM's North American operations and
marketing chief. And he keeps in touch with lower-level executives
too _ in a recent interview in his office at Procter &AMP; Gamble's
headquarters in Cincinnati, he ticked off a list of five of GM's
division leaders he had recently met with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smale runs this place,'' said one GM executive with some
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Smale is behind some of GM's biggest changes. Several
years ago, he pushed for the auto company to adopt the brand
management marketing techniques common to companies like Procter &AMP;
Gamble that sell cheaper consumer goods. GM has since hired a
number of midlevel marketers experienced in hawking soft drinks,
diapers, and snack food who have had mixed success selling cars.
</P>
<P>
   And this year's reorganization of the system GM uses to get its
cars from factories to dealers is something that paid off for
Smale's company. The change has not gone smoothly _ dealers have
complained all year that GM can't get them cars their customers
want fast enough as a result of the organizational shuffle _ but
Wall Street analysts are convinced it will eventually prove to be a
smart move. So is Smale. ``We did this at Procter 10 or 11 years
ago,'' he said. ``It simply takes time.''

PAYTON LEFT US WITH GREAT MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DOUG SPOON 
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN's way of paying tribute to the century's greatest athletes
is to roll the videotape and provide some mood music.
</P>
<P>
   Real life isn't like that, of course. Our sports heroes aren't
frozen in time, forever replaying their finest moments.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, athletes win and lose, succeed and fail, prove
themselves mortal and only sometimes seem bigger than the games
they play.
</P>
<P>
   And then they die.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Walter Payton was the one who left us. The former
Chicago Bears running back, the NFL's all-time rushing leader, died
at age 45, after a nine-month wait for a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   His death was premature, unfair and only the latest in a long
line of sports figures -- from the young and promising to the old
and prominent -- who have passed away this year.
</P>
<P>
   It started with the death of Joe DiMaggio, whose passing in
March was long anticipated and much dreaded. DiMaggio's obituary
had been prepared for months; one television network reported his
death weeks before it actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   All that took none of the pain away. To a generation of baseball
fans yearning for the innocence of a bygone era, Joltin' Joe took a
little bit of us with him.
</P>
<P>
   Similar feelings were expressed last month when basketball great
Wilt Chamberlain died. Although his position among the game's
all-time greats will be debated forever, Wilt represented a
dominance and dedication many admired and find missing among
today's athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, neither DiMaggio nor Chamberlain was handed the tragic fate
of golfer Payne Stewart, who died in a private plane crash last
week. If there is anything in sports more sad than the death of a
legend, it is the passing of one who wasn't allowed the opportunity
to become one.
</P>
<P>
   Golfer Gene Sarazen's passing came last spring. Former Dodger
shortstop Pee Wee Reese, who lived a long, colorful life, passed on
this fall. Former Athletics and Yankees pitcher Jim ``Catfish''
Hunter suffered greatly before dying of the disease named for
another Yankees standout, Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago this summer, Gehrig stood before a sellout crowd
at Yankee Stadium and called himself ``the luckiest man on the face
of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig, well aware he was dying of a rare disease, had an
admirable perspective on his situation. At least he was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   For Stewart and several others who died tragically in accidents
this year, death came without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Diemert, a young man trying to make a name for himself in
auto racing, died in a crash during a practice run on opening night
at Irwindale Speedway. J.C. Gonzalez, a promising young jockey,
died after falling from his mount on the first day of horse racing
at the Los Angeles County Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Cowherd become Irwindale Speedway's second fatality in a
crash in September. Greg Moore, 24, was killed in a crash during
the Marlboro 500 in Fontana on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And now, we have lost a football player whose amazing
combination of grace, strength and endurance will be remembered
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Payton truly was a good guy, a man with honest intentions and
the dedication and ability to carry out his mission. In a 13-year
career, he rushed for 16,726 yards and led the Bears to a Super
Bowl victory in 1985. He avoided tacklers and churned out yardage
in ways many have displayed for short periods of time, but never
with his degree of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Payton appeared publicly last February to announce his
illness, he was quiet and frail, a man staring death in the face
unless a liver donor was found.
</P>
<P>
   That liver never came. In the meantime, Payton developed the
form of cancer that would eventually lead to his death. We
should've been prepared, but we chose to think of brighter days and
to hope.
</P>
<P>
   With Payton, as has happened so often in 1999, we are left with
the memories of a public figure who inspired us.
</P>
<P>
   Those they can never take away from us.

COUNTDOWN IN NORWAY: 100 DAYS TO END A 100-YEAR-OLD CONFLICT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ In the birthplace of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace effort, President Clinton presided Monday over a kind of
multinational homage to the original dream of a permanent peace as
both sides prepared for the thorny final round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian leaders, with sideline cheers from the
Norwegians, recommitted themselves to forging a framework agreement
by February. In a series of two-way meetings, with each other and
separately with Clinton, they began designing an approach to carry
forward at a quickened pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although a recent lull in the negotiations had concerned both
the Americans and the Palestinians, Clinton, in the first day of a
two-day summit meeting, said it was hardly time for hand-wringing.
Rather, he and the other leaders referred to this as a critical
juncture when both sides share a resolve to end a 100-year-old
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the 100 years, Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime
minister, called the next 100 days a fateful period that could set
the stage for a resolution of a seemingly inexorable battle. Toward
midnight, he headed into a private meeting with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader _ a couple of night owls from the Middle East in
a hotel suite by the fjords.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, looking unusually hale and hearty, Arafat said
he welcomed Barak to be his ``partner in the making of peace, of a
peace of the brave.'' Arafat, 70, was echoing his term of affection
for Yitzhak Rabin, the slain Israeli prime minister whom he
repeatedly refers to as ``my late partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Rabin, who was assassinated on Nov. 4 four years
ago, hovers over this reunion in Oslo, with his widow, his
daughter, his two drivers, his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and
his protege _ Barak _ all present. A memorial service on Tuesday is
meant to serve as the emotional centerpiece of this diplomatic
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and the Palestinians did not devote any time to the
substance of the charged issues that will shape a future
Palestinian state and Israel's relation to it. Official two-way
talks between Israeli and Palestinian teams begin next week in the
Middle East. The members of the Israeli team were named Monday,
nearly two months after the Palestinian group was established.
</P>
<P>
   But in his meeting with Clinton, Barak revealed a part of his
negotiating strategy for the first time. He said he has divided the
issues _ from the division of water resources to future borders _
into three categories: non-negotiable; vital to Israel and worth
fighting hard for, and merely important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave Clinton an idea of what are the red lines that cannot
be crossed, and what are the gray lines,'' a senior Israeli
official said. The official would not divulge which issues fell
into which categories.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Melchior, an Israeli cabinet minister, said Barak
has made it clear to him that ``if we really have an overall deal,
he is willing to give deep compromises.'' He said that meant that
if serious issues like Jerusalem were resolved in a way that the
Israelis found favorable, they could do more on territory.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said Clinton's meeting with both
leaders focused on practical ways to ``get down to business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the leaders were discussing, with each other and through
Clinton, whether to deal with all the issues at once or one at a
time, and whether to have single-issue committees. He also said
they would try to figure out their own relationship to the
negotiating teams given that both leaders understand that they will
ultimately make the tough calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time for us to be focused on the substance,''
the American official said. ``It's a time for us to be focused on
structure, process and organization so that you have a reasonable
chance to get what they have established for themselves _ a
framework agreement on all the permanent-status issues by Feb.
13.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with the Norwegian prime minister, Kjell
Magne Bondevik, Arafat said he considered the fate of Jerusalem and
of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank to be the most crucial
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to state that holy Jerusalem will be the capital
of the Palestinian state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM STARTS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his trademark fatigues and keffiyeh head scarf,
Arafat waved and smiled to the Norwegian crowds that had awaited
his arrival and clapped politely in greeting. He appeared in better
health, more focused and cheerier than he has in some time, with a
notably reduced tremor in his lip. Although he always speaks
publicly in Arabic, Monday he corrected his interpreter, Saeb
Erekat, the senior Palestinian negotiator, and for the first time
in a long time, he broke into English himself.
</P>
<P>
   After Erekat said that the Palestinian leader had called for all
agreements to be implemented as ``accurately and precisely as
signed,'' Arafat raised his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accurately and honestly,'' Arafat said, smiling largely.
``That is what I said in the original Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would complain to Clinton about Israel's continued
building at settlements in the West Bank, Arafat added that
``Norway, the European Union, the United States and all the nations
of the earth consider settlement activity to be destructive to the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is perceived as both a friend of Israel and the first
American president to fully embrace the Palestinians, giving him
unusual sway over the peace effort, whether he is a midwife or a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance here Monday as the first American president to
pay an official visit to Norway, he said it was premature to
discuss a possible summit meeting at Camp David early next year.
But he added, ``There is nothing I would not do if I thought it
would genuinely help build a lasting peace in the Middle East.''
</P>

<P>
   For the Israeli and Palestinian peace teams, this city, with its
moody skies and damp streets, evokes vivid memories of their
breakthrough negotiations in 1993 and their return to collect the
Nobel Peace Prize the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The waste of three years was a catastrophe, but we are back
here,'' said Uri Savir, a key negotiator and now an Israeli
legislator, who took some of the famous secret walks in the
Norwegian woods that paved the way to the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   Savir said he believed strongly that if a deal were not struck
with the current Palestinian leaders, an opportunity would be lost.
Future Palestinian leaders, who grew up under the Israeli
occupation, would prove to be more hard-line, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   At the Grand Hotel in the center of town, a kind of peace
reunion took place as some of the original players reconvened and
reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   Melchior, a Danish-born Israeli who took a leave as the chief
rabbi of Norway when he joined Barak's cabinet, gave daylong
television interviews Monday in fluent Norwegian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the old Oslo feeling here today,'' said Melchior, who
leads a dovish Orthodox movement called Meimad.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the Munch Museum, Barak's wife, Nava, who
rarely speaks publicly in Israel, lamented the fact that Rabin's
assassination still made Israel fearful. She referred to the secret
service's decision that her husband would not be allowed to speak
at a memorial service in Israel because there was not sufficient
time to plan proper security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great shame that four years after the murder, someone
can't get up in public and give a speech without being worried
about his well-being,'' she said. ``It's not even worry about
terrorists from outside, God forbid, but about forces from
within.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Coast Guard abandoned the search for survivors of
EgyptAir Flight 990 in waters off Nantucket Island, Mass., on
Monday, but recovered a large piece of the plane and detected
submerged pinging signals, apparently from one of the black boxes,
whose retrieval could explain the jetliner's mysterious plunge into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of what was expected to be a sprawling,
complex inquiry lasting months or years, investigators analyzed
radar tracks of the doomed plane, questioned potential witnesses,
attended to organizational tasks, set up headquarters in Rhode
Island and even pursued a lead in a Los Angeles hotel where the
crew had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The large questions _ whether acts of sabotage, mechanical
failure or human error lay behind the disaster _ remained
unanswered. But the recovery of some wreckage and the chance that
the flight-data and cockpit voice recorders might soon be found
appeared to represent significant early progress.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aspects of the early investigation, numerous facts
begged for interpretation and elaboration _ the meaning of the
radar tracks, for example, and the size and significance of the
wreckage found _ but no immediate conclusions were forthcoming from
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dedicated to finding the cause of this tragedy,'' James
Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said at a news briefing in Newport, R.I. ``Factual information may
not be developed as quickly as the press may like,'' he said, but
he added that the American and Egyptian people would be kept
abreast of all the relevant facts.
</P>
<P>
   In an inquiry that will undoubtedly produce many leads, an
intriguing one surfaced Monday. A law-enforcement official said the
FBI was checking a report that an EgyptAir 990 crew member had
complained to the management of a hotel where the crew stayed that
a briefcase had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   Agents took a bomb-sniffing dog to the room where the crew
member stayed, and it reacted to a bag of sugar near a coffee
maker. The sugar and some loose wires found in the room were sent
to FBI labs in Washington for analysis. At the moment,
investigators do not believe that there was ever a bomb or bomb
materials in the room. They said they were not attaching much
significance to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials reiterated on Monday that they had
no evidence of terrorism in the EgyptAir case. A review of the
plane's cargo manifest suggested nothing out of the ordinary: it
listed computer and dental equipment, aircraft spare parts for
EgyptAir, and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which was taking a clearly subordinate role to the
safety board, assigned more than 600 agents to the inquiry, many
from its New York, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J., field offices.
Hundreds of additional state and local law-enforcement officials
were involved, as well as others from the Defense Department, the
Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While a review of recent intelligence data collected by national
security agencies and eavesdropping techniques had unearthed
nothing yet to suggest any criminal threat against the plane, one
senior official noted that more than 30 Egyptian military officers
had been on the flight, along with some diplomats, and that their
presence might have increased the risk of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of investigators involved was suggestive. ``We
wouldn't be doing this if it was abundantly clear that it was an
accident,'' the senior official said. But he added, ``We don't
really know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the investigators had already interviewed baggage
handlers, caterers, mechanics, ground crews, drivers of fuel
trucks, customer-service workers and others who had come in contact
with the plane and its occupants in recent days. ``Everyone seems
to have checked out and everyone cooperated,'' said Robert Kelly,
director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Monday was devoted to getting organized, an effort that
centered on Quonset Point, R.I. A morgue was set up for the remains
of the victims, and a hangar was selected to house the wreckage of
the plane, which may be pieced together in months ahead. And
accommodation was being arranged in a motel for families of the
victims, some of whom were flown in from New York on Monday. Other
relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo, Egypt, in
flights on Tuesday and Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation developed, the Coast Guard shifted the
focus of its search from finding victims to recovering their
remains, along with their effects and the remnants of their
shattered aircraft. It was a day of wrenching emotions for the
families of the 217 people who went down with the plane early
Sunday, for it meant the abandonment of hope that they could still
be alive.
</P>
<P>
   With life expectancy in the chilly 58-degree Atlantic limited to
five or six hours, officials directing search operations
acknowledged Monday afternoon what had been fairly obvious for a
day _ that there was no longer any hope for the victims, 199
passengers and 18 employees of EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe at this point it is in everyone's interests to no
longer expect that we will find survivors in this case,'' Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee said at a news conference in Newport 35 hours
after the aircraft went down. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with
these victims and their families. It is now a search-and-recovery
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee noted that only one body had been recovered on Sunday
and that by Monday only the partial remains of other victims had
been found in what he termed a saturation sea-and-air search of a
36-square-mile area around what is believed to be the aircraft's
splashdown point, about 52 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir 990, a twin-engine Boeing 767 that had come in from Los
Angeles, took off from Kennedy International Airport at 1:19 a.m.
Sunday for what was to be an 11-hour nonstop flight to Cairo. It
was cruising at 33,000 feet in a clear night sky 31 minutes later
when, without warning or signal of distress from the cockpit, it
went into a two-minute plunge and crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing search, involving a half-dozen Coast Guard cutters
and a dozen planes and helicopters, found an abundance of debris
from the plane, Larrabee said. He cited seats, seat cushions, a
wheel, clothing, personal papers, two partly inflated life rafts
and two emergency chutes. None showed evidence of scorching,
suggesting that there had been no fiery explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the searchers on Monday had also recovered ``a
significant piece of the aircraft floating on the surface.'' He did
not specify its size, but called it ``a large piece of the aircraft
structure,'' so large that it had to be hoisted by a crane onto the
deck of the Coast Guard cutter Juniper.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Larrabee nor Hall would characterize the significance of
the object. But it seemed to confirm that the aircraft had come
apart, either in the air or upon impact with the ocean.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The admiral also announced that searchers had detected a pinger
signal, apparently from the plane's flight data recorder or the
cockpit voice recorder. The vessels currently involved in the
search were not equipped to pinpoint the signal's location,
presumably on the ocean floor, but Navy ships arriving overnight
would have such equipment, he said, raising hope that one of the
black boxes might be recovered in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a 24-hour machine capable of holding
all the airplane's technical data, from speed and direction to
orientation, rate of fuel consumption and the exact positions of
all rudders, ailerons and other moving parts. The cockpit voice
recorder, fed by three microphones, has a 30-minute tape, and could
reveal what was said by the pilots throughout most of the flight,
especially in the crucial last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crash of EgyptAir 990 was in some ways reminiscent of
that of Trans World Airlines 800 in July 1996 _ both fell into the
Atlantic shortly after leaving Kennedy Airport _ there were also
major differences. TWA 800 blew up in midair, while there is as yet
no evidence of any explosion aboard the Egyptian plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, officials said Monday, the recovery operations for EgyptAir
990 are going to be substantially different. The plane's watery
grave off Nantucket is 250 to 270 feet deep, twice the depth of the
water off the south Shore of Long Island, where TWA 800 went down.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover the water off Nantucket is much colder now than the
summertime waters where the TWA wreckage was raised. And the TWA
recovery site was close to shore, while the EgyptAir site is over
50 miles offshore, compounding the difficulties of diving,
recovering parts of the plane and transporting them to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the advancing season of autumn. Larrabee
noted Monday that rain and high winds were expected to buffet the
search area Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Navy's Norfolk-based ship USS Grapple was
expected to arrive Tuesday with a remotely operated submersile
vehicle that would be used to locate debris underwater. In
addition, the navy ship USS Mohawk, from Philadelphia, was
expected. It has sonar equipment that would enable the Navy to
create a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor and objects
resting on it.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the Egyptian aircraft is believed to be resting
on the bottom near the site of several shipwrecks including the
luxury liner Andrea Doria, which sank in July 1956, after colliding
with the Swedish ship Stockholm. The sea floor in the area is
believed to be relatively smooth, so objects would be more readily
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty relatives and friends of the crash victims arrived in
Newport on a chartered flight from New York on Monday afternoon and
were met by two buses that took them to the Newport Islander
Doubletree Hotel, a secluded place on a small island off Newport.
They did not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But George Arian, the publisher of a small Arabic newspaper in
New Jersey who said he was acting as an unofficial spokesman for
the group, said, ``Everyone was weeping and crying on the plane,
and the Red Cross people talked to them.'' He said about 100
relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo and would
also be put up at the hotel.

ANDERSEN CONSULTING'S CHIEF MAKES E-COMMERCE NEW GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andersen Consulting announced Monday that Joe W.
Forehand, a high-ranking partner with 27 years of experience at the
firm, would be its new chief executive. Forehand said in an
interview that he planned to make e-commerce the central part of
the consulting firm and that the company intended to take stakes in
clients more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Forehand, a native of Alabama who lives in Texas, most recently
led the firm's communications and high-technology practice, which
accounts for about 25 percent of the company's revenue. He replaces
George T. Shaheen _ who left in September to run Webvan Group, an
Internet grocery delivery company _ as the head of the $9 billion
firm that employs 65,000 people in 48 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Forehand takes over at a crucial time for
Andersen, the world's largest consulting firm. Its 1999 growth rate
will fall below 20 percent for the first time since 1994 as its
strength of installing back-office systems has become less
lucrative and it has been embroiled in a nasty breakup with its
former parent, Arthur Andersen. After bringing in $8.3 billion in
revenue last year, Andersen Consulting will report a growth rate in
the mid-teens for 1999, Forehand said.
</P>
<P>
   Following in the footsteps of the dynamic Shaheen, the new chief
executive is little known outside of Andersen, where he has spent
his entire career, and one analyst said the appointment was a
surprise, though strategically sensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andersen doesn't really need a dynamic, colorful leader
anymore,'' said Tim Bourgeois, the vice president of research at
Kennedy Information, a New Hampshire research firm that tracks
consulting. ``It makes sense to have a kinder, gentler person'' as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Forehand said he envisioned an Andersen that has a consulting
practice at its core but increasingly invests in Internet ventures
that would then be aligned with the firm. It would also use its
consultants' ideas to start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, he said, should ``become a part of the fabric of this
new economy, not just watch it happen.'' Currently, 14,000 of
Andersen's consultants are taking internal classes to improve their
understanding of e-commerce, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The firm already holds about a dozen stakes, typically worth $2
million to $3 million each, in start-ups for which it has done
work, said Forehand, who  in engineering at Auburn
University. Forehand said he would aggressively expand such
projects, particularly in business-to-business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Owning parts of other companies raises potential
conflict-of-interest problems for consulting firms, which have long
worked for more than one client in an industry. Clients could be
reluctant to hire a firm that owns parts of a rival.
</P>
<P>
   Forehand said he was confident that Andersen would be able to
resolve such issues.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would not alter the firm's confrontational
strategy of seeking a divorce from Arthur Andersen, from which it
tried to break off almost two years ago. Andersen Consulting became
a separate unit of Arthur Andersen in 1989, and the two have spent
much of the 1990s arguing over how to co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   The firms began an arbitration hearing on Oct. 25 in New York.
It will wrap up at the end of next week, Forehand said, and he
expects a ruling early in 2000 on the future structure of the
firms.
</P>
<P>
   That could end a process that has kept some of Andersen's top
partners busy with internal business rather than on
revenue-producing work. ``It has been a distraction for them,''
said C. Scott Hartz, the managing partner for global consulting at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, a rival firm.

U.S. GIVES ITS BACKING, AND CASH, TO ANTI-HUSSEIN GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration made clear Mon that its support for
Iraqi dissidents would be channeled through the Iraqi National
Congress, a diverse and shaky coalition of Iraqi opposition groups
that have so far shown little in common beyond their hostility to
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, underscored the support in a speech ending a conference
held by the Iraqi National Congress in New York, which was paid for
by the United States and attended by more than 300 Iraqi
dissidents, a few of whom came from inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering's remarks left little doubt that the Iraqi National
Congress is the primary beneficiary of the $97 million that the
U.S. Congress authorized in goods and services last year to help
the Iraqi opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that international support for and solidarity with
the Iraqi people are urgently needed,'' Pickering said. ``It is
high time now to join free Iraqis through the Iraqi National
Congress in preparing'' for a transition to democratic rule in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering promised that the United States would organize an
international effort to rebuild a democratic Iraq once Hussein was
overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know and you know that skepticism abounds about your
ability to maintain a unified front, and to act effectively as a
political grouping,'' Pickering said. ``It will demand great effort
and energy from you and from us to prove those skeptics wrong, and
to mobilize strong worldwide support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi National Congress held its last conference in 1992 in
Salahudeen in northern Iraq. In 1996, its fighters in the region
were decimated by Iraqi forces who came to the aid of one Kurdish
faction, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, against its rival, the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Both Kurdish factions attended the
latest meeting and are represented in the congress' new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Covert aid to the congress by the Central Intelligence Agency in
the past put off some other dissident groups. The Supreme Council
for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, an anti-Hussein group that has ties
to Iran, declined to send anyone to the New York meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics have said that the congress looks too fractious
and disorganized to threaten Hussein's iron-fisted rule. But one
Iraqi at the conference said that the United States made clear that
it would not help any faction that did not cooperate with other
factions.
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of the United States, which in the 1991 Gulf War
led a military coalition to evict Hussein's forces from Kuwait,
creates a problem for the Iraqi National Congress, said Clovis
Maksoud, a former Arab League ambassador to the United Nations who
directs the Center for the Global South at American University in
Washington. The congress' credibility as the legitimate Iraqi
opposition to Hussein, he said, was undermined by the American role
in bringing the opposition groups together. ``It renders opposition
in that context easy to be dismissed as unpatriotic,'' Maksoud
said.
</P>
<P>
   To bridge the ideological and ethnic diversity in its ranks, the
Iraqi National Congress introduced a potentially unwieldy seven-man
leadership Monday. It also chose a 65-member council that Salah
Shaikhly, a congress spokesman, described as ``representative of
all the different groups within the Iraqi opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The membership includes former Baath Party officials and former
army officers, monarchists, Shiite Islamists, Assyrian Christians,
Kurds, members of Iraq's small Turkmen minority and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have left the door open for all the groups,'' said Hoshyar
Zibari, a co-leader from the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Another new co-leader, Sharif Ali Bin al Hussein, who heads the
Constitutional Monarchy Movement, said that many people expected
the conference to collapse, but were proven wrong. ``The opposition
is a work in progress,'' he said. ``This is one step among many.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Iraqi dissidents criticized Washington for so far offering
computers, fax machines and office supplies instead of military
hardware. The coalition will not get actual cash until it
incorporates itself as a legal entity and has a transparent
bookkeeping system, a state department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Chalabi, a veteran leader of the congress, said it was not
ready yet for weapons. ``We do not want to get a bunch of guns and
go blazing into the sunshine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chalabi acknowledged that the Iraqi opposition felt let down by
the United States in 1991 and 1996, when its battles against
government forces failed to get American military support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both have learned a lot since 1991,'' Chalabi said.

UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT WINS SPOT IN NOV. 14 RUNOFF  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM WARNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ Leonid Kuchma overcame his own lackluster record
as leader of Ukraine for the past five years to win a commanding
first place in a preliminary round of presidential elections on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to nearly complete but unofficial results issued
Monday evening, Kuchma finished well out in front of the 12 other
candidates with 36.5 percent of the votes. He now faces a runoff on
Nov. 14 against the leader of the Communist Party, Petro Symonenko,
who placed second with 22.2 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   International election observers said that some of the campaign
methods used by Kuchma and his supporters were unfair and even
illegal, but that they were generally pleased about the voting
process and said the count seemed to reflect how Ukrainians cast
their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts said the result made Kuchma a virtual shoe-in in
the second round. The only candidate who was thought to have a
serious shot at beating Kuchma, the Socialist Party leader
Oleksandr Moroz, placed a distant third with only 11.3 percent of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Mykhailo Pohrebinsky, an analyst and one of Ukraine's leading
pollsters, said the greatest danger for Kuchma is that his
supporters will be so certain of his victory that they won't show
up at the polls for the final runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Symonenko beat out other would-be challengers by initially
focusing on gaining the support of the party faithful and then
reaching for broader support on the eve of the election with
newsmaking comments that seemed to show him breaking from his
reputation as a doctrinaire Marxist-Leninist.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Symonenko and his party had consistently called
for Ukraine to join Russia's union with Belarus as a first step
toward restoration of the Soviet Union. On Monday, however
Symonenko said he favored ``free trade'' with Russia and Belarus
but not necessarily political union.

RICHARD TULLIS, EX-CHAIRMAN OF HARRIS CORP., DIES AT 86  
(DW)

<P>
   Richard B. Tullis, who guided the Harris Corp. from a small
printing press company to an electronic communications equipment
giant, died on Sunday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla., the company
said. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harris' early career predated the computer revolution
by decades, he was well primed to ride the electronic
communications wave. Tullis graduated from Principia College in
Elsah, Ill., in 1934, with a double major in mathematics and
physics. After short stints with the Dictograph Products Co. and
Schick Dry Shaver, he joined the Miller Printing Machinery Co. of
Pittsburgh as a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Tullis moved to Cleveland in 1956 to become vice president of
what was then known as Harris-Seybold, a maker of printing presses
and paper cutters. Over the next 29 years, as Harris began changing
into a manufacturer of word processing systems and other
computerized communications devices, he rose through the company's
ranks, becoming president in 1961, chief executive in 1968 and
chairman in 1972. He remained on the Harris board until 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He also served on the boards of National City Bank, the
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, NACCO Industries and
GenCorp, and was chairman of Armada Funds Group for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Tullis' role in Cleveland extended beyond Harris. He was among
the leaders of a movement to build low-income housing in the city's
downtrodden Hough area and was a longtime trustee of the Cleveland
Orchestra, where he and his wife, Chaille, endowed the principal
viola chair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Tullis is survived by his daughter,
Mrs. Charles G.L. de Barcza of Bedminster, N.J.; twin sons, Barclay
of Palo Alto, Calif., and Garner of New York City; nine
grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    EgyptAir crash investigation: Too early to predict cause
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ While abandoning hope that they would find any
survivors from Sunday's crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, searchers
Monday recovered a large piece of the aircraft and heard a signal
believed to come from a flight recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these discoveries, officials said they're baffled by the
crash. They cautioned that the investigation _ even the recovery of
submerged wreckage _ could take years.
</P>
<P>
   That haunting prospect awaits more than 180 relatives from Egypt
and across the United States arriving in this historic Navy town.
Grief counselors await them at a local hotel and investigators
promise twice-a-day updates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon disclosed 30 Egyptian military officers were on
board the doomed flight. Among the officers was at least one
brigadier general, The Associated Press reported, citing unnamed
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities said they have found no indications of sabotage
or terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this particular point in time, there is no indication of
criminal activity,'' FBI agent Barry Mawn said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that FBI bomb technicians and lab specialists
will help in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall cautioned
that he's unwilling to rule out the possibility of sabotage because
of the investigation is in the ''very early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The facts will lead us where they will lead us,'' said Hall,
flanked by officials of the NTSB, the FBI, the Coast Guard and the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian military officers were mostly pilots who had been
training in the United States, the Pentagon said. The 199
passengers included 106 Americans _ 54 of them headed on a two-week
trip to Egypt and the Nile. Eighteen crew members were on board.
</P>
<P>
   The first group of victims' relatives arrived from New York on
Monday afternoon by chartered plane at T.F. Green Airport in
Warwick, where they were greeted on the tarmac by an Egyptian
priest. They were taken to a hotel and offered grief counseling
from the Red Cross and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   George Arian, a friend of one of the victims, said some
passengers on the flight to Rhode Island panicked briefly as the
plane began flying over water soon after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock. Some people were crying hard,'' Arian said.
``Every lady or every man was thinking of his loved one.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian investigators and the president of EgyptAir are
expected to arrive today to assist in the investigation, Hall said.
He estimated 500 to 1,000 investigators are at work.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo-bound Boeing 767 suddenly plummeted 33,000 feet into
the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles south of Nantucket, Mass., early
Sunday, a half-hour after leaving New York's John F. Kennedy
Airport. The plane vanished from radar screens without making a
distress call or giving any other indication of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, searchers detected a pinging sound, which
investigators believe is coming from one of two ''black box''
recorders. If recovered, the flight data recorder or the cockpit
voice recorder may offer clues to the jetliner's plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said it will be 36 to 48 hours before the USNS Mohawk,
equipped with sophisticated listening devices, will arrive at the
debris field to hone in on the pinging, presumably 250 feet under
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recovering small objects, including a recorder, is daunting,''
Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The debris collected _ some of it by student sailors from the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy _ includes shoes, purses and teddy
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically looked like somebody had emptied their trash
Dumpster,'' said one of the sailors, Chris Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   None of the retrieved debris has any burn marks that might
indicate a fire or explosion, search officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All agencies are now focused on search and recovery, abandoning
rescue efforts 36 hours after the crash. A person could survive
five to six hours in the 59-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have far exceeded that,'' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M.
Larrabee said. ''We believe at this point it is in everyone's best
interest to no longer expect we will find survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing we needed or wanted that we did not have in
terms of searching for survivors,'' he said. ''There were no
limitations as far as our efforts for the last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   But until now, Larrabee said, ''One of the frustrations in this
case is we have not been able to communicate directly with the
families of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes and boats originally scoured a 9,000-square-mile zone,
but narrowed it to a 36-square-mile area after discovering floating
debris Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Coast Guard rushed to gather the debris _ small
pieces of the plane, cushions and seats, clothing and other
personal belongings _ in advance of wind, rain and cold weather
forecast today.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to reach the search area today, a ship capable of
sonar detection and a second vessel equipped with sonar and a robot
will focus their search on underwater debris.
</P>
<P>
   It is going to be tough, despite the sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a good area,'' said former Coast Guard officer Brent
Spies, now a private boat captain. ''It is very deep. There are
conflicting currents. The weather can deteriorate real quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard cutter Monomoy transported human remains and
aircraft debris Monday from the search area to the former Quonset
Point naval base. The NTSB is staging its investigation at the
sprawling complex of airplane hangars, runways and deep-water
docks, northwest of Newport.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will gather wreckage and attempt to reassemble the
plane in one of the hangars. In conjunction with the local medical
examiner, the NTSB is setting up a temporary morgue in another
building.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers have recovered one body, grisly work in this scenic
stretch of New England. Deep-blue water dominates the rocky terrain
dotted by weather-beaten towns and brick houses perched over the
Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In Newport, the Coast Guard has set up its search-and-recovery
operations at the Naval Yard where a ship delivered the wreckage of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s private plane, recovered from nearby waters
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies, including the American Red Cross and the
Salvation Army, are setting up operations in Newport and Quonset
Point. The agencies will feed emergency workers and provide
counseling for the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know the people of Rhode Island will open their hearts to
their families wherever they come from,'' Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln
Almond said.

Henry Grunwald, the former editor in chief of Time Inc. and
ambassador to Austria, has written ``Twilight: Losing Sight,
Gaining Insight,'' which he calls ``an autobiography of my eyes,''
to be published on Wednesday by Alfred A. Knopf. Grunwald, 76, has
been slowly losing his sight since 1992 because of macular
degeneration (a disease of the central retina, which picks up the
finest details of what people see). It affects 15 million Americans
and is the biggest single cause of legal blindness among the
elderly. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo) LITE

AMERICA MEDIA TO ACQUIRE GLOBE COMMUNICATIONS FOR $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era when Congress worries about multibillion-dollar
megamergers and corporate chieftains with creased, sweaty brows
testify before congressional subcommittees about the threat of
monopolization, one question has yet to rear its head: What happens
if one media company starts to corner the market on tabloid gossip?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, America may find out as The National Enquirer (this
week's headline: ``Woody Allen's Bizarre Lust for Young Girls'')
and The Star (``Hunky Prince William is Moving to U.S.: Look Out
Girls'') are joined in tabloid bliss with The Globe (``Ravaged TV
Beauty Beats Booze!'') under the same owners.
</P>
<P>
   American Media, the company that owns the National Enquirer and
the Star tabloid newspapers, is expected to announce Tuesday that
it will acquire the Globe Communications Corp. for $100 million in
cash, said executives close to the deal. The price is five times
Globe Communications' annual cash flow of about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   American Media is owned by Evercore Capital Partners, LLC, which
is headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman, who
is a close friend of the President and Mrs. Clinton, arguably the
first family not only of the country, but of the tabloid press.
Altman had no comment about the deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will join The Globe, a 40-year-old weekly tabloid with
a penchant for Elvis sightings and alien landings, and the
approximately 30 other titles owned by Globe Communications _
including Crack'd, Horoscopes and The National Examiner _ with The
National Enquirer, Star, Weekly World News and Country Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   When completed the deal will not only annoy celebrities and pump
up the nation's Elvis-memorabilia market, but will assure that
almost half of the nation's supermarket check-out tabloids are
under one corporate umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is best known for publishing more front-page articles
about the JonBenet Ramsey murder case than any other tabloid, and
scored a coup, of sorts, by publishing the crime-scene photographs
of that murder. The editor, Tony Frost, was not available for
comment on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been on and off for years; Globe Communications has
long been the apple of The National Enquirer's eye. The previous
owner of The Enquirer, Peter Callahan, attempted to buy Globe
Communications at least three times, said an executive familiar
with the negotiations. But Michael Rosenbloom, the Montreal
businessman who owns the Globe, became concerned that the
Department of Justice would investigate the potential for monopoly
_ as indeed the Justice Department did briefly when Callahan bought
Star from Rupert Murdoch in 1990. That investigation was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase comes at a time of growth and change for the
Enquirer: The tabloid is trying to go legitimate under its new
ownership. In February of this year, Evercore purchased the
Enquirer and the Globe for $294 million from its joint owners,
Boston Ventures and MacFadden Holdings, Inc., and hired David J.
Pecker, the former president and chief executive of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines, to be the chief executive of American Media.
</P>
<P>
   At American Media, Pecker's goal, along with his partners at
Evercore, has been to extend the National Enquirer brand to an
array of new ventures that may include more television programming,
new magazines _ such as Enquirer spinoffs for teenagers and
Hispanic readers _ and online services. Pecker has overseen a
redesign by the same designer who has redesigned The New Republic,
and Pecker has introduced an advertising campaign intended to
portray the National Enquirer as a respected celebrity news source.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potential for conflict among the staffs of the
tabloids, said an executive familiar with the personnel at both
companies. Whenever staff members are dismissed at the National
Enquirer or Star, the executive said, many of them would just ``go
down the road'' and get a job at the Globe; all three newspaper are
currently based in Lantana, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Murray, a vice president at Dirks Van Essen, a newspaper
brokerage company in Santa Fe, N.M., said that American Media is
broadening its demographic reach with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting a spectrum of different readers so you can go
to advertisers and offer them the range of demographics or a
specific demographic,'' he said. The Enquirer, Star and the Globe
``were fighting in the same space. If you control the content of
all three, you can tailor them so they reach different people,''
then sell advertisers either the combined audience or one segment
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Leslee Dart, a public-relations executive at PMK, a firm that
manages the images of celebrities like Tom Cruise, said that
celebrities would just have to contend with the new gossip
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, by the way, I've always felt it was better to have all
your enemies contained in one spot,'' Ms. Dart said.

DAEWOO FOUNDER AND 12 OTHER EXECUTIVES OFFER TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Disgraced by the collapse of the business
empire he founded 32 years ago, the chairman of the Daewoo Group
submitted his resignation Monday to the domestic creditors who are
overseeing the sale of the South Korean conglomerate's vast array
of heavily indebted businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation offer by Kim Woo Choong, a modern-day Korean
business legend, was quickly followed by similar offers from the
presidents of Daewoo's 12 main affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday night whether the creditors had accepted
the resignations. Kim had quietly left Seoul last week. Now in
Frankfurt, he called over the weekend and offered to quit, group
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   His move was not a complete surprise. The 62-year-old chairman
resigned last month as chairman of the nation's big business
lobbying group, the Federation of Korean Industries, leading to
speculation that he would leave Daewoo as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to step down from management in order to take full
responsibility for Daewoo Group's management problems,'' Kim and
the other executives said in a statement. ``Our decision is also
aimed at helping speed up the rehabilitation of the group's
affiliates.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who once personified South Korea's business success,
created Daewoo with a $10,000 loan in 1967, starting the company as
a one-room textile exporter. Over the years, Daewoo _ which means
``Great Universe'' in Korean _ grew into the nation's
second-largest conglomerate behind Hyundai, with businesses ranging
from shipbuilding to cars to securities brokerage. In the process,
it used vast amounts of borrowed money that it found increasingly
difficult to repay.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's heavy debts are thought to have contributed to South
Korea's economic crisis two years ago, and the company's own
financial problems grew so severe that it nearly fell into
bankruptcy in July, with $52 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors granted a reprieve from the most pressing loans, and
efforts to reorganize the group and sell many of its businesses
have been under way since then. But the process has been extremely
slow.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Ho Gen, executive chairman of the Corporate Restructuring
Committee, the group of domestic creditors overseeing the Daewoo
reorganization, said the resignation offers by Kim and his
subordinates came in response to concern that Daewoo's founder was
manipulating the reorganization process from behind the scenes.
``There's been a great deal of speculation that Chairman Kim is
scheming to come back,'' Oh said. ``It's nothing but a rumor, but
as long as it was perceived as a possibility, it was very difficult
to work out a restructuring for each of these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's stock market rose more than 5 percent Monday on
the news, and amid optimism that Daewoo's reorganization might
proceed more smoothly. But some expressed skepticism that Kim would
no longer be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows new control to start being established,'' said James
Rooney, president of the Templeton Investment Trust Management Co.
``But will the chairman really detach himself? Will he really let
the things necessary actually happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney said while Kim had ``clearly been part of the problem
over the last few years,'' his undisputed leadership made him the
``only one who knows where everything is in the group'' _
information that is crucial to creditors and to the South Korean
government in unraveling the debt problems.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging Kim's knowledge of the inner workings of the vast
conglomerate, Oh at the Corporate Restructuring Committee said that
while the chairman and the company presidents had offered to
resign, creditors might decide to keep them aboard to help with the
overhaul of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Oh said Kim was not indispensable. He said creditors had made
substantial progress over the last few months in gaining knowledge
about the depth of Daewoo's financial crisis. ``The myth about
Chairman Kim being the only one who knows everything about Daewoo
is just that, a myth,'' Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   Creditor banks on Tuesday will review debt-rescheduling and
restructuring plans for the Daewoo Motor Co., Daewoo Heavy
Industries, the Daewoo Electronics Co. and the trading and
financing arm of the group, the Daewoo Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign creditors, who are exposed to around $5 billion of debt,
met last week in Japan and refused to freeze the group's debt,
demanding more consultation on the restructuring plans.

DOW FALLS IN MIXED TRADING AS NASDAQ HITS NEW HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Monday as traders and
investors took some profits after the big run-up in market gauges
over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a consolidation-type day,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, a
market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``There was a little bit
of profit taking, and word of another earthquake in Taiwan got
people a little scared and took a little of the froth out of the
Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   While some semiconductor stocks, including Intel, dropped after
news of the quake flashed across trading screens, the Nasdaq
composite index managed to eke out another record.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Nasdaq was up 1.22 points, or 0.04 percent, to
2,967.65. Early in the session, the index flirted with 3,000 and
got as high as 2,997.90.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big declines in two conglomerates, General Electric
and Tyco International, helped to push the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index down by 8.81 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,354.12.
Tyco fell 4 9/16, to 35 9/16, and GE dropped 6 1/8, to 129 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which included four new stocks
_ Intel, Microsoft, Home Depot and SBC Communications _ for the
first time, slumped 81.35 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,648.51.
Declines in GE, American Express, down 5 to 149, and DuPont, down 2
3/8 to 62 1/16, were largely responsible for the drop in the
blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the new Dow stocks _ Intel and Microsoft _ fell Monday,
with Intel down 1 7/16, to 76, and Microsoft dipping 3/16, to 92
3/8. SBC Communications and Home Depot gained, with SBC rising 2
1/8, to 53, and Home Depot rising {, to 76\.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks had a solid session with the Russell 2000 index of
small-company shares gaining 3.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to
431.82.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of business was fairly brisk for a Monday, although
much reduced from the heavy traffic recorded at the end of last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 861 million shares. On
the Nasdaq stock market, 1.07 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said it was likely that business would not pick up
significantly until after the government releases October
employment numbers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Monday's mixed performance, many participants and
analysts are coming to the view that the weeks and months of
uncertainty that have impeded a broad advance may be coming to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to be biased toward being pretty positive,'' said
Michael Molnar, a managing director in sales and trading at Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a lot of risk to the market,'' he said.
``Interest-rate fears are largely overblown, and Y2K is the
ultimate one-time event. As a business issue, people will start to
look past it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbing concern that interest rates will move higher prodded
Byron Wien, a U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
to commit some spare cash from his model stock portfolio to a
handful of financial service stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still quite cautious on the overall market,'' Wien said
Monday. ``This was a tactical move because I think we are in a
benign interest-rate environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors favor financial stocks at the moment, Wien said,
including the pending elimination of the Glass-Steagall Act, strong
economic growth with minimal inflation, and the sense that a
decision by Federal Reserve Board policy-makers to raise short-term
interest rates on Nov. 16 may be the last such increase for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which have had a big run over the last two
weeks, retreated a bit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/KBW Bank Index, which had risen
nearly 25 percent in two weeks, fell 10.68 points Monday, or 1.2
percent, to 873.51.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies had a good day, as investors began to focus
on how they might help big companies transfer some of their
business to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle and Siebel Systems, which sell customer-service and
call-center software, were two big winners. Oracle gained 3 5/8, to
51 3/16. And Siebel jumped 7 7/8, to a record 117 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies posted mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint fell 2 5/16, to 72\, after The Financial Times of London
reported that the company faces seven lawsuits stemming from its
agreement to be bought by MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth, which lost the bidding war for Sprint, rose 2
3/16, to 47 3/16.

BEHIND SYRIA'S STONY FACADE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seen from the outside, Syria has a rough veneer. Few Americans
think of it as a tourist destination, scared off, perhaps, by its
less than savory image: for years, Syria has been a member of the
State Department's terrorism list. But pass through its doors,
wander its souks, explore its back roads, and Syria turns out to be
something very different.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Syria is like an old Damascene home, with walls
that give way to an inviting courtyard. In four years of living in
the Middle East, in fact, I have found traveling in Syria to be the
most pleasant single surprise. It is a land of stunning variety _
of geography, culture and above all, of the relics left by those
who over many centuries have battled for its control.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else in the region, perhaps nowhere else at all, can a
visitor leap so effortlessly from one era to another _ from Roman
ruins to Crusader castles, from Mameluke mosques to Christian
churches, from Ottoman caravanseries to primitive, creaking water
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Syria's two major centers, Damascus and Aleppo, are
thriving, noisy metropolises. But at their hearts lie ancient
covered markets, with serpentine alleyways, where a visitor can
begin to appreciate the two places' rival claims to being the
oldest continuously inhabited city.
</P>
<P>
   It must be said that Syria is not always an easy place to
travel. Although it is trying hard to promote tourism, the country
still lacks truly modern highways and is short of first-class
hotels. Obtaining a visa can be cumbersome; all applications are
closely scrutinized, and because Syria remains technically at war
with Israel, would-be travelers who have an Israeli stamp in their
passport are bound to be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone with a taste for the exotic and the old-fashioned
will find Syria a wonderful antidote to the monotony brought on by
globalization. With an isolation that is in part self-imposed,
Syria is still a country without ATM's, mobile phones and credit
cards of its own. Europeans, particularly the French, have begun to
discover Syria, often in tour groups. Even so, it is not unusual to
find major sites all but empty.
</P>
<P>
   I had visited Damascus many times, and twice before had
journeyed well outside the capital _ to the fortified storybook
castle known as Crac des Chevaliers, a marvel of medieval
engineering, and to the ancient city of Palmyra, where Roman tombs,
temples and pillars are spread out across a stark desert. But it
was not until last spring, when my wife, Lisa, and I decided to
venture out on a four-day trip, that I began to learn just how much
Syria was hiding.
</P>
<P>
   With a hired car and driver, we moved in a kind of figure 8,
heading first from Damascus north toward Aleppo, through the town
of Hama _ famous for its water wheels but also infamous for a 1982
massacre of at least 10,000. We picnicked in the Roman ruins of
Apamea, on green hills overlooking the Orontes Valley, where cows
peacefully grazed among the Corinthian columns.
</P>
<P>
   In Aleppo's Armenian Quarter, we discovered old homes newly
transformed into small hotels or restaurants where the cuisine,
including salads of fresh herbs and salty cheese, was some of the
most memorable I have tasted in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   From Aleppo, we headed northwest about a half-hour to the
remains of the remarkable St. Simeon Stylites Church. Set amid
rolling, rocky countryside, it was built in tribute to the
fifth-century ascetic who spent much of his life there, on a
platform atop a stone column. (Most of the column has been chipped
away by pilgrims over the centuries, but a stump still remains.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, we curved to the southwest, passing through the rugged
coastal mountains toward the Mediterranean coast by way of Qal'at
Saladin, the remote Crusader fortress that T.E. Lawrence called
``the most sensational thing in castlebuilding I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the port city of Latakia, we toured the Bronze Age city of
Ugarit, where evidence of the world's first cuneiform alphabet was
discovered on a terra-cotta tablet. Then we swung south and east,
past Crac des Chevaliers, splendid on the lush coastal hillsides,
and across the Syrian desert to the date-palm oasis where Palmyra
lies, before returning to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   We wished we had had more time. Still, accustomed to the numbing
distances and inefficiencies that are often part of travel in the
Middle East, we felt fortunate; in Syria, we discovered, much can
be accomplished in a relatively short time.
</P>
<P>
   We made our arrangements only after arriving in Damascus, where
any trip to Syria should start. We had been tempted to rent a car
and drive, but opted against it. Roads in Syria are not well
marked, even on major highways, and smaller tourist destinations
can be difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Damascus and Aleppo, the traffic can be atrocious
and parking almost nonexistent. Even English-language signs can be
hard to decipher: ``Make lightspeed,'' one of them cautioned; ``A
place full of inhabitants'' was another.
</P>
<P>
   For many travelers, a package tour might be a better option. But
we were glad to have the freedom to map out our own route and the
flexibility to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   In the back streets of Hama, we happened across a parade of
schoolchildren, marching through the streets and waving tiny flags
as they chanted homage to Hafez Assad, who has been Syria's leader
for nearly 30 years. It was a holiday, it turned out _ the
anniversary of Assad's Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   Later, back on the main highway, we marveled at the villagers
who seemed to have gathered at every exit, all in festive dress,
the scene enlivened by the music of drums and traditional
instruments. It was a modern variation of an old Muslim tradition _
a welcome for neighbors returning home from a pilgrimmage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the Damascus Airport can confirm old prejudices. The
airport has been renovated, but the first impression is the one
left by surly soldiers who thumb through passports looking for any
evidence of an Israeli stamp. On the walls are posters of Assad,
which are ubiquitous in the capital.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Everdream Takes Hassles Out of Computing  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A Silicon Valley startup today will become the latest vendor to
announce a plan to relieve small businesses of the risks and
hassles of buying, installing and supporting their own computers.
<P>
   Everdream Corp. will provide up-to-date PCs, an array of
standard software applications, unlimited Internet access and 24/7
tech support for the whole setup at a flat fee of no more than $150
per user per month.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-month-old Mountain View company is part of a growing
trend known in the industry as ``subscription computing.'' System
integrators such as MicroAge already offer hardware, software and
support to large corporate customers on a per-seat basis. In , &LR;  and
in  &LR; recent months two other companies _ CenterBeam, a Santa Clara
startup, and Micronpc, a direct-to-the-customer PC vendor based in
Nampa, Idaho _ have unveiled similar plans for small-to-medium
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But Everdream's service differs from the others in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's designed specifically for what CEO Gary Griffiths
called ``the low end of the small-business market'' _ companies
with just 10 or so employees. It will even contract with customers
who have only one PC.
</P>
<P>
   Second, instead of competing head-on with local dealers who
currently  &LR; supply PCs for many such businesses, Everdream aims to
enlist them as its front-line marketing arm. The theory is that
dealers will be glad to offload basic tasks such as building and
installing PCs, which don't generate much profit anyway, so they
can concentrate on offering more lucrative value-added services.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Everdream had already signed up 45 dealers in
the Bay Area alone, Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   For their $150 monthly fee, users will get Everdream-branded PCs
with Intel Pentium III microprocessors, 128 megabytes of memory,
13-gigabyte hard drives, Intel Ethernet network adapters and
17-inch monitors.
</P>
<P>
   That's a generous configuration by today's standards, but it
might not be when Everdream's standard 21/2-year contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Windows 98, Outlook 2000 and the Small Business
Edition of Microsoft's Office 2000 productivity-software suite will
be preloaded, along with Intuit's Quicken or QuickBooks accounting
software and Symantec's Act! &LR;  contact-management program. Web-based
- &LR; training courses on six major applications are also included.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet access, Everdream customers will use 56K modems or
high-speed digital subscriber lines to connect to Concentric, a
prominent local Internet service provider. At sites with 10 or more
customers, there will be no extra charge for DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Everdream, however, wants potential customers to focus not on
the hardware and software it will install, but on the service and
support it will provide. The company says it will function as a
single point of contact users can count on for live support when
they have a problem or question about any aspect of the system.
</P>
<P>
   To keep support costs down, Everdream is relying on some special
software it will preinstall, including open-source &LR;   &LR; programs that
allow its technicians to chat with the customer and observe or even
control the PC over the Internet. A ``dreambar'' floating above the
standard Windows taskbar will provide one-click access to major
applications and to Everdream's support services, as well as to a
Web portal where it will offer additional small business-oriented
information and services.
</P>
<P>
   The dreambar also has room for the customer's own business logo
and for system-status reports, such as ``backup completed 2:11
a.m.'' The package includes daily backup over the Internet to
www.connected.com, a Web site that specializes in data backup and
disaster recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all that, Everdream has also developed proprietary,
patent-pending programs it hopes will keep its customers up and
running without extensive hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   The software divides the PC's hard drive into two partitions,
each with its own copy of the Windows operating system. Users will
be free to install anything they want on one partition, but the
other will contain only software preinstalled by Everdream, which
users won't be able to modify.
</P>
<P>
   When starting up their PCs, users will be able to choose which
part of the disk to launch. When they boot up from Everdream's
partition, software for which the company is seeking a patent will
check the disk and make sure it contains all the files it's
supposed to and no others; if it detects any anomalies, they will
be fixed automatically before they can cause problems, according to
Russell Rive, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer.
That way customers will always have a system they can count on
working, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Smulders, principal analyst at Dataquest, called the
Everdream service ``a very interesting model.'' But he also noted
that the company faces some challenges: Some very small businesses
might consider the service pricey compared to ``free'' or nearly
- &LR; free PCs offered with Internet service contracts, and many local
resellers might be reluctant to share revenues and information
about customers with the company.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that many small businesses require
specialized ``vertical-market'' software that Everdream isn't set
up to provide.

 UNDATED: the capital.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the streets, drivers are eerily obedient. Much of the
construction is modern and unremarkable. Rising behind the city are
the Anti-Lebanon Mountains, but these also convey a certain
bleakness; barren of vegetation, they are capped, on one hilltop,
by Assad's severe and monumental presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   But plunge into Old Damascus on foot, and the senses ignite.
Enter through the Hamidiyyah souk, and you may be swept like the
tide through this bazaar, past merchants offering tawdry modern
wares and others peddling treasures like the brocade cloth that
bears the city's name.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can resist shopping, at least at first, should wade
farther, to the triumphal arch that marks the remains of the Temple
of Jupiter, on a site that has housed sacred enclosures for more
than 3,000 years. The arch guards the gate to the majestic Umayyad
Mosque, one of the most impressive in the Middle East, having
survived more than 1,200 years of invasions, earthquakes, fires and
Mongol sackings.
</P>
<P>
   I like to wander through the great courtyard, where an octagonal
treasury raised above the ground was used beginning in the 14th
century to keep public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to wander is the Street Called Straight, a major
thoroughfare since Hellenistic times, and featured in biblical
tales of St. Paul's conversion to Christianity. Straight Street
also marks the best route to the Bab Sharqi, at the old city's
eastern edge, in a quarter that has a cluster of good restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that old Damascene houses may be most easily
glimpsed, along the street leading to the Chapel of St. Ananias, on
a site where Paul reputedly took shelter. Visitors are free to peer
into many courtyards, and in some houses, small shops offer
Damascus' most famous wares, including the brocade and inlaid
wooden boxes.
</P>
<P>
   There is much more to see in old Damascus _ museums, mosques,
churches _ and more shopping, at prices that can be staggeringly
good (but be sure to bargain). But with its three million people,
the capital can also sometimes feel stifling, and after three days
we were glad to get on the road, namely the Damascus-Aleppo
highway, which took us into Syria's midsection, watered by clouds
that blow through a gap in what are otherwise impenetrable coastal
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Our driver, Mohammed, was a friendly, multilingual college
graduate in his 30s who, like many young Syrians, had had little
luck in lining up more lucrative work. We had chosen not to hire a
separate guide, and had brought good guidebooks, most notably Ross
Burns' ``Monuments of Syria'' (London: I.B. Taurus, $24.50), which
we found invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   At most sites, only limited information is available in English,
even though the Syrian government charges entry fees that average
about $6.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop, Hama, lies on the Orontes River, about two hours
north of Damascus. Those who follow the politics of the Middle East
may remember the city for the killing that took place there in
1982, when Assad sent his army into the city to suppress an
uprising by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The government later flattened much of the large area where the
fighting took place, but as we wandered through the narrow alleys
near the local museum, we found walls still pockmarked with
innumerable bullet holes from house-to-house fighting.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked one man what had happened there, he jerked a finger
across his neck. That lent a somber mood to our morning. But not in
Hama, nor anywhere else in Syria, did I feel a sense of threat. The
Syrian government's record is far from clean when it comes to
terrorism, but even the State Department, perhaps its biggest
critic, says the government has not been tied to an act of
terrorism since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre at Hama, Assad has kept a tight lid on law
breaking, making the streets of Syria safer than those of most
cities.
</P>
<P>
   These days, as for centuries, the sound of Hama is the creaking
of water wheels _ some as large as 65 feet across _ being turned
slowly by the river's flow. These nurias, the oldest thought to
date from 1700, still lift the water and send it flowing into
nearby fields.
</P>
<P>
   We pushed on, first to the Roman ruins at Apamea, another 90
minutes or so away, along a narrow road that wound through lush
countryside. The ancient city, founded in the fifth century B.C.
had a long and glorious history, its visitors including Cleopatra
and Marc Antony.
</P>
<P>
   Its central avenue, more than a mile long, was lined by 1,200
columns, some 200 of which have been uprighted again. We saw no
more than a dozen other tourists in two hours there, and were free
to roam. In the distance to the west, fog-capped coastal mountains
seemed to plunge almost vertically into the green Orontes Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Aleppo, two hours north, was disappointing at first, crowded
with cars and noisy with the honking of horns. But a glimpse of the
Citadel, an ancient fortress perched high on a massif at the city's
heart, served as a reminder that this was no ordinary city. And
nearby, in the ancient stone-covered souk, a maze of alleys crowded
with craftsmen, merchants and donkey carts, we reveled in finding a
market that is utterly authentic.
</P>
<P>
   We had hoped to stay in Beit Wakil, the nicer of the small new
hotels in the renovated old houses in the Armenian Quarter. But
they were booked, so we were relegated to the Pullman, a mostly
shabby place some 15 minutes away. Back in the Armenian Quarter,
meals of savory grilled meat, mezzes and Lebanese wine helped to
soothe the sense of having missed out.
</P>
<P>
   Among our further stops, one of my favorites was Qal'at Saladin,
for its remoteness in the steep and rugged mountains that divide
Syria's coast from its hinterland. Reached by a narrow winding
roadway, it looks down toward the sea, isolated not only by two
natural ravines but also by a 60-foot-deep ditch, gouged into the
stone by workers who left behind a pinnacle of rock to support a
draw bridge.
</P>
<P>
   An old Byzantine fortress, it was taken over by the Crusaders
early in the 12th century. But the Crusaders' stay was brief; in
1188, the castle was conquered by the great warrior Saladin as part
of a flurry of conquests that led to the Arab recovery of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As for Latakia, the mainly industrial seaport where we spent a
night, it was a stop we could have done without. Still, it provided
easy access to Ugarit, the Bronze Age site a short drive away, and
allowed a chance to feast on fresh fish from the Mediterranean,
served whole in a waterside restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   By design, we had saved Syria's best-known sites for last, and
both Crac des Chevaliers and Palmyra were worth the wait. The Crac,
set amid green rolling hills, may be the paragon of castles, the
one in the mind of any child who sets out with a bucket and a pail.
</P>
<P>
   Taken over and improved by the Knights Hospitaler beginning in
1144, it was among the last of the Crusader fortresses to be built
in the region and the most formidable, not conquered until the
mid-13th century. During a few hours of wandering, we saw that the
happiest visitors appeared to be the children, exploring the vast
dungeon, stables and towers that offered a commanding view.

 UNDATED: commanding view.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To reach our final stop, Palmyra, required a two-and-a-half hour
drive across the desert, where Bedouin shepherds watched their
herds. On our arrival, the sight of Roman temples and columns
rising so incongruously from the sands drove home the role that
Palmyra played in its heyday, some 400 years beginning in the first
century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Made viable by a spring that still feeds the oasis, the city
straddled the main trading route between the Persian Gulf and the
Mediterranean, as well as the Silk Road, and the taxes it imposed
provided vast wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the year, the fierceness of the desert sun
can make midday explorations uncomfortable at best, and the flat
light can render even the most impressive of the ruins
unremarkable. But palm-shaded courtyards of several outdoor
restaurants are good places to take breaks, while sunset is the
time to explore the Arab castle, atop a steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the final morning of our trip, we set our alarms very early.
Soon we were outside, shivering in the darkness, picking and
stumbling our way across the rocky soil toward shapes we could
barely discern. Bit by bit, the sky began to lighten and the sun's
first pink rays shot across the desert to illuminate ancient marble
and, as it has for millenniums, bring Palmyra to life. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finding your way through a nation of a hidden treasures  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To enter Syria, a visa must be obtained in advance. Single-entry
visas cost $61, by money order only. Information and applications
are available from the Syrian Embassy, 2215 Wyoming Avenue NW,
Washington, D.C. 20008, (202) 232-6313.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Around
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Where to Stay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except where noted, the 10 percent tax on hotel rooms is not
included. All large hotels accept credit cards, but for flexibility

and traveler's checks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton Damascus Hotel and Towers, on Umayyad Square, with
325 modern, rooms, is a favorite of business travelers. Its bars

fax (963-11) 224-3607. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cheaper option is the 80-room Orient Palace, near the old
railway station in al-Hejaz Square. With clean, simple quarters,
this 55-year-old hotel retains some charm. A room with breakfast
and taxes is $38; (963-11) 223-1351, fax (963-11) 221-1512. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Aleppo, the Pullman, in the University district, offers 101
small, basic rooms with tired furnishings, at $83; (963-21)
266-7200, fax (963-21) 266-7213. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More attractive alternatives are the 16-room Beit Wakil, Sissi
Street, al-Jedaideh Area, (963-21) 221-7169, fax (963-21) 224-7082,
and the 14-room Martini, (also called Dar Zamaria), al-Huttub
Street, al-Jedaideh Area, (963-21) 363-9913; fax (963-21) 363-2333.
Both are newly opened in restored Armenian Quarter homes on narrow
cobbled alleys, and feature small but delightful rooms, Turkish
baths and peaceful courtyards. At each, rooms are $100, including
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In Latakia, the modern-style Cote d'Azur de Cham, (963-41)
428-700; fax (963-41) 428-285, just outside the city, is a huge
popular beach resort, with 1,100 rooms. A basic but pleasant room
with a balcony overlooking the Mediterranean is $133; from October
to April 1, $67. The hotel is operated by Cham Palace, Syria's
largest chain. For reservations in most cities from the United
States, call (202) 835-0099, fax (202) 429-0615. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Palmyra, the well-situated Palmyra Cham Palace, with 250
rooms, overlooks the oasis at the edge of the city. Its rooms,
overpriced at $180, are unremarkable in decor, but offer moonlit
views of the archaeological site. Reservations from (963-31)
912-230, fax (963-31) 912-245, or the Cham Palace American number. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smaller alternative is Villa Palmyra, a peaceful, relaxed
guest house in town on Gamal Abdel Nasser Street. The 42 rooms cost
$50, including breakfast and taxes. (963-31) 913-600; fax 912-554. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, Arabesque, in Medhat Pasha Market, off the Street
Called Straight in the Old City, offers updated versions of Arab
cuisine in pleasant surroundings, including an outdoor terrace with
a view of the city. A specialty is couscous with lamb, Moroccan
style. Dinner for two, with good Lebanese wine, is about $38;
(963-11) 543-3999, fax (963-11) 331-2170. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zeitouna, tucked away in the covered courtyard of an old
Damascene house, on Zeitouna Street, near Bab Sharki, offers a
delightful variety of appetizers, or mezze. Main dishes feature
grilled meats; With Lebanese wine, dinner for two is about $30;
(963-11) 543-5994, fax (963-11) 543-1324. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Aleppo, some of the best cooking in the Middle East can be
sampled at Sissi House, Jedediah Plaza, in the Armenian Quarter. A

fish and sea food. Dinner for two, with Lebanese wine, is about
$35; (963-41) 478-238 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What to See &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect to pay the equivalent of $3 to $6 to enter any
government-run site. For free exploration, marketplaces and city
streets can be eminently more authentic.
</P>

extraordinary collection of archaeological and historical material.

 _ SF CHRON  
 EVoice Offers Nearly Free Phone Mail  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Looking to save a few bucks a month on voice mail?
<P>
   A Menlo Park company is offering phone message service free to
customers in Northern California who are willing to listen to a 10-
to 15-second advertisement before picking up their messages.
</P>
<P>
   EVoice Inc., which launches its service tomorrow, said it plans
to compete with Pacific Bell by offering its customers free voice
mail on their home or business phones. Pac Bell offers voice mail
for $7.95 per month, plus a one-time installation fee of $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of companies _ such as One Box, eFax and
ThinkLink _ have started offering free voice mail service in recent
months, most require that messages be sent to a separate phone
number that's different from a customer's home or work number.
Users of those services check their voice mail via the Internet or
telephone, as do eVoice users.
</P>
<P>
   But eVoice lets customers get the free voice mail on their
existing home or business phone, so users can have a single number
for all messages.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have signed up, users can access their messages via
the phone or by going to eVoice's Web site _ www.evoice.com. To
check their messages on the Web, customers must use a computer with
RealAudio so they can hear the advertisements and phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   However, to find out if they have a message waiting, the eVoice
service is a bit less convenient than traditional voice- &LR;  mail.
</P>
<P>
   Users must either call the eVoice service, go to the Web site,
check their e-mail or be notified via an alphanumeric pager. The
service does not provide users with a flashing light on their phone
or a fast dial tone indicating that a message is waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The company is testing a service that would inform customers of
a waiting message through a ``stutter'' dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Crair, president of eVoice, said the company plans to roll
out the service nationwide during the next year. For now, however,
it's only available from Fairfield to Watsonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why customers should have to pay a monthly
fee to get voice mail,'' Crair said. ``Consumers and small
businesses can both save money by using eVoice.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, as long as they're willing to listen to advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Crair said several companies, such as the Fox Family Channel,
have signed up with eVoice to pitch their products to customers. He
said the ads will be targeted to users based on demographic
information eVoice collects about customers when they sign up.
However, no individual information will be given to advertisers,
Crair said.
</P>
<P>
   EVoice's business model is similar to other companies that have
begun giving customers free services for the price of listening to
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like BroadPoint Communications, based in Maryland,
offer free long-distance service to people willing to listen to
recorded ads. Some PC-makers are giving away computers to customers
who don't mind seeing ads on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Pac Bell said customers who sign up for voice
mail want a quick, efficient service and won't want to listen to
ads.
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a spokesman for the phone company, said when Pac
Bell broadcast messages over its voice mail service a while back
customers were not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ```People get voice mail with us because they want it to be fast
and save them time. They don't like listening to ads,'' Britton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Britton added that the service lacks some of the functionality
of Pac Bell's voice mail system _ such as the ability to hear a
special dial tone indicating that a message is waiting.

AT&AMP;T FIGHTS PUSH TO OPEN CABLE LINES TO ITS RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Seeking to stamp out a growing political brush
fire that started here, the AT&AMP;T Corp. argued before a federal
appeals court Monday that the city exceeded its authority last year
when it sought to force AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines to rival
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has bought some of the nation's biggest cable companies in
the last year in a bid to become the leading provider of service
over cable lines, offering not only television programming but
ultimately high-speed Internet connections and local telephone
service. Cable can provide Internet access 10 to 80 times as fast
as a standard telephone line, allowing customers to retrieve
information from the World Wide Web with the immediacy they get
when changing television channels.
</P>
<P>
   But in a case being watched closely around the country and
argued Monday before a three-judge panel of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Portland and Multnomah County
have essentially taken the position that high-speed Internet
service over cable lines should be opened to competition, much the
way long-distance telephone lines were after decades of control by
AT&AMP;T. Under Portland's plan, these competitors, like America
Online, would pay AT&AMP;T a fee for use of the cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge here has already ruled in Portland's favor, and
a handful of local authorities around the country have followed its
lead in providing for ``open access,'' a position that AT&AMP;T
portrays as an outrageous undermining of its multibillion-dollar
investment to upgrade cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual vote on Tuesday, Denver residents are being asked
whether to extend the city's franchise agreement with AT&AMP;T, with
the company's critics urging a vote of no to force the open-access
issue onto the table there.
</P>
<P>
   But in other places where the issue has come up, including Los
Angeles and Seattle, officials have refrained from imposing access
requirements, not wishing to jeopardize the introduction of
advanced cable services and calling instead for some clarification
at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of reasoning Monday that seemed to take both sides in
the Portland case by surprise, the judicial panel questioned
whether the lines were a cable service at all anymore, but instead
a telecommunications service that should presumably be regulated
federally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we decide that this is a telecommunications service or
facility, either one, this case is over, is it not?'' Edward Leavy,
an appeals court judge on the panel, which also includes Judges
Ferdinand F. Fernandez and Sidney R. Thomas, asked lawyers at the
packed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But that possibility left both sides predicting victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they decide, that's terrific and we would love
to see that as national policy,'' said Erik Sten, the commissioner
here who oversees cable issues. Sten predicted that under federal
oversight, open access would be required. ``This has to be used for
the public good,'' he said at a news conference Monday, ``and the
public good is choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But David W. Carpenter, a lawyer for AT&AMP;T, told the judges that
Congress had already passed telecommunications laws allowing for
vigorous competition over Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress was clear,'' Carpenter told the judges, ``because it
wanted nothing _ nothing _ to get in the way of that conversion''
of cable lines for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Federal Communications Commission has sided with
AT&AMP;T, filing a brief in the Portland case saying that any
regulation of high-speed Internet service was premature, and in any
case was a federal matter, not a local one.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, which is expected to rule early in the new
year, is being asked to decide whether Judge Owen M. Panner of
United States District Court backed Portland's actions by ruling in
June that AT&AMP;T had ``no contractual right under the franchise
agreements to exclude competitors from the cable modem platform.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T bought several huge companies, including TCI, which had
been providing service here. Portland used the normally routine
matter of a formal franchise transfer to AT&AMP;T as a means of
imposing the open-access requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Open Net Coalition, made up of a range of AT&AMP;T rivals
including America Online and GTE, backs open-access requirements
but also says it wants to sit down with AT&AMP;T and hammer out a fair
price agreement for access to customers over the cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are standing here holding out money and telling
AT&AMP;T, `Here, take our money,''' said Gregory Simon, a former top
aide to Vice President Gore, who is co-director of the coalition
with Richard Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``The only thing stopping AT&AMP;T from taking our money is
AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T, which provides high-speed Internet access through an
exclusive agreement with the Excite(at)Home service, in which it
owns a major stake, says there is no rationale for forcing the
company to open up the lines it has paid for and improved. Monday
it made public a letter signed by more than 100 high-technology
companies warning that such requirements could stifle Internet
innovation.

 AIDS Activists Help Quash Experimental HIV Drug  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel yesterday
rejected a new treatment for HIV after leading AIDS activists broke
with tradition and argued that the experimental drug had too many
side effects and too few benefits.
<P>
   The 13-to-1 vote by the advisory committee was a crushing blow
to Gilead Sciences of Foster City, because the FDA usually follows
its panels' recommendations in deciding whether to approve new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed with the committee's decisions,''
Gilead chief executive John Martin said in a statement. ``However
we plan to work closely with the FDA to resolve the outstanding
issues and respond to the questions they have raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Gilead shares was halted at $63.19 yesterday during
the panel's deliberations. The stock is in for a pounding today as
investors digest the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had bet on Adefovir's approval, touting the
experimental drug as a remedy for people with strains of HIV
resistant to current AIDS drugs. JP Morgan analyst Franklin Berger
had estimated Gilead would book $42 million from Adefovir sales in
2000, a big step toward making the company profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The negative vote casts a cloud over those projections as well
as Gilead's other successes, notably the royalties it stands to
earn from the recent FDA approval of Tamiflu, a pill to relieve flu
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's meeting began badly for Gilead when FDA staff
scientists testified that Gilead's Adefovir was not very effective
in treating HIV and that even low doses seemed to cause kidney
problems in many patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, companies seeking approval for HIV drugs could rely
on strong support from AIDS activists to shout down such FDA
concerns. But leading AIDS groups, like the Treatment Action Group
in New York, voiced the same reservations as the FDA scientists
yesterday and urged the advisory panel to reject Adefovir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adefovir marks a turning point for the AIDS community,'' said
Martin Delaney with Project Inform in San Francisco. ``Nobody has
worked harder than we have to get new treatments approved. But with
14 other drugs out there, you tend to look a little more harshly at
the new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Frost &AMP; Sullivan market research firm
estimatesthat nearly $3 billion worth of AIDS drugs will be sold in
1999. It projects sales will grow an average of 19 percent a year
through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said the very robustness of the HIV drug market meant
AIDS activists and advisory panel members could consider Adefovir's
performance without the sense of urgency with which they have
scrutinized previous drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members were concerned that Adefovir accumulated in the
kidneys of many recipients. Part way through the human trials,
Gilead cut the dose of Adefovir in half to reduce possible kidney
toxicity. But that left Gilead with less evidence that Adefovir was
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paucity of data on safety and efficacy is quite obvious to
all of us today,'' advisory panel member Wafaa El-Sadr, an AIDS
expert in New York, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Not all AIDS activists cheered Adefovir's rejection. Ronald
Baker, editor of HIVandHepatis.com, said AIDS doctors understand
the risks of new medications and should have the choice of
prescribing Adefovir for patients who are resistant to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Adefovir's future as an HIV treatment is uncertain, AIDS
activists say Gilead has a more potent and less toxic variant of
the drug in the wings. Gilead hopes to get this drug, called
Tenofovir, into Phase III trials later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised Gilead two years ago to drop Adefovir and
concentrate on Tenofovir,'' Delaney said, but the company felt it
could not afford to wait the extra year or so to get Tenofovir to
market.
</P>
<P>
   Gilead officials did not return calls for comment.

LOBBYISTS PLEAD GUILTY IN CASE LINKED TO HOUSE MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two lobbyists pleaded guilty Monday to relatively
minor charges arising from a huge construction project in Boston,
thereby ending an investigation that had seemed to threaten the
powerful chairman of the House transportation committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ann M. Eppard of Alexandria, Va., and Vernon A. Clark of
Stateline, Nev., pleaded guilty in federal District Court in Boston
to misdemeanor charges that Ms. Eppard took illegal compensation
from Clark while she was chief of staff to Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.,
who heads the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph L. Tauro fined each defendant $5,000. He fined
Clark an additional $5,000 on a separate guilty plea to filing
false tax documents related to his lobbying business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ends the case against Ann Eppard and Vernon Clark, and it
ends the investigation,'' the U.S. Attorney in Boston, Donald K.
Stern, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said his office had decided to drop an earlier indictment
containing far more serious charges because a recent Supreme Court
decision made it more difficult to prosecute cases involving
government officials who accept favors.
</P>
<P>
   The original indictment, returned in April 1998, accused the
defendants of several felonies involving illegal gratuities and
influence-wielding that could have led to more than 30 years in
prison for each defendant. The indictment was handed down a year
before the Supreme Court case cited by Stern, who asserted that the
earlier charges were appropriate at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action apparently ended any legal problems for Shuster.
It had been widely reported for months that a federal grand jury in
Boston was looking into whether he had used his influence to help
two campaign contributors in disputes regarding the
multibillion-dollar construction project in the case, a highway and
tunnel project through downtown Boston and under the city's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The House ethics committee agreed last June to delay an inquiry
into Shuster's activities pending the outcome of the Boston
investigation. It was not apparent Monday evening what effect, if
any, the end of the Boston case would have on the ethics
committee's course.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1998 indictment asserted that Ms. Eppard had received more
than $200,000 from 1989 to 1995 by taking advantage of her position
as chief of staff to Shuster to gain favorable settlements for two
businessmen whose property was in the path of the construction
project. Both businessmen were represented by Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eppard worked for Shuster from 1972, when he was elected to
Congress, until just after the election of 1994, when the
Republicans took over the House, and Shuster gained the influential
chairmanship of the transportation panel.
</P>
<P>
   She then left Shuster's office to form a lobbying firm, which
has prospered by representing transportation interests. She also
continued to raise money for Shuster's campaigns, partly by
soliciting contributions from those interests.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's critics saw his friendship with Ms. Eppard, her
instant success as a lobbyist and her fund-raising on his behalf as
conflict of interest. But the chairman has consistently denied any
wrongdoing, and Monday night he issued a statement expressing
pleasure that the most serious charges against Ms. Eppard were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our trust and respect for Ann remain intact,'' Shuster said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's lawyer, Stephen Delinsky of Boston, said that the case
against Ms. Eppard and Clark was weak from the start and that the
result was ``a huge victory for Ann Eppard and Vernon Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's lawyer, Barry Simon of Washington, could not be reached
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eppard's lawyer, Richard Egbert of Boston, called his client
``a dedicated person and a very decent human being.'' He said the
misdemeanor to which she pleaded involved technical violations _
accepting meals, lodging and entertainment from Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stands vindicated of any willful or intentional violation
of the law,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Stern disagreed. He said his office had been hobbled by a
Supreme Court ruling last April that simply giving gifts to an
official, without a demonstrated link between the gifts and an
official's actions, did not constitute illegal gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling involved an investigation into the actions of former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who had been accused of taking
illegal gifts from a California agricultural cooperative. The
Supreme Court agreed with a federal appeals court, which had
overturned a verdict against the cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   In a wider investigation, Espy was cleared of all charges.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Dividends Bedevil Retiree 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I have a 401(k) plan with Wells Fargo, my former employer. All
the money is invested in a fund consisting entirely of Wells stock.
The quarterly dividends were automatically reinvested in more stock
until recently. Then I was surprised to receive a large check
representing my dividend, along with a note stating that this would
happen every quarter from now on. It said that I can't reinvest the
money in the plan and that the dividends are taxable income, but
that I will not be subject to the 10 percent penalty for early
withdrawal from a tax-deferred plan. I would have preferred to stay
with the tax-deferred dividend reinvestment plan. What are my
options?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Paula Rowe, a benefits manager with Wells Fargo, says the change
was made to give Wells Fargo a `'very significant'' tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tax code, she notes, dividend distributions to
retirees from an employee stock ownership plan _ which your 401(k)
is _ can be deducted from income in determining corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   By taking advantage of this deduction, Rowe says, Wells has been
able to set aside more money for matching-dollar contributions to
the plan. It now will match up to 6 percent of salary each year,
compared with 4 percent previously. As a result, future retirees
will wind up with more retirement money.
</P>
<P>
   But that is small consolation for you, because you already are
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe points out that you can shift your assets to another Wells
fund if you are unhappy with the present arrangement. Wells
provides a dozen alternative funds that will reinvest your
dividends rather than send them to you.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that these are diversified funds _ not invested
strictly in Wells Fargo stock. As a general rule, diversification
is good for investors. But if you think Wells, without reinvested
dividends, is going to perform significantly better than a
diversified portfolio with reinvested dividends, then you will want
to stick with your present fund. Also, bear in mind that you can
reinvest your Wells dividends yourself _ after taxes _ by
purchasing Wells stock from your broker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; No Escaping Capital Gain
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I am a Canadian citizen. Many years ago, while living in the
United States as a resident alien, I invested in a U.S. mutual
fund. Later, I lived for seven years in Canada. I have returned to
the United States, again as a resident alien, and have just sold my
fund shares, realizing a capital gain. Do I have to pay U.S. income
tax on the portion of the gain that was achieved while I was living
in Canada? Also, does the fact that I lived in Canada affect my
acquisition date for tax purposes?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The U.S. tax code requires people living in the United States to
pay tax on their income, regardless of the source. The fact that
you moved in and out of the country in years gone by doesn't affect
your liability for taxes on income received while you are living in
this country, according to Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse
Weller.
</P>
<P>
   Because you took the capital gain while living here, the gain is
subject to U.S. tax. Whatever portion of the gain accrued during
your stay in Canada is irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Your acquisition date for tax purposes is simply the date on
which you purchased the shares. Whether you have been to Canada,
Nepal or the moon in the meantime doesn't change that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Retiring on $12 Million
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; q  &LR;  Q: I am 45 years old and retired. I have no debt and my annual
expenses total $125,000. I am curious to know whether my asset
allocation seems adequate to sustain my lifestyle until age 90.
Here are my assets: a house, appraised at $3 million, with the
mortgage paid off; $5 million in a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
fund; $2 million in a tax-free fund; $2 million in municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I am flattered to receive your question. People with a
net worth of $12 million are likely to have dozens of high-powered
financial advisers and brokers camped on their lawn, waiting to
make a pitch. Have you looked out the window lately?
</P>
<P>
   Barring some catastrophe that decimates your holdings, your
fortune should be plenty large enough to tide you over for the next
45 years. Assuming that your annual expenses grow at an inflation
rate of 3 percent per year _ a reasonable expectation, though not
certain _ you would need a total of somewhat more than $11 million
to pay your bills from now to age 90. You already have more than
that _ including your house _ in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Reckoning in tomorrow's dollars, you almost certainly have much
more than you need, because your investments should grow
considerably during the next 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Consider your S&AMP;P 500 fund alone. If it were to grow at an
average annual rate of 10 percent per year, it would be worth more
than $300 million by 2044.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to withdraw 5 percent of the amount in your S&AMP;P fund
each year to meet expenses _ probably more than you will need _ you
would wind up with more thmillion in the fund at age 90,
again assuming a 10 percent annual growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   So relax and enjoy the next 45 years. Then, relax and enjoy 90
more years. You should be able to afford it.
</P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 Most Insurance Inadequate to Rebuild Your Home  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If a fire were to level your house tomorrow, do you think your
homeowners insurance would cover the full cost of rebuilding it?
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area construction costs have soared in recent years. The
long-standing rule of thumb that home replacement costs an average
of $85 to $125 per square foot _ depending on the complexity of the
structure, the quality of building materials and the contours of
the lot _ has been rudely updated to $125 to $250 per square foot
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, most insurance companies in California
have capped their potential liability for fires and other
devastating losses by eliminating guaranteed replacement coverage _
the obligation to pay the full cost of rebuilding your house, no
matter what. Even some homeowners who should know better neglect to
keep a watchful eye on their insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Walker, a prominent San Francisco architect, says he
recently increased the policy limit on his 89-year-old Cow Hollow
house by $400,000 _ but only after his insurance agent called his
attention to the huge difference between the coverage and the
probable replacement cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way _ even as an architect calling in favors _ to
replace that house with the same quality of materials for less than
$300 per square foot,'' he says. ``The policy limits were set at
$160.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of full-replacement policies is part of a nationwide
movement by insurers to avoid catastrophic losses, particularly in
high-risk regions such as California, with its fires and
earthquakes, or Florida and Louisiana, which are prey to
devastating hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Most private insurers in California got out of the earthquake
business a few years ago, shifting the burden of that coverage onto
the state-created California Earthquake Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The CEA will nominally insure you for the full replacement value
of your home if you set the policy limit high enough. But you don't
really get full coverage, because quake policies carry a large
deductible _ 15 percent of the home's value in the case of a
bare-bones CEA policy, or 10 percent if you pay extra for the
agency's new supplemental coverage.
</P>
<P>
   You still can get full coverage against fire in California, but
you have to take an active role by requesting policy limits that
will cover your potential costs in a disaster. Most insurers will
pay only the limits stated on the policies _ plus, in some cases, a
certain percentage beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The net result: Many of the region's homes _ perhaps most _ are
grossly underinsured.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Harding, an editor with the Marshall &AMP; Swift Valuation
Service in Los Angeles, blames the soaring building costs mainly on
a shortage of materials _ especially such major components as
drywall, plywood, lumber and cement.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation has been aggravated by rising interest rates,
which boost the cost of construction loans, and by a Bay Area
remodeling boom that has tipped the balance of supply and demand
decisively in favor of the region's contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Probably most homeowners aren't yet aware of the substantial
cost increases. Few of them rebuild or remodel their homes often,
and most have other things to do besides monitoring
construction-industry statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact you must monitor the situation closely if you hope
to financially survive the destruction of your home. Experts say
that only 3 percent of home fires result in total &LR;   &LR; destruction _
but try telling that to the nearly 3,000 families who suffered
total losses in the 1991 Oakland hills firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be prepared for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bob Rivinius, chief executive of the California Building
Industry Association in Sacramento: ``We can reasonably expect that
the price of construction will go up every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Macandan, a spokeswoman for the Western Insurance
Information Service, suggests that you consult a construction
engineer every year before renewing your homeowners policy, to make
sure you are fully covered.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of rebuilding exceeds your policy limit, ask your
insurance agent to raise the limit; the few extra dollars you pay
in premiums will seem well worth it if disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that policy limits didn't necessarily matter.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers routinely offered guaranteed replacement coverage
_ a promise to pay the full amount needed to rebuild your house to
the same specifications as the original structure. The stated
limits on those policies were used strictly as a reference in
determining the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   A few insurers, such as the California State Automobile
Assocaition and Farmers Insurance, still offer guaranteed
replacement coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At Farmers, says spokesman Kenneth Adams, you have to be careful
to ask for add-on ``endorsements'' to the standard policy to get
guaranteed replacement.
</P>
<P>
   At CSAA, however, guaranteed replacement is the standard type of
policy, says Marjorie Berte, the vice president for underwriting.
Practically every customer has one.
</P>
<P>
   Berte says the annual premium rates on the CSAA policy vary
widely _ from $1 to $9 per $1,000 of rebuilding costs, depending on
how elaborate the structure is, and also on such considerations as
the proximity of the nearest firehouse and fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   More common is the coverage offered by State Farm, the largest
homeowners insurer in the state, which dropped guaranteed
replacement coverage three years ago. It caps its coverage at 20
percent above the stated policy limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homeowner has to decide the limits,'' says State Farm
spokesman Bill Sirola. ``If the limits represent 100 percent of
value, there shouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The phaseout of guaranteed replacement coverage can be traced
back to the Oakland hills fire, experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, thousands of upscale homes needed to be replaced, and
there weren't enough contractors to handle the volume. Construction
prices skyrocketed, and insurance companies were forced to pay
through the nose to meet their obligations to their
guaranteed-replacement policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little-publicized flip side to that problem: Many
Oakland hills residents didn't have guaranteed replacement
coverage, even though it generally cost only a few dollars a year
more than standard coverage. The insurers held these homeowners to
the stated limits on their policies, paying far less than the
actual rebuilding costs.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Scott, an architect whose mother died when the Oakland
blaze consumed their home, says he wasn't even aware at the time
that he could have bought a guaranteed-replacement policy. His
insurance agent didn't bother to tell him, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Scott sued the agent and received an out-of-court settlement
from the insurance company. But he says the settlement fell
$150,000 short of the actual cost of rebuilding the house and
replacing his lost possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Oakland fire, the state Legislature
tried to prevent misunderstandings by passing a law requiring
insurance companies to list in writing all the different types of
homeowners policies they provide and to furnish the list to all
their customers and potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The list provided by Allstate, for example, says the company
provides guaranteed replacement coverage only for mobile homes.
Another Allstate policy insures regular homes for up to 150 percent
of the stated policy limits. Still another is fixed at 100 percent
of the limits.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates have complained that the disclosure form
_ a standardized document created by the state Insurance Department
_ is written in dense legalese, making it tough for the average
consumer to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I can't figure it out,'' claims insurance gadfly Harvey
Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights. ``I have to call my company and have them explain it. a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have a point. Consider this passage from the Allstate
list, describing something called ``actual cash value coverage'':
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of any covered loss to your home, the insurance
company will pay either the depreciated fair market value of the
damaged or destroyed dwelling at the time of the loss or the cost
of replacing or repairing the damaged or destroyed dwelling with
like or equivalent construction up to the policy limit.''
</P>
<P>
   If that brings you up short _ or if you have any other question
whatsoever about your homeowners coverage _ do as Rosenfield does.
Call your insurance agent and don't put the phone down again until
you get an explanation that you can fully understand.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Coast Guard abandoned the search for survivors of
EgyptAir Flight 990 in waters off Nantucket Island, Mass., on
Monday, but recovered a large piece of the plane and detected
submerged pinging signals, apparently from one of the black boxes,
whose retrieval could explain the jetliner's mysterious plunge into
the sea.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of what was expected to be a sprawling,
complex inquiry lasting months or years, investigators analyzed
radar tracks of the doomed plane, questioned potential witnesses,
attended to organizational tasks, set up headquarters in Rhode
Island and even pursued a lead in a Los Angeles hotel where the
crew had stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The large questions _ whether acts of sabotage, mechanical
failure or human error lay behind the disaster _ remained
unanswered. But the recovery of some wreckage and the chance that
the flight-data and cockpit voice recorders might soon be found
appeared to represent significant early progress.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aspects of the early investigation, numerous facts
begged for interpretation and elaboration _ the meaning of the
radar tracks, for example, and the size and significance of the
wreckage found _ but no immediate conclusions were forthcoming from
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dedicated to finding the cause of this tragedy,'' James
Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,
said at a news briefing in Newport, R.I. ``Factual information may
not be developed as quickly as the press may like,'' he said, but
he added that the American and Egyptian people would be kept
abreast of all the relevant facts.
</P>
<P>
   In an inquiry that will undoubtedly produce many leads, an
intriguing one surfaced Monday. A law-enforcement official said the
FBI was checking a report that an EgyptAir 990 crew member had
complained to the management of a hotel where the crew stayed that
a briefcase had been tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   Agents took a bomb-sniffing dog to the room where the crew
member stayed, and it reacted to a bag of sugar near a coffee
maker. The sugar and some loose wires found in the room were sent
to FBI labs in Washington for analysis. At the moment,
investigators do not believe that there was ever a bomb or bomb
materials in the room. They said they were not attaching much
significance to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials reiterated on Monday that they had
no evidence of terrorism in the EgyptAir case. A review of the
plane's cargo manifest suggested nothing out of the ordinary: it
listed computer and dental equipment, aircraft spare parts for
EgyptAir, and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which was taking a clearly subordinate role to the
safety board, assigned more than 600 agents to the inquiry, many
from its New York, Los Angeles and Newark, N.J., field offices.
Hundreds of additional state and local law-enforcement officials
were involved, as well as others from the Defense Department, the
Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   While a review of recent intelligence data collected by national
security agencies and eavesdropping techniques had unearthed
nothing yet to suggest any criminal threat against the plane, one
senior official noted that more than 30 Egyptian military officers
had been on the flight, along with some diplomats, and that their
presence might have increased the risk of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of investigators involved was suggestive. ``We
wouldn't be doing this if it was abundantly clear that it was an
accident,'' the senior official said. But he added, ``We don't
really know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the investigators had already interviewed baggage
handlers, caterers, mechanics, ground crews, drivers of fuel
trucks, customer-service workers and others who had come in contact
with the plane and its occupants in recent days. ``Everyone seems
to have checked out and everyone cooperated,'' said Robert Kelly,
director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Monday was devoted to getting organized, an effort that
centered on Quonset Point, R.I. A morgue was set up for the remains
of the victims, and a hangar was selected to house the wreckage of
the plane, which may be pieced together in months ahead. And
accommodation was being arranged in a motel for families of the
victims, some of whom were flown in from New York on Monday. Other
relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo, Egypt, in
flights on Tuesday and Thursday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation developed, the Coast Guard shifted the
focus of its search from finding victims to recovering their
remains, along with their effects and the remnants of their
shattered aircraft. It was a day of wrenching emotions for the
families of the 217 people who went down with the plane early
Sunday, for it meant the abandonment of hope that they could still
be alive.
</P>
<P>
   With life expectancy in the chilly 58-degree Atlantic limited to
five or six hours, officials directing search operations
acknowledged Monday afternoon what had been fairly obvious for a
day _ that there was no longer any hope for the victims, 199
passengers and 18 employees of EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe at this point it is in everyone's interests to no
longer expect that we will find survivors in this case,'' Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee said at a news conference in Newport 35 hours
after the aircraft went down. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with
these victims and their families. It is now a search-and-recovery
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee noted that only one body had been recovered on Sunday
and that by Monday only the partial remains of other victims had
been found in what he termed a saturation sea-and-air search of a
36-square-mile area around what is believed to be the aircraft's
splashdown point, about 52 miles south of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   EgyptAir 990, a twin-engine Boeing 767 that had come in from Los
Angeles, took off from Kennedy International Airport at 1:19 a.m.
Sunday for what was to be an 11-hour nonstop flight to Cairo. It
was cruising at 33,000 feet in a clear night sky 31 minutes later
when, without warning or signal of distress from the cockpit, it
went into a two-minute plunge and crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing search, involving a half-dozen Coast Guard cutters
and a dozen planes and helicopters, found an abundance of debris
from the plane, Larrabee said. He cited seats, seat cushions, a
wheel, clothing, personal papers, two partly inflated life rafts
and two emergency chutes. None showed evidence of scorching,
suggesting that there had been no fiery explosion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the searchers on Monday had also recovered ``a
significant piece of the aircraft floating on the surface.'' He did
not specify its size, but called it ``a large piece of the aircraft
structure,'' so large that it had to be hoisted by a crane onto the
deck of the Coast Guard cutter Juniper.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Larrabee nor Hall would characterize the significance of
the object. But it seemed to confirm that the aircraft had come
apart, either in the air or upon impact with the ocean.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The admiral also announced that searchers had detected a pinger
signal, apparently from the plane's flight data recorder or the
cockpit voice recorder. The vessels currently involved in the
search were not equipped to pinpoint the signal's location,
presumably on the ocean floor, but Navy ships arriving overnight
would have such equipment, he said, raising hope that one of the
black boxes might be recovered in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a 24-hour machine capable of holding
all the airplane's technical data, from speed and direction to
orientation, rate of fuel consumption and the exact positions of
all rudders, ailerons and other moving parts. The cockpit voice
recorder, fed by three microphones, has a 30-minute tape, and could
reveal what was said by the pilots throughout most of the flight,
especially in the crucial last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crash of EgyptAir 990 was in some ways reminiscent of
that of Trans World Airlines 800 in July 1996 _ both fell into the
Atlantic shortly after leaving Kennedy Airport _ there were also
major differences. TWA 800 blew up in midair, while there is as yet
no evidence of any explosion aboard the Egyptian plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, officials said Monday, the recovery operations for EgyptAir
990 are going to be substantially different. The plane's watery
grave off Nantucket is 240 to 270 feet deep, twice the depth of the
water off the south Shore of Long Island, where TWA 800 went down.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover the water off Nantucket is much colder now than the
summertime waters where the TWA wreckage was raised. And the TWA
recovery site was close to shore, while the EgyptAir site is over
50 miles offshore, compounding the difficulties of diving,
recovering parts of the plane and transporting them to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the advancing season of autumn. Larrabee
noted Monday that rain and high winds were expected to buffet the
search area Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Navy's Norfolk-based ship USS Grapple was
expected to arrive Tuesday with a remotely operated submersile
vehicle that would be used to locate debris underwater. In
addition, the navy ship USS Mohawk, from Philadelphia, was
expected. It has sonar equipment that would enable the Navy to
create a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor and objects
resting on it.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the Egyptian aircraft is believed to be resting
on the bottom near the site of several shipwrecks including the
luxury liner Andrea Doria, which sank in July 1956, after colliding
with the Swedish ship Stockholm. The sea floor in the area is
believed to be relatively smooth, so objects would be more readily
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty relatives and friends of the crash victims arrived in
Newport on a chartered flight from New York on Monday afternoon and
were met by two buses that took them to the Newport Islander
Doubletree Hotel, a secluded place on a small island off Newport.
They did not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But George Arian, the publisher of a small Arabic newspaper in
New Jersey who said he was acting as an unofficial spokesman for
the group, said, ``Everyone was weeping and crying on the plane,
and the Red Cross people talked to them.'' He said about 100
relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo and would
also be put up at the hotel.

LAKERS EXPECT SLOW START, HOPE FOR FAST FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under Phil Jackson, the Los Angeles Lakers are all
about geometry, so grab a protractor, a compass and maybe the
nearest abacus and try to process this bit of mathematical reality:
The presumably improved Lakers could go .500 in the first month of
the season ... and be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, they might not post a winning month until sometime after
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And if that doesn't sound logical _ the idea a perennially
dominant team can add the winningest coach in NBA history and
expect !ital!mediocrity!off! in the win-loss column _ then you can
empathize with all those contorted faces in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has brought credentials and expectations. But he has
also brought humility to a once-cocky team.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, all eyes are still on the championship. But for
once, the Lakers acknowledge just how much they need to do to get
there. The installation of Jackson's triangle offense has been
shaky, and that alone has forced everyone from Shaquille O'Neal to
Kobe Bryant to accept that becoming champions is a learning
process, and that they are but neophytes.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Laker Paradigm, suddenly ``patience'' is the
buzzword.
</P>
<P>
   And how about this? The Lakers actually admitting they can't
just steamroll through the league. That they might even lose more
games than they'll win in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be real rocky,'' said Lakers veteran Robert
Horry. ``There's going to be a lot of people booing. But they've
got to realize this offense, a lot of guys don't really have a hold
of it yet, and they're not really comfortable with it. And a lot of
times, you'll be second-guessing yourself and that takes away from
your game, and that carries over to the defensive end. It's just
like a big snowball effect, it just messes up your whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched the Lakers go 3-5 in the exhibition season
could see that. For now, there's no reason to expect the first few
weeks of the real season will be much different. But Horry believes
that might be an odd sort of blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different, but I think it will be good for
us. That way nobody has a lot of expectations put on them. Guys
just go out and play, and there's a lot of teams that are picked
before us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like the Utah Jazz, which the Lakers face in tonight's
opener at Salt Lake City. And the Trail Blazers, who the Lakers
play in Portland on Saturday. In fact, six of their first nine
opponents are probable playoff teams, Houston and Phoenix among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers' challenge of assimilating a new offense,
a new coaching philosophy and a half-dozen new players will be
further exacerbated by the loss of Bryant, out another three weeks
or so because of a broken right hand.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, has caused panic in the ranks, and that's
a reflection of the Lakers' new coach. Jackson is intense but
cerebral, and a five-year contract gives him the latitude to be
relaxed about the prospect of losing games. He's also been through
this many times before, even with the Chicago Bulls, even during
their championship seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to struggle to start, and I figure if we're 5-5 in
November, I think we'll be happy at some point when we're at that
level,'' Jackson said. ``The idea is to build momentum during the
course of the season and finish really strong. And that's all that
matters to us, really. Whether we win 40, 50 or 60 games, if you
build the momentum at the end of the season, you're going to have
the type of team you want to go into the playoffs with. It really
doesn't matter beyond that, because you can still win championships
in this league just by making the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty wins is still Jackson's goal, but a lot of things will
have to go right. O'Neal will have to stay healthy, because he has
no solid backup. An odd collection of less-than-ideal power
forwards will have to suffice until the Lakers can swing a trade,
probably for Detroit's Bison Dele. Glen Rice will have to find a
way to make jump shots in an offense that doesn't seem to suit him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the West has only gotten better, and the
Lakers' path to the Finals will be tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, the Lakers won 61 games, reached the conference
finals and were swept by Utah. Last season, they were swept out of
the semifinals by San Antonio. Now, they start a season without
having added a significant talent, save for the gray-bearded man at
the end of the bench (Jackson, not John Salley).
</P>
<P>
   But they're arguably no better a team than the one embarrassed
by the Spurs. ``Not yet,'' O'Neal conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys are just still nervous and a little timid about
not making a mistake,'' O'Neal said. ``I think by January we should
be able to tell where we are as a team .... Patience is the best
virtue, but that word's not in my dictionary, so I don't know what
it means. But the reality of the situation is we are going to have
to have patience.''
</P>
<P>
   And if O'Neal sounds a bit more conservative than the
smack-talking ``Superman'' of the past few years, then maybe that's
the first sign of the new coach's influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think I'm going to panic,'' Jackson said. ``And I
think if I don't panic, the players will remain calm. They'll be
very comfortable that we have confidence in what we do, and we know
how to run this and we know how to get it done. If they stay matter
of fact about their business, which is learning the skills and
executing the things that have to be done, they'll do all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, that is.

PRESIDENT BRADLEY WOULD EARN FAR LESS THAN CITIZEN BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Bradley, author, lecturer and consultant,
would have to take a substantial pay cut if the American people
accepted his offer and elected him president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the former senator and basketball player, made more
than $5.3 million in 1997 and 1998. His federal income tax returns
for those two years reveal that he wasted little time after his
departure from the Senate in January 1997 in turning his celebrity
and 18 years of political contacts into lucrative speaking and
consulting income.
</P>
<P>
   His 1997 adjusted gross income was $2.7 million, more than half
of it from speeches and consulting fees. He earned $300,000 from
media appearances, book royalties and visiting professorships at
the University of Maryland, Stanford University and Montclair State
University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bradley reported gross income of $2.6 million from many
of the same sources, with the addition of $300,000 in consulting
fees from Morgan Guaranty Trust and J.P. Morgan and $131,000 from
the Gartner Group, a Connecticut telecommunications concern.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information in the tax returns was disclosed in May,
when Bradley filed his personal financial statement with the
Federal Election Commission. But the Bradley campaign made the
complete returns available in the last week in response to
reporters' inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, Bradley's campaign press spokesman, said he would
allow the returns to speak for themselves. ``We're not interpreting
it,'' Hauser said. Congress last month doubled the president's
salary, to $400,000 a year. The increase takes effect after
President Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's incom both years included pension payments of about
$90,000 from the National Basketball Association and the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his wife, Ernestine Schlant Bradley, reported
charitable gifts of $39,462 in 1997 and $38,041 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gifts in 1997 included $500 to Princeton University, Bradley's
alma mater; $1,500 to the public library in Montclair, N.J.; $1,000
to Barrios Unidos, a Latino community group, and $250 to the
National Civic League.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Bradleys contributed $1,000 to the Harlem
Educational Activity Fund ; $1,050 to the Newark Do Something Fund;
$900 to Give Kids the World and $1,025 to Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   In both years, by far the largest recipient of the Bradleys'
largess was the St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Newark, N.J. In 1997, they gave the church 500 shares of
appreciated NationsBank stock worth $31,859; in 1998, they donated
500 shares of BankAmerica stock with a value of $28,016.

FOUR MEDIA ACCEPTS BUYOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; BURBANK _ Post-production specialist Four Media Co., in a major
boost to its fortunes, announced Monday it has agreed to be
acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp. affiliate Liberty Media for $246.7 million
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, due to close in the first quarter of 2000, gives Four
Media stockholders a rich payout with shares valued at $12.48 _
more than double their price at the close of trading Friday. The
company's shares jumped $4.6925 to $10.75 on Monday, a 77 percent
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Walston, who founded
Burbank-based Four Media six years ago, said in a statement the
deal will be a catalyst for creation and delivery of new forms of
entertainment and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, operated by cable mogul John Malone, has been on the
acquisition trail in recent months and agreed last week to buy
hotel pay-per-view programming specialist Ascent Entertainment for
more than $500 million. In late July, Liberty bought two other
major Hollywood ``post'' houses _ Todd-AO and Soundeluxe _ in
separate deals worth a combined $162 million.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, which had 1998 revenue of $1.56 billion, also has
investments in QVC, Discovery Channel and USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which grew partly through an aggressive acquisition
strategy of its own with the goal of becoming a ``one-stop shop''
for all post-production services, sold 51 percent of itself earlier
this year in an $80 million deal worth $7.85 a share to Wall Street
investment firm Warburg Pincus. Walston, Warburg Pincus and Fleming
Asset Management _ owners of 70 percent of Four Media's shares _
have endorsed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which has more than 1,300 employees, also reported
Monday a loss of $2 million for its fourth quarter ended Aug. 1 due
to the expense of a stock offering. Cash flow was off 4.2 percent
to $8.1 million compared with the 1998 period while revenues rose
40.7 percent to $48 million.

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM COLLEGE IN MISSISSIPPI TO CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news that Walter Payton died Monday at his home in a suburb
of Chicago came not so much as a shock but as a sorrowful, piercing
spike. We were prepared last February by the shock of seeing the
once robust Payton looking gaunt and frail as he announced that he
suffered from a rare liver disease. Now we mourn a family's loss of
a father and husband, and the industry's loss of a great athlete. I
mourn the loss of a shared past, life petals that peel away each
time someone contemporary dies.
</P>
<P>
   I was not close to Walter Payton, but rather attached to him.
</P>
<P>
   We first met 28 years ago this month, on Nov. 13, 1971. This was
the sort of one-on-one introduction that defensive backs dread and
outstanding running backs love. We met at the 10-yard line in
Mississippi Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This was before Payton became Sweetness; before he became a
Chicago Bear; before we were paid for plying our particular crafts.
We met in the rarefied atmosphere of black college football. He was
a freshman at Jackson State University in Mississippi; I was a
senior at Morgan State in Baltimore. It was an intersectional game
between once-beaten, once-tied opponents. We had beaten Jackson
State a year earlier at RFK Stadium in Washington, and now it was
our turn to go to the Deep South, deeper than I'd ever been. I was
intrigued by Mississippi, the state so tied to civil rights
history. All our coach kept talking about was that these Southern
boys were still fighting the Civil War: the South thought it was
better than the North, and when it came to football, heartier,
better and tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State had a great football legacy: Willie Richardson,
Gloster Richardson, Ernie Richardson, Tom Richardson, Verlon Biggs,
Harold Jackson, Richard Caster, Lem Barney. This particular year it
had Jerome Barkum, a wide receiver, Robert Brazile, a linebacker,
and Eddie Payton, Walter's older brother, who became a great punt
returner and then a professional golfer. Walter began the year
unknown, playing behind his brother. By November he was still
playing behind his brother but was Jackson State's secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   My recollection of the game is reduced to one poignant frame _
that first meeting at the 10-yard line. A sweep with Payton slicing
past the line, over the linebackers and finally into the secondary.
There was Payton, there was me; I attempted a tackle and felt solid
contact, then felt him bounce back to the outside. What I remember
thinking at the moment was that he had great balance, like a
gyroscope, when he was nearly horizontal, legs still churning. He
was rushing toward the National Football League; I was not doing
such a good job of tackling but was recording the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Years later in Chicago I teased him about Morgan State's victory
in 1970. Payton reminded me that we had won that game when he was
still in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Payton represents so much to so many. He carried the banner of
black college football to an unprecedented level. To one extent or
another we all carried a burden of proof. One success reflected
well on the group. Individual success was group success, even if
the player went to a different institution. Like when Grambling
sent eight players to the NFL one season, or now when Mike Strahan,
who played at Texas Southern, runs in with the winning touchdown.
Payton was an object of such pride. His success felt good and warm.
</P>
<P>
   He held so many NFL records. He set the career record for
rushing yards, 16,726; for career attempts, 3,838; for rushing
yards in a game, 275; for seasons with 1,000 or more yards, 10. He
broke Jim Brown's NFL career rushing mark, 12,312 yards, in Chicago
on Oct. 7, 1984, the same day he broke Brown's mark of 58 100-yard
rushing games.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Robert Hughes, the Jackson State head coach, who was
an assistant coach in 1971, put Payton in perspective. ``What's
most memorable to me is when he started getting on a roll and
started after Jim Brown's record,'' Hughes said. ``Brown was the
greatest running back of all time. He didn't come from a
predominantly black school; he's from Syracuse. When Walter came in
from a little school in Mississippi to top all that, that's what
made it great.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Payton, with the aggressive, elusive style that was
formed at Jackson State. The NFL's career rushing leader. The
runner who led Chicago to its only Super Bowl victory. Dead so
young, at 45. &QL;

FOUR MEDIA ACCEPTS BUYOUT

<P>
   &LR; BURBANK _ Post-production specialist Four Media Co., in a major
boost to its fortunes, announced Monday it has agreed to be
acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp. affiliate Liberty Media for $246.7 million
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, due to close in the first quarter of 2000, gives Four
Media stockholders a rich payout with shares valued at $12.48 _
more than double their price at the close of trading Friday. The
company's shares jumped $4.6925 to $10.75 on Monday, a 77 percent
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Walston, who founded
Burbank-based Four Media six years ago, said in a statement the
deal will be a catalyst for creation and delivery of new forms of
entertainment and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, operated by cable mogul John Malone, has been on the
acquisition trail in recent months and agreed last week to buy
hotel pay-per-view programming specialist Ascent Entertainment for
more than $500 million. In late July, Liberty bought two other
major Hollywood ``post'' houses _ Todd-AO and Soundeluxe _ in
separate deals worth a combined $162 million.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, which had 1998 revenue of $1.56 billion, also has
investments in QVC, Discovery Channel and USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which grew partly through an aggressive acquisition
strategy of its own with the goal of becoming a ``one-stop shop''
for all post-production services, sold 51 percent of itself earlier
this year in an $80 million deal worth $7.85 a share to Wall Street
investment firm Warburg Pincus. Walston, Warburg Pincus and Fleming
Asset Management _ owners of 70 percent of Four Media's shares _
have endorsed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Four Media, which has more than 1,300 employees, also reported
Monday a loss of $2 million for its fourth quarter ended Aug. 1 due
to the expense of a stock offering. Cash flow was off 4.2 percent
to $8.1 million compared with the 1998 period while revenues rose
40.7 percent to $48 million.

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Fashion Ads in National Geographic &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Flip through the November issue of National Geographic _ past
the images of a posthurricane Tegucigalpa, Honduras; a militia
march in Iraq; a mating dance of the Karo people of Ethiopia _ and
you will see a picture of a woman who seems as out of place in the
pages of this publication as she might at a Weight Watchers
meeting. She is the British model Stella Tennant, and she is
featured in an ad for Helmut Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, who considers National Geographic his favorite
publication, has never taken a conventional approach to
advertising. When he opened his SoHo store in 1997, he bought ads
on the top of taxicabs, that most populist of venues. And he
prefers to buy ad pages in magazines like Vibe and Artforum rather
than Harper's Bazaar or Vogue. He has favored Robert Mapplethorpe
images in his campaigns rather than pictures of his clothes. Now,
Lang is the first fashion advertiser to appear in the U.S. edition
of National Geographic, which typically runs ads for cars and
flood-relief groups and might not attract more chic-minded factions
of the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that the sheer size of National Geographic's
readership _ there are eight million subscribers worldwide _ means
that among the many who want to read about African marriage
rituals, there must also be some who see the logic of spending
$1,200 on a simple wool coat. Richard Kirshenbaum, a co-founder of
the ad agency Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP; Partners, which does not handle
Lang's account, says National Geographic readers are an educated,
well-traveled lot who might easily fall into Lang's
``psychographic.'' Reaching them comes at no small cost, though. A
page in the magazine costs about $170,000, about four times what it
might be in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``With National Geographic the great thing about it is it's so
not fashion,'' said Jonny Lichtenstein, Lang's advertising
director. Lichtenstein, who said there will be Lang ads in National
Geographic every month through 2000, enjoys the fact that Lang ads
stand out more there than they might otherwise. In a magazine
replete with fashion ads, ``you can get lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ex-Barneys Chief Is Now at Vanity Fair &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While readers may not be seeing an ad for Barneys New York in
National Geographic anytime soon, they might soon be feeling,
however faintly, the influence of its former chief, Gene Pressman,
in the pages of another magazine, Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Vanity Fair named Pressman, who was the store's
co-chief executive until it filed for bankruptcy in 1996, a
contributing editor of the magazine. Like other celebrities and
quasi-celebrities on mastheads _ Shoshanna Lonstein at
Cosmopolitan, Gayfryd Steinberg at Vogue _ Pressman will not be
expected to go about town with a steno pad in search of scoops.
Instead, he will apparently share his thoughts on fashion and
society with the magazine's editors. ``I could be the eyes and ears
culturally for the magazine,'' he said. ``They have other people to
do that, too, obviously, but I can contribute. Magazines are like
think tanks.'' He added, ``A lot of it will be impromptu _ that's
how ideas are generated.''
</P>
<P>
   Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair's editor, said that he and Pressman
had been friends until they had a falling out over a critical story
that Vanity Fair ran about the financial troubles of Barneys. Then
a few years ago, they ran into each other at a party for Steven T.
Florio, Conde Nast's chief executive, and reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire his eye, talent and passion,'' Carter said. ``Why not
bring him to the magazine and try him for a year?'' He added after
a pause, ``He's up on the Internet and all its possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributors like Pressman are ``good door openers,'' Carter
said. ``A lot of a magazine's success depends on access.'' But it
is unclear what kind of access Pressman can provide that other
nonwriting contributors cannot, like Diane Von Furstenberg, Anne
McNally and Rupert Everett. Still, Pressman, appears to have a good
deal of time on his hands with which to do some door opening.
Although he has a consulting contract with Barneys, he described
his relationship with the current management of the store, founded
by his grandfather, as ``mellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been asked to do too much, and I haven't been doing
any complaining,'' he said. &QL;

DISNEY PLANNING HONG KONG EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 KONG-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; BURBANK _ Maybe the Walt Disney Co. can't straighten out ABC,
maybe its Disney Stores are getting stale and apparently its Club
Disney concept wasn't popular enough to expand nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Disney's two core businesses _ amusement
parks and family movies _ Disney remains the best. That's why Hong
Kong officials are willing to spend billions of dollars to develop
the latest Disney amusement park, and why Burbank-based Disney will
only hpony up what's believed to be $200 million to $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal certainly speaks highly to the power of the Disney
brand,'' said Peter Chernack, president of a Burbank-based
theme-park design firm. ``The fact that Disney is a global brand
and the fact that they have the ability to work out an agreement
with the Chinese government is very exciting. Disney is very much
in a leadership position so this bodes well for the rest of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers noted Monday, in the hours before the
official announcement late Monday of a deal between Disney and Hong
Kong officials to open a park in 2005, that building a Hong Kong
version of Disneyland makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that it's important from a long-term outlook for
Disney to get a foothold in Southeast Asia as the standard of
living goes up,'' said Linda Bannister, an entertainment analyst
with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``As people's disposable incomes grow in
that part of the world, Disney is counting on them spending some of
that money on Disney products.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and consultants agree that Hong Kong's battered economy
is not ready for a theme park at this point but could be in another
six to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about getting ahead of the curve,'' said Dennis
Speigel, chief of International Theme Park Services. ``This is a
`plant our flag and run it up the flagpole' approach. I think
Disney will take its time because this market is not going to be
ready to support a theme park for another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Hong Kong has been under active consideration for
several years and chairman Michael Eisner indicated in his message
to shareholders in early 1999 that there would eventually be a
Disney theme park in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Disney looked at a lot of options,'' said
theme-park con Harrison Price. ``It doesn't defy common
sense that this is the step they're taking. They have done very
well in Japan, so in some ways this is just a geographic
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Green-lighting the Hong Kong project also comes at a time when
Disney has been cost-cutting in other operations in response to
intense pressure to improve financial performance and lift its
stock price. But the theme-parks segment of the corporation has
continued to generate better results in recent years than Disney's
creative content and broadcasting divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Committing to Hong Kong is not a contradiction of its
corporate strategy,'' Bannister said. ``They have been cutting in
areas where they do not see good returns but this area has a lot of
long-term potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister noted that analysts generally support Disney's
investments in the Internet for similar reasons. ``There is not a
lot of money to be made right now but that should change down the
road,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong park, which will be built on reclaimed land near
the massive new airport on Lantau Island, would be Disney's fifth
overseas theme park. Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 and will add a
Disney Seas attraction in 2001; Euro Disney opened near Paris in
1992 and is planning a movie studio attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Speigel, who has advised a variety of theme-park builders on
projects in mainland China, stressed Disney should avoid cutting
corners in the new project. ``Only the highest level of quality
will do,'' he added. ``People in Hong Kong are very sophisticated
and always up on the latest developments.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of designing the new theme park will most likely be
performed under the direction of Glendale-based Walt Disney
Imagineering, which recently announced plans for an ambitious
makeover of its headquarters into a ``creative campus'' that would
also see its first new buildings in 2005.

FOOTBALL REMEMBERS PAYTON, THE ULTIMATE PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also OBIT-PAYTON, which moved in ``a'' category code) 
(jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon each National Football League team
received an e-mail message from the Chicago Bears. Many executives
knew what it said before they read it: Walter Payton, one of the
best ever to play running back, had died.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several days it had been rumored that Payton had
taken a turn for the worse, so the league was braced for th
Still, the announcement that Payton had succumbed to bile-duct
cancer at 45 rocked and deeply saddened the world of professional
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``His attitude for life, you wanted to be around him,'' said
Mike Singletary, a close friend who played with Payton from 1981 to
1987 on the Bears. Singletary read Scripture at Payton's side on
the morning of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of individual if you were down he would not
let you stay down,'' Singletary said.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the NFL family was devastated
by the loss of Payton. Tagliabue called him ``one of the greatest
players in the history of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tremendous grace and dignity he displayed in his final
months reminded us again why `Sweetness' was the perfect nickname
for Walter Payton,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In his 13 seasons with Chicago, Payton rushed for 16,726 yards
on 3,838 carries, still both NFL records. One of Payton's most
impressive feats was that he played in 189 of 190 games from 1975,
his first season, until his retirement in 1987. For someone with
Payton's style to participate and dominate in that many games _ he
enjoyed plowing into defenders and rarely ran out of bounds to
avoid a tackle _ is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best football player I've ever seen,'' said Saints
Coach Mike Ditka, who coached Payton for six seasons with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka added: ``At all positions, he's the best I've ever seen.
There are better runners than Walter, but he's the best football
player I ever saw. To me, that's the ultimate compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   What always amazed Payton's opponents was his combination of
grace and power. Payton once ran over a half-dozen players from the
Kansas City Chiefs, and on more than one occasion he sprinted by
speedy defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the NFL to see that Payton was special.
In 1977, his third season, Payton, standing 5 feet 10{ inches and
weighing 204 pounds, won the first of two most-valuable-player
awards after one of the best rushing seasons in league history. He
ran for 1,852 yards and 14 touchdowns. His 5.5 yards a carry that
season was a career best, and against Minnesota that season he ran
for 275 yards, a single-game record that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember always watching him and thinking, `How did he just
make that run?''' New York Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi
said. ``He was just a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi echoed the sentiments of others that Payton may not have
had the natural gifts of running back Barry Sanders or the
athleticism of Jim Brown, but that he made the most of what he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jim Brown is in a class by himself,'' Accorsi said.
``And then there are other great players right behind him like
Walter Payton.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was known as much for his kindness off the field as his
prowess on it. He was involved with a number of charities during
and after his NFL career, and although he valued his privacy he was
known for his kindness to people in the league whom he did not
know.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi saw Payton at the 1976 Pro Bowl, and even though it was
one of the first times the two had met, Payton told Accorsi, ``I
hope God blesses you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When some guys say stuff like that, you wonder if it is
phony,'' Accorsi said, ``but not with him. You could tell he was
very genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears fans in Chicago felt the same way, which is why reaction
to his death was swift and universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He to me is ranked with Joe Dimaggio in baseball _ he was the
epitome of class,'' said Hank Oettinger, a native of Chicago who
was watching coverage of Payton's death at a bar on the city's
North Side. ``The man was such a gentleman, and he would show it on
the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   Several fans broke down crying Monday as they called into a
Chicago television sports talk show and told of their thoughts on
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what made Payton special, Ditka said: ``It would have to
be being Walter Payton. He was so good for the team. He was the
biggest practical joker and he kept everyone loose. And he led by
example on the field. He was the complete player. He did
everything. He was the greatest runner, but he was also probably
the best blocking back you ever saw.'' &QL;

areas where they do not see good returns but this area has a lot of
long-term potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister noted that analysts generally support Disney's
investments in the Internet for similar reasons. ``There is not a
lot of money to be made right now but that should change down the
road,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong park, which will be built on reclaimed land near
the massive new airport on Lantau Island, would be Disney's fifth
overseas theme park. Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 and will add a
Disney Seas attraction in 2001; Euro Disney opened near Paris in
1992 and is planning a movie studio attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Speigel, who has advised a variety of theme-park builders on
projects in mainland China, stressed Disney should avoid cutting
corners in the new project. ``Only the highest level of quality
will do,'' he added. ``People in Hong Kong are very sophisticated
and always up on the latest developments.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of designing the new theme park will most likely be
performed under the direction of Glendale-based Walt Disney
Imagineering, which recently announced plans for an ambitious
makeover of its headquarters into a ``creative campus'' that would
also see its first new buildings in 2005.

U.S. SAID TO BE WORKING ON NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to file in `i' category)  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of secret exchanges with Beijing
over the past two weeks, the White House is racing to close a deal
by the end of this month that it hopes will pave China's way into
the World Trade Organization, even if Congress cannot pass judgment
on the agreement until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a phone call from President Clinton to President
Jiang Zemin late at night on Oct. 16, Washington and Beijing have
since engaged in what one official called an ``intense set of
interactions.'' Nonetheless, senior administration officials say
that there is only a 50-50 chance they will be able to close the
huge deal, which Clinton now views as his best shot at stabilizing
U.S. relations with China during his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has never publicly described that call, nor has
it described an internal strategy debate presided over by the White
House chief of staff, John Podesta, over how to close the elusive
deal. But according to Chinese and U.S. officials, Clinton offered
in the call to make the first move to break a long stalemate in the
talks, volunteering to send China's leaders the details of a deal
he characterized as Washington's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Those details have not been disclosed, but areas up for
discussion include telecommunications, financial services, textiles
and anti-dumping sanctions, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative reveals how desperately Clinton is attempting to
put back together the huge trade deal he walked away from in April,
a move his aides say he now deeply regrets.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the White House say that the deal offered in April
would still not satisfy the administration, one top official mused
last week, ``If we could get it again, we'd probably take it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment of maximum U.S. leverage to strike a deal is fast
approaching, as Clinton prepares to open a meeting of the world's
trade ministers in Seattle on Nov. 30. That session is expected to
set the agenda for a new round of global trade talks that will take
years _ and which China can influence only if it clearly is about
to join the group that sets the terms of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's conversation with Jiang, trade officials have
been working to put together a draft of an agreement, based on the
U.S. understanding of the deal that didn't happen in April. But the
process is made more difficult by continuing disagreements between
China and the United States about what concessions China's premier,
Zhu Rongji, brought with him on that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House's decision to publish a long list of
those concessions so inflamed some powerful Chinese business
executives and their political patrons that China has been forced
to pull back, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is no longer clear that China is still willing
to let U.S. firms own 51 percent of Chinese telecommunications
companies. But if the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, struck a deal that gave U.S. telecommunications firms
less of an inroad into the booming Chinese communications market,
she would have to make the case that she extracted other
concessions that went beyond China's offer in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly still want a deal and want it soon,'' one
administration official who has been in touch with the Chinese said
recently. ``But it's becoming clear it won't be exactly the same
deal. The politics have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mysteries that the White House has not yet solved is
whether Jiang is still committed to striking a deal, especially at
a moment when he is under growing economic pressure at home.
Clinton was clearly frustrated in New Zealand in early September,
when Jiang dragged his feet in restarting negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His Oct. 16 call was followed up a week later with a trip to
China by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. While Summers was not
sent to negotiate _ Jiang and the country's top trade negotiators
were all in Europe _ he saw Zhu and after a three-hour meeting
reported that the embattled prime minister was still committed and
eager for China to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure created by opening China's markets, Zhu
once again told Summers, would help spur China's own reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's political enemies have seized upon the list of
concessions that the White House published in April to help
undermine a deal. And U.S. diplomats say that China's leaders
appear concerned that in the last year of his presidency Clinton
lacks the clout to push the deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses would have to approve a change in the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which requires Congress to
review China's trade status annually, a vote that gives many in
Congress a chance to voice their disapproval of China's human
rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its ballooning trade
surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade status would be implicit in any deal that got
China into the World Trade Organization. But under one scenario now
being discussed in Ms. Barshefsky's office, the United States would
reach an agreement with China but would invoke a seldom-used
provision of the World Trade Organization's rules that would
prevent China from enjoying some of the trade benefits with the
United States until a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get a deal through Congress, even in an
election year,'' Rep. David Drier, the Republican who heads the
House Rules Committee, said in an interview last week. ``If
American industry says it's a good deal, I think that would be
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky is being unusually tight-lipped about the talks,
which would mark the biggest trade deal in her tenure and a major
part of Clinton's foreign-policy legacy. She does not want to
appear too eager to strike a deal, always a dangerous negotiating
position. And her influence in the White House remains murky: Her
advice that Clinton take the April deal was overruled, after Robert
Rubin _ the Treasury secretary at the time _ and other
administration officials said that it could not get through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday shefsky announced that she expected formal
negotiations with China to resume this month. ``We have got to
see,'' she said Monday, when asked about the possibility of a deal.
``I'm neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I'm actually a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of work to do as we look ahead,'' she
said, noting that China would also have to conclude deals with
Europe, Canada and Latin America, though those would probably
closely follow whatever agreement was struck with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials close to Ms. Barshefsky say she may travel to
China before the Seattle trade meeting if there is enough progress
to suggest that a deal could be wrapped up in time for Clinton to
announce it during the Seattle session.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky still has two big hurdles to clear.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is textiles: At a moment when the United States is
urging other countries to drop trade barriers, Ms. Barshefsky is
under pressure from members of Congress representing textile-making
states to force China to agree to an extension of import quotas and
tariffs on Chinese-made fabrics. The Chinese are resisting. But
they may agree in return for other concessions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the biggest stumbling-block: China's insistence
that the United States surrender its ability to invoke unilateral
trade sanctions against Chinese products that it determines are
being unfairly ``dumped'' at below-market prices in thd
States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a vital one for unions, which insist that
anti-dumping actions are critical to saving manufacturing jobs.
They are already putting pressure on Vice President Al Gore, who
has courted them assiduously, to protect their interests in any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his aides say, has no intention of getting near the
Seattle meeting.

NBA BEGINS A TRANSITION FROM PHYSICAL TO UP-TEMPO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After various New York Knicks had been whistled for
holding, grabbing and chucking with their forearms, the referees
conducting a clinic on the new rules during training camp last
month asked whether the players had any more questions regarding
what the league expected of them from now on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should be wearing tutus out there,'' one player said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999-2000 National Basketball Association opens Tuesday at
about the same time the door on aggressive physical play is
closing.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern wants and needs a more balletic style
of play and more points to be scored to sell his product _ and
fewer bullies to depress television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   From rule changes to personnel shake-ups, the league is the
middle of a transformation. Losing ground is the plodding
half-court style, which is being replaced by an up-tempo,
end-to-end running game. And it is not just the Sacramento Kings
and the nouveau Knicks. The fast break, dormant for much of the
1990s, is experiencing a sudden rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way everyone wants us to play, so I'll guess we'll
just have to deal with it,'' said Coach Pat Riley of the Heat,
whose brutish teams in New York and Miami were annually accused of
bringing down the league's quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not who we are,'' Riley said. ``It's not our identity.
And it will take us a while to adjust. But maybe it will be good
for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of declining scores and field-goal percentages,
and dramatically improved defense, something had to change. Michael
Jordan's former team, the Chicago Bulls, averaged a paltry 81.9
points a game last season, fewest in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Nine teams averaged fewer than 90 points a game, including the
Knicks and the Heat. Sacramento was the lone NBA team to average
more than 100 points. It is no coincidence that a former almost
invisible NBA outpost has become must-see television. The colorful
Kings of Jason Williams and Chris Webber have already secured 20
national television appearances, including nine on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the network's decision-making process, Dick
Ebersol, NBC Sports' president, recalled sitting up late one night
in May and watching a playoff game on Turner Sports between the
upstart Kings and the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``College or pro, it was the most extraordinary basketball game
I'd seen all year,'' Ebersol said of Utah's last-second victory in
Game 4. ``It was a game we didn't even televise. People were making
baskets, scoring on both ends. The offense was startling. That game
was one of the reasons we made some of the scheduling decisions we
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, Allen
Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers; Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant
and the Los Angeles Lakers, and Allan Houston, Latrell Sprewell and
the Knicks will be featured a maximum 11 times on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what America wants to see,'' the Kings'
Williams said recently. ``We run. We have fun. We push it up the
court. Growing up, that's what attracted people to the game. If we
have anything to do with getting back to that, then that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   With many members of the original Dream Team closer to
retirement than their primes _ Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing,
Scottie Pippen, John Stockton and Karl Malone among them _ it
appears the league and the network have made a conscious decision
to showcase rising young stars rather than fading, aging icons. The
Kings did not make an appearance on NBC during the regular season
in the nine previous years of the network's contract with the
league. An advertising campaign titled ``It's Our Turn Now'' aired
during the World Series, featuring Iverson and Williams. Bryant and
Kevin Garnett of Minnesota have also filmed commercial spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always say a game that is centered at the very least on
offense as much it is defense makes for much better TV fare,''
Ebersol said. ``There's no question we cherish a wide-open game and
we believe in a lot of these young players.''
</P>
<P>
   After Magic Johnson and Larry Bird retired, Jordan's
transcendent popularity masked many of the league's quality-of-play
problems. Now that Jordan has been gone from the game since the
abbreviated season that began last January, the league seems to
understand the need to return to more free-flowing, fluid offenses
to increase fan interest. It is a marriage of simple economics and
aesthetically pleasing play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's right to say we've acted in concert or that
the game is going to dramatically change,'' Stern said. ``The
network's decisions are based on research and judgment. And our
owners have decided they'd like to return a less physical, more
open game.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes involving excessive contact were by far the
greatest indicator that the game had become too physical. But not
everyone is in agreement that they will help the quality of the
game.
   ``I'm not so sure that it's going to be the answer,'' said
Lakers Coach Phil Jackson, who also decried the adding of a timeout
in the second period, believing it will impede the flow of a game.
``We hope it is because we like to see more cutting and movement on
the floor, less physical holding, contact of bodies and physical
play being the dominant factor, rather than speed and mobility.
Some of the rules have been enforced very well. Some haven't
because it's a very difficult thing for the referees to make that
adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Petrie, the general manager of the Kings, was named
executive of the year last season by his peers for the foresight to
trade for Webber, draft Williams and acquire the offensive-minded
center, Vlade Divac. Putting together a team of entertaining
passers and scorers, Petrie seemed to also see the changing
landscape of a league literally in transition. ``The classic
example of the running game flourishing would be the Knicks of the
early 1970's,'' Petrie said recently. ``They had five or six really
skilled players, and each had the ability to do more than just one
thing. Now we have all these specialists, and suddenly the game has
drifted.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I can't say I or anybody else went out and decided
to build a running team. But I knew early on we were going to be
able to play up-tempo. Do I think the rule changes and getting back
to running are good for the game? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the rules were called, it was hard to cut without
someone giving you a forearm shiver every time. I'm for anything
that allows more skill, more natural basketball ability than just
raw physical strength.''

AD COLUMN: MTV AND MGM JOIN IN 100-HOUR JAMES BOND PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the next three weeks, MTV viewers might feel as if they
have stumbled into one of those James Bond movie marathons _ only
this one will be celebrating just one film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the latest James Bond movie, will
be the centerpiece of as many as 100 hours of programming on MTV
channels worldwide. Among other things, there will be multiple
showings of the music video of the movie's theme song; a special on
the making of the video, which includes scenes from the movie; and
a contest to give away a $200,000 BMW featured in the movie, to be
conducted on MTV's highest-rated program.
</P>
<P>
   But what will not be apparent to MTV viewers is that much of the
programming will be part of a financially based arrangement between
MTV, a unit of Viacom Inc., and the studio behind the film,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   The two entertainment companies have joined in a huge promotion
aimed at building a more youthful following for a Bond movie
franchise old enough to be the father of most MTV viewers. The
arrangement will not be overtly disclosed, even on MTV programs
like a special devoted exclusively to the movie that includes
interviews with its stars, whose production costs are paid for,
wholly or in part, by MGM.
</P>
<P>
   MTV and studio executives said that the Bond promotion, like
many other MTV movie promotions in recent years, is a hybrid: one
part programming maneuver, intended to appeal to the channel's
film-infatuated audience, and one part elaborately conceived and
externally financed promotional announcement _ with elements of
what is otherwise known in television as an infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the stakes are particularly high. MTV is calling
the campaign, pointing toward the opening on Nov. 19 of ``The World
Is Not Enough,'' the first global movie promotion. MGM, which is
controlled by the Tracinda Corp., has taken the unusual step of
releasing the film throughout the world within the same two-week
window and MTV, which has more viewers than ever before, is singing
the movie's praises in music videos and special programs on
affiliates reaching more than 300 million homes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For MGM, the deal adds up to worldwide access to MTV's audience
of teenagers and college students. For MTV, it adds up to another
lucrative payday from its best customers, the movie studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we are in television,'' said John Shea, a senior
MTV executive, ``we are also in business. To say anything else
would be naive. This campaign is an understanding between smart
marketing people.''
</P>
<P>
   The very title of Shea's job suggests how business
considerations go hand in hand with programming at the channel. He
is the senior vice president of franchise and sponsor development
for MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Shea described the process of promoting films as a
one-hand-washing-another kind of arrangement. He said that MTV had
a specific ``movie team'' that meets each week to assess upcoming
releases and identify ones likely to appeal to its young audience.
Some recent examples included ``Austin Powers,'' ``The Waterboy''
and both Scream movies.
</P>
<P>
   Once a film is deemed a likely favorite for MTV viewers, MTV
executives approach the studio that is distributing it about
participating in a promotion. If the studio agrees, it may be asked
to put up money to produce a ``movie special'' for the channel,
perhaps to supply the prizes for a giveaway and often to increase
its purchase of advertising time on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a studio deems us a promotional partner,'' Shea said,
``they also ought to deem us an appropriate media-buy partner.''
The studios, he said, were all already in business with MTV because
of the amount of advertising money they committed to the channel
before every TV season _ the so-called upfront market.
</P>
<P>
   Van Toffler, the general manager of MTV, said that the channel's
negotiations with movie studios as advertisers were no different
from the negotiations any network would hold with clients.
</P>
<P>
   But some studio executives complain that MTV's standing in the
youth market gives it enough leverage to let it to set a specific
figure that a studio must spend in advertising before any promotion
deal can be closed. One executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that MTV was far from alone in this practice _ that
it had become widespread on cable television channels and even some
broadcast networks _ but that MTV was the most aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive with another studio described MTV movie
promotions as ``basically paid political advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   This executive called MTV ``a very efficient monopoly'' on
youthful viewers and said of the channel's demands on advertisers
to go along with the promotions, ``They drive a hard bargain and it
doesn't matter how big you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea did not agree. ``It's not accurate to say there is a quid
pro quo'' for the studios to buy more advertising, he said.
``That's putting the cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, he said, MTV's movie team, which includes
representatives of several departments _ advertising and promotion,
programming and even news _ must decide if the film will appeal to
the channel's viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And Toffler disputed the idea that MTV creates infomercials for
movies. ``The studios don't pay the whole costs of movie
specials,'' he said. ``We take on the decision to produce a
program. It's not as if they're paying us for air time.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the Bond project, Toffler was supported by Gerry Rich,
the president of worldwide marketing for MGM, who said his studio
had not been asked to increase its advertising budget despite the
elaborate promotion. He also said that while MGM had contributed
cash to some of the productions connected to the promotion, ``It
has been a harmonious arrangement; it felt balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   In finding a welcome at MTV, Shea said, the Bond film was aided
by its producers' decision to recruit the rock band Garbage to sing
its title song _ and to make the video that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   MTV also came up with the idea of tying the film promotion to
its production of the MTV Europe Music Awards, the European version
of MTV's Video Music Awards. That event is set for Nov. 11 in
Dublin, and Pierce Brosnan, the current James Bond, and Denise
Richards, his co-star in ``The World Is Not Enough,'' will appear
as presenters.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, MTV will give away one of the BMWs that Brosnan
drives in the film. Another will be given away by Ms. Richards on
``Total Request Live,'' a daily MTV show.
</P>
<P>
   Toffler contended that no promotion decision, whether for
advertising money or money for production, was ever made by MTV's
programming department. ``I don't know what our ad guys say when
they talk to the studios,'' he said, ``but none of that impacts any
programming decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a number of independent films like ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and ``Go,'' which he said MTV had backed with programs
and other forms of coverage even though their production companies
could not afford much, if any, advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a slave to our audience,'' Toffler said. ``What our
audience is desirous of seeing is our priority.''

BUSH SLIGHTLY HURT DURING JOG WHEN A TRUCK SPILLS DEBRIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was slightly
injured while jogging in Austin, Texas, Monday when a truck trailer
overturned, scattering debris across a foot path, and Bush was
forced to dive out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement authorities and officials with the Bush campaign
said Bush, 53, the leading contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, suffered only minor scrapes and bruises to
his right leg and hip.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving medical treatment from paramedics on the scene,
he was able to proceed with his plans to fly to New Hampshire,
where he arrived Monday night and will campaign for the next two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old baseball term called a strawberry,'' Bush said
in a statement released by his campaign Monday night. ``You get a
strawberry when you slide hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a strawberry on my hip and on my leg, but if I needed
to, I could go out now and run three miles,'' he said. ``The only
thing retarding that is the fact that I'm getting a little older
and I don't want to do that twice in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was relieved to hear that Roscoe Hughey, a
bodyguard who had been riding behind him on a bicycle, was released
from the hospital Monday night. Hughey, 39, had been partly buried
in debris, mostly pieces of wood and concrete, that pressed hard
into his left side, law-enforcement officials said. But hospital
tests showed that he had not sustained any broken bones or serious
internal injuries, Bush's aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said it was unclear what had caused
the trailer to overturn. Both they and Bush's aides said there was
no indication that the driver of the truck was singling out Bush or
was guilty of any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush usually runs at least 15 miles a week, in 3- or 4-mile
increments. When he is home in Austin, he often runs downtown along
Town Lake.

   That is where he was exercising shortly after noon Monday, his
aides said. The section of the path on which he was running abuts a
busy street, and aides said his fleeting visual impression was that
the truck and trailer were veering off the street and heading for
him. He hurled himself off the path before the debris tumbled
across it, hitting Hughey.

SCOTLAND GENERATING HIGH-TECH INNOVATION AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland _ John Dunlop might seem at first to have the
manner of the archetypal academic, aloof from the high-tech
revolution sweeping the globe. In reality, though, rather like a
digital Braveheart, he is very much part of his country's updated
assault on the electronic barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Since late last year, behind the imposing Gothic ramparts of
Glasgow's Strathclyde University, Dunlop, 55, a professor of
electronic systems engineering, has been working on a project to
monitor incoming radio signals so efficiently that as they begin to
weaken, they can be boosted back to full audibility.
</P>
<P>
   What lifted this modest, $100,000 venture out of the groves of
academe was that it was conducted in conjunction with the local
subsidiary of Motorola. And its intention was far from theoretical:
as Europe prepares to embrace a new generation of mobile phones,
the technology developed by Dunlop and his small team will, he
said, eliminate the fade-outs that are among the biggest irritants
of wireless telephony. That could give Motorola a potential edge
over competitors if the company chooses to exercise its first
option on licensing rights.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of collaboration between university researchers and
corporate partners is nothing new in the United States, or in parts
of England to the south. But here, it is new and heretical _ and
central to a major new effort to break away from dependence on
imported technology as a source of manufacturing employment, or
``screwdriver'' jobs, and burst into an era of innovation generated
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, its proponents say, that shift is the cornerstone
of Scotland's effort not just to attract foreign investment to the
corridor of technology companies between Glasgow and Edinburgh _ an
area nicknamed Silicon Glen _ but to harness Scotland's output of
well-qualified college graduates in a high-tech revolution of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Glen has one big edge over Silicon Valley: while
California companies compete avidly to hire talent, Scotland
produces far more highly trained graduates than its fledgling
electronics design industry can employ. But that is also the
problem: little of that home grown talent stays at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that we are able to take our ideas
from the academic environment into the industrial department,''
Dunlop said. And the development of wireless technology is only a
part of what he termed a ``wide range'' of scientific development
at the University linked to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking, Scotland's boosters maintain, is the forerunner
of a fundamental change in the way Scotland handles its high-tech
future, seeking a commercial edge from its successes in
biotechnology _ like the cloning of Dolly the sheep _ to its
advances into the domain of intellectual property in the
semiconductor business.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, in a project backed by Cadence Design Systems of San
Jose, Calif., Scottish authorities are readying a 97-acre campus
offering research facilities to corporations, cheek-by-jowl with an
academic center _ known as the Alba Centre _ designed to train
graduates in advanced chip design. The intention, according to an
Alba statement, is to put ``Scotland at the forefront of shaping
the global electronic design industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The project, taking shape over the last year, reflects a
perception among some Scottish electronics entrepreneurs that the
focus of Scotland's ambitions has rested for too long on the
employment potential of foreigners' imported technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be doing more, looking beyond job creation to
knowledge creation,'' said David Milne, 56, managing director of
Wolfson Microelectronics, a successful semiconductor design company
in Edinburgh that was created in 1985 as a spin-off from an
academic research foundation and this year expects sales of $20
million, up from $15 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland has proved adept at persuading American and other
companies to set up the kind of job-producing plants and telephone
call-centers that are a feature of foreign investment across
Britain and Ireland. Indeed, some 40,500 people have found jobs in
electronic manufacturing _ with some 29,000 more employed in the
supply chain _ since companies like IBM and Hewlett-Packard set up
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's ambition now, though, is to build centers of
high-tech innovation challenging rivals like Cambridge (Silicon
Fen) or Oxford (Silicon Spires), both set up explicitly to tap
academia's knowledge for industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, said Crawford W. Beveridge, chief executive of
Scottish Enterprise, a government development agency, ``what you
have to do is to play the hand you are dealt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' he added, ``we've been dealt a better hand with the
university system'' than some of Scotland's European rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with some 9 percent of Britain's 50-million-plus
population, Scottish universities produce 21 percent of the
nation's postgraduate degrees in computer science. And even at the
college level, they punch above their weight, turning out some
2,406 engineering and technology degrees, or 11 percent of the
British total of 21,010. The idea now, Beveridge said, is to create
``clusters,'' bringing together university brain with the financial
brawn of the world's $7 billion semiconductor market.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of ambition is not altogether surprising. In August,
Scotland's parliament was revived after 300 years, formalizing the
land's claims to a separate political identity. Scotland's banks,
moreover, have shown a new feistiness, competing in hostile _ if
slow-moving _ maneuvers to take over one of England's biggest
retail banks, National Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation whose heart once beat to the rivet guns of
ship-building on the Clyde, steel and other heavy industry,
Scotland has mixed a newer economic life-blood from North Sea oil,
tourism, food industries and technology. That shows in familiar
ways: once the depressed domain of savvy bargain-hunters, the
housing market in upscale sections of Glasgow and Edinburgh has
``gone berserk,'' Beveridge said.

U.S. SAID TO BE WORKING ON NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of secret exchanges with Beijing
over the past two weeks, the White House is racing to close a deal
by the end of this month that it hopes will pave China's way into
the World Trade Organization, even if Congress cannot pass judgment
on the agreement until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a phone call from President Clinton to President
Jiang Zemin late at night on Oct. 16, Washington and Beijing have
since engaged in what one official called an ``intense set of
interactions.'' Nonetheless, senior administration officials say
that there is only a 50-50 chance they will be able to close the
huge deal, which Clinton now views as his best shot at stabilizing
U.S. relations with China during his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has never publicly described that call, nor has
it described an internal strategy debate presided over by the White
House chief of staff, John Podesta, over how to close the elusive
deal. But according to Chinese and U.S. officials, Clinton offered
in the call to make the first move to break a long stalemate in the
talks, volunteering to send China's leaders the details of a deal
he characterized as Washington's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Those details have not been disclosed, but areas up for
discussion include telecommunications, financial services, textiles
and anti-dumping sanctions, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative reveals how desperately Clinton is attempting to
put back together the huge trade deal he walked away from in April,
a move his aides say he now deeply regrets.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the White House say that the deal offered in April
would still not satisfy the administration, one top official mused
last week, ``If we could get it again, we'd probably take it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment of maximum U.S. leverage to strike a deal is fast
approaching, as Clinton prepares to open a meeting of the world's
trade ministers in Seattle on Nov. 30. That session is expected to
set the agenda for a new round of global trade talks that will take
years _ and which China can influence only if it clearly is about
to join the group that sets the terms of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization
and the predecessor General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have
been going on for over 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once China is in the organization, it will be required to abide
by the group's extensive rules on opening markets _ meaning it
would have to allow in far more foreign investors, farm goods and
providers of services. That would likely result in a boon for U.S.
companies, which have been lobbying hard for this agreement. But it
would also reduce Washington's ability to impose its own sanctions
on China, because the Chinese could use the trade forum's court to
arbitrate disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's conversation with Jiang, trade officials have
been working to put together a draft of an agreement, based on the
U.S. understanding of the deal that didn't happen in April. But the
process is made more difficult by continuing disagreements between
China and the United States about what concessions China's premier,
Zhu Rongji, brought with him on that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House's decision to publish a long list of
those concessions so inflamed some powerful Chinese business
executives and their political patrons that China has been forced
to pull back, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is no longer clear that China is still willing
to let U.S. firms own 51 percent of Chinese telecommunications
companies. But if the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, struck a deal that gave U.S. telecommunications firms
less of an inroad into the booming Chinese communications market,
she would have to make the case that she extracted other
concessions that went beyond China's offer in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly still want a deal and want it soon,'' one
administration official who has been in touch with the Chinese said
recently. ``But it's becoming clear it won't be exactly the same
deal. The politics have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mysteries that the White House has not yet solved is
whether Jiang is still committed to striking a deal, especially at
a moment when he is under growing economic pressure at home.
Clinton was clearly frustrated in New Zealand in early September,
when Jiang dragged his feet in restarting negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His Oct. 16 call was followed up a week later with a trip to
China by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. While Summers was not
sent to negotiate _ Jiang and the country's top trade negotiators
were all in Europe _ he saw Zhu and after a three-hour meeting
reported that the embattled prime minister was still committed and
eager for China to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure created by opening China's markets, Zhu
once again told Summers, would help spur China's own reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's political enemies have seized upon the list of
concessions that the White House published in April to help
undermine a deal. And U.S. diplomats say that China's leaders
appear concerned that in the last year of his presidency Clinton
lacks the clout to push the deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses would have to approve a change in the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which requires Congress to
review China's trade status annually, a vote that gives many in
Congress a chance to voice their disapproval of China's human
rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its ballooning trade
surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade status would be implicit in any deal that got
China into the World Trade Organization. But under one scenario now
being discussed in Ms. Barshefsky's office, the United States would
reach an agreement with China but would invoke a seldom-used
provision of the World Trade Organization's rules that would
prevent China from enjoying some of the trade benefits with the
United States until a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get a deal through Congress, even in an
election year,'' Rep. David Drier, the Republican who heads the
House Rules Committee, said in an interview last week. ``If
American industry says it's a good deal, I think that would be
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky is being unusually tight-lipped about the talks,
which would mark the biggest trade deal in her tenure and a major
part of Clinton's foreign-policy legacy. She does not want to
appear too eager to strike a deal, always a dangerous negotiating
position. And her influence in the White House remains murky: Her
advice that Clinton take the April deal was overruled, after Robert
Rubin _ the Treasury secretary at the time _ and other
administration officials said that it could not get through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Ms. Barshefsky announced that she expected formal
negotiations with China to resume this month. ``We have got to
see,'' she said Monday, when asked about the possibility of a deal.
``I'm neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I'm actually a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of work to do as we look ahead,'' she
said, noting that China would also have to conclude deals with
Europe, Canada and Latin America, though those would probably
closely follow whatever agreement was struck with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials close to Ms. Barshefsky say she may travel to
China before the Seattle trade meeting if there is enough progress
to suggest that a deal could be wrapped up in time for Clinton to
announce it during the Seattle session.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky still has two big hurdles to clear.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is textiles: At a moment when the United States is
urging other countries to drop trade barriers, Ms. Barshefsky is
under pressure from members of Congress representing textile-making
states to force China to agree to an extension of import quotas and
tariffs on Chinese-made fabrics. The Chinese are resisting. But
they may agree in return for other concessions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the biggest stumbling-block: China's insistence
that the United States surrender its ability to invoke unilateral
trade sanctions against Chinese products that it determines are
being unfairly ``dumped'' at below-market prices in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a vital one for unions, which insist that
anti-dumping actions are critical to saving manufacturing jobs.
They are already putting pressure on Vice President Al Gore, who
has courted them assiduously, to protect their interests in any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his aides say, has no intention of getting near the
Seattle meeting.

   Q -- I am an accountant in a small commercial real estate
company. There is a generous owner, a secretary, another accountant
and myself _ I am female. The secretary and I have always been
great friends, but the other accountant is constantly gossiping
about me and my work to her. He and the owner are both in love with
her, and she is married. She tells me she does not know what to say
to the accountant when he wants to vent about me. Do I confront him
or ignore them both? J.M.
</P>
<P>
   A -- With your boss and colleague both in love with your great
friend, a secretary who betrays you, this is more of a soap opera
than a real estate firm. Unless you are comfortable playing the
role of the victim, you need a speaking part.
</P>
<P>
   The first person you should speak with is your great friend. If
she is going to be any kind of a friend, when the accountant comes
to vent to her about you, and she just ``doesn't know what to
say,'' she needs some new lines. For example, the next time he
approaches and starts to smear you, she should state that she is
not interested. If she cannot do this, one has to wonder about the
greatness of this friendship.
</P>
<P>
   You should also approach your fellow accountant and tell him
that if he has a problem with you or your work, he should discuss
it directly with you _ and only with you. If he cannot pick up this
cue, you can approach the owner, but the problem is that he too has
a soft spot in his heart for the secretary. He may well be a
generous individual, but if the soap opera continues, it may be
time for a break.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- Our manager has this habit of saying, ``I know I shouldn't
say this,'' before coming out with a disgusting or degrading
comment. He gets a big laugh out of this, as do some of the
followers around here, but many of us are offended. What do you do
with a manager like this? R.P.
</P>
<P>
   A -- If there is a course in remedial management, enroll him in
it. This person is not a manager, but rather is a bully, a buffoon
and a brat. He is also a walking liability for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the phrase, ``I know I shouldn't be saying this,''
somehow magically shields him from any possible repercussions for
what may come out next is sheer folly. This type of behavior has a
negative impact on employee satisfaction, teamwork, commitment and
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   You and some of your associates should approach him on a
businesslike basis and let him know your feelings. Be sure that he
understands the present and potential costs that are associated
with his behavior, and clearly indicate that you would like it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   If his offensive comments continue, you and your group should
approach senior management. It is important for senior management
to know that this is going on in your department, and it is even
more important for you to know what senior management does about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- My boss stopped by my apartment, and I was going to drive
him to a meeting. While he was waiting for me, he noticed that a
stapler on my desk came from the office. I told him immediately
that it belongs to the company and I had brought it home for a
couple of days and planned to return it. He shook his head and now
seems upset with me. What do I do? K.T.
</P>
<P>
   A -- Presumably, you have already taken step one: Return the
stapler. If you did not have a real discussion of what happened in
the car on the way to the meeting, you should do so now.
</P>
<P>
   When you make a mistake, the best approach is to admit it,
apologize and correct it. People make all sorts of mistakes in
their careers, some large and some small. In many cases, the
mistakes may be excusable if the person who committed them is
honest and forthright about what happened. What tends to be
inexcusable is when the mistakes are repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have given your mea culpa to your manager, you need to
move on from this point. If you keep returning to the issue, it
will never move from the foreground into the background. Let your
manager see that the incident was an aberration, and let your
performance clearly demonstrate your work ethic, drive, skills and
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   You made a mistake, suffered some consequences, and hopefully
learned from the ordeal. The only other suggestion is to buy your
own stapler.

BAYLOR NAMED MANAGER OF CHICAGO CUBS AND MANUEL GOES TO CLEVELAND
INDIANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day that Don Baylor rejoined the managerial
ranks from which he was inexplicably evicted a year ago, other
black and Latino candidates did not fare so well Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chambliss and Cito Gaston were shut out in Cleveland,
where the Indians named Charlie Manuel as their new manager, and
Bob Watson and Omar Minaya finished as also-rans in Disney Land,
where the Anaheim Angels hired Bill Stoneman as their general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first day that Leonard Coleman, the
highest-ranking black executive in baseball history, was no longer
president of the National League. With Major League Baseball moving
all league functions into the central office, Coleman resigned,
effective the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, whom the Colorado Rockies fired as manager last year
only to have the owner subsequently acknowledge that the move was a
mistake, was named manager of the Chicago Cubs. He accepted a
four-year contract for $5.2 million dollars. The appointment had
been expected, even though Baylor was the person most sought by
clubs seeking a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor served this season as the Atlanta Braves' hitting coach.
He rejected offers from the Angels (four years, $4.9 million) and
the Milwaukee Brewers (four years, $5.2 million). The Baltimore
Orioles received permission to talk to him, but never followed up.
</P>
<P>
   In becoming the Cubs' 46th manager and the first who is a member
of a minority group, Baylor said he liked the city, its fans and
the challenge presented by a team that has not won a World Series
since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would love to be in Joe Torre's shoes,'' Baylor said
by telephone from Chicago, referring to the Yankees' manager.
``That doesn't happen. But with your second chance to manage, the
history of this club, the fans they have, they have a tremendous
following. They have to feel they want to win sometimes. That's
what we're going to try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's appointment restores to four the number of black and
Latino managers in the majors. Jerry Manuel of the White Sox,
Felipe Alou of Montreal and Dusty Baker of San Francisco are the
others. The Brewers are expected to raise the total to five when
they select their manager; the candidates are said to be Gaston,
Chambliss, Willie Randolph and Davey Lopes.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Manuel, the Indians' hitting coach, seemed to be that
club's choice as manager ever since Mike Hargrove was fired last
month for failing to win a World Series during the Indians'
five-year run as American League Central champions. Hargrove may
wind up managing the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday an Indians official indicated that none of the other
candidates had given the club reason not to hire Manuel, who in his
sixth season as hitting coach this year saw the Indians score the
most runs of any team in half a century. The Indians also
interviewed Gaston, who managed Toronto to World Series
championships in 1992 and 1993; Chambliss, the Yankees' hitting
coach, and Jim Riggleman, Baylor's predecessor as the Cubs'
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a true baseball guy like Charlie is the right move and
the right fit,'' John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said.
``Today's announcement is going to be a big hit in our clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Baylor and Manuel left the Orioles and the Angels
seeking managers. The Orioles also do not have a general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' hiring of Stoneman left the major leagues with 29
white general managers, including four hired recently. No black or
Latino executive has held that position since Watson resigned as
the Yankees' general manager two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Watson appeared to be a strong candidate for the Angels' job
after they interviewed him three times. The third interview came
last week, after their prospective hiring of Stoneman, the Montreal
Expos' vice president for baseball operations for 15 years,
appeared to have fallen through.
</P>
<P>
   According to an executive of another club, Stoneman was the
choice of Tony Tavares, the Angels' president, but Michael Eisner,
head of the Walt Disney Company, was not convinced after meeting
with Stoneman, whose role with the Expos had been largely
financial. The Angels then held additional interviews with Watson,
Minaya and Jim Duquette of the Mets and Dan Evans of the White Sox.
Watson declined to comment on the Angels' decision, but he was
clearly not happy that he had been interviewed three times and was
still not hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want some time to pass before I go out and say how I really
feel about all this,'' he said by telephone from his home in
Houston. ``I don't want it to be construed as sour grapes. I'm
going to wait until I can really collect all my thoughts and also
see how the rest of this hiring process goes.''

2 SYRACUSE PLAYERS REMAIN HOSPITALIZED AFTER STABBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two Syracuse University football players and another man
remained hospitalized Monday with stab wounds following a melee
outside a downtown Syracuse bar early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were injured in what the police say they believe
started as a verbal altercation inside the bar, Sadie's Place, and
spilled onto the sidewalk. Three players and two of their friends
were set upon by an armed group of six or more men, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Byrd, a starting cornerback for the Orangemen was upgraded
from critical to serious condition late Monday, but Myles Thomas of
Boston, a friend of one of the players, remained in critical
condition in the intensive care unit at University Hospital. Byrd,
who had surgery Sunday, was stabbed twice in the back, twice in the
neck and once in the leg. Thomas was stabbed in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni DeLoatch, a backup tackle who was stabbed behind the
right ear, in the right thigh and several times in the back, was in
good condition at St. Joseph's Hospital. Maynard Pettijohn, a
starting defensive end who was stabbed in the head and in the ear,
was treated at St. Joseph's and released, and Daniel Moore of
Boston, a friend of one of the players, was treated for a stab
wound to the back and was released from St. Joseph's.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie's Place has a history of violent disturbances, including
fights, assaults, stabbings and shootings, said Sgt. David Sackett,
a spokesman for the Syracuse police. The bar is about two miles
from the campus and is owned by the wife of an Onondaga County
sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the university's athletic department,
Coach Paul Pasqualoni said the players had been warned about going
to places like Sadie's, although he did not say that it had been
singled out.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested two Syracuse men on Sunday night and said
they planned to arrest more in connection with the stabbings,
Sackett said. Trequill Stackhouse and Cheiron Thomas, both 22, were
charged with assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Sackett said a bouncer cleared the bar because he smelled
marijuana and feared a fight was about to break out. He said
witnesses told the police that 40 to 60 people were milling outside
the bar and that 6 or more men, some armed with knives, attacked
the players and their friends. Two knives were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what precipitated the fight, but when it
all comes out we believe it will show that the players were singled
out,'' Sackett said.  &QL;

EVEN INTERVIEW IS NOW OVER 30 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CATHY HORYN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last thing the photographer David LaChapelle
wanted to be associated with was a party where, as he put it,
``Miuccia Prada would be staring at Helmut Lang.'' Those two were
indeed at Interview magazine's 30th anniversary party last Thursday
night at the Kit Kat Club. And so were Calvin Klein, Fran Lebowitz,
Barry Diller, Diane Von Furstenberg, Jon Bon Jovi, Tom Ford, Puff
Daddy and Elizabeth Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody was being stared at. Unless you counted the platinum
blonde who was wandering naked through the room looking as though
she had just slipped out of Marilyn Monroe's ``Happy Birthday''
dress. Or Lil' Kim, the diminutive rapper, who performed wearing
nothing more than a slinky top made of some gold chains and a pair
of pink satin pants that had only one leg.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the place was so crowded, with people filling the
balcony and the wings, that Ms. Hurley, for one, could never be
sure what the rap star was wearing. ``I could only see her from the
waist up, and she looked fabulous,'' she said, standing next to
Elton John, who also performed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hints of decadence, hardly any of the usual crew of
guests seemed shocked when they arrived at the party, around 10:45
p.m., after a dinner given by Ingrid Sischy, Interview's editor in
chief, and Sandy Brant, its publisher. And while somebody had gone
to a lot of trouble to decorate 2,000 cupcakes with the magazine's
logo and to arrange for Amanda LaPore, the blonde, to pop naked out
of a big cake, LaChapelle was clearly the evening's presiding
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Since the party was also in his honor, he transformed the club
into ``Hotel LaChapelle,'' after his new book of photographs, being
published by Bulfinch Press. There were rows of twin beds on the
main floor, and night stands with Bibles and alarm clocks. As the
guests arrived, topless bell boys and bell girls wearing pasties,
suspenders and caps with chin straps served drinks. Andre Leon
Talley, Vogue's editor at large, flopped down on a bed next to Ms.
Lebowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pastiche'' was Talley's pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she thought of the situation _ the beds, the go-go
dancers gyrating on the stage in white cotton underpants and boots
_ Ms. Lebowitz shook her head. ``I don't think it's really a
thinking situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   LaChapelle, whose goggle-like glasses and floral-print shirt
gave him the appearance of an ecstatic tropical insect, said he
wanted the party to evoke what he called ``the energy of Studio
54.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't really, but there were moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted a mix,'' he said. ``So there are skateboarders
and Sean Puffy Combs. You've got Willem Dafoe and a transsexual
prostitute I know standing next to some women in a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it was Lil' Kim, more than the hysterical
decorations or the self-conscious attempts to be shocking, who
transformed the evening. She is the real thing, an invention, a
performer whose body and obvious lack of inhibition make you feel
she is totally in control of the stage. She sang with a couple of
young men she introduced as her ``little brothers,'' though they
didn't look very little.
</P>
<P>
   ``She uses her sexuality in a really aggressive way in her
music, but when you meet her she's disarmingly sweet, a living
Kewpie doll,'' said LaChapelle, who recently photographed Lil' Kim
naked except for some logos (``We were painting them right on her
skin,'' he said, ``like she was an expensive Louis Vuitton bag'').
</P>
<P>
   After her performance, Talley took Ms. Lebowitz backstage to
meet her. Lil' Kim was in a tiny dressing room with a couple of
friends, including Iman, the model who is married to David Bowie,
and Nija Battle, who designs furs for Lil' Kim and other rap
artists. There were a lot of squeals of ``No, you're beautiful!''
and ``Honey!'' Lil' Kim was saying she had her wardrobe designed by
someone named Misha or Melissa, when another person dropped by and
her little voice was drowned out by more squeals.
</P>
<P>
   LaChapelle came in and plopped down next to Lil' Kim. Someone
asked him if it was true he had auditioned all the go-go dancers.
``Oh, yeah,'' he said. ``They're professional go-go dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lebowitz shot him a look and said, ``They thought they were
going to clerk for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who experienced enough of the so-called pop life _
the clubs, the underground happenings, the celebrities extending as
far as the limos stretch _ to qualify as a kind of senior citizen
of camp (even though she is only 49), Ms. Lebowitz had an
interesting take on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I like in this popular culture is the music,''
she said, lighting a cigarette. ``It's the only thing wholly
invented by these people. It's not taken from somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't think the party atmosphere had anything in common
with the club scene in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing like it, nothing at all,'' she said, adding,
``Young people always come up to me and say, `Oh, I want to be like
you.' I don't want to be like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lebowitz frowned and went on: ``They always ask me what
restaurant I went to when I was their age. We didn't eat. We didn't
have any money. That's a difference _ kids have money now. I don't
think I ate dinner the first 12 years I was in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Lil' Kim was ready to go back out in the crowd and mingle. She
put on a white coat, seemed to roll around in it a moment, and left
surrounded by a posse of bodyguards. As Ms. Battle headed out
behind her, she was asked about Misha or Melissa, the stylist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Misa,'' she said. ``M-I-S-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lebowitz smiled mildly. ``You know,'' she said, ``like Misa
Sert.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course,  &UR; that &LR;  muse's name was Misia _ but what's an ``i''
among all these good friends?

OFFICERS WHO KILLED HAMMER-WIELDING MAN WON'T FACE CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn grand jury has decided not to bring any
charges against four police officers involved in the fatal shooting
of a mentally disturbed, hammer-wielding man, District Attorney
Charles J. Hynes announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Gidone Busch on Aug. 30 brought hundreds of
Hasidic protesters to the streets of the heavily Orthodox Borough
Park neighborhood and attracted widespread attention because of the
stark differences between Police Commissioner Howard Safir's first
description of what happened and the accounts of witnesses on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Before releasing the findings, Hynes and other prosecutors met
with Busch's family for more than two hours Monday morning to
outline the results of the investigation for them.
</P>
<P>
   In an often emotional encounter, participants on both sides
said, the prosecutors presented a narrative sharply at odds with
Safir's original version. But the prosecutors concluded that, in
legal terms, the officers were justified in using deadly force
against Busch because they had a ``reasonable belief'' that he was
a threat to them and others. Busch's relatives and supporters, on
the other hand, remained bitterly critical of the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Busch's mother, Doris Busch-Boskey,
said later. ``I just hope we can learn from this, in how they
handle emotionally disturbed persons.''
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference the morning after the shooting,
flanked by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and a hastily assembled row of
Jewish community leaders, Safir said the police opened fire only as
Busch was beating a fallen police sergeant with a hammer, putting
the officer's life in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seven independent witnesses who confirm everything I
am saying, nonpolice witnesses,'' Safir said that morning, ``and
each of those witnesses says at this point as he continued to hit
the sergeant with the claw hammer, the police fired 12 shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to participants on both sides of Monday's meeting,
the prosecutors gave a different account, based on the grand jury's
findings. Citing both police and civilian witnesses, they said
Busch was shot after he broke free of the police effort to contain
him. He ran up a narrow stairway from his basement apartment,
struck Sgt. Terrence O'Brien with his hammer, then rushed past the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on the sidewalk, they said, with the hammer raised over
his head as the six officers who responded to radio calls stood,
all on their feet, guns drawn, in a rough semicircle around him.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted at him _ one ``almost pleading,'' a law enforcement
official said _ to drop the hammer. There was a distinct single
shot, closely followed by a volley. Busch fell dead.
</P>
<P>
   This account is essentially the same as that in an article in
The New York Times last month that reconstructed the shooting from
accounts of witnesses and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been speculation that the grand jury, which
voted on Thursday, might issue a report critical of police training
and tactics for dealing with emotionally disturbed persons, Hynes
said, ``That's a kind of second-guessing I don't want to engage
in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of this case is that they followed every step of the
procedures,'' the district attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the officers called for the specially
trained and equipped Emergency Services Unit.
</P>
<P>
   A few new details emerged Monday _ including a previously
undisclosed, frantic second radio call for the Emergency Services
Unit, underscoring both the strangeness of the fatal events and the
speed with which they unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Busch first appeared holding not a hammer, but a flute,
according to Monday's account. Percy Freeman, a homeless man with
whom the prosecutors said Busch had been smoking marijuana, had
come up the stairs to tell the police, ``Don't worry about the
hammer; it's a religious object,'' when the officers wrestled him
to the ground to handcuff him.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed radio calls indicated that only seven
seconds elapsed from the time Busch bolted past the police and his
death. At 6:48:20 that night, Sgt. Joseph Memoly, arriving on the
scene as Busch was breaking free, put in a second call for the
emergency unit ``forthwith'' _ police argot for as fast as
possible. At 6:48:27, O'Brien radioed: ``Perp down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAGOSA SPRINGS, Colo. _ Nestled in the San Juan National Forest
in southwestern Colorado is a small rectangle of mountains and a
valley that straddles the meandering East Fork of the San Juan
River.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the rectangle's 2,780 acres are indistinguishable from
the surrounding landscape, a dream scene of 1.8 million pristine
acres at the Continental Divide, where the only sounds are the
water rushing over rocks, the wind and the occasional cry of birds
high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   But that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Like more than 50 million other acres inside the United States'
national parks and forests, only a fraction of the total, the
rectangle of acreage is privately owned. It was one of thousands of
land grants made available, in some cases almost 140 years ago, for
homesteading, mining operations and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the private tracts remain undeveloped, owners
of the rectangle here are planning to build a members-only resort
on 200 acres that they call Piano Creek Ranch, where membership
shares cost $385,000 to $535,000.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to accommodate 395 families, the resort would include
spacious houses, lodges, a golf course and an equestrian center. A
ski area would be built on another part of the rectangle. Already,
175 families have signed up, and ground breaking is scheduled for
next June, with completion planned in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists say developments like Piano Creek represent
only the beginning of a major problem throughout federal lands. It
is ``the undiscovered crisis,'' says the National Park Trust, a
nonprofit group that buys land and donates it to the park system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the results of the booming economy and a lot of
new disposable wealth,'' said Steve Thompson, senior vice president
of the Trust for Public Land, another nonprofit organization that
works to preserve national park lands and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``With population pressures and beautiful places disappearing,
people of means are saying, `I'll get my little corner of
Paradise,' and they do what they want with it,'' Thompson said.
``They have the legal right to do it. But it's sad that resources
that are so spectacular, so beautiful would not be made available
to a broader audience, only to a limited group.''
</P>
<P>
   And with land prices soaring in areas within some of the
country's more popular parks and forests, the federal government
and nonprofit agencies that buy land for preservation may be unable
to compete with private investors. Paul Pritchard, president of the
National Park Trust, predicted, ``In five or 10 years, we'll be
priced out of the market in high-demand parks.''
</P>
<P>
   The private ownership rights were honored when Congress began
designating national parks and forests in the 1890s, and through
recent years most of the land owners have either kept their tracts
in a natural state or sold them to the federal government for
preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the San Juan forest, and with growing frequency
elsewhere, owners of ``inholdings,'' as they are known to the
federal government, are developing acreage for commercial gain,
setting off intense fights with preservation groups and community
organizations concerned that development could damage the ecology
by disturbing wildlife and scarring landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a major concern,'' Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt said of private development inside federally owned lands.
``We need the resources to buy them out before problems start, and
there are willing sellers for most of them. But we don't have the
money, so the willing seller decides to sell on the open commercial
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the major federal land management agencies _ the
National Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of
Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Land Management _ provide
Congress with a list of privately held property they want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The park service list alone has a backlog of 10,184 private
tracts in 145 parks _ more than 1 million acres in all _ that
officials say would cost the government $1.35 billion to buy for
preservation. The National Park Trust estimates that 20 percent of
the privately held land within national parks and forests is ``in
imminent danger'' of development.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress never appropriates enough money to satisfy all the
needs, so which properties are bought depends on the threat of
development, the willingness of the owner to sell and the price.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Babbitt said, the four agencies have received a
combined $300 million to $400 million annually for the acquisition
of private land. As a result, conflicts are brewing throughout the
country as more developers build on their land inside national
parks and forests and market it for profit.

</P>
<P>
   In the Maryland suburbs outside Washington, the National Park
Service is trying to buy 88 acres within the Monocacy National
Battlefield, a major Civil War site, to prevent any development of
housing subdivisions and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of 11,000 acres within the Bitterroot National Forest
in western Montana resisted efforts to sell the land to the federal
government and, instead, sold recently to a company headed by Craig
Barrett, chief executive of Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said that his group did not intend to develop the land.
But preservationists are skeptical and they complain that because
the acreage is a patchwork of about 14 separate tracts, the private
ownership makes it difficult for the federal government to manage
the public lands around them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, developers
are planning to turn an old 20-acre mining site into a remote lodge
with 30 lodges. For access, which the federal government is
required to provide, the developers are asking the park service to
improve a 10-mile road through park land that would cross a valley
creek 27 times. Park officials fear that the improvement will
encourage other land holders to develop sites near the road.
</P>
<P>
   Gettysburg National Military park in south-central Pennsylvania
includes three privately held tracts, and park officials say that
proposed commercial development would destroy the integrity of one
of the most sacred battle sites of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle grazing on 532 acres of private land around the Golden
Spike National Historic Site in Utah, where rails from the east and
west linked for the first time in 1869, is speeding up erosion, a
process that officials say can be reversed only by buying the land.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth in Arizona, one of the fastest-growing states
in the country, is threatening the Saguaro National Park, where the
saguaro cactus has been known to grow as high as 50 feet and weigh
as much as 8 tons. But in recent years, encroaching development has
affected the cactus, and the park service wants to buy 250
surrounding acres as protection.
</P>
<P>
   Those fights are similar to the conflict here. Dan McCarthy, a
Chicago businessman and majority owner of the San Juan property,
once considered building a large ski resort on the land but said he
was persuaded by members of his family to abandon the plan because
of the potential impact of the traffic and people. More recently,
the 81-year-old McCarthy agreed to sell the tract to developers
whose idea for a country-club-like project more suited his
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely sensitive to the environment,'' he said in an
interview. ``And I am concerned about what happens to the East Fork
after I die, whose hands it might be in. My kids like it the way it
is, but someone might come along and they might feel like selling.
I think this is the best practical answer.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people disagree with him. While recognizing
that as a property owner, McCarthy can do whatever he wants with
his tract, a coalition of environmental groups, Friends of the East
Fork Valley, and residents of Pagosa Springs, the nearest town,
have vowed to fight the project as inappropriate for the site.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the lavish resort would disrupt elk migration
routes, threaten lynx, deer and other wildlife and destroy
landscape that remains as it was when wagon trains rolled westward
across the same access road that would serve the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep thinking that every time you develop something,
wildlife can go over the next hill into the next valley,'' said
Mark Pearson, chairman of the Sierra Club's National Wildlands
Committee. ``Well, this is the last next valley. There is no other
place wildlife can go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is helping lead a campaign to stop, or at least delay,
the Piano Ranch project by challenging developers as they seek
permits from federal, state and local governments for necessities
like road improvements, electric lines and sewage operations.
Opponents also say they intend to appeal any appy the Forest
Service, which is required for construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cancer in the heart of a national area,'' said Betty
Feazel, 83, who has lived on an 800-acre ranch at the foot of the
access road to the Piano Creek site since 1922 and remains a friend
of McCarthy despite the development plans. ``I don't think he
realizes how much impact this thing is going to have. People are
going to be crawling all over the whole area.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jo Bridges, a district ranger for the San Juan National
Forest, said that unless an environmental-impact study concluded
that development of Piano Creek posed insurmountable problems to
the forest, she would approve the project, as the first level of
review, and ``development will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said that opponents of the development would appeal her
approval to the Forest Service regional office and, if necessary,
to headquarters in Washington. Beyond that, either side could
appeal to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Sanders, chairman of the development company that is
buying the land from McCarthy, said in an interview that if Pearson
and others would only listen, they might be convinced that the
impact of the project on the area would be small and certainly less
than the ski resort once under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said he thought the opponents' public campaign had been
disingenuous, filled with half-truths and overstatements to attract
more allies. He cited as an example assertions that the project
would cover all 2,780 acres of the rectangle. That was wrong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not easy to believe a developer, that I could have
good intentions,'' he said, pointing out that he could just as
easily have built residential subdivisions. ``But I am trying to
protect the environment. I'm attracted to this area for the same
reasons other people are. Environmentalists want to see the land
remain pristine, and so do our members.''

CANADIAN REGULATORS FILE COMPLAINT AGAINST YBM MAGNEX AND ITS
OFFICERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's top securities regulator filed a complaint
Monday against YBM Magnex International and its senior managers and
directors, including former Premier David Peterson of Ontario,
accusing them of failing to disclose negative information about the
industrial magnet maker's business in a share offering prospectus
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario Securities Commissi the company and its
underwriters did not tell investors that the auditor Deloitte &AMP;
Touche had refused to sign YBM's 1997 accounts or undertake further
work until ``an in-depth forensic investigation'' had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The securities commission approved the prospectus after
discussions with company officials, despite concerns expressed by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about YBM's links to Russian
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, YBM shares were listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange and included in the TSE 300 index, but the company had no
Canadian operations. Its head office was in Pennsylvania, its
principal shareholding was in the Channel Islands, its
manufacturing plant was in Hungary and almost half its sales were
in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The securities commission said it had initiated proceedings
against Harry Antes, YBM's chairman; Jacob Bogatin, president and
chief executive; Daniel Gatti, vice president of finance, as well
as Peterson and another independent director. Peterson was premier
of Ontario from 1985 to 1990. Also named by the securities
commission were First Marathon Securities and Griffiths McBurney &AMP;
Partners, two Toronto-based securities firms that underwrote YBM's
stock issue.
</P>
<P>
   The securities commission will seek a permanent order to end
trading in YBM shares, which are now temporarily banned from
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In June, YBM pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to commit
mail fraud and securities fraud in the United States.

CLINTON URGES SUPREME COURT TO UPHOLD THE MIRANDA DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration came strongly to the
defense of the Miranda decision in a brief filed with the Supreme
Court Monday night, urging the justices to take up a legal
challenge to the 33-year-old legal landmark and to reaffirm a
decision that ``has come to play a unique and important role in the
nation's conception of our criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   The after-hours filing of the brief, following months of
deadline extensions from the court that ran out Monday, reflected
the political delicacy of the issue for an administration often on
guard against appearing too liberal on criminal justice questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some federal prosecutors and law-enforcement groups had urged
the administration to take the occasion to urge the court to
overturn the Miranda ruling, with its heavy price of suppressing a
suspect's incriminating statements if the police have not given the
famous warnings about the right to remain silent and the right to
consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the unusual nature of the brief's filing,
Attorney General Janet Reno's name was on the cover of the brief,
above that of Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman and several
assistants in his office. Ordinarily, the solicitor general files
the government's Supreme Court briefs in his own name, and the
attorney general's name does not appear.
</P>
<P>
   At issue before the Supreme Court, in a pending appeal by an
accused bank robber, is the validity of a law that Congress passed
in 1968, two years after the court decided Miranda vs. Arizona,
with the goal of overturning the decision in federal prosecutions.
The law, known as Section 3501 for its designation in Title 18 of
the United States code, provides that a confession is admissible as
long as it is ``voluntarily given'' in light of ``all the
circumstances,'' regardless of whether the suspect received any
specific warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has never relied on Section 3501 in the
31 years since it became law, and it has been essentially regarded
as a dead letter. But some conservative legal groups have been
trying to revive it, searching for a test case that the Washington
Legal Foundation finally found in the case of the Virginia bank
robber, Charles T. Dickerson. The federal district court in
Alexandria suppressed his confession in 1997 on the ground that he
had not received his Miranda warnings after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative policy and
litigation group, entered the case as a friend of the court when
the government's appeal of the district court's decision was before
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
Richmond. The legal foundation urged the appeals court to find the
confession admissible under Section 3501, and a three-judge panel
did so in a 2-to-1 decision last February that criticized the
Justice Department for not invoking the law itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson then appealed to the Supreme Court, which has not yet
announced whether it will hear the case, Dickerson vs. United
States, No. 99-5525. The core issue is whether the Miranda decision
was based on a constitutional interpretation of the Fifth
Amendment's protection against compelled self-incrimination, in
which case Congress had no authority to overrule it, or whether, as
the Fourth Circuit held, it simply announced a procedural rule that
need not be binding.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief Monday night, which described the case as ``one of
exceptional importance that warrants this court's review,'' the
administration said the court had made it clear that the Miranda
rules ``have a constitutional foundation'' that ``cannot be
superseded merely by legislation.''

 NEW YORK: the ocean.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The admiral also announced that searchers had detected a pinger
signal, apparently from the plane's flight data recorder or the
cockpit voice recorder. The vessels currently involved in the
search were not equipped to pinpoint the signal's location,
presumably on the ocean floor, but Navy ships arriving overnight
would have such equipment, he said, raising hope that one of the
black boxes might be recovered in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder is a 24-hour machine capable of holding
all the airplane's technical data, from speed and direction to
orientation, rate of fuel consumption and the exact positions of
all rudders, ailerons and other moving parts. The cockpit voice
recorder, fed by three microphones, has a 30-minute tape, and could
reveal what was said by the pilots throughout most of the flight,
especially in the crucial last two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While the crash of EgyptAir 990 was in some ways reminiscent of
that of Trans World Airlines 800 in July 1996 _ both fell into the
Atlantic shortly after leaving Kennedy Airport _ there were also
major differences. TWA 800 blew up in midair, while there is as yet
no evidence of any explosion aboard the Egyptian plane.
</P>
<P>
   And, officials said Monday, the recovery operations for EgyptAir
990 are going to be substantially different. The plane's watery
grave off Nantucket is 240 to 270 feet deep, twice the depth of the
water off the south Shore of Long Island, where TWA 800 went down.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover the water off Nantucket is much colder now than the
summertime waters where the TWA wreckage was raised. And the TWA
recovery site was close to shore, while the EgyptAir site is over
50 miles offshore, compounding the difficulties of diving,
recovering parts of the plane and transporting them to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the advancing season of autumn. Larrabee
noted Monday that rain and high winds were expected to buffet the
search area Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Navy's Norfolk-based ship USS Grapple was
expected to arrive Tuesday with a remotely operated submersile
vehicle that would be used to locate debris underwater. In
addition, the navy ship USS Mohawk, from Philadelphia, was
expected. It has sonar equipment that would enable the Navy to
create a three-dimensional map of the ocean floor and objects
resting on it.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage of the Egyptian aircraft is believed to be resting
on the bottom near the site of several shipwrecks including the
luxury liner Andrea Doria, which sank in July 1956, after colliding
with the Swedish ship Stockholm. The sea floor in the area is
believed to be relatively smooth, so objects would be more readily
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty relatives and friends of the crash victims arrived in
Newport on a chartered flight from New York on Monday afternoon and
were met by two buses that took them to the Newport Islander
Doubletree Hotel, a secluded place on a small island off Newport.
They did not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But George Arian, the publisher of a small Arabic newspaper in
New Jersey who said he was acting as an unofficial spokesman for
the group, said, ``Everyone was weeping and crying on the plane,
and the Red Cross people talked to them.'' He said about 100
relatives of victims were expected to arrive from Cairo and would
also be put up at the hotel.

CHAPPAQUA PASSES A NEW LAW AS IT GETS READY TO WELCOME THE
CLINTONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton
closed on their $1.7 million house here Monday without attending
the closing, but their presence was felt in the neighborhood long
before they signed the papers and wrote the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the Town Board of New Castle, which includes the
hamlet of Chappaqua, passed a law requiring that protesters get a
permit before demonstrating along its quiet woodsy roads. Last
month, officials from the Secret Service and the Federal Aviation
Administration met to discuss increasing the altitude at which
planes must fly over the Clintons' new house, which is under the
landing path to the busy Westchester County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to put up with the demonstrations but we won't
have the noise from the planes,'' said Clinton B. Smith, the New
Castle town supervisor. ``So I guess we'll take the good with the
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' lawyers handled the details of the closing Monday
at the Manhattan law firm Battle Fowler. The loan, for $1.36
million, is a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage, starting with an
annual interest rate of 7.5 percent for three years, said Jim
Kennedy, a White House spokesman. The loan, from the PNC Mortgage,
a subsidiary of PNC Bank Corp. of Pittsburgh, allowed the Clintons
to call off a much-criticized arrangement with a Democratic Party
fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, who had guaranteed an earlier loan
with $1.35 million of his money as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   In the new mortgage, the Clintons put up a 20 percent down
payment, or $340,000. Neither of the Clintons attended the closing,
and they made no announcement on when they planned to move in.
</P>
<P>
   But owning property does not necessarily a New Yorker make.
</P>
<P>
   Though she now officially owns about an acre in New York state,
Mrs. Clinton was not considered a New Yorker by 69 percent of the
people questioned between Oct. 23 and Oct. 28 for a New York
Times/CBS poll, and 43 percent thought she could not effectively
represent New York in the Senate without having lived here for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   But to some people in Chappaqua, however, the newcomers already
seem like a lingering headache.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the New Castle Town Board has considered creating a
law to regulate an onslaught of demonstrations they expect the
Clintons' presence to invite. The board began considering the law
in September after a small group of demonstrators marched in front
of the house, a white clapboard colonial on Old House Lane, to
protest mass killings in East Timor. The Clintons had not moved in
and the couple they bought the house from had not moved out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to know what's coming,'' Smith said of the need for
the new law, which requires organizers of demonstrations and
parades of more than 10 people to apply for a permit at least a
week in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make sure we don't have overlapping demonstrations.
Otherwise it could overwhelm the police and disrupt traffic.
Besides, if I'm a protester holding a sit-down demonstration in the
middle of Route 117, I'm going to hope that somebody's around the
bend telling cars to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   When most people buy a house, they have to consider the impact
that a nearby airport might have on their lives. In the Clintons'
case, the airport has to worry. The house is about a mile from the
landing beacon that pilots follow to approach the Westchester
County Airport in bad weather. Depending on the altitude
requirement, the Clintons' presence could have a significant
impact, said Berl Brechner, president of the Westchester Aviation
Association, which represents 170 corporate and private plane
owners who use the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester County Airport handles 200,000 annual takeoffs
and landings and a million passengers a year on commercial
airlines, corporate jets and privately owned planes, Brechner said.
To land safely on Runway 16, which 90 percent of the planes use,
pilots have to fly about 2,000 feet above sea level or, because of
Chappaqua's hilly terrain, about 1,500 feet above the Clintons'
house, Brechner estimated. Any restriction requiring pilots to fly
higher would mean the approach to the airport would have to be
changed. Such a change would carry the risk of a plane's
encountering dangerous tailwinds, Brechner said.
</P>
<P>
   James Peters, a spokesman for the FAA, said the Secret Service
had not yet requested that the FAA study the potential impact a
flight restriction in the area. Given that the Clintons now own the
house, the Secret Service is expected to make that request shortly.

CATHOLIC LEAGUE CHIEF OFFENDS SOME BUT GETS RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Donohue refuses to lunch with the rich and
powerful even though, he says, they come courting. He hardly ever
takes phone calls _ unless, of course, they are from people like
Cardinal John O'Connor _ and he never lets anyone tell him what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so easy for others to dismiss Donohue, the
outspoken president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's scathing attacks on the blasphemous and the irreverent
in movies, magazines and art exhibitions have transformed his group
into one of the most visible defenders of the Roman Catholic
Church. The Catholic League, which is not officially part of the
church, gets $2.7 million a year in donations but its tactics have
drawn the ire of artists, community leaders and even some
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Donohue spent $34,500 for a full-page ad in The
New York Times that assailed Vanity Fair and its publisher, Conde
Nast, for three stories that he said tried to discredit O'Connor,
Mother Teresa and Pope Pius XII. The headline trumpeted: ``Conde
Nast has a Problem with Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic League members also handed out ``vomit bags'' outside
the Brooklyn Museum of Art to protest the Oct. 2 opening of
``Sensation,'' which features a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned
with elephant dung. Donohue dispatched a flurry of letters urging
New York City Council members to cut off public funding. He called
on Catholic schoolteachers to boycott the museum for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the Marines who go in and clear the forest,''
Donohue said as he plunged a fork into the macaroni salad that he
had for lunch on Thursday in his rented office in the archdiocese
headquarters in Manhattan. He was eating at his desk, alone as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has something to say,'' he said. ``People can agree
or disagree, but I would hope when they disagree, they can do it
respectfully. There's a cacophony of catcalls stopping that message
from getting out at the moment, and what I want to do is give it a
fair hearing _ and then walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say the Catholic League _ whose symbol is a shield
and sword _ only worsens the din.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and associate editor of
America, a national Catholic magazine, said he disagreed as often
as he agreed with the Catholic League. He called the group a
``double-edged sword'' because of its eagerness to plunge into one
fray after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often their criticism is right on target, but frequently they
speak without seeing or experiencing what they are critiquing, and
that undercuts their credibility,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, that
type of response gives people the idea that the Catholic Church is
unreflective.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, 52, a former sociology professor who lives in Mineola,
took over the 11,000-member Catholic League in 1993 and
reinvigorated it with his personal blend of religious pragmatism
and media savvy. Although he supports the church's teachings on
life-and-death issues like abortion and the death penalty, he
steers clear of divisive debates on theological doctrines and
secular politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at all like the Christian Coalition, which, let's
face it, is the Christian arm of the Republican Party,'' said
Donohue, who is an independent voter. ``I don't care about the
Republicans, and I don't care about the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Catholic League has grown to an estimated 350,000
members (Donohue multiplies the number of households that donate
money by 1.5 to include spouses and other family members).
</P>
<P>
   But he counts no Hyannisport Kennedys among them. He said Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani had never written the organization a check. And
the one time Donohue met with Peter Vallone, the City Council
speaker, was outside Yankee Stadium; Donohue introduced himself and
told Vallone he was wrong on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Donohue's support comes from rank-and-file Catholics
like Jodie Thompson, a real estate developer in Dallas, who has
given $50,000 in the last two years, making him the league's
biggest donor. ``I think a lot of Catholics are fed up with attacks
on Catholicism and Christianity, too,'' Thompson said. ``There
aren't attacks on Jews, Buddhists or Hindus. If someone attacks
other faiths, they would be severely criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue fans this simmering anger with inflammatory news
releases, a Web site and a newsletter, The Catalyst, which condemn
everything from Miramax movies to tasteless jokes about nuns. Every
other month, he requests donations for a large ad or some other
project. He writes personal notes to those who give more than $250.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League receives no money from the church, but it
maintains close ties to the leadership. Several bishops make
personal donations. O'Connor spoke at the group's 25th-anniversary
reception in 1998 and vacated part of his suite for its expanding
operations, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Donohue denies that he does O'Connor's bidding. ``I swear on
the Bible,'' he said. ``We are not a front group for the cardinal.
Nobody calls the shots here.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, that is, but Donohue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He leads the crusade against anti-Catholicism from his tidy
corner office lined with religious awards and pictures of Christ,
the Virgin Mary and various saints. Unexpectedly, there is also a
silver-framed photo of Donohue with Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, at a recent news
conference. ``People are surprised that Norm and I are friends,''
he said. ``You know why I like him? Because he's a straight
shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Siegel said that he has come to respect Donohue's
aggressive leadership of the Catholic League _ and to view him as a
formidable opponent. He described Donohue as a ``populist'' who
frequently takes extreme ``bunker-type positions'' to appeal to
religious conservatives. ``He's a bright, well-read individual, but
he wants to be a kind of intellectual Archie Bunker,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue concedes that his tactics can be, well, uncharitable,
but he points to the results. When he calls for a protest or
boycott, he commands attention. ``My predecessors in the Catholic
League were losers who always took the softest approach possible,
and we saw where it got them,'' he said. ``I'm saying I want
results and fast results.''

LEADING BLACK NEW YORKERS MEET PRIVATELY WITH GORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two months after Bill Bradley delivered a speech on
race relations at a public hall in Harlem, Vice President Al Gore
met privately Monday with two dozen prominent black New Yorkers,
some of whom urged him to begin campaigning in black communities
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is obvious that he was dealt with on this,'' the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who was host to Bradley at the Harlem speech in
late August, said of the meeting with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly brought that up,'' Sharpton said. ``And we
certainly expect that he will do what his opponent has done _ and
what Bush has done.'' Sharpton was referring to a visit by Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas to a public school in Harlem since he began
his run for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The session with Gore lasted just under an hour and was attended
by a cross-section of black New York religious and political
figures, including H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller; State
Assemblyman Clarence Norman, the Brooklyn Democratic leader, and
former Mayor David N. Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appearance was at the headquarters of Sharpton's
National Action Network, just off 125th Street, Gore's at the
elegant apartment of the lawyer Victor A. Kovner on a quiet block
on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not stop to discuss the meeting with reporters
afterward, jumping into his limousine with a wave and heading off
for a dinner party arranged by Tina Brown, the editor of Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the latest in a number of private sessions Gore
has arranged to shore up his standing with essential segments of an
electorate that will determine the Democratic presidential
nomination. The meetings are taking place at a time when many
Democrats believe that the vice president is facing a particularly
fierce challenge in the New York primary by Bradley, former senator
from New Jersey and a onetime player for the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted from Oct. 23 to Oct. 28
found that among registered New York Democrats, 42 percent said
they would prefer to see Gore as their party's nominee, compared
with 37 percent for Bradley. But that difference was within the
poll's margin of sampling error.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the state's highest-ranking black official, said Gore
had called him and asked him to arrange the meeting that took place
Monday. McCall, who is supporting Gore, said the session had not
been arranged in response to Bradley's visit to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a reaction to what anyone else has done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Bradley's approach to his appearance in Harlem, Gore
did not seem to want public attention drawn to his meeting.
Although his aides alerted reporters to some events on the vice
president's schedule _ including a taping at ABC News _ they did
not mention the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But Kovner's apartment is across the street from the entrance to
ABC, and reporters who had gathered there in hopes of questioning
the vice president took note of the appearance of first Sharpton
and then Dinkins. Gore's aides and Secret Service agents kept
newspaper photographers across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dinkins and McCall praised the vice president's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the usual kind of issues _ a lot of concern about
education and the homeless,'' Dinkins said. ``The vice president
was forthright, responsive and tremendously articulate.''

DIGITAL CONTRACT BILL FAILS IN HOUSE VOTE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Monday turned back a proposal that would
have given digital contracts the legal weight of ink and paper. The
outcome essentially killed the bill's chance of passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote _ to suspend House rules and so allow for speedy
consideration of the measure _ was 234 in favor and 122 against, a
bit shy of the two-thirds majority needed. The rules suspension was
sought by Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who is
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, and was opposed by the
White House and Democratic leaders, who maintained that the measure
would undercut consumer protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they supported the bill's goal, the fostering
of electronic commerce, but contended that the legislation would,
for instance, undermine requirements that banks, insurers and
credit card companies notify consumers by mail about overdue
payments, cancellations and changes in the terms of their
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill is pending in the Senate, but it too is unlikely
to win passage this year, given Democratic opposition.

   More resolute than bereft, Patricia Rose is making a memorial
journal of the final two weeks in the life of Walla Zeid, a
19-year-old student from Luxor, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that her family know how their child spent her
last two weeks on earth,'' Mrs. Rose explained Monday at Dunbar
High School in Baltimore, where Ms. Zeid and three other Egyptian
exchange students spent two all-too-fleeting weeks of schooling and
socializing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be pictures of Walla from every day she was with us
so her family has a memory of what their child was like,'' said
Mrs. Rose, glancing over at her own daughter, Chantel, a
17-year-old Dunbar senior grieving for her newfound friend, now
lost. ``That family sent their child to me for two weeks and didn't
know she wasn't going to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   All over the world Monday, families and friends sifted through
pictures _ mental and sentimental ones as well as photographs _ of
the 217 passengers and crew members who died Sunday when EgyptAir
Flight 990 fell into the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   There were children and retirees, business people and
vacationers. Many of the victims were traveling in groups: more
than 30 Egyptian military officers returning home from a variety of
missions across the country; six supervisory engineers from the
Egyptian branch of the oil giant BP Amoco PTL; 30 adventurous
Americans on an Elderhostel tour; a foursome of card players from
Southern California, and the Egyptian students at Dunbar High in
downtown Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, a dozen parents, teachers and students
pondered the frightening news that came so soon after they had
thrown a jubilant bon voyage celebration Saturday at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's kind of numb,'' said the principal, Dr. Joyce Ilean
Jennings, who had been host to one of the students, 12-year-old
Gehed Mohamed, and to her father, Hosam Mohamed Ahmed, the tour
chaperone and a tourism director from Egypt who also perished on
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the airport with them Saturday, it was like Christmas, so
glorious,'' Dr. Jennings said, describing how Gehed beamed and
waved goodbye as she trod down the jetway in a pair of oversize
Winnie-the-Pooh bedroom slippers, a gift from Chantel Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Sameh Morkos, a 15-year-old student, was remembered by his
American friend, 17-year-old Chris Hill, for a spontaneous sense of
humor that endeared him to all sorts of people as he mugged his way
through class and darted in open wonder through the city's shopping
malls. ``We laughed a lot,'' Chris said. ``He was just like a
second little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris and the others who grew close to the visitors said they
were determined to carry out the second half of the exchange
program, however nervous the Dunbar party might be when they take
off next spring for Luxor, where their visitors had lived. ``I have
a lot to say to Sameh's family about the way their son was, about
the last days he was here on earth, days full of joy and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Imilda Kolander, 66, who traveled the world with her husband and
on her own, was not quite fearless, but almost, said her husband,
Harry. On a trip up Mount Ararat in Turkey, she was taken as a
hostage by Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mil had a wonderful life,'' Kolander, of San Ramon, Calif.,
said in a telephone conversation punctuated with deep sighs. ``She
was a fulfilled person.''
</P>
<P>
   She put a Dramamine patch behind her ear on Saturday and boarded
EgyptAir Flight 990 for a tour that was to take her to Egypt and
Jordan to pursue a deep interest in antiquities, he said. She had
put off an operation to replace both knees, he said, because she
wanted to take the trip. ``She said: `It ain't hurtin' bad enough.
I'm going to let it hurt a little longer,''' said Kolander, who
loved to travel, but could no longer accompany her because he had
developed diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kolander, who is also survived by a daughter and a son, had
seen much of what she wanted to see of the world, from China and
the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, to the Balkans, the
Himalayas and outer Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   She lost interest in traveling only once, after a trip to Turkey
in 1990. While climbing Mount Ararat, she and several members of
her small tour group were intercepted by Kurdish rebels who were
apparently interested in taking an American hostage, Kolander said.
She was forced to walk from about 10,000 feet up the mountain to
14,000 feet, where she passed out. Her captors decided she was an
unsuitable hostage, and sent her down the mountain, where she was
later picked up by a truck driver and turned over to military
police. It was a year before she traveled again.
</P>
<P>
   Then she went back to Turkey to finish her trip.
</P>
<P>
   The joke around the radiology department at the Veterans Affairs
Hospital in Chillicothe, Ohio, was that when Dr. Adel Elkousy, the
department's chief, and his administrative assistant, Milly New,
both retired in a few years, they would have to go to the
courthouse for a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent more time with each other than with our spouses,''
Ms. New said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   They had worked together for 22 years, since Elkousy, 67, first
arrived at the hospital. ``We didn't think of him as the boss,''
Ms. New said of herself and the department's nine other employees.
``He was Doc.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a Muslim; Ms. New, and the other employees, were
Christian. They celebrated each other's holidays. Born in Luxor,
Egypt, and a graduate of the University of Cairo, Elkousy had
become an American citizen, with his wife, Wafaa. He was so
appreciative of America's rights and freedoms that before he and
his wife left for their two month trip to Egypt _ a pilgrimage they
made every other year _ he filled out an absentee ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Serious in demeanor outside the hospital, he welcomed practical
jokes and tricks within its walls. ``He said: `We deal with death.
We deal with illness. We have to be able to laugh,''' Ms. New said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone called him Doc, even at the Big Bear Grocery, where he
went almost daily. He was so well loved at the store that employees
would bake special muffins just for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they were a very private family, said Joanne Stevens, a
neighbor and friend. What was public was Mrs. Elkousy's pride in
her two sons: Hussein and Mohamed, tennis stars in high school,
doctors in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Elkousy had relatives in Egypt, so every other year they
made their visit home. Before he left, on Friday, the doctor
embraced his employees, who were apprehensive about his trip. Ms.
New said she was crying. He looked at her and said, ``I'm going
home.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They found each other late in life, after long careers in
science and social work. They had raised eight children between the
two of them, and lost their first spouses to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Brokaw, 76, and Virginia Chaplin, 72, were just
getting started together.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds _ they celebrated their first anniversary on Oct.
23 _ split their time between his home at the foot of the Green
Mountains in Strafford, Vt., and her home overlooking the Atlantic
in Georgetown, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The two were studying Homer's ``Iliad'' for a future trip to
Greece, and had planned to ski the slopes of St. Moritz in January.
``They loved life, knowledge and learning, both of them,'' said
Mrs. Chaplin's daughter Anne Chaplin Gould of Kennebunkport, Maine.
``They weren't the type to just take a cruise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw retired in 1973 after 20 years at the NASA John H. Glenn
Research Center in Cleveland, where he received an achievement
medal for his study of gases during combustion. Mrs. Chaplin served
on the national board of the YWCA in the 1970s, and continued to
volunteer with the organization. When she was in her 60s, she
enrolled in classes at the Divinity School at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw and Mrs. Chaplin met a decade ago, when they were
traveling with their spouses on an Elderhostel trip in Greece. The
couples remained friends, and after tragedy struck years later,
Brokaw and Mrs. Chaplin came together in support and friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their friendship blossomed into love,'' said Brokaw's daughter
Frances Brokaw of Norwich, Vt. ``They were happy together. I felt
like they were so lucky to find each other at the end of their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   They were a foursome: a quartet of women in Orange County,
Calif., who were brought together by the card game Pan.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Grant, Judy Bowman, Sheila Jaffee and Tobey Seidman
played together with three or four others each Thursday night for
several years. Mrs. Grant's son-in-law, Randy Garell, said the
three others had planned the three-week trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bev had already been to that part of world but she was one of
these people who said, `I'd like to go,''' Garell said. ``So she
decided to go, too.'' He said the women were particularly looking
forward to a boat trip down the Nile. ``I'm sure they were going to
play a lot of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his mother-in-law worked every day in the sporting goods
store owned by her daughter, Alexa, and Garell. She is also
survived by three sons and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most 23-year-olds couldn't have kept up with her,'' Garell
said. ``She really was in the prime of her life, at 82.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Schwenk, the 39-year-old manager of business development at
the Palm Computing division of 3Com Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif.,
was following one of his several passions when he took off on
vacation with his girlfriend, her parents, his mother, Erica
Schwenk of Hilton, N.Y., and his sister and brother-in-law, Mitzie
Schwenk and Will Jackson of Scotch Plains, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a regular world traveler,'' said Betty Taylor, a
Silicon Valley public relations executive who was a friend of
Schwenk's. She said he had recently traveled in Spain and Ireland
and had trekked in the Himalayas in Nepal last year. ``We all
described Kurt as someone who was larger than life. He had a big
personality and a great sense of humor and wit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwenk's other passions were skiing and rugby, she said. He
played for the San Jose Seahawks, an amateur team. Another outdoor
passion was skiing, said Nancy Keith Kelly, a friend who is vice
president and group manager at the Fleishman-Hillard public
relations agency in Singapore. She summed up his philosophy of life
this way: ``The more stamps on your passport the more fun life
becomes.''
</P>
<P>
   To their neighbors in Ridgefield, Conn., they were Natalie and
Martin Greenberg. To each other, they were ``sweetheart'' and
``doll.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jon Haddon of Temple Sherith Israel was planning to help
the couple renew their marriage vows on their 50th anniversary in
May. ``I never remember not seeing them together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were also planning to celebrate the occasion this spring
with a cruise in Alaska, with their only daughter and two
grandchildren. But the Greenbergs, avid travelers and tennis
players, did not reach that milestone. They had set off Saturday on
their first trip to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a hard time staying home,'' said Karl Holzthum, who
played bridge with the Greenbergs. Neighbors and friends in this
New York suburb, where they had lived for more than 25 years, said
Greenberg, a semiretired toy salesman, enjoyed his subscription to
the New York Philharmonic, until his hearing started to fail. A
former secretary in the Bronx public schools, Mrs. Greenberg used
to enjoy hikes with friends, but had double hip replacement surgery
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hadden recalled seeing them power-walking through town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lived life to the hilt,'' he said, ``and really
contemplated this trip as the trip of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Norman and Joan Shapiro and Larry and Edith Kowalsky were close
friends for nearly half a century in metropolitan Detroit before
they boarded the EgyptAir flight for what was supposed to have been
a day in Cairo followed by a two-week photography safari in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, 70, and Kowalsky, 74, attended pharmacy school at Wayne
State University in the early 1950s and became friends soon after
graduation through a professional organization of pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   Kowalsky ``was the kind of pharmacist in the neighborhood that
you'd go to and say, `I have something wrong with my ear,' and he'd
recommend something off the shelf,'' said John Moscheck, who owns a
butcher shop across the street from where the Kowalskys' drug store
used to be in Allen Park, Mich. Kowalsky and his wife, Edith, 68,
are survived by four sons and six grandchildren, said one of their
sons, Steven Kowalsky.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro so enjoyed meeting customers that he continued to work
full time for several years after he sold his pharmacy in 1992, and
was still working on Saturdays until the crash, said Richard Kerr,
the manager of the CVS drug store in Bloomfield Township, Mich.,
that bought Shapiro's business. Joan Shapiro, 64, wrote at least
two published romance novels. They are survived by two sons and a
daughter, said Ben-Zion Lanxner, the rabbi and cantor at their
synagogue, Congregation B'nai David.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Gale, the assistant director of the Jewish Community
Council of Metropolitan Detroit, said their presence on the flight
was a testament to progress in the Middle East. Until recently, he
said, ``I don't think you'd find many Jews flying on EgyptAir
unless they had relatives in Cairo.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fitzpatrick had lived on Long Island's North Fork for
only three years, but to his neighbors on Old Wood Path in
Southold, N.Y., he may as well have been a lifelong resident.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old retiree took long, solitary walks through the
woods to Great Peconic Bay, but stopped often to chitchat. ``He
made a lot of friends out here,'' said Doug Jacobs, who lives a few
doors away from Fitzpatrick and his wife, Sharon Fitzpatrick, 67.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick volunteered with the Scenic Byways Advisory
Committee, a group of town residents that for two years has been
formulating a land-use plan to maintain the rural character of
Southold. Mrs. Fitzpatrick also became a fixture, supporting a
budding arts community that brought concerts to the town and arts
programs to schools.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had lived for years in Port Washington, N.Y., but
when Fitzpatrick retired as the manager of a Lord &AMP; Taylor store in
Garden City, N.Y., and Mrs. Fitzpatrick retired as an English
teacher at Hempstead, N.Y., High School, they left the big house
where they had raised four children and moved to a cozy saltbox
colonial nestled in the woods in Southold.
</P>
<P>
   There, Fitzpatrick could take his walks and Mrs. Fitzpatrick,
who wrote poetry and fiction, could work on her mystery novels, two
of which she was trying to publish. The couple, who were married 44
years, could also put up their four grown children and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the children gathered at the Southold home, where
they fielded phone calls from friends and relatives, and
reminisced. ``Whatever fear or pain they felt,'' Sean said, ``they
were holding hands when it happened, and we're glad they were
together.''

AMERICA MEDIA TO ACQUIRE GLOBE COMMUNICATIONS FOR $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Change in ninth graf.) 
 (ms)

<P>
   In an era when Congress worries about multibillion-dollar
megamergers and corporate chieftains with creased, sweaty brows
testify before congressional subcommittees about the threat of
monopolization, one question has yet to rear its head: What happens
if one media company starts to corner the market on tabloid gossip?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, America may find out as The National Enquirer (this
week's headline: ``Woody Allen's Bizarre Lust for Young Girls'')
and The Star (``Hunky Prince William is Moving to U.S.: Look Out
Girls'') are joined in tabloid bliss with The Globe (``Ravaged TV
Beauty Beats Booze!'') under the same owners.
</P>
<P>
   American Media, the company that owns the National Enquirer and
the Star tabloid newspapers, is expected to announce Tuesday that
it will acquire the Globe Communications Corp. for $100 million in
cash, said executives close to the deal. The price is five times
Globe Communications' annual cash flow of about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   American Media is owned by Evercore Capital Partners, LLC, which
is headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman, who
is a close friend of the President and Mrs. Clinton, arguably the
first family not only of the country, but of the tabloid press.
Altman had no comment about the deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will join The Globe, a 40-year-old weekly tabloid with
a penchant for Elvis sightings and alien landings, and the
approximately 30 other titles owned by Globe Communications _
including Crack'd, Horoscopes and The National Examiner _ with The
National Enquirer, Star, Weekly World News and Country Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   When completed the deal will not only annoy celebrities and pump
up the nation's Elvis-memorabilia market, but will assure that
almost half of the nation's supermarket check-out tabloids are
under one corporate umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe is best known for publishing more front-page articles
about the JonBenet Ramsey murder case than any other tabloid, and
scored a coup, of sorts, by publishing the crime-scene photographs
of that murder. The editor, Tony Frost, was not available for
comment on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been on and off for years; Globe Communications has
long been the apple of The National Enquirer's eye. The previous
owner of The Enquirer, Peter Callahan, attempted to buy Globe
Communications at least three times, said an executive familiar
with the negotiations. But Michael Rosenbloom, the Montreal
businessman who owns the Globe, became concerned that the
Department of Justice would investigate the potential for monopoly
_ as indeed the Justice Department did briefly when Callahan bought
Star from Rupert Murdoch in 1990. That investigation was fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase comes at a time of growth and change for the
Enquirer: The tabloid is trying to go legitimate under its new
ownership. In February of this year, Evercore purchased the
Enquirer and the Star for $294 million from its joint owners,
Boston Ventures and MacFadden Holdings, Inc., and hired David J.
Pecker, the former president and chief executive of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines, to be the chief executive of American Media.
</P>
<P>
   At American Media, Pecker's goal, along with his partners at
Evercore, has been to extend the National Enquirer brand to an
array of new ventures that may include more television programming,
new magazines _ such as Enquirer spinoffs for teenagers and
Hispanic readers _ and online services. Pecker has overseen a
redesign by the same designer who has redesigned The New Republic,
and Pecker has introduced an advertising campaign intended to
portray the National Enquirer as a respected celebrity news source.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potential for conflict among the staffs of the
tabloids, said an executive familiar with the personnel at both
companies. Whenever staff members are dismissed at the National
Enquirer or Star, the executive said, many of them would just ``go
down the road'' and get a job at the Globe; all three newspaper are
currently based in Lantana, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Murray, a vice president at Dirks Van Essen, a newspaper
brokerage company in Santa Fe, N.M., said that American Media is
broadening its demographic reach with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are getting a spectrum of different readers so you can go
to advertisers and offer them the range of demographics or a
specific demographic,'' he said. The Enquirer, Star and the Globe
``were fighting in the same space. If you control the content of
all three, you can tailor them so they reach different people,''
then sell advertisers either the combined audience or one segment
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Leslee Dart, a public-relations executive at PMK, a firm that
manages the images of celebrities like Tom Cruise, said that
celebrities would just have to contend with the new gossip
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, by the way, I've always felt it was better to have all
your enemies contained in one spot,'' Ms. Dart said.

EDITORIAL: THE JUDGMENT ON `SENSATION' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Delivering a ringing endorsement of the First Amendment as well
as a stinging rebuke to New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Judge
Nina Gershon ruled Monday that Giuliani's efforts to punish the
Brooklyn Museum of Art for mounting a controversial display of
modern art had violated the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no federal constitutional issue more grave,'' she
wrote, ``than the effort by government officials to censor works of
expression and to threaten the vitality of a major cultural
institution as punishment for failing to abide by governmental
demands for orthodoxy.'' She then ordered the mayor to resume city
payments to the museum and end his campaign to evict the museum
from city land and to fire its board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, though welcome to all those who care about freedom
of expression, does not dispel the deep concern raised by
disclosures in Sunday's New York Times that the museum had
solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies and
individuals with a commercial interest in the exhibition. Indeed,
Giuliani quickly seized upon these disclosures to buttress his
contention that Judge Gershon's ruling was ``precipitous'' and said
he would appeal the case to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had earlier charged the museum with maintaining an
improper relationship with Charles Saatchi, the owner of the art,
and Christie's, the auction house that has sold Saatchi's works in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The additional details that The Times has produced about this
relationship, as well as several new disclosures, do not in any
sense undercut the museum's First Amendment right to display the
art. But the possibility that a publicly supported museum was being
used to inflate the commercial value of the artists on display has
made many people uneasy, not only the mayor. The new details about
the museum's fund-raising methods will not dispel this unease.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Times, the museum solicited and obtained funds
from an apparently reluctant Saatchi himself, and then hid his
financial role from the public under the cloak of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, museum officials misled the press when explicitly
asked whether Saatchi had provided funding for the exhibition.
Museum officials also raised money from art dealers who represent
several of the artists in the exhibition, and gave Christie's
privileged access to its exhibit halls for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The financing revelations may well do more to jeopardize support
for the Brooklyn Museum and its leadership than has exhibiting
``Sensation'' itself. The exhibition looks like aesthetic
enterprise, the manner of paying for it like an ethically dubious
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Museums have usually drawn the line at displaying privately
owned collections. It is a simple standard and an effective one,
even if it is not foolproof. There is no clearer evidence of its
value as a standard than the questions raised by the funding of
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   But those questions should not obscure the importance of the
fundamental constitutional issue that the court has now ruled upon.
Giuliani would be well advised to forgo any effort to appeal the
decision. The museum's funding practices do not justify an attempt
to override its First Amendment rights to choose the art it will
display without political interference.

EDITORIAL: THE POLITICS OF IMPERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Life would be simple for presidential candidates if they did not
have advisers. Vice President Gore is the latest to discover this,
thanks to the amusing report in Time magazine that he is being
urged to quit behaving like a ``beta male,'' to wear earth-toned
suits and to look for opportunities to bash President Clinton,
whose alpha maleness Gore has to conquer. It is, as we have been
saying, going to be a great campaign year.
</P>
<P>
   The above advice was urged on Gore by Naomi Wolf, the feminist
author who made her mark on the 1996 campaign by advising Clinton
to reshape his political persona into that of the reliable father.
No doubt he wishes he had listened. Her advice to Gore seems pretty
reasonable, except for the earth tones. It is a rule of American
politics that Ronald Reagan was the only president who could get
away with brown suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the real significance of this little flap is that of a
mileage marker in the campaign. We are entering that stage of the
contest when candidates' organizations, their histories and their
personalities start generating news. This happens because everyone
takes a closer look when the field is winnowed to a serious
handful, and the body politic and the press discover yet again that
each contender has his foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may be lucky in taking his lumps early, for the spotlight
will swing to each candidate. Former Sen. Bill Bradley, praised
today for his Zen-like calm, will be examined tomorrow for signs of
remoteness.
</P>
<P>
   The testing process is already moving along smartly on the
Republican side, where the curiosity about Gov. George W. Bush's
alleged drug use ebbs and flows, but never quite disappears. Now
Sen. John McCain is threatening Bush's front-runner status in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the subject of McCain's temper has been explored in a
recent New York Times article, which was cited in turn in a tough
editorial in The Arizona Republic. The editorial dismissed as
``hogwash'' McCain's contention that he does not fly off the
handle. Like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton before him, McCain may
discover that dark-horse candidates from smaller states find it
especially hard to convince their old neighbors that they are ready
for the big time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a natural tendency in each momentarily besieged
candidate to think that his or her opponents are getting a free
ride. But over time, just about everyone gets a chance to deal with
a campaign crisis. The responses help the public to measure the
guts and intelligence of the candidate and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   It is an imperfect process, to be sure. In 1996, for example,
campaign combat exposed the deep strain of sourness and pessimism
in Bob Dole's personality. But the skills at crisis management
demonstrated by Bill Clinton in his 1992 campaign did not transfer
into a disciplined performance in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Only one recent president has slipped through his campaigns and
the White House without revealing deep truths about himself. Ronald
Reagan was surrounded by aides who liked to maintain an air of
mystery about how much he knew and how engaged he was with his job.
The mystery endures to this day, and on the evidence of ``Dutch,''
it confounded even Reagan's official biographer, Edmund Morris.
</P>
<P>
   That alone should remind us not to look away from the messy or
silly moments on the campaign trail. Most candidates are not as
successfully opaque as Reagan, and in the hundreds of small
decisions that must be made between Iowa and the inauguration _
decisions as diverse as suit color and how to finance health care _
they reveal themselves. If the electorate is lucky, the winner
gathers the strength demanded by the office.

   With the police patrolling Tiananmen Square in ever larger

CHASE REDUCES REVENUE AND FIRES TRADER FOR BOOKING NONEXISTENT
PROFITS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK MCGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's third-largest
bank, said Monday that its fourth-quarter trading revenue would be
reduced by $60 million after the bank found it had booked
nonexistent trading profits. The bank has dismissed a currency
trader involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials declined to identify the trader or to say why he
was fired. But people inside the bank said that a senior currency
trader named Christopher Goggins was dismissed last week after an
internal audit found that he had been exploiting a flaw in the
bank's trading systems to record gains on long-term trades that the
bank could not realize.
</P>
<P>
   They said the bank had not determined whether the breach was
deliberate or inadvertent. Traders are usually compensated based on
their annual trading performance.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Goggins' home in New Jersey
said he was no longer employed at Chase. Goggins did not respond to
messages left at the home.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Chase said that no money was embezzled from the
bank and that no customer funds were affected. Chase also noted
that the $60 million cut in fourth-quarter revenue was barely
significant to a bank with trading revenue of $2.2 billion in the
first nine months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is something that they're embarrassed about and
should be embarrassed about,'' said Lawrence Cohn, director of
research at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in Livingston, N.J. ``It's a breakdown
in their internal control mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the paper gains will reduce the bank's net
income this quarter by about 5 cents a share, analysts said.
Chase's stock dropped $3.6875 a share Monday, or 4 percent, to
$83.5625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   According to people inside Chase, the trader had taken advantage
of slight discrepancies in the bank's pricing of currency and
interest-rate contracts for about a year. The trades involved
currency forwards, or contracts to buy or sell currencies at a
predetermined price on a future date. To limit risk, such trades
typically involve the simultaneous purchase of one contract and
sale of another.
</P>
<P>
   These people said the trader was inflating the paper profits on
his trades by using inappropriate methods to measure their value.
The small differences in those pricing methods added up as the size
of the positions grew larger through the year, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was picking and choosing from two different cash streams on
the same contracts to make it look like profits were being made
that really weren't,'' one Chase executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase officials declined to say whether the bank planned to take
legal action against the trader.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who were briefed on the matter by a Chase executive
said they were persuaded that the bank had rooted out the problem
and repaired the flaw in its systems that allowed it to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn said that as he heard about the problem, he was reminded of
Joseph Jett, a one-time star trader at Kidder, Peabody, the
now-defunct securities firm. Jett was dismissed from Kidder after
he was said to have exploited flaws in Kidder's risk-management
systems to book huge gains on trades that the firm never realized.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, an arbitration panel rejected Kidder's case seeking
$82.8 million in fraud claims from Jett, though it withheld
millions of dollars of his deferred compensation. Last year, Jett
was found guilty of false record-keeping, ordered to repay $8.2
million of bonuses, fined $200,000 and barred from the securities
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts played down the Chase incident, calling it so
minor that it would never have been noticed had the bank not
disclosed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing _ traders getting beyond their scope _
happens occasionally,'' Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman
Brothers, said. ``In all of the cases where it has happened to an
American bank, they've proven to be isolated cases rather than an
indication of faulty oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemical Bank, one of the banks that merged to form Chase, had a
big loss from one person's trades in 1994. Victor Gomez, a currency
trader, lost $66 million in what his supervisors called
unauthorized trading of contracts on the Mexican peso. Gomez was
sentenced in 1997 to 37 months in jail for conspiring to defraud
the bank by falsifying records.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like this happens to them every five years, with
as much currency trading as Chase does around the world,'' Ms.
Glossman said, ``that would indicate that their controls are pretty
good.''

 &HT;    An epitome of overachievement
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was something unusual about Walter Payton beyond
his ability to zig when defenders zagged. He wasn't O.J. Simpson.
He wasn't Jim Brown. He wasn't even Red Grange, Bronko Nagurski or
Gale Sayers, those other greats for the Chicago Bears who rushed
for fewer yards than Payton but caused more tingling at the
mentioning of their names.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was just Payton, and Payton was a 5-foot-10, 202-pound
miracle. Somehow, despite spending most of his 13 NFL years behind
invisible offensive lines, he became the league's all-time leading
rusher. He had two Most Valuable Player awards to complement his
nine Pro Bowl trips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, except for those who really knew the deal, Payton zagged
when others with such credentials zigged in the game of throwing
your legend around without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just knew so much about him. That was the problem,'' said
Jeff Van Note, the former Falcons center, who retired a year before
Payton after the 1986 season. ``If you ask any player in the
league, they knew about his incredible workout regiment. That's all
I used to hear, about how he used to run these hills back in
Mississippi. You didn't think about him as having any sort of a
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Note was referring to the Payton outside of his No. 34
jersey. As that miracle, nobody played harder. Nobody played wiser.
Nobody inspired so many around him to do both, and this was before
and after the Bears' renaissance under Mike Ditka. From Payton's
rookie season of 1975 through the early 1980s, the Bears were bad.
They were really bad, and except for those who really knew the
deal, they'd have been worse if not for Payton's desire to remain
that miracle each game no matter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the culmination of the Bears' renaissance in 1985,
when they surged to a world championship. Although Payton was named
the NFL's MVP, he quickly became a footnote for historians because
of a Chicago defense that evolved into one for the ages. ``But,''
Ditka said, ``we wouldn't have won the Super Bowl without Walter
Payton. There were guys who ran with the ball better, faster. But I
don't think anyone ever ran with more determination than Walter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Falcons free safety Eugene Robinson, a Payton fan as a
youth in Hartford, Conn. But business is business. In 1987, before
Robinson's Seahawks met Payton's Bears, Robinson developed a
strategy to handle the blistering forearm Payton used to shock
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, OK, I know he's going to punch me in the face with
that forearm, so I'm going to grab his wrist and push down his
punch arm and kind of clothesline him on the sideline,'' Robinson
said, laughing. Robinson laughed some more, while recalling how he
nearly cried back then after he was surrounded by a bunch of
growling Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Singletary. Richard Dent. Wilber Marshall. All those
dudes ran after me, saying, `Man, what's wrong with you? I better
not ever catch you doing that again to Walter,''' Robinson said.
``I told them it was legal, but I sort of moved out of their way,
saying, `My bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Payton said nothing. Payton rarely did. Payton just let his legs
do his talking.
</P>
<P>
   The miracle died Monday, and he was 45. For those who really
knew the deal, the miracle will live forever.

 &HT;    Jaguars looking at offensive line moves
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Jacksonville Jaguars might have to make at least one change
to their highly regarded offensive line when they face the Falcons
Sunday in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right guard Rich Tylski fractured his right foot in
last week's 41-10 victory over Cincinnati. He'll be out at least
four to six weeks. Also, Pro-Bowl left tackle Tony Boselli was
wearing a stabilizing boot for a sprained right ankle in the locker
room on Monday. Boselli's status is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only Monday,'' said Boselli, who forms the league's best
tackle tandem with Leon Searcy. ``There's no reason to start
speculating about what's going to happen. We still have a couple of
days. Hopefully, it will respond well.''
</P>
<P>
   Zach Wiegert will probably move into Tylski's spot. If Boselli
can't play, starting left guard Ben Coleman could move outside,
with Quentin Neujahr taking Coleman's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a decision on how that will go,'' coach Tom
Coughlin said. ``There are some options, some flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Jaguars' playmakers on offense also are battling
injuries. Quarterback Mark Brunell started against the Bengals,
completing 11 of 19 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns, but he
aggravated a rib injury and didn't return after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell was injured in practice before an Oct. 17 game against
Cleveland. He says he felt about 80 to 90 percent against the
Bengals and could have played in the second half if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up enough where we could rest it a little bit,''
Brunell said. ``It was a smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, running back Fred Taylor, a second-year pro from
Florida, also sat out most of the second half. Taylor rushed for
128 yards on 15 carries against Cincinnati, after missing the
previous three games with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he left after playing just over two quarters because
of leg cramps. Veteran James Stewart rushed for 32 yards and two
touchdowns in Taylor's absence against the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I'm able to play 60 minutes, I'm not quite back to my
old self yet,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are coming off their best defensive game of the
season. Atlanta sacked Carolina quarterback Steve Beurelein six
times in last week's 27-20 win. Defensive end Chuck Smith had three
of them and caused a fumble, which defensive tackle Shane Dronett
returned to the Panthers' five-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sidelined
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Akili Smith, the third overall pick in this year's
draft by the Bengals, will miss as many as three games after
hurting the big toe on his right foot during the loss to the
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who missed most of training camp because of a contract
dispute, was sacked four times during the first half in
Jacksonville. A magnetic resonance imaging test Monday found no
major injury, but the foot was badly swollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it will be two or three weeks before I even start
running,'' Smith said. ``It's depressing, it really is, but this
kind of stuff happens in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blake, who opened the season as the Bengals' starter, will
replace Smith against Seattle Sunday. Blake completed 13 of 23
passes for 155 yards against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Blake and other Bengals players believe the injury might be the
best thing for the former Oregon star.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out and play against a defense (such as Jacksonville's)
with no training camp, it's tough for him,'' Blake said of Smith.
``He's struggling. I feel bad for him. He has no chance at all,
none whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three games, Smith was sacked 13 times and threw
four interceptions with no touchdowns.Willie Anderson

WOMEN MARATHONERS IN U.S. HITTING THEIR STRIDE AT AGE 40 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARC BLOOM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Chodnicki of Manhattan ran her fastest marathon,
2 hours 43 minutes, in 1980. She was 21. Now at 40 she hopes to run
close to that performance in Sunday's New York City Marathon and
join a growing number of women in their 40s in what was once
considered a young runner's pursuit: the Olympic marathon trials.
</P>
<P>
   Chodnicki, a manager in a printing plant, is part of a
phenomenon. When Joan Benoit Samuelson captured the first Olympic
marathon for women in Los Angeles in 1984, she was 27, and the
other top Americans in the burgeoning women's running movement were
in their 20s. Now 42, Samuelson is still running and, along with
midlife peers like Kim Jones and Lynn Jennings, is a contender to
make the United States Olympic marathon team for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the 195 women who have qualified for the women's
trial, to be held Feb. 26 in Columbia, S.C., are 40 or older or are
turning 40 in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 42, twice the runner-up at New York, whose competitive
edge has survived a year of running lost over the stress of a
divorce, said, ``I was talking with Joanie at a race and told her,
`Wouldn't it be great if you, me and Lynn Jennings all made the
Olympic team?'''
</P>
<P>
   Older women have succeeded in the marathon before _ Priscilla
Welch of England won at New York in 1987 at 42. But the tendency of
large numbers of women to sustain a running career and contend for
the Olympics is uniquely American. The five female marathoners on
the United States team at last summer's world track and field
championships in Seville, Spain, averaged 38. But most of the
world's best, like the world record-holder, Tegla Loroupe of Kenya,
a two-time New York City winner, are in their 20s or are just over
30.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Olympic trials, Chodnicki, who turned 40 in
June, has to run 2:50 or better, a pace of 6:28 a mile. ``I feel
fresher than ever,'' said Chodnicki, whose weekly 20-mile training
runs take her over the George Washington Bridge and back. ``As I've
gotten older, I've taken more rest days and cut my mileage. I used
to run 80 to 90 miles a week. Now I do 55 and have life in my
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   A more measured approach to the marathon shapes these women;
many of them balance careers and child-rearing with Olympic hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had two children in my 30s,'' said Marie Boyd, an
Albuquerque pathologist, who turns 40 in December and competed on
the United States team in Seville. ``My whole career has been a
juggling act. We settled in New Mexico because I found a position
in a hospital in which I work only 35 to 40 hours a week and can
fit in my training.''
</P>
<P>
   In February's trials, Boyd hopes to run under 2:35, which would
most likely put her in contention for one of the three berths on
the United States team. ``Women in their 40s understand their
bodies, make fewer training mistakes and get more out of
themselves,'' said Benji Durden, a 1980 Olympic marathoner who
coaches Boyd and Jones. ``But it's also the case that there has not
been a lot of new blood coming into the marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one American, 34-year-old Libbie Hickman, who ran 2:28:34
at Chicago on Oct. 24, has broken 2:30 during the trials qualifying
period. Samuelson ran 2:24:52 to win the 1984 Olympics, and her
American record is 2:21:21 from 1985. Even with prize money readily
available, no marathon stars have succeeded her in the 1990s,
motivating older women still capable of running in the 2:30's and
2:40s to continue.
</P>
<P>
   While Samuelson, the winner in the masters division (40 and
over) at New York last year, and Jones are not running Sunday to
save themselves for the trials, Chodnicki is making her last
attempt at a qualifying spot. On Oct. 3, she ran the Twin Cities
Marathon in Minneapolis but said she ``fell asleep'' in the 18th
mile and ran 2:54. ``It only took me a week to recover,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chodnicki, who represents the Warren Street Social and Athletic
Club of Jersey City, began running 26 years ago for Saddle Brook
High School in New Jersey. She has run more than 30 marathons but
with significant detours. After improving her best time by nine
minutes with a 2:43, achieved at New York in 1980, Chodnicki
developed anorexia and bulimia, eating disorders that plagued her
for years. ``It took a long time to heal,'' Chodnicki said. ``But
that's all gone.
</P>
<P>
   Physically fit, Chodnicki acquired mental focus from turning 40,
which has given her new life as a competitor. ``If you look at the
results of road races in New York,'' she said, ``most of the top
women are in their late 30s and into their 40s. Now I go into a
race asking, `Who are the masters?''' &QL;

EDITORIAL: NEW VOICE AGAINST THE CUBAN EMBARGO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II last year deplored the United States' embargo
against Cuba for the suffering it has caused and the way it
isolates ordinary Cubans from outside ideas. A similar judgment has
now been reached by the conservative Republican governor of
Illinois, George Ryan, who visited Havana last week, the first
American governor to do so in 40 years. His visit was rooted as
much in commerce _ Illinois farmers could benefit from selling food
to Cuba _ as in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the Clinton administration remains trapped in the
futile policies of the Cold War past. It criticized Ryan for
meeting with Fidel Castro and restated its opposition to trade with
Cuba. That will please some in the Cuban-American community, and
their Congressional allies. But it will not help bring constructive
change to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The time is ripe for changing American policy toward Cuba from
isolation to democratic engagement. Many Republicans, like Ryan,
are casting off old orthodoxies. American businesses, like American
farmers, see post-Castro Cuba as a potentially lucrative market and
do not want to concede it to foreign competitors. Among
Cuban-Americans, many in the new generation are more flexible on
the embargo than their parents. The Clinton White House should
offer enlightened leadership on Cuba. Instead it clings to the
policies of the past.  &QL;

SETBACK FOR BELL ATLANTIC IN DRIVE FOR LONG DISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raising a speed bump in Bell Atlantic Corp.'s path toward
offering long-distance communications services, the Justice
Department on Monday said the company had come close to fully
opening its local networks in New York to competitors, but had not
quite made it.
</P>
<P>
   The department's comments to the Federal Communications
Commission, which is weighing whether to make Bell Atlantic the
first Bell company allowedhe long-distance market, were a
surprise to some analysts, who had expected the department to
endorse Bell Atlantic's application.
</P>
<P>
   But the department hardly rejected Bell Atlantic out of hand _
in contrast to the department's blunt dismissal of five previous
Bell applications _ and even said the commission could approve Bell
Atlantic's petition subject to conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that Bell Atlantic can solve the few remaining
problems in New York, and I am pleased that they have already
started to do so,'' Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in
charge of the antitrust division, said in a statement. ``But those
problems cannot be ignored and must be resolved if we want
consumers to receive the full benefits of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bell company may enter the long-distance business on a
state-by-state business after convincing the FCC that it has opened
its local systems to competitors. But no Bell has yet passed that
test.
</P>
<P>
   The department's comments are not binding on the FCC, but the
two organizations have agreed on rejecting the past applications.
</P>
<P>
   The department's lukewarm comments were a surprise mainly
because the New York State Public Service Commission gave Bell
Atlantic its full support less than two weeks ago. The Justice
Department joined forces with the New York regulators last year in
a partnership to test the openness of Bell Atlantic's New York
network. That process delayed Bell Atlantic's long-distance
application for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire New York process has in some ways been
disappointing because it's taken so long,'' James Young, Bell
Atlantic's general counsel, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Bell Atlantic might be able to address the
department's concerns even before the FCC's review ends in late
December. The commission, however, has frowned on Bell companies'
amending their long-distance applications, preferring to take a
network ``snapshot'' at the time of the application in order to
avoid chasing a moving target. It is also unclear how any
conditional approval could be structured.
</P>
<P>
   But because Bell Atlantic is credited with doing more than the
other Bells to open its systems, the FCC might demonstrate some
flexibility. The commission is under political pressure to allow at
least one of the Bells into the long-distance market.

RODEO AND AUTO RACING DEATHS CUT SHORT CAREERS OF TWO YOUNG
ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their names did not engender the public familiarity afforded
professional athletes like the golfer Payne Stewart, who died last
week in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Moore drove race cars for a living and the thrill of it.
Colby Goodwin supported a family by roping steers. Moore, 24, and
Goodwin, 32, were killed last week doing what they had done for
several years: Moore racing his Reynard-Mercedes at speeds up to
220 miles an hour; Goodwin lassoing 750-pound steers from atop a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Although not yet in Stewart's vaunted realm, both Moore and
Goodwin were talented athletes on the rise in their respective
fields. Moore won five races over the last three years and finished
fifth in points last season on the CART FedEx series, one of auto
racing's toughest circuits. Goodwin finished among the top 15 steer
ropers in the country for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's death was only the second in National Finals history.
Brent Thurman, a bull rider, was killed in 1994. Moore was the
second driver in the CART FedEx series to die this year. Gonzalo
Rodriguez of Uruguay was killed in a crash Sept. 11. Before this
season, there have been only two driver fatalities in CART racing
(using Indianapolis-style cars) over the last 20 seasons, said Ron
Richards, vice president for communications for Championship Auto
Racing Teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go along week to week, month to month and don't have anyone
injured or killed,'' Richards said in a telephone interview from
Los Angeles, a few miles from the California Speedway in Fontana,
where the wreck occurred. ``At times, you sit back and look at it
and view it as being totally safe. This is a dangerous sport. With
cars going at 200 miles per hour, there is an element of risk. This
reinforces that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin was critically injured Saturday when his horse tripped
on the slack portion of his rope after he had roped a steer and
fell sideways on him. The accident occurred during the National
Finals steer roping competition at the Lazy E arena in Guthrie,
Okla., with Goodwin's wife, Amy, and his parents watching from the
stands. The couple have a 10-day-old son, Gunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real dangers in rodeo is traveling from rodeo to
rodeo,'' said Steve Fleming, director of communications for the
Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, which has 11,000 members.
``Typically, we have one or two deaths per year in traffic
fatalities to and from rodeos.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said it is not uncommon for riders to compete on a
Saturday night and have another competition Sunday morning. Because
most riders travel with the horses, they usually drive to
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's traveling partner was Guy Allen, one of the most
successful steer ropers on the circuit. Allen, 41, won an
unprecedented 14th world title at the Nationals. Like Goodwin,
Allen is from Lovington, N.M., and the two ropers had formed a
close bond. Allen was the best man at Goodwin's wedding in August
1998 and became his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't uncommon for a very accomplished rider to travel
with a younger guy like Goodwin and advise him on what to do and
what competitions to enter,'' Fleming said in a phone interview
from the association's headquarters in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, was said by
his peers to embody what pro racing is all about. Single,
good-looking and fun-loving, Moore along with three of his closest
friends, Max Papis, Dario Franchitti and Tony Kanaan, were a
talented 20-something group of drivers known on the CART circuit as
the ``Brat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys had a great deal of fun,'' Richards said. ``You
have to be committed to do what these guys do week in and week out.
Greg was focused, courageous and committed. He loved racing and
going out on the track. But he also loved life away from the track,
and much of it centered around his friendship with Max, Toni and
Dario.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore almost missed Sunday's race. He broke his hand the day
before and was driving with a cast and brace approved by CART's
doctors. He wasn't cleared to drive until late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART, said he
gave Moore the go-ahead. ``It really is not likely that the hand
injury had anything to do with this accident,'' Olvey told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Player's Forsythe team for the past two years,
Moore was scheduled to switch to Roger Penske's team next season.
</P>
<P>
   Services for Goodwin are scheduled for Thursday in Channing,
Texas. Memorial services were being planned for Moore. &QL;

KINGS' TAYLOR MASTERS ART OF THE DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Hollywood always needs a story line.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille is scoring goals like the good old days. New
coach Andy Murray is part headmaster, part rink rat. Downtown is
not down anymore, not with a glitzy new arena called Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But those things are only part of the reason the Los Angeles
Kings' improbable first month really is not that surprising, and
why barring injuries they should remain very competitive in the
NHL's toughest division.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor, who at this moment is sitting in
some drafty barn in Quebec looking at teen-age prospects, has
reshaped the Kings the old-fashioned way, completing two trades
since last December that clearly has made the club much more than a
facade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, heading into tonight's game against the Pittsburgh
Penguins, the Kings have more goals than any team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Taylor acquired high-scoring Ziggy Palffy
from the New York Islanders. But in the same deal he got Bryan
Smolinski, whose career had stalled on a series of last-place
teams.
</P>
<P>
   He now is part of a second line that has scored 20 points in its
last eight games. His linemate Donald Audette came from Buffalo for
a draft choice almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 13 games, the Kings have gotten 12 goals from
Palffy, Smolinski and Audette. In return, the Islanders and Sabres
have gotten one goal _ by former No. 1 pick Ollie Jokinen.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio is nearly a goal a game. Last season, the Kings
averaged 2.3 goals. Now it's 3.4. See the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it helps that Robitaille has regained the scoring
touch thought lost just two years ago. Or that first-line center
Jozef Stumpel, the club's leading scorer during the 1997-98 season,
appears back after a year slowed by a hip injury.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall has been so good for the Kings that winger Vladimir
Tsyplakov, who saw considerable action on the first and second
lines the past few seasons, has been a healthy scratch many times
already this season. He does not have a position to play.
</P>
<P>
   As a skill player, Tsyplakov is not equipped for duty on the
physical third and fourth lines that are designed to stop the other
team's top unit.
</P>
<P>
   Both trades have been a boon for Taylor, who had a lot of people
whispering in his ear last season that he needed to open Staples
Center with a flashy free agent like Pavel Bure or Theo Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   When Vancouver dangled Bure last season, Taylor didn't bite,
even though he knew he needed to put a more exciting product in the
new building than the one that missed the playoffs five of the
previous six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bure had back-to-back 60-goal seasons on his resume. Fleury was
among the league's top offensive players and the heart and soul of
the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Bure was traded to Florida, signed a huge new contract and
quickly went down with a knee injury that is still bothering him.
The Bure who is tied with Robitaille and Montreal's Brian Savage
for the league lead in goals is Calgary's Valeri Bure.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury was traded to Colorado, which lost him when the big-money
New York Rangers came calling last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a $60 million payroll and only four victories. &QL; 
ROENICK ON THE MOVE?
</P>
<P>
   Travis Green, who was a bust with the Islanders and Mighty
Ducks, has come on so strong in Phoenix and might have made Jeremy
Roenick expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Green is now the first-line center and Roenick is considering
his future. One report has him possibly headed to the New Jersey
Devils in exchange for center Brendan Morrison and left winger
Patrick Elias. &QL; 
STAR STRUCK
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup champion Dallas Star might have the best record
in the NHL over the past three seasons, but when they lose, they
lose hard. The Stars were shut out seven times last season -- third
most in franchise history -- and already have been shut out three
times this season.
</P>
<P>
   LISTEN UP
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the teams this season, the Red Wings underwent
diversity training this past week. The NHL-sponsored session was
conducted by sensitivity trainer Zachary Minor and Willie O'Ree,
who broke the NHL's color barrier. This is the first year for such
training after a couple ugly racial incidents. Players were shown a
film with five vignettes illustrating racial, ethnic and gender
harassment.

 McCAW AGREES TO RAISE $1.2 BILLION TO TAKE ICO OUT OF CHAPTER XI   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, said Monday that
he had agreed to raise at least $1.2 billion to take ICO Global
Communications Ltd. out of Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   The move by McCaw, who is expected to gain control of the
bankrupt company, is a big vote of confidence in the struggling
global satellite telephone business, which had been saddled last
summer by two high-profile bankruptcies and growing doubts about
its viability.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw _ who is also a large investor in Teledesic LLC, the
so-called ``Internet in the sky'' satellite venture scheduled to
begin operating in 2004 _ is also considering taking a large stake
in Iridium &UR;  &LR; LLC, another global satellite telephone venture that
filed for bankruptcy protection last summer, according to a
spokesman for McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks there's a business to be stabilized and an
opportunity to be realized here,'' Robert Ratliffe, a vice
president at Eagle River Investments &UR;  &LR; LLC in Bellevue, Wash., a
company that McCaw operates, said of his ICO investment. ``He sees
satellites as a tremendous vehicle to deliver services globally.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment, which will occur in three rounds over the next
eight months, is expected to help ICO Global Communications
complete its bankruptcy reorganization plan by early next year,
finish building its network of 12 satellites and 12 earth stations,
and start global telephone service by early 2001, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a validation of the business plan we have in place,''
said Patrick McDougal, a senior vice president for corporate
development at ICO, which is based is London. ``The meaningfulness
of this is that it will help us get out of Chapter 11.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, McCaw will eventually gain voting
control over ICO in exchange for raising at least $1.2 billion
through his affiliated companies, Teledesic LLC and Eagle River
Investments, as well as a group of international investors.
Existing investors in ICO are also expected to participate. The
company has spent more than $3.4 billion to begin service. The
deal, however, still needs approval of bankruptcy courts in
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything right now, we're in negotiations,'' said
Luc Despins, a lawyer at Milbank Tweed Hadley &AMP; McCloy in New York,
a lawyer who represents an informal committee of ICO bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear whether ICO will have any relationship
with Teledesic _ which aims to deliver broadband Internet access
over a global satellite network _ officials at ICO and Teledesic
said there could be some synergies or agreements between the two
companies, both of which will be largely controlled by McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear that Teledesic will be involved in ICO,''
McDougal at ICO said. ``It's too early to say. But certainly it is
clear Mr. McCaw sees synergies between what ICO is ready to do and
what Teledesic has ambitions to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ICO is not prepared to start broadband service, the
company says that its system is flexible and that when it begins
operating, the satellite service will be able to send data and
offer multimedia and Web browsing capabilities as well as telephone
service virtually anywhere around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Armand Musey, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said
McCaw's investment indicates that he is a firm believer that
satellite service will eventually deliver telephone and Internet
service, and that he can get a foothold in the industry at bargain
basement prices, and thereby pave the way for the beginning of
Teledesic in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``He held all the cards because if he didn't come in they could
look at getting nothing,'' Musey said. ``ICO and Iridium absolutely
need outside investors. So it looks like he looked at the two
companies and then went with ICO first because it has data
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaw said in a statement Monday: ``It is our hope that by
working with ICO's team and international partners we can bring the
company back to good health and make a contribution to global
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliffe, a spokesman at Eagle River, said McCaw's investment is
another attempt to revive a struggling company, just as he did at
Nextel Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an analogy to Nextel. Craig saw a way to modify the
engineering there,'' Ratliffe said. ``Here's a service provider who
is focused on the customer. There just aren't many situations where
a manufacturer is a successful service provider.''

SOFT, WET GRASS HURTS EUROPEAN CONTINGENT AT BREEDERS' CUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ Eleven of Europe's best race horses flew into
South Florida Monday for the Breeders' Cup, but, while the weather
seemed suitable for flying, racing officials were bedeviled by an
old problem: was it suitable for racing?
</P>
<P>
   The travelers found many of the 128 Breeders' Cup horses stabled
at Gulfstream Park, where the championships will be run Saturday,
and they also found the main track loaded with traffic during the
morning workouts. Bob Baffert alone had seven of his stars taking
their final dress rehearsals, including the undefeated juvenile
filly Chilukki, the great Silverbulletday and his leading candidate
for the $4 million Classic, General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the horses were working on a dirt track labeled
fast. Most of the Europeans will run on the grass course, which has
been inundated with storm water and may not afford them much chance
of working out. The racing officials offered little assurance that
things would get better.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is a matter of huge importance to horses from
Europe. They customarily race on grass, and the weather back home
tends to be cool in autumn. But as they landed in Florida, they
were met with more of the heat and humidity that undermined their
two previous visits at Gulfstream: in 1989, when the European
horses went 0 for 11 in the Breeders' Cup, and in 1992, when they
went 0 for 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurricane Irene dumped 18 inches on the track two weeks ago,''
said Pam Blatz-Murff, the director of racing for the Breeders' Cup.
``And since then, we've had two more inches of rain. We've had a
hard time getting on the turf course. In the 10 days that I've been
here, this morning was only the third time we'd been on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to sacrifice the turf course to workouts, not
with championship races coming up. Six horses went out at 9 o'clock
this morning. We're hoping things get better by the time the
European grass horses come out of quarantine tomorrow. But the
forecast is calling for more rain, and even a flood watch for
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The grass course was officially listed as soft when the six
horses were allowed to try it Monday morning. The grass tends to
retain water closer to the railing, so the horses are restricted to
running on the outer portion of the course. They are kept outside
by ``dogs,'' or rubber cones, placed on the ground to mark off the
restricted zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the decision on racing over the turf course at 4 in
the morning,'' Blatz-Murff said. ``We've been restricting the turf
course to certain hours and certain horses, mainly Breeders' Cup
starters. Today, we started at 9 and let the six horses work. But
the dogs were placed 50 feet out from the rail. The track is only
70 feet wide, so it meant the horses could use only the outside
lane or two.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the flooding worse, after Irene howled through Florida,
the infield lake at Gulfstream overflowed onto the grass course.
When the Breeders' Cup is run, three of the eight races may be
compromised _ the new $1 million Filly and Mare Turf, the $1
million Mile and the $2 million Turf. Those are the chief races the
Europeans have targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Where will all that leave grass racing on Friday, the opening
day of a gala three-day Breeders' Cup weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Friday's races yet,'' Blatz-Murff
said, sounding as though she wished the subject would go away.
``The fields are smaller, for one thing. Meanwhile, for workouts,
grass horses for Saturday will have the preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baffert's dirt horses dominated the workouts Monday,
both in number and speed. The California trainer expects to enter
eight horses in six of the eight races, and he turned seven of them
loose by the dawn's early light. The eighth, River Keen, worked six
furlongs in 1:12 at Belmont Park in New York in preparation for the
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, who is Baffert's main horse in the Classic,
worked a snappy six furlongs at Gulfstream in 1:09 3/5, prompting
Baffert to say: ``I like to put an edge into my horses this close
to a race. This work puts him right into it. I was going to work
him tomorrow, but I kept seeing rain in the weather reports. When
the track came up in good shape this morning, I called an
audible.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, the star filly in Baffert's barn and the
probable favorite in the $1 million Distaff, dazzled the clockers
by going five furlongs in 57 2/5 seconds. She did not like running
in the mud when she lost the Beldame to Beautiful Pleasure last
month at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't like that surface,'' he said. ``But that's what
happens in this sport: horses beat horses. She's pitched 10 strong
innings for us this year. I just want her to give us one more
strong inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also saw a smart workout Monday by his 2-year-old filly
Chilukki, who shot five furlongs in 59 seconds. He was thoroughly
impressed by Forest Camp, his star juvenile colt, who flew five
furlongs in 58 2/5 seconds in one of the morning's best
performances for the rich Baffert barn.

SAVUMIAMOORTHY THONDAMAN OF SRI LANKA, A TAMIL LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, a Sri Lankan trade unionist and
political figure who was a leader of the minority Tamils of Indian
origin, died on Saturday in a hospital in the Colombo area. He was
reported to be 86 or 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said a Sri Lankan legislator, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils whom Thondaman represented went to the Indian Ocean
island that is now Sri Lanka when it was the British colony of
Ceylon. They were taken from southern India in the 19th century to
clear jungles and work in plantations opened by the British to grow
crops including tea, an important export.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils are Tamil-speaking Hindus who live mainly in southern
India and in Sri Lanka. The largest group of Tamils in Sri Lanka,
called Jaffna, or ``Sri Lankan'' Tamils, have been a part of the
country's history for centuries and make up 12 percent of the
population. The more recent migrants from India constitute 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We transformed this country,'' Thondaman, president of the
powerful Ceylon Workers' Congress, a political, as well as a labor
organization, said in 1973, when it represented nearly 400,000
workers. ``Plantation labor opened the roads and railways, built up
communications and began the flourishing export trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said, a large number of ``people who have been
born here and know no other motherland are considered stateless.''
But he succeeded in securing Sri Lankan citizenship for many
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a kingmaker in politics for decades. One important
achievement was keeping the Tamils of Indian origin in the tea
country away from the Tamil separatist movement in the north. If
not, Sri Lanka might have been badly wounded economically.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, in 1998, as head of the Workers' Congress, he
oversaw a nine-day strike, for higher pay, by half a million
workers on tea and rubber plantations. The wage increase was won,
but the walkout led to $60 million in lost export revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Accounts about Thondaman's parents differ. The A.P. reported
that he was born into a prominent southern Indian family that had a
tea estate in Ceylon, which became independent in 1948 and was
renamed Sri Lanka in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 11, he went to Ceylon and attended school there for
five years. He dropped out to learn about tea production and, in
the process, formed a close relationship with tea workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thondaman had been a member of parliament for years. At his
death, he was minister of estate infrastructure and livestock
development. He had previously held other cabinet posts.

 &HT;    Government asks for more time in Branch Davidian case
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For the second time in a month, the federal
government has asked U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of
Waco for more time to comply with his order to produce all evidence
related to events at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence in the wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Branch
Davidian survivors against the government was due Monday. In a
motion filed then, Nina S. Pelletier, a U.S. Department of Justice
attorney, gave the judge a progress report of the government's
efforts, including some in the executive office of the president,
to comply with his discovery orders and then asked for an
additional month to complete the task.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the judge ordered, among other things, that the
government turn over all materials in the custody of any agency,
including audio and video tapes, that relate to the Branch Davidian
raid on Feb. 28, 1993, or the April 19, 1993, tear-gas assault and
fire in which David Koresh and 75 of his followers died.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, who represents a majority of the
plaintiffs, said he will not oppose the delay, adding that he
doesn't think it would, if granted, affect the May 15 trial date
set in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge initially ordered these documents produced in
August, and it is hard to understand how they can't get their act
together after four months,'' Caddell said. ``They should have been
doing this all along. They have organized these documents for
Congress twice now. The truth is that all this stuff has been
organized before. They make it sound like this is the first time
anybody from the government has gone through these documents.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pelletier's notice of compliance, as of Oct. 29,
the Department of Treasury, excluding the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms; the Department of Justice, with the exception
of the FBI; the Department of Commerce; the Department of State;
the office of Special Counsel; and the Department of Health and
Human Services had completed their searches for materials and will
produce all ``responsive, non-classified documents on or before
Nov. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, the FBI had shipped 131 boxes of materials to the
court in Waco, including more than 100,000 pages of documents, 882
audio tapes, 121 video tapes, numerous computer disks, laptop
computers, photographs and more, the notice reports.
</P>
<P>
   Also by Monday, the ATF had shipped at least 66 boxes of
materials to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``ATF continues to devote substantial resources to reviewing and
inventorying other materials, including computer drives and
computer diskettes, third-party documents and oversized
photographs,'' Pelletier writes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Texas,
which handled the criminal prosecutions of 11 Branch Davidians in
San Antonio, has submitted 111 boxes; the Department of Defense has
gathered about 30,000 pages of unclassified materials and 7,000
pages of classified documents and has forwarded about 12,000
unclassified pages to the court.
</P>
<P>
   The executive office of the president has produced documents,
too, and is in the process of completing its search of archived
e-mail messages, according to the notice. The office estimates that
it will have provided ``all responsive unprivileged material'' by
Thursday.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER TO USE NEW PLASTIC IN WRANGLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI, Mich. _ Taking a big step forward in the development of
automobiles with plastic bodies, DaimlerChrysler announced Monday
that it would equip 5,000 of its Jeep Wranglers each year with
lightweight, low-cost roofs made from a new kind of specially
hardened plastic, starting with the 2001 model year.
</P>
<P>
   A different kind of plastic, made by taking sheets of plastic
and pressing them into shapes in big machines, is already used to
produce current Wrangler roofs and to make many exterior body
panels of Saturn cars.
</P>
<P>
   The new plastic, made by injecting liquid material directly into
giant molds, can make stronger, cheaper and less brittle auto parts
that could replace steel for structural auto body parts within 10
years, DaimlerChrysler officials and outside experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember where, in the 1960s movie `The Graduate,' they
whispered `plastics,''' said James Holden, the president of
DaimlerChrysler's former Chrysler operations. ``Well, we're finally
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The new hardtop roof will weigh 47 pounds instead of 70 pounds
for the current one and will cost 10 percent less to make, Holden
said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler makes 90,000 Wranglers a year and will equip
only 5,000 a year with the new roofs partly because only one
machine has been built so far to produce them and partly because
DaimlerChrysler wants to assess the new material's performance in
the field. The rest of the Wranglers will continue to be sold with
sheet-molded hardtop roofs or with soft, canvas roofs.
</P>
<P>
   All Wranglers have roll bars that are designed to support the
vehicle's weight if it tips over, so the roof does not need to be
very strong. Holden said that the new roofs would be just as safe
as existing roofs. DaimlerChrysler has not decided which Wranglers
will have the new roofs, he said, adding that one color of
Wranglers might be sold with the injected-plastic designs.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have been searching for high-strength, lightweight
substitutes for steel because lighter automobiles tend to have
better fuel economy and lower emissions, allowing manufacturers to
meet ever-tighter regulatory standards and prepare for any future
sharp increases in gasoline prices. Aluminum, the most common
alternative to steel, weighs half as much for a similar-sized auto
part but tends to cost twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   So-called plastic cars like Saturns use sheet-molded plastic
body panels attached to a lattice of steel beams that provide the
cars' structure. The sheet-molded plastic panels must be painted,
an expensive task that produces a lot of pollution, because the
plastic cannot be adequately dyed.
</P>
<P>
   Injected plastic is strong enough to provide an automobile's
structure, many auto engineers say, although steel makers question
this. The injected plastic can also be dyed, so it does not need to
be painted. The dyed product is not glossy enough yet, however, to
be put on the sides of a vehicle where lots of customers will see
it, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, an analyst at Auto Pacific, an automotive consulting
firm, said that if the Wrangler's new roof proved popular and
durable and held its color, widespread use of injected plastic
could come next. ``It could turn out to be a real big deal,'' he
said. ``The materials are probably there but nobody trusts them,
and this is a nice, safe way to do it.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's New &AMP; Notable capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY CAT SPIT MCGEE'' &QL; 
By Willie Morris (Random House, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of any cat hater, this is a major defection.
Morris was a confirmed dog man most of his life. First there was
Skip, about whom Morris wrote a book called ``My Dog Skip,'' and
then there was Pete, a carefree black lab who hung out with the
guys at the local gas station and counted Truman Capote among his
many friends before he settled down with Morris. In the last years
of his life (he died of heart failure this year), however, Willie
Morris loved a cat. Not that he went gently. When he noticed his
faltering resistence to feline company, he consulted with a friend,
the dog-loving Eudora Welty (who was no help), and with a
psychiatrist, who told him it was not unmanly to love a cat. And so
he and Spit McGee became a twosome, Morris spellbound and smitten
and companionable, Spit haughty and all-knowing and coy. This is
Morris' ode to Spit, whom he sometimes believed was his dog Skip
reincarnated. However, Spit was Spit and no one else. Do you have
to love cats to love this book? We'll be honest with you _ it
helps. A little Spit McGee goes a long way. ``This afternoon the
two of us were down by the creek sitting together in our favorite
spot,'' Morris writes. ``It was false spring again in January and
the warming sunlight fell languidly upon us. As I stroked him on
his back, once again he snuggled into my lap. `I love you, Spitty,'
I said. He extended his paw toward me.'' Pete and Skip are probably
spinning in their graves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``CARE PACKAGES: LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER REEVE FROM STRANGERS AND
OTHER FRIENDS'' &QL; 
By Dana Reeve (Random House, $20) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks. This is a weeper. And yet it's not
a sappy book. We thought it would be, and we opened it with
considerable reluctance. Then we got our hankies out and read to
the last letter in the pile. The people who have written to Reeve
since he was paralyzed in a riding accident four years ago _
especially the strangers _ are not overly sentimental people. They
tend to be survivors themselves, who have faced physical adversity
and come out of it reborn, if not recovered. Their messages tend
toward the challenging. Buck up. Don't let people tell you what you
can't do. Things might never be the same, but make something of the
life you have now. Never give up. Never. Dana Reeve also includes
letters from old acquaintances who knew her husband both as himself
and as Superman, and from celebrities who sent their good wishes
and encouragement. Here's a note, in its entirety, from a
7-year-old boy: ``Hope you'll come out of hospital soon. And you
can come round. Dad will help you up the stair's.'' (cq) Paul
McCartney wrote about the day he and his young son, a huge Superman
fan, traveled on the same plane with Reeve to America from London.
``You were kind enough to give him a big wave when he turned around
to look at you,'' McCartney said. ``That's the kind of thing that
means a lot to soppy old parents like us, and something we won't
forget in a hurry.'' And Katharine Hepburn typed this _ ``Let me
know if I can do anything _ My golly what a mess.'' and signed it
with a very shaky hand. It's hard not to be heartened by the
collective goodness of these people, who took time out of their
days to reach out to a man in need. ``By compiling these letters,''
Reeve says in his foreword, ``Dana is sharing with you and
reminding me of words that helped me start a new life. For that I
am deeply grateful.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BASEBALL'S 25 GREATEST MOMENTS'' &QL; 
(The Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We showed this book to a rabid Pirates fan, who let it be known
that the editors erred deeply when they ranked Bobby Thomson's home
run against the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1951 pennant race over
Pittsburgh second baseman Bill Mazeroski's homer in the last game
of the 1960 World Series. It's that kind of book _ you don't check
your allegiances at the door. Also among the Top 10: the hobbled
Kirk Gibson's home run in the opening game of the 1988 World
Series; Bill Buckner's devastating error in game six of the 1986
series; Don Larsen's perfect game for the Yankees over Brooklyn in
Game Five of the 1956 series; and ``The Catch,'' which Willie Mays
made in 1954 and has been downplayed ever since, but we think it's
just the most amazing thing, so amazing that we could watch it

``THE WAY WE LIVED THEN'' &QL; 
By Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he was 9, Dunne's aunt took him from his home in
Connecticut on a vacation in the West. Their first stop was Los
Angeles, and when they got onto the bus that toured movie stars
homes, Dunne sat next to the guide so that he wouldn't miss
anything. In truth, he knew more about the stars than the guide did
_ he was already steeped in Hollywood gossip and glamour, the
intrigue and the dirt. Years later, as a young stage manager, he
attended his first Hollywood party at the home of Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall, where he saw Judy Garland, who lived next door,
and Lana Turner, who lived next door on the other side (she walked
in late, ``looking the way you wanted Lana Turner to look''), Frank
Sinatra, Spencer Tracy and so many others. ``Before the night was
over, people jumped in the pool in their party clothes,'' he says.
``I jumped in, too. I wanted to be a part of it. I thought to
myself, `This is how I want to live.' '' He did, for a long time.
This is his memoir of life in Hollywood, with photographs from his
own scrapbooks showing the stars at leisure.  &QL;

A 100 YEARS LATER, CAN FREUD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (THIS ARTICLE ALSO MOVED IN ``A'' and ``L'' CATEGORIES) One
hundred years ago this month, Sigmund Freud began an enterprise
that would turn us all inside out.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Interpretation of Dreams,'' published in November 1899,
the 43-year-old Viennese doctor theorized that dreams present us
with repressed desires. All dreams are wish fulfillment, Freud
claimed, and it is possible to read our dreams and to know things
felt long ago in childhood that were driven into the unconscious
under the weight of social norms and parental expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about someone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Frederick Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but on the meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

LEMIEUX A CITY SAVIOR _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ This is a place that takes its heroes very
seriously, from Franco Harris and Terry Bradshaw to Roberto
Clemente and Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen closely to the narrow streets of its downtown, you
can still hear the cheers for Bill Mazeroski's World Series-winning
home run nearly 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, there is a hero much bigger than a fistful
of Super Bowl rings, even though he has not put on a uniform in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Lemieux is here to save hockey in a town now better known
for its small crowds and the ``small market'' label that has become
a death sentence in a sports world growing more polarized by
lucrative luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who started his career by scoring on the first
shift of his first game, overcame Hodgkin's disease and finished
with 613 goals and 1,494 points, lifting the Penguins out of
financial ruin might be his biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big task,'' said the Los Angeles Kings' Luc
Robitaille, who played two years here with Lemieux. ``But he's a
big, big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, who brought Pittsburgh its only two Stanley Cup titles
in the early 1990s, saw the future up close last week when he
accompanied the Penguins to Staples Center for their game with the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   He has the game's top player in Jaromir Jagr and a payroll
around $30 million. But he also has the league's oldest arena and
the team is coming off its worst attendance since 1984, the year
before his Hall of Fame career began.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Lemieux, 34, now owns the Penguins was
because he was still owed $35 million in deferred money by the
team, which was bankrupt and thinking about selling to a group in
Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an emotional investment as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place has been a big part of my life here for 15 years,''
Lemieux said, ``and it just seemed like a disaster for hockey fans,
and the city as well if it left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play here for so many years, and you have a great
relationship with the fans and the people just walking around town,
it draws you in. They're very respectful, and that's why I've
stayed here since I came here. The relationship between the fans
and myself is the reason I decided to stay here and raise my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the team was more than $100 million in debt when
bankruptcy was filed last month, Lemieux saw an upside when he put
together an ownership group that was awarded the club in September
by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is scheduled to open new baseball and football
stadiums, making a hockey arena a good possibility if Lemieux can
generate enough revenue to move the team into the black.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL recently signed a five-year, $600 million television
contract with ABC/ESPN that gives the league national exposure even
if the per-team payout is only $7 million annually, easily the
worst among the four major sports.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux's presence, however, clearly was the reason the Penguins
received a $10 million local television package from Fox, roughly
$3 million more than the Kings receive in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins throughout the '90s have been the highest-rated
sports team on television in Pittsburgh. And even though their
season average of 14,825 was bad by league standards, that usually
was good enough to outdraw baseball's Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of optimism in Pittsburgh and in the
league office,'' NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said. ``Mario adds a
level of credibility that is difficult to measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most attractive part of the package is the Penguins
themselves, who have made the playoffs every year this decade, even
after Lemieux retired prematurely in 1997 because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   They have Jagr, who replaced Lemieux as captain. He is the
two-time defending league scoring champion and last season's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Constantine, beginning his third year, is considered by
many the best bench coach in NHL. His team, which reached the
second round of the playoffs last year, has stumbled at the
beginning of the season, going 2-4-3 heading into tonight's game
against the Kings, including just two points on last week's
three-game swing through California.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux has tried to help out the fans, getting cuts in
upper-deck seat prices as high as $10 and creating family sections.
He set a goal of 12,000 season tickets but has only 9,000 right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work to be done,'' he said. ``But keeping
hockey in Pittsburgh is too important to the community not to be a
part.''

<P>
   Using free association, dream interpretation and long-term
interaction with an analyst, neurotic behavior could be understood
as the result of repressed memories of childhood trauma.
Consciousness could dispel those unconscious urges that rule us
from below.
</P>
<P>
   Freud wrote many other books over the next four decades,
developing his theory of psychoanalysis into a comprehensive view
of human experience. By knowing the dark sources of its everyday
behavior, he averred, humanity could be made healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone has agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After untold millions of hours have been spent by thousands upon
hundreds of thousands of patients on couches talking about potty
training and relationships with their moms, it seems scarcely
possible to assert in 1999 that humans are generally happier than
they were in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Freud's theory is not so life-altering as originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's not even tenable.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Greeks, in the myth of Orpheus and the Underworld,
seem to have anticipated Freud and found his theory wanting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the myth, the great musician Orpheus loved the
nymph Eurydice with a passion that transcended all. When, on their
wedding day, she died of a snake bite, Orpheus would not let death
part them. Orpheus strode into the Underworld and requested of
Pluto, its King, to let Eurydice leave with him when he returned to
the sunshine. Pluto granted Orpheus' request on one condition:
Orpheus must not look back at Eurydice as they left, but keep his
gaze directed at the road ahead, the path out of the Underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Orpheus began the journey back with Eurydice following. But as
he neared the exit from the kingdom of shades, he could not resist
a glance back at his beloved. Instantly, he realized his mistake,
as Eurydice slipped back helplessly into the darkness. Orpheus
emerged into the light alone, and for the rest of his days roamed
the land, heartbroken, singing his tragic songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the myth, the Underworld _ the Greeks' symbol for the
unconscious _ could not be successfully breached by Orpheus/Reason
without losing the object of its quest. The contents of the
unconscious could not be pulled out into the sunshine and
comprehended in conscious, rational terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Freud asserted that they could, and he has convinced most of
the rest of us that he was right. His theories, once radical, are
now everyday. His observation of the stages of infant development
today seem obvious to any observant parent: the oral stage,
dominated by feeding; the anal stage, with attention shifted to
endless diaper changes; and the genital stage, signalling the first
hints of sexual awareness. After the mindless destruction of World
War I seemed to deny the life force itself, Freud put forth the
idea, in ``Beyond the Pleasure Principle,'' that humans struggle
daily with two opposing forces: Eros, the life force, and Thanatos,
the death force. Whenever we talk about smeone having a death
wish, Freud is there.
</P>
<P>
   He's also there when we say something sexual where a sexual
reference was not intended _ we call it a ``Freudian slip.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's there whenever his grossest generalization, the Oedipus
complex, is taken seriously. Generalizing from the results of his
own self-analysis, in which he found himself attracted to his own
mother in childhood, Freud asserted it to be true of all children,
male and female alike (which has recently found him favor in
lesbian circles). The actual story of Oedipus in Greek mythology
probably points to something far less sexually specific: that a man
is likely to follow the pattern set out for him in youth, to
attempt to duplicate the home he was raised in and to replace (to
``kill'') his father. But the myth is now so wrapped up with Freud
that it is hard to disentangle it.
</P>
<P>
   Freud's reputation crested sometime midcentury and has since
been under sustained attack. Where once Freud was a hero of popular
culture _ the 1962 Hollywood howler ``Freud'' cast Montgomery Clift
as the bearded cigar-smoker and featured the oracular tones of
director-narrator John Huston comparing Freud to Christ _ he is now
passe, a name with little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the scholarly world, too, has tended more to
Freud-bashing than to Freud hagiography. In ``The Memory Wars:
Freud's Legacy in Dispute (New York Review, 1995),'' author and
former Freudian Fr Crews dismissed Freud as ``the discoverer
of vague general truths about human deviousness.'' E. Fuller
Torrey, in ``Freudian Fraud (Harper Collins, 1992),'' made a case
that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for Freud's theories.
</P>
<P>
   Long before either book was published, no less a figure than
Ludwig Wittgenstein, one of the century's greatest philosophers,
pointed out perhaps the single greatest flaw in Freudian theory. If
Freud had indeed discovered dark things in the unconscious, how
could he possibly prove they were things of meaning? A cause is not
a meaning. Event A may cause Behavior B without imbuing B with a
particular meaning.
</P>
<P>
   A child may learn to repress sexual urges that do not correspond
to parental expectations, but, well . . . so what? Nothing
scientific can be drawn from such an observation. An additional
element is needed, Wittgenstein observed, to give the event and its
repression meaning: the very unscientific one of mythology.
(Wittgenstein's observations about Freud, scattered throughout his
career in essays and lectures, are gathered in ``Wittgenstein Reads
Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious,'' by Jacques Bouveresse,
translated by Carol Cosman (Princeton University Press, 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   So, Freud's power depends, not on any factual, scientific
observation about humanity, but on the skills he had as a writer
and self-promoter to convince us that looking at life his way _ at
every neurosis as a repressed desire, at every dream as wish
fulfillment, etc. _ is the right way to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychoanalysis is a myth without hard scientific basis.
Paradoxically, it's a myth that loses potency when stripped of its
supposed factual basis, becoming then just one possibility among
many others. Freud himself was adamant that his theories be
considered ``correct.'' In ``The Ego and the Id (1923)'' he wrote:
``The fact that in the technique of psychoanalysis a means has been
found by which the opposing force (repression) can be removed and
the ideas in question made conscious renders the theory
IRREFUTABLE.(ITAL)''
</P>
<P>
   The claim to irrefutability was part of Freud's myth.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Orpheus and Eurydice was a myth about the
exploration of the unconscious. Its moral was that knowing the dark
side of ourselves is not possible except in the symbols of art _
Orpheus' music.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of Freud was a modern version of same in which knowing
our unconscious selves in rational terms is not only possible, but
factually verifiable according to the theories of psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the old myth, and not the new one, more accurately
represents the human condition? Not all myths are equal. Some got
there first because they state a truth that lies at the center of
our existence.
</P>
<P>
   If the story of Orpheus is truer than the story of Freud, then
our conscious and unconscious selves are not meant to communicate
in the way Freud wanted them to. In psychoanalysis, the language of
the conscious self dominates the unconscious; the unconscious is
invaded. The Orpheus myth would lead us rather to leave the
unconscious alone on its own terms, and content our conscious
selves with meditating on the symbols of art and spirituality that
are the universal language of the unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   In very general terms, this is what Carl Jung did. The Swiss
student of Freud trumped his teacher's belief in the unconscious by
giving the unconscious its due, developing a whole new branch of
psychology that diverged from Freud by dwelling not on repressed
sexual urges but meaning of symbols from the unconscious. He
let the unconscious speak in its own language.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of plumbing the darkness inside ourselves, sexual or
otherwise, may have begun to pale. The latest trend in therapy is
philosophical therapy, which is an exact denial of psychological
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   According to philosophical therapists, our duties as people are
to develop conscious discernment and leave what cannot be discerned
to dreams, art and religion. In a time when Freudian theories have
decayed to the point that respect is given to every smirking sexual
reference on daytime television talk shows, it's a refreshing
concept. &QL;

U.S. SAID TO BE WORKING ON NEW TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a series of secret exchanges with Beijing
over the past two weeks, the White House is hoping to close a deal
by the end of this month that could pave China's way into the World
Trade Organization, even if Congress cannot pass judgment on the
agreement until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sparked by a phone call from President Clinton to President
Jiang Zemin late at night on Oct. 16, Washington and Beijing have
since engaged in what one official called an ``intense set of
interactions.'' Nonetheless, senior administration officials say
that there is only a 50-50 chance they will be able to close the
huge deal, which Clinton now views as his best shot at stabilizing
U.S. relations with China during his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has never publicly described that call, nor has
it described an internal strategy debate presided over by the White
House chief of staff, John Podesta, over how to close the elusive
deal. But according to Chinese and U.S. officials, Clinton offered
in the call to make the first move to break a long stalemate in the
talks, volunteering to send China's leaders the details of a deal
he characterized as Washington's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The details of that offer are being closely guarded, but areas
up for discussion include telecommunications, financial services,
textiles, and sanctions in retaliation for the dumping of exports,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative reveals how desperately Clinton is attempting to
put back together the huge trade deal he walked away from in April,
a move his aides say he now deeply regrets.
</P>
<P>
   While some in the White House say that the deal offered in April
would still not satisfy the administration, one top official mused
last week, ``If we could get it again, we'd probably take it and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment of maximum U.S. leverage to strike a deal is fast
approaching, as Clinton prepares to open a meeting of the world's
trade ministers in Seattle on Nov. 30. That session is expected to
set the agenda for a new round of global trade talks that will take
years _ and which China can influence only if it clearly is about
to join the group that sets the terms of world trade.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization
and the predecessor General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have
been going on for over 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Once China is in the organization, it will be required to abide
by the group's extensive rules on opening markets _ meaning it
would have to allow in far more foreign investors, farm goods and
providers of services. That would likely result in a boon for U.S.
companies, which have been lobbying hard for this agreement. But it
would also reduce Washington's ability to impose its own sanctions
on China, because the Chinese could use the trade forum's court to
arbitrate disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton's conversation with Jiang, trade officials have
been working to put together a draft of an agreement, based on the
U.S. understanding of the deal that didn't happen in April. But the
process is made more difficult by continuing disagreements between
China and the United States about what concessions China's premier,
Zhu Rongji, brought with him on that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House's decision to publish a long list of
those concessions so inflamed some powerful Chinese business
executives and their political patrons that China has been forced
to pull back, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is no longer clear that China is still willing
to let U.S. firms own 51 percent of Chinese telecommunications
companies. But if the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, struck a deal that gave U.S. telecommunications firms
less of an inroad into the booming Chinese communications market,
she would have to make the case that she extracted other
concessions that went beyond China's offer in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly still want a deal and want it soon,'' one
administration official who has been in touch with the Chinese said
recently. ``But it's becoming clear it won't be exactly the same
deal. The politics have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mysteries that the White House has not yet solved is
whether Jiang is still committed to striking a deal, especially at
a moment when he is under growing economic pressure at home.
Clinton was clearly frustrated in New Zealand in early September,
when Jiang dragged his feet in restarting negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His Oct. 16 call was followed up a week later with a trip to
China by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. While Summers was not
sent to negotiate _ Jiang and the country's top trade negotiators
were all in Europe _ he saw Zhu and after a three-hour meeting
reported that the embattled prime minister was still committed and
eager for China to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure created by opening China's markets, Zhu
once again told Summers, would help spur China's own reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's political enemies have seized upon the list of
concessions that the White House published in April to help
undermine a deal. And U.S. diplomats say that China's leaders
appear concerned that in the last year of his presidency Clinton
lacks the clout to push the deal through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses would have to approve a change in the Jackson-Vanik
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which requires Congress to
review China's trade status annually, a vote that gives many in
Congress a chance to voice their disapproval of China's human
rights record, its posture toward Taiwan, or its ballooning trade
surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent trade status would be implicit in any deal that got
China into the World Trade Organization. But under one scenario now
being discussed in Ms. Barshefsky's office, the United States would
reach an agreement with China but would invoke a seldom-used
provision of the World Trade Organization's rules that would
prevent China from enjoying some of the trade benefits with the
United States until a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could get a deal through Congress, even in an
election year,'' Rep. David Drier, the Republican who heads the
House Rules Committee, said in an interview last week. ``If
American industry says it's a good deal, I think that would be
enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky is being unusually tight-lipped about the talks,
which would mark the biggest trade deal in her tenure and a major
part of Clinton's foreign-policy legacy. She does not want to
appear too eager to strike a deal, always a dangerous negotiating
position. And her influence in the White House remains murky: Her
advice that Clinton take the April deal was overruled, after Robert
Rubin _ the Treasury secretary at the time _ and other
administration officials said that it could not get through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday Ms. Barshefsky announced that she expected formal
negotiations with China to resume this month. ``We have got to
see,'' she said Monday, when asked about the possibility of a deal.
``I'm neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I'm actually a realist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is quite a bit of work to do as we look ahead,'' she
said, noting that China would also have to conclude deals with
Europe, Canada and Latin America, though those would probably
closely follow whatever agreement was struck with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials close to Ms. Barshefsky say she may travel to
China before the Seattle trade meeting if there is enough progress
to suggest that a deal could be wrapped up in time for Clinton to
announce it during the Seattle session.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky still has two big hurdles to clear.
</P>
<P>
   One concern is textiles: At a moment when the United States is
urging other countries to drop trade barriers, Ms. Barshefsky is
under pressure from members of Congress representing textile-making
states to force China to agree to an extension of import quotas and
tariffs on Chinese-made fabrics. The Chinese are resisting. But
they may agree in return for other concessions from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the biggest stumbling-block: China's insistence
that the United States surrender its ability to invoke unilateral
trade sanctions against Chinese products that it determines are
being unfairly ``dumped'' at below-market prices in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a vital one for unions, which insist that
anti-dumping actions are critical to saving manufacturing jobs.
They are already putting pressure on Vice President Al Gore, who
has courted them assiduously, to protect their interests in any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his aides say, has no intention of getting near the
Seattle meeting.

   SEATTLE _ It's a somber time for the owners and the workers of
The Boeing Co.

   Investors and workers are coping with a weekend that recorded
the tragic crash of an EgyptAir 767 airplane and an embrassing
report that the company didn't share data on fuel tank problems
with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Investors expressed their concern by sending Boeing's stock down
3.1 percent in trading Monday, in part based on speculation that
the crash could create uncertaintity among the company's customers,
according to financial analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were coupled with a general worry about the
fallout from a report that the company didn't share some findings
about its fuel tanks for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the events rattled investors and weighed on the minds
of Machinists as they reported for work at Boeing's Everett plant
after the eventful weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is if there is some sort of implication that comes
back to Boeing or the manufacturing process making that aircraft
that could concern the airline customers and perhaps raise concerns
about future sales,'' said Peter Jacobs, an analyst who tracks
Boeing for the Ragen MacKenzie Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Only a day before the crash, Boeing was dealing with news
reports stating it didn't share a 1980 report on fuel tank problems
in one of its jumbo jets with federal investigators until June. The
investigators _ striving to determine what caused TWA Flight 800 to
explode in a ball of flame over Long Island in 1996 _ said the
report could have helped them.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's events also dampened the mood at lunch tables and
breakrooms at the Everett plant, where workers assembled the 767
that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said they're always concerned when one of the airplanes
they craft is involved in an accident, according to John Scofield,
who works on the 777 airplane line at the Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``a little somber,'' Scofield said. ``We are not happy
about it. We all fly those airplanes too.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Scofield and others say they don't expect investigators
to discover that a flaw in their craftsmanship or an oversight on
the assembly line led to Sunday morning's tragedy that appears to
have claimed 217 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, employees say, they expect the National Transportation
Safety Board to discover that a mistake in maintaining the plane or
some other flaw caused the EgypytAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys, they take great pride in the product they build,''
said Bill Johnson, the president of International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751, based in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The union and Boeing are also dealing with the revelation that
the EgyptAir 767 that crashed rolled off the assembly line right
before another 767 plane, owned by Lauda Air, that crashed eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Employees and union leaders rejected any connection, citing the
quality of the work and the checks-and-balances built into the
airplane manufacturing system.
</P>
<P>
   News reports ``make it sound like some flaw (was) built into the
airplane, I just don't see it,'' said a Boeing employee, who works
on the 767 line and requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The two days of bad news are the latest clouds to gather over
the Seattle-based aerospace giant. Boeing has already fallen behind
rival Airbus Industrie in the fight for new airplane orders this
year. So far, Airbus has captured about 70 percent of the 1999 firm
orders.
</P>
<P>
   And only last week, El Al, Israel's state-owned airline,
announced it's planning to buy Airbus planes for the first time.
While it also announced plans to buy at least three Boeing 777
planes. Currently, the carrier has an all-Boeing fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news coming out of Boeing is bad lately. The company
has reported a series of strong financial quarters, indicating that
its new campaign to cut costs is succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   And Chief Financial Officer Debbie Hopkins has received rave
reviews from Wall Street analysts for boosting the company's
financial performance.
