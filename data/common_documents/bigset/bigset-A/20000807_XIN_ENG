<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija

his week-long official visit to India.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed with the Indian counterparts all the issues of
Nepal-India relations and no confusion exists now in the relations
between the two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Koirala held official talks with his Indian
counterpart, Atal Vajpayee, and discussed the whole gamut of
bilateral relations, including the Kalapani territorial disputes,

<HEADLINE> Title Race Intense after Dalian Shide Loses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The race for the season's title
tends to get down to the wire as the league leaders Dalian Shide
has their winning momentum stopped by Tianjin Taida at home in the
20th round of the Chinese first division soccer league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taida overcame one goal deficit to beat Shide 2-1, keeping a
clean record against the league-leading club this season. They
edged Shide 1-0 at home court in the seventh round match.
</P>
<P>
Shide retained its league leading position with 45 points but
failed to pull away from the closest rival Shanghai Shenhua which
pulled off a 2-1 victory over Shenyang Haishi.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua, which now ranked second with 41 points, will keep heat
on Shide in a two-horse title race after the reigning champion
Shandong Luneng lost 2-0 to Jilin Aodong, which is struggling at
the bottom with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
Luneng, which stormed to its first title in club history last
season, has suffered their second straight loss and now stands
third with 35 points.
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the standings, Xiamen Xiaxin remains
languishing after they tied with Sichuan Quanxin 2-2 at home court.
They ranks second from bottom on 17 points.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Hainiu slid further after they lost 1-4 away to Beijing
Guo'an. With only 19 points from 20 matches, their chance of
staying in the first division next season becomes cloudy.
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the day, Liaoning Fushun beat Yunnan Hongta
2-1 at home and Shenzhen Ping'an forced Chongqing Longxin to a 2-2
road tie.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Adjourns Trial of Sectarian Massacre Until October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday adjourned until
October 3 the trial of 96 suspects charged in the killing of 20
Christians and one Muslim early this year in a Nile Valley town in
the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
All defendants in the so-called Kosheh case will remain under
detention, a criminal court in the southern city of Suhag decided,
state-run Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This was the second court session since the trial was first
opened on June 4. The defense attorneys argued at the court Monday
to clear the defendants of the responsibility for the events of
January, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the court for a tape of a television news report
recorded at Kosheh just after the events and asked for the calling
of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight of the defendants, all of them Muslims, face
execution if convicted on charges of premeditated murder during the
January 2 violence in Kosheh, 550 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The other defendants, 33 of them Coptic Christians, were being
tried on charges of attempted murder, armed robbery, destruction of
public property, illegal assembly, and illegal possession of
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tension first erupted on December 31 in Kosheh, a mainly
Christian town of 35,000 people, following a quarrel between a
Christian merchant and a Muslim customer over a piece of cloth.
</P>
<P>
It spiraled into full-scale rioting and gunfire conflict two
days later, with market stalls and shops burned and Christians
killed. The one Muslim killed was reportedly hit by a fleeing car.
</P>
<P>
Many villages in southern Egypt have large proportions of Copts,
who account for around 9 percent of Egypt's mainly Muslim
population of 65 million.

<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
called for holding an Arab summit, saying it is more urgent than
ever in view of some critical international and regional issues
needed to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
After seeing off Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, UAE Deputy
Prime Minister Sultan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan made the remarks in a
statement to the Emirates news agency (WAM), stressing this is the
country's official position.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Arafat's visit to the UAE was successful. The
Palestinian leader met Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi crown
prince and deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, and
discussed with him the latest developments in the Mideast Peace
talks, Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE tour is part of Arafat's campaign to rally support from
Arab and Islamic countries after the failure of the Camp David
talks in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The sticking point in the tough talks is the status of
Jerusalem. Israel proposed a shared sovereignty over Arab East
Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War while the
Palestinians insisted on a total sovereignty over the part of the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said that the Palestinian position reflects the Arab,
Islamic and Christian views.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that peace and stability would prevail in
the region and that Jerusalem would become the capital of Palestine
with people of all the three religions of Islam, Christianity and
Judaism free to practice their rituals in Jerusalem's holy places.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit, Arafat accused Israel of wanting "
Tailor-made Peace."
</P>
<P>
He also said that another U.S.-sponsored Palestinian-Israeli
summit may be held after August 14, but Israeli Prime Minister
Barak said it is "too early to discuss a new summit."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader praised UAE's President Zayed bin Sultan
Al Nahyan for his repeated calls for a unified Arab stance and his
full support to the Palestinian position on the issues of Jerusalem
and the return of Palestinian refugees.

concessions on the part of the Palestinians. (Israel-Palestinians-

<HEADLINE> United Nations Sets up Body to Monitor Violence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Administrative Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has set up a body to
monitor ethnic violence in the Yugoslav province, a spokeswoman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from the provincial capital of Pristina,
spokeswoman Susan Manuel said the purpose of the body would be to
compile statistics and "to define killings as political and
nonpolitical."
</P>
<P>
The would enable UNMIK to "determine what kind of incidents
are political and whether there is political trend going on," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Manuel said the new body would include representative of UNMIK
's head, Bernard Kouchner, as well as UNMIK police, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
international peacekeepers, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to avoid violence during the campaign for
municipal elections, due to take place in October, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission would investigate complaints
of political harassment, while the police would investigate
criminal acts, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since UNMIK made its presence in the Serbian province in
June last year, violence broke out and non-Albanian residents were
mainly victims of the terrorist actions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The international community has repeatedly warned UNMIK
against the trend towards independence of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting with Serbs for independence of the province
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeepers Restore Calm in Sierra Leone After Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Although most of Sierra
Leone is reported as calm on Monday, there was tension reported
overnight in the nation's capital of Freetown, where one Sierra
Leone Army soldier was shot dead on Sunday night while
investigating a shooting incident, a U.N. spokesman said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference here that "U.N. peacekeepers rushed to the area of the
killing and brought the situation under control."
</P>
<P>
"Two Sierra Leone Army recruits and a civilian technician were
arrested following the incident, and a further investigation is
underway," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeepers restored the calm while its mandate
expires on Monday and the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously
last Friday to extend the mandate of the U.N. Mission in Sierra
Leone, called UNAMSIL, until September 8.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL has its mandate renewed while U.N. officials
prepare recommendations to beef up the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Although UNAMSIL Commander Indian Major General Vijay Jetley
told reporters Thursday that he had asked the Security Council for
"many more troops" to increase from the current authorized
strength of 13,000 troops, the Council resolution did not mention
the increase.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
provide recommendations as soon as possible for restructuring and
beefing up the force.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also gives UNAMSIL a tougher mandate to deal
with rebels violating a peace accord signed by the rebels and
government in Lome, capital of Togo, in July last year. UNAMSIL
was sent into the war-torn country to monitor the peace accord,
which was intended to end the eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said attacks on UNAMSIL by the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) had "revealed serious inherent
weaknesses in the mission's structure, command and control and
resources."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. force is also due to "deter, and where necessary,
decisively counter the threat of RUF attack by responding robustly
to any hostile actions" or threat of imminent use of force, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
RUF, lead by Foday Sankoh, violated the peace accord by taking
more than 500 U.N. soldiers hostage and surrounding 223 others for
more than two months in the eastern part of the West African
country. Sankoh is currently in the government custody in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the "widespread and serious
violations" of the Lome agreement by the RUF "constitute a
breakdown of the prior generally permissive environment based on
the agreement" and predicted on the cooperation of the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to recommend adding several battalions,
raising the force strength to around 16,500 troops, although in a
recent report he said increasing UNAMSIL's strength would depend
on the willingness of U.N. members to provide the necessary well-
trained, well-equipped soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Conflict Lets Colombia 23 Bln Dls in Losses Per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Colombian armed conflict generates
direct and indirect economic losses for around 23 billion U.S.
dollars per year, representing 30 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
According to a recent research conducted by experts Luis
Londono and Rodrigo Guerrero, the war has caused 4.307 billion
dollars a year in indirect economic losses in the health sector,
and material damages amounting to 5.513 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The negative impact due to business activity reduction and the
investment withdrawal, amounts to 3.466 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, this research reveals that the Colombia's
internal conflict's indirect costs, include 5.944 billion dollars
due to consumption and labor opportunities reduction, and 3.79
billion dollars in burglary, assault, blackmail, and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
Other figures shown as a result of the research underscore that
the war
financing costs represent five percent of the GDP, that is, some 3.
75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the conflict resulted in the 4.1 percent fall of the
GDP in 1999 due to the "52 percent investment contraction, and
according to surveys, half this contraction can be understood due
to violence exerted on companies and houses," the research by
Londono and Guerrero noted.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meeting on Ethiopia, Eritrea Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The open Security Council
meeting, originally scheduled for Tuesday on Ethiopia and Eritrea,
has been postponed later in the week, a U.N. spokesman said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the U.N. spokesman, told a press
conference here the postponement was made to wait for the latest
report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is expected to
offer detailed plan for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in the
Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General's next report to the Council on
Ethiopia and Eritrea, which will detail plans for a U.N. presence
there, is still being finalized and is expected to go to the
Council in the next few days," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force is expected to patrol a 25-
kilometer buffer zone inside Eritrea, at which point Ethiopia's
army is to withdraw to prewar positions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations announced two weeks ago that a senior
Finish soldier, Colonel Jukka Pollanen, had arrived in Addis Ababa,
capital of Ethiopia, to set up an office to prepare the ground for
the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed the cease-fire pact in Algeria
under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity, ending
fighting in a two-year border war in which tens of thousands of
soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
But enmity and mistrust remain high between the Horn of Africa
neighbors. Observers here warned that skirmishes along the border
remain a possibility until the planned arrival of some 1,500 U.N.
peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Conservative Iranian Students Protest in Front of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- About 300 Tehran University
students staged a sit-in in front of the Majlis (parliament)
building Monday, calling for legal actions against the lawmakers
who they alleged had insulted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators handed out leaflets, condemning any "
disrespect" for the supreme leader, the patron of the powerful
conservative camp, by any parliamentarians and demanded legal
punishment for such a behavior, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei on Sunday ordered the reformist-controlled Majlis to
cancel a scheduled debate on rewriting the press law, which sparked
a brawl and scuffling among the Majlis deputies.
</P>
<P>
After Speaker Mehdi Karrubi read out the decision to cancel the
debate at the start of Sunday's open session, some deputies
expressed strong objection, an act regarded by some others
disrespect for the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Several of the protesting students wore white shroud, the symbol
of sacrifice and martyrdom in Islam, saying they would not allow
the Islamic revolution to "fall into the hands of the enemy," the
IRNA report said.
</P>
<P>
All these students belong to the conservative Basij -- the
volunteer force -- who pledge absolute loyalty to the supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tehran Bazaar, a powerful conservative
organization of businessmen, also announced Monday that it will
organize a gathering in front of the parliament on Tuesday in
support of the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The press law has become a major focus of factional struggle in
Iran. The conservative judiciary has used the restrictive law,
passed by the last, conservative-dominated Majlis before its tenure
ended, to close 20 pro-reform publications and send a number of
journalists to jail.
</P>
<P>
But the reformists, who won control of the Majlis in the
February parliamentary election, had vowed to rewrite the press law
to allow more "freedom of the press."
</P>
<P>
Their effort was dealt a deadly blow on Sunday as Khamenei
directly intervened by ordering to stop the debate in the
legislation. The tough move sets an example and is telling to the
reformists allied with President Mohammad Khatami as to who is
really in power in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives still have tight grip on most of the pivotal
state organs, including the judiciary and the military.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious reformists will find it no less difficult to push
through the reform programs advocated by President Khatami since
his took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Even if without direct intervention from the the supreme leader,
any bill passed by the Majlis must be endorsed by the conservative
Guardians Council before it can become law.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, EU Sign Economic Assistance Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the European Union (EU)
signed on Monday a series of agreements on EU economic assistance
to Cyprus, the official Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Cyprus Finance Minister Takis
Clerides and Donato Chiarini, head of the EU delegation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the EU is to provide 1.4 million euros (1.
3 million dollars) for Cyprus' harmonization with EU rules and
regulations, 1.4 million euros (1.3 million dollars) to finance the
participation of Cyprus in a program for research and technological
development and 2.4 million euros (2.2 million dollars) for the
development of civil society.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the signing of the agreements, Clerides noted
that Cyprus' request had been for "much higher amounts."
</P>
<P>
However, "we are happy to receive this amount," he said, adding
that "we are still looking for other amounts coming our way."
</P>
<P>
Chiarini admitted that the amount provided is below Cyprus'
expenditure for its EU harmonization process, but said "You are
much more prosperous than all the other candidates and also on the
per capita basis the amount is about what the others receive."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that there was no reason that Cyprus should
not ask for greater support from the EU and he pledged to support
such a request.
</P>
<P>
Chiarini also expressed EU support to greater contacts between
Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started substantive
accession negotiations with the EU in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Wanting "Tailor-made Peace" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said here Monday that what Israel wants is a "tailor-made" peace
which will be rejected not only by the Palestinians but also by the
Arab and Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Sunday night from Libya as part of a
tour to garner support for the Palestinians, made the remark at a
meeting with Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi crown prince
and deputy supreme commander of the United Arab Emirates Armed
Forces.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Khalifa on the collapsed Camp David summit and the
international reactions based on his ongoing tour, stressing that
the Palestinians are determined to continue their struggle and
steadfastness to set up their independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital.
</P>
<P>
He praised UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan's
repeated calls for a unified Arab stance in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks and his full support to the Palestinian position on the
issues of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Khalifa reaffirmed the UAE's support for the
Palestinians, urging the United States, the main broker in the
Middle East peace process, to observe impartiality and seek
solutions which conform with the related international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa also reiterated the need for Israel to return East
Jerusalem it seized in the 1967 Mideast War to Palestinian
sovereignty, according to the official news agency WAM.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa hailed Arafat's position at the Camp David talks and his
firm stand against all kinds of pressure to force him to make
concessions on the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President
Bill Clinton held a marathon summit at Camp David, a presidential
retreat near Washington, last month trying to seal an agreement on
the Israeli-Palestinian final status.
</P>
<P>
The talks failed to produce such an agreement due to the gaps
between the two sides on the thorny issues including Jerusalem,
statehood, Jewish settlements, refugees, water and security.
</P>
<P>
Arafat repeatedly announced he will declare Palestinian
statehood on September 13, even without a peace deal with Israel,
which has met threatening objection from the U.S. and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Barak Calls for Countering Palestinian Information Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (XInhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Monday that Israel should step up its "information
campaign" worldwide in light of the Palestinian efforts to
publicize their stand in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who contemporarily holds the foreign ministry portfolio,
has met with a number of officials from the ministry and rejected
former Foreign Minister David Levy's accusation that his foreign
policy is "zigzagging."
</P>
<P>
Levy resigned from the cabinet last Wednesday in protest of
Barak's alleged concessions to the Palestinians during the Camp
David summit and his "lack of sincere steps" to form a national
unity government with the opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Foreign Ministry Director General Eytan Bentsur
quit his post and was expected to receive an overseas post in a
European capital.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent concrete effort to drum up international support,
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, also Israel's top
negotiator with the Palestinians, is expected to arrive in Turkey
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He will brief Turkish leaders on the peace process and the
outcome of the 15-day U.S.-brokered Camp David summit, which ended
on July 25 without reaching an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Next week, Ben-Ami will be joined by Transport and Tourism
Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak in visits to European and Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister himself is also planning to visit Jordan to
meet King Abdullah II. He has met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
who refused to pressure Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to make
concessions on the issue of Jerusalem, a sticking point which had
led to the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
In another development on Monday, Barak continued his effort to
rebuild his coalition government which has been left with only 12
ministers and 40 seats in the 120-member Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Barak met Knesset member Roman Bronfman to discuss the
possibility of the latter's Democratic Choice faction's joining the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Bronfman said later that this would depend on the composition of
the coalition. He said his faction would only join a "civilian
Zionist government" that would concentrate on internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Bronfman said, his two-seat party would support the
government on a selective basis.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science, Culture and Sports Matan Vilnai has said
the prime minister is still interested in bringing the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party back into the coalition, and called for
continued efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest grouping in the Knesset after Barak's
One Israel coalition and the Likud, bolted the government on the
eve of Barak's departure for the Camp David summit, partly to shirk
responsibility for a possible "bad agreement" that Barak might
bring back.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Shas leadership has sent out mixed signals as
to whether it wants to return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak on Sunday named four cabinet ministers from the ruling One
Israel to be temporarily in charge of portfolio vacated by the
defected ministers. Barak said the remaining ministerial vacancies
will be filled soon although he may himself keep those of foreign
affairs and education.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Seeks Ways to Ease Energy Shortage by Xing Guoxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, heavily feeling pressure of
energy shortage, is making more efforts to find solutions to meet
the growing energy demand which increases nearly 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Following the cancellation of the tender for a nuclear plant in
southern Akkuyu because of financial problem and environmental
concerns, Turkey is desperately looking for alternative energy
sources, with natural gas being the top option.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Suayip Usenmez said last Saturday that
the cabinet was discussing a report titled "Restructuring Works,
Views, Criticisms, and Proposals in the Field of Oil and Natural
Gas Under the Facts of the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The report said Turkey will mainly depend on import of oil and
natural gas in the future given the country's scarcity of oil and
gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has realized that a real energy shortage will befall the
country for lack of necessary measures to diversify energy types
and supplying countries. Russia, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Iran
are the main suppliers now.
</P>
<P>
Under the Blue Stream project signed with Russia, energy hungry
Turkey will import 365 billion cubic meters of gas via a black sea
pipeline of Russia in 25 years as of the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
A pipeline linking Iran's northwestern Tabriz to Ankara is under
construction. Under a protocol signed early this month, as of July
30, 2001, the pipeline will transfer 3 billion cubic metres of gas
to Turkey annually.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the protocol cleared all obstacles to the
construction of the pipeline which had been delayed due to the
tense relations between the two neighbors and the U.S. opposition.
</P>
<P>
The United States has voiced opposition to the Turkish-Iranian
deal on the grounds that it was a rival to the trans-Caspian
pipeline. To appease Washington, Ankara has repeatedly said the
trans-Caspian pipeline is a priority.
</P>
<P>
Since the uncertainty of a pipeline project with Turkmenistan,
Turkey is eying the newly-discovered Azeri natural gas reserves in
the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer has recently visited
Azerbaijan, highlighting the importance of Azeri gas for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to start negotiations on
transporting the gas through a pipeline adjacent to the strategic
Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline that will transport the rich Caspian oil
to western markets via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ankara is rebuilding the Tarutina Compressor
station in Ukraine to increase the capacity of the current Russia-
Turkey natural gas pipeline via Ukraine and the station will be
operational in the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
By then, the transfer capacity of the pipeline will rise to 19.8
billion cubic meters from the current 16 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to diversify types of energy, the government will
attach importance to the establishment of new wind, water and
thermic power plants.

KUWAIT CITY, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait stressed Monday that
Jerusalem was not a mere Palestinian issue but an important Arab

</P>
<P>
This was stated by Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah following a
meeting with visiting United States Assistant Secretary of State
for Far East Affairs Edward Walker.
</P>
<P>
Sabah expressed the hope that the Palestinian and Israeli sides
could reach a just, fair and durable peace.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah have held separate
meetings with Walker, who arrived here Sunday night for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Walker conveyed a message from U.S. President Bill Clinton to
the Kuwaiti emir on the failed Camp David talks between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak under
the auspices of Clinton last week in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The two-week talks failed to solve final-status issues,
including Jerusalem, statehood, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, water and security, to pave the way for the conclusion
of a permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Walker is on a Mideast tour as the U.S. efforts to revive the
peace march on the Palestinian-Israeli track after the failure of
Camp David talks. He has visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Albania's Liaison Office in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Monday lodged "
the strongest protest" over the establishment of the Liaison
Office of the Republic of Albania in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province,
saying that the establishment violates the U.N. Charter and the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and that the
Office "will be abused" to further separatism and secession in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The protest, which describes the Albanian move as "unlawful
act," came in a letter to the president of the U.N. Security
Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the
Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations. The letter is being
circulated here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Office was "characterized by the Republic of Albania as '
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and
Kosovo'," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "this act of diplomatic piracy is not the first
one committed by the Republic of Albania in violation of the
principle of the Charter of the United Nations and international
law relative to respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity
of other States."
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the Liaison Office of the Republic of
Albania will be abused for the furtherance of separatism,
secession of Kosovo and Metohija and the creation of Greater
Albania," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a June 10 resolution adopted last year, the Security
Council demands that all Member States should respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and Kosovo is part of the Balkan country.

<HEADLINE> ITU, IETF Achieve Single Standard to Bridge Circuit-Switched and IP-Based Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) have agreed to a single standard on the control of
gateway devices, according to an ITU press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ITU hailed the agreement after more than one year of hard
work as a further major milestone in multimedia standards allowing
scalable and seamless implementation of services and applications
over circuit-switched and IP-based networks. The standard, ITU-T H.
248, will also be published as the Megaco protocol in the IETF,
the international body responsible for the Internet protocol (IP).
</P>
<P>
"This is the next in a continuing series of technologies that
are benefiting from the close cooperation of the IETF and the ITU-
T in areas of common interest," said Scott Bradner, Transport Area
Director in the IETF and Vice-President of Standards at the
Internet Society (ISOC).
</P>
<P>
With the new standard, gateway devices will be to pass voice,
video, fax and data traffic between conventional telephone and
packet-based data networks such as commercial IP networks or the
Internet. Connections through these gateways will allow callers
from a normal telephone to make voice calls over commercial packet
networks such as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"While the H.323 family of standards already provides an
extensive framework for the provision of these new services, H.248
will for the first time allow low-cost gateway devices to
interface in a standard way with the signaling systems found in
conventional telephone networks", said Pierre-Andre Probst,
chairman of ITU-T Study Group 16 responsible for multimedia
services and systems.

<HEADLINE> UK Jobless Figures Affected By Birth Rate Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) - The declining share of young people
in the workforce has lowered the sustainable rate of unemployment
in Britain, according to a research by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
As much as 10 percent of the drop in the jobless rate between
1984 and 1998 may have been triggered by the collapse in the birth
rate during the 1970s "baby bust", the research concludes.
</P>
<P>
This may have lowered the equilibrium rate of unemployment --
the level consistent with stable inflation -- by half a percentage
point, it suggests.
</P>
<P>
The baby bust has almost halved the number of young people in
the workforce during the past 15 years. And as younger people are
more prone to experience unemployment than old people, this has
led to a fall in the overall jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
Richard Barwell, who conducted the research, said that in 1981,
9.9 percent of the labor force were aged 16-19 and by 1994, this
had fallen to 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Barwell expected that over the next few years the
youth share of employment will increase slightly while the number
of people aged 25-34 will decline sharply as the "baby bust"
generation grows older.

<HEADLINE> Motoring In Britain Costs More Than Mortgage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Motorists in Britain spend more
running a car than paying mortgage, according to the official
figures released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Diaries kept by more than 11,000 households show the cost of
motoring has for the first time outstripped the cost of
accommodation and food.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated car owners aged under 50 now spend up to a
fifth of their income on buying and running a car when
depreciation is included.
</P>
<P>
The Family Expenditure Survey reveals that the weekly price of
keeping a car has risen to more than 71 pounds since figures were
last published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Food and non-alcoholic drink now account for 66 pounds of the
average family's weekly budget and rent or mortgage repayments
make up 67 pounds.
</P>
<P>
It is generally acknowledged that the figures compiled by the
Office for National Statistics, were further evidence that drivers
were being unfairly penalized.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years fuel costs have doubled but an Auto
Association spokesman said: "It is not just petrol, insurance has
rocketed and car prices are dearer in Britain than anywhere else
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The cost of running a car has far outstripped inflation. For
some people it is now becoming untenable to run a car," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 353 Million U.S. Dollars in U.N. "Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported some 353
million U.S. dollars worth of oil last week, the latest figures
from the United Nations Office of Iraq Program said on Monday
</P>
<P>
The Office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, reported that for the week to August 4, Iraq
exported 14.9 million barrels of oil under the program.
</P>
<P>
The Office said since the beginning of Phase Eight on June 9,
2000, Iraq has now exported 106.8 million barrels for revenue
estimated around 2560 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the last week, the United Nations Security Council Sanctions
Committee approved a further seven contracts for the export of
Iraq oil, bringing the total of approved contracts to 92 for a
volume of 368.38 million barrels, the Office added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the "oil-for-
food program," 66 percent of earning goes to fund the country's
humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the Compensation
Commission, which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission and U.N. operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until the United
Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arm inspectors have been away from Iraq since the U.S.
-led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> EC Approved Joint Venture to Make Groundbreaking Ruling on Internet Marketplace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Monday approved the business-to-business joint venture of
MyAircraft.com to make a groundbreaking ruling on the Internet
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said
that it had found no competition problems with the joint venture
between United Technologies Corp. and Honeywell International Inc.,
both from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the joint venture would be seen by third
parties as a tool to make the operation within the aerospace
industry quicker, more efficient and less costly.
</P>
<P>
Other B2B marketplaces in the same sector have also been looked
into by the commission that cautioned on Monday that it would
judge other like joint ventures case by case on their respective
merits.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Co., BAe Systems Plc, Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon
Co. announced last month that they were forming an aerospace B2B
joint venture called "Exostar".
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been closely monitoring the mergers and
joint ventures so that none should establish a domination in the
marketplace that rules out the competition from other companies in
the same sector.

<HEADLINE> Greece Sets Up Hotlines for Information on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece has set up two hotlines for
information on terrorists as part of its efforts to deal with the
increasingly terrorist acts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The hotlines, the first of its kind in Greece, were linked
with Greece's anti-terrorist service and would be staffed on a 24-
hour basis, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
No caller ID or recording machine would be placed on the two
lines and that conversation would be strictly confidential.
</P>
<P>
In the past 26 years, Greece's "November 17" terrorist group
has killed more than 20 people, including Britain's defense
attache in Greece Stephen Saunders, who was shot dead in early
June.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Greek police are closely cooperating with
Britain's Scotland Yard in a bid to bring those responsible for
the killing to justice.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to grant the police and judiciary wider powers in
dealing with terrorism cases, the Greek government is expected to
submit a counter-terrorism bill to the parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for the abolishment of measures construed as
protecting terrorism suspects while it will also allow for house
searches.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Greece's Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos will
visit the U.S. to sign a police cooperation protocol between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> Slight of Duty in Dutroux's Video Tapes: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A slight of duty was reported
Monday on the part of investigators into the Marc Dutroux case as
some confiscated video tapes had never been viewed to help
pinpoint the child abuser and killer much earlier.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux is described by local people as the most notorious
child abuser and killer in Belgium and his arrest in 1996 and his
attempt to escape from police in 1998 twice caused sensation
around the country.
</P>
<P>
La Derniere Heure newspaper quoted the country's special
committee P (police of polices) as saying that some video tapes
confiscated from Dutroux's house at Marcinelle in December 1995
was never viewed by the investigators.
</P>
<P>
But the content of the video tapes was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was arrested in 1994 and released not long after. He
was arrested in August 1996 charged with abusing, raping and
killing two little girls.
</P>
<P>
Two more girls were later found dead within the premises of his
house and local people have been accusing the police of slight of
duty for otherwise the girls could have been saved. Autopsy
results showed that the two girls died of starvation after Dutroux
had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 people from around Europe gathered in Brussels to
protest against the police dysfunction in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux then stirred up another sensation when he broke loose
from two accompanying gendarmerie just prior to a pre-trial
hearing at Neufchateau in southeastern Belgium in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of police and gendarmerie had to be mobilized from
Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands in the ensuing
manhunt that took more three hours to catch him again.
</P>
<P>
Two Belgian cabinet ministers had to resign to take the
responsibility of this attempted escape from police and
gendarmerie. The country is now under pressure for reforms on its
justice and law enforcement systems.
</P>
<P>
It was not until February last year when people viewed one of
the confiscated tapes which was taken away by a gendarme.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the committee P as labeling the police
dysfunction as "a lack of rigor and of professionalism". But the
committee did not say whether an earlier viewing of the
confiscated video tapes could have led to early arrest of Dutroux.
</P>
<P>
The committee P reported on Monday its finding on the police
dysfunction to the general prosecutor in Liege and is expected to
report to the Belgian parliament soon.

<HEADLINE> Gore Names Senator Lieberman as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic presidential
candidate Monday named Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his
running mate and Lieberman accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
Gore made the offer in a telephone call to Lieberman on Monday,
making the Senator become the first Jewish vice-presidential
candidate in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
"It is a special honor to be asked to run for vice-president
with a man I deeply believe in, Al Gore, and who I think is ready
to be a great president," Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, 58, was picked up after beating five other finalists,
Indiana Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, North Carolina Senator John
Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt and New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Gore and his running mate are expected to appear
together in Nashville of Tennessee State for a formal announcement
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, is also known as the first Democrat
publicly to criticize President Bill Clinton for the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
By selecting a political moderate like Lieberman, Gore is
trying to reach out to both independents and Republicans and
distance himself from Clinton's controversies, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Gore trailed Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
by 17 points in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Sunday. The
poll was taken just after the Republican National Convention
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, who was first elected to the Senate in 1988 and got
re-elected in 1994, bills himself as pro-business, pro-environment
and pro-defense. He has served as chairman of the Democratic
Leadership Council in the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Military Pullout to Avail Ties With Georgia: Shevardnadze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian troops' withdrawal
from Georgia will help improve the relations between the two
countries, not leading to their degradation, Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze told an interview with the national radio
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's pulling out its technical weapons and gradually
removing its military bases from Georgia "don't mean the
complication and deterioration of the traditionally friendly
relations between the two countries," the Interfax news agency
quoted Shevardnadze as saying in the interview in Tbilisi, capital
of the former soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The military withdrawal from Georgia will do no harm to Russia'
s national security, but accelerate the improvement of the
relationship between the two states and strengthen their mutual
trust in each other, stressed the president.
</P>
<P>
He noted that other member nations of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) do not have Russian military bases on
their soil but maintain normal relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Georgian-Russian ties should be established and develop on the
basis of equality, mutual benefit and respecting both nations'
interests, Shevardnadze added.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe and
bilateral agreements reached between Georgia and Russia, Moscow
started military withdrawal from Georgia since the beginning of
this month. By the end of this year, Russian will pull out 244
pieces of technical weapons from the republic.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military bases in the towns of Vaziani and Gudauta
in Georgia's conflicting region of Abkhazia are also being
withdrawn in line with an understanding reached at the OSCE (the
Organization of Security and Cooperation for Europe) summit held
in the Turkish port-city of Istanbul earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rabbinate Studies Synagogue on Temple Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief Rabbinate Council
Monday discussed a proposal on building a synagogue on Temple Mount
and set up a committee which would review the restrictions of the
Jewish law concerning entry by Jews into the holy area.
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier reports that the subject would not be discussed
out of political considerations, the council held a preliminary
debate on the proposal by Rabbi Shear-Yeshuv Cohen, chief rabbi of
the northern coastal city of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Cohen presented historical findings regarding the ever
existence of a synagogue on the Temple Mount and material evidence
from research studies by former Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Temple is
the most sacred place in Judaism and also home to Islamic shrines.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the majority of Israel's senior rabbis, the late Rabbi
Goren favored permitting Jews to visit the Temple Mount, located in
the Old City in East Jerusalem that the Palestinians are striving
to make the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Cohen said there are enough opinions and findings to
detail the area where the Jews are permitted to enter. Therefore,
the project to establish a synagogue on the Temple Mount should
proceed.
</P>
<P>
But so far the council has not changed the rabbinical ruling
that Jews must not enter the Temple Mount for fear of treading on
holy ground.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after the 1967 Middle East War in which Israel
seized East Jerusalem, 56 of Israel's most important rabbis issued
a warning against Jews' entering "the entire area of the Temple
Mount," lest they violate the "strict prohibition against
desecrating the purity of the temple site."
</P>
<P>
Mufti of Jerusalem Ekrima Sa'id Sabri warned Sunday that "if the
Al-Aqsa Mosque (Islam's third holiest shrine) is harmed, not only
the Muslims here but the Muslims all over the world will not sit
idly by."
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem, particularly sovereignty over the
Temple Mount, is the toughest issue in Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, which aim to a peace deal by September.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini has
urged the Israelis to stop attempts to build a synagogue at the
contentious holy area and said the project could be an obstacle to
peace.
</P>
<P>
The minister, in a commentary published on International Herald
Tribune Monday, also said that the Palestinians recognize the
interests of the Jewish people in Jerusalem and seek to share the
Holy City with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He said the city is already divided and compromise on it by both
sides is possible.

<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
seized on Monday 100 kilograms of heroin in Baskale town of eastern
Van province, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, the police raided a house in Baskale's
Guroluk village and confiscated the drug buried in the front garden
of the house.
</P>
<P>
Muzaffer Sahin, the owner of the house, was arrested. He
confessed to having brought the heroin from Iran and planning to
take it to Istanbul, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, anti-drug police also seized 22 marijuana
plants and 10 grams of powdered hashish in Iskenderun town of
southern Hatay province and 19,250 marijuana plants in Umutlu
village of Nurhak township in southeastern Kahramanmaras province,
arresting four suspects.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, anti-drug forces have captured
3,219 suspects on drug-related cases and seized 2,850 kilograms of
heroin, 22.6 tons of hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56
kilograms of opium, 6 kilograms of cocaine, 5.5 tons of acid
anhydride, 618,336 captogan pills and 14,964 synthetic drugs, a
police statement said.
</P>

related cases and anti-drug forces seized 2,249 kilograms of
heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of base morphine,

<HEADLINE> Singapore Unions Leader: Cooperate to Prevent Structural Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore labor unions leader
has called for tripartite cooperation among the government, unions
and employers in the country's efforts to prevent the increasing
structural unemployment.
</P>
<P>
In his National Day message to unions and employers Monday, Lim
Boon Heng, Secretary-General of the National Trade Unions
Congress and Minister without Portfolio, said Singapore can keep
structural unemployment from taking root only if the government,
unions and employers work as a team.
</P>
<P>
He also said that there is a need to attract more investments
so that Singapore can have more and better jobs.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the key lies with each and everyone who seizes
the opportunity to upgrade skills, he urged workers to assume
individual responsibility and save part of their income for
retraining where necessary.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Manpower Lee Boon Yang revealed Sunday
that retrenchments hit 7,700 in Singapore in the first half of
this year, 1,000 more than the 6,700 retrenchments seen in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that June's unemployment rate reached 3.5 percent,
a figure significantly higher than the pre-crisis unemployment
rate of less than 2 percent and also up from the rate of 3.4
percent for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rise of unemployment mainly to increasing
retrenchments in the manufacturing sector which was most severely
affected by the cycle of upgrading and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Older and lower skilled workers were retrenched by a
restructuring economy and they were unable to take up newly-
created jobs because of lack of needed skills, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government hopes to increase the skilled
workers to 65 percent of the whole workforce from the current 34
percent over the next 15 years and reduce the semi-skilled and
unskilled workers to 20 percent and 15 percent respectively from
the present-day 28 percent and the 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Signs Law on Upper House Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
has signed the bill on changing the way of the Upper House's
formation, the last one of his three planned bills to tighten
Moscow's control over Russia's federal regions, said the Kremlin
press service Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, regional and territorial leaders in the Russian
Federation Council, the upper chamber of the parliament, will be
replaced by two permanently working representatives from each
territory -- one from the legislative branch and the other from
the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
All incumbent Federation Council members, also heads of
territorial legislatures and administrations, shall be replaced by
January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the legislative branch will be elected by
the territorial legislature, while that of the executive branch
will be appointed by the top executive official -- governor of a
territory or president of a federal republic in the Russian
Federation -- and will need to be agreed on by two thirds of
deputies of the territorial legislature.
</P>
<P>
The representatives, who must be no less than 30 years old, may
be dismissed in the same way as they are appointed or elected, and
the mandate of the senators will be extended from two to four
years.
</P>
<P>
By this law, the regional leaders will also lose their immunity
from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Putin submitted the bill on reforming the Federation Council to
the State Duma, the lower house of the parliament, on May 19, and
the Duma ratified the bill in the second and third readings on
June 23.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council, however, vetoed the bill on June 28.
</P>
<P>
0n July 17, a trilateral conciliatory commission, consisting of
representatives from the two chambers of parliament and the
president, reached a compromise on amendments submitted by the
upper house to the Duma, which approved the amendatory bill two
days later.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, the Federation Council approved the bill by a vote
of 119 for and 18 against with four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the adoption of Putin's three bills aimed to
strengthen Moscow's central authorities has capped his victory
over independent-minded regional rulers.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Putin signed a new law on regional autonomy,
which allows provincial governors to fire mayors and local
officials who are found to have violated the law.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another law passed by the parliament allows Putin to
fire governors who are found to violate the law.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the three bills by both houses of the
parliament last month despite the strong opposition from regional
governors is seen as a key domestic policy victory for the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who won election in March on a platform of strengthening
the state and Russia's global clout, says that many of the
regional governors are highly authoritarian and have pushed for
greater autonomy, so reining in the regions is necessary to fix
Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to appease angry regional leaders, Putin
has proposed that both houses of the parliament create a committee
on how to implement the new laws.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Signs New Tax Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
announced Monday that he has signed the new Tax Code into law,
describing it as "a major event in the life of the country."
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting of the cabinet and the presidential
administration in the Kremlin, he said that he inked the bill
Sunday, thanking all the cabinet member who had contributed to
drafting the code and promoting it in the Federal Assembly,
reported Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Finance Ministry is expected to submit its 2001
budget draft to the cabinet in accordance with the new tax code,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines of the new tax code are to lower taxes rate,
reduce tax categories and expand the foundation of taxation for
increasing tax collection and enhancing business activities, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new tax code will introduce a flat income tax of 13 percent
and other measures designed to boost the troubled Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
Introducing personal income tax, value-added tax and
consumption tax, the new code also will consolidate all existing
social charges, involving several payroll taxes, into a single
social, lower social security tax.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the package include eliminating loopholes such
as income tax exemptions for soldiers and judges.
</P>
<P>
The new 13 percent flat tax, which would take effect next year,
replaces an existing progressive tax rate ranging from 12 percent
to 30 percent. That will mean a tax increase for poorer Russians
who now pay 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the excise will be much higher after the code
becomes effective. Especially, the consumption tax for alcohol and
vodka will rise to five percent with the rate for beer up to 10
percent, while the index of tobacco probably tops to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian government leaders say that the new tax code
will be a major step in reviving stalled market reforms.
</P>
<P>
The government, which consistently fails to meet its tax
collection goals, says the lower rate will cut evasion and boost
government revenue by encouraging businesses and individuals to
report their true incomes.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the single rate will also boost tax revenue
by making it easier to calculate and collect taxes. The government
is also hoping the lower rate will encourage Russians to bring
home and invest some of the billions of dollars now lodged in
secret foreign bank accounts. The tax burden on companies is
believed to fall by 25 percent after the new code comes into force.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia, with most businesses
and private citizens avoiding tax altogether or underreporting
their incomes. Business leaders complain that the combined burden
of income tax, profits tax and social security taxes would drive
them out of business if they paid in full.
</P>
<P>
After being elected as head of state in March, Putin has
repeatedly vowed to press ahead with market reforms, which stalled
during the inertia of the last years of the presidency of Boris
Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Gore Selects Lieberman as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
has selected Connecticut Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running
mate, the AP reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gore will call Lieberman later Monday to inform him of the
decision and the two will appear together in Nashville of
Tennessee State for a formal announcement Tuesday, the report
quoted Democratic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gore made the decision after consulting with his top advisors,
including former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who headed
up his search process, his brother-in-law Frank Hunger, his wife
Tipper and campaign chairman Bill Daley.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, 58, will be the first Jewish vice presidential
candidate in American history.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, is also known as the first Democrat
publicly to criticize President Bill Clinton for the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
Gore selected Lieberman from a short list of possible
candidates, including Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, North
Carolina Senator John Edwards, Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, House
Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt and New Hampshire Governor Geanne
Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
By selecting a political moderate like Lieberman, Gore is
trying to reach out to both independents and even Republicans and
distance himself from Clinton's controversies, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, who was first elected to the Senate in 1988 and got
re-elected in 1994, bills himself as pro-business, pro-environment
and pro-defense. He has served the past five years as chairman of
the Democratic Leadership Council.

<HEADLINE> Gangsters' Shooting in Tokyo Leaves Two Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A shooting incident broke out when
a group of armed men stormed into an office of a right-wing
organization in central Tokyo on Monday, killing two people and
injuring five others, police said.
</P>
<P>
About 15 knife-wielding attackers broke into the office of the
rightist group Sofusha (Blue Wind Group) and began firing at
around 3:20 p.m., and were met by gunfire by three Sofusha members
in the office, police said.
</P>
<P>
The police later seized two handguns and arrested the three
Sofusha members for possessing firearms. Investigators believed
the incident was a case of intra-group conflict.
</P>
<P>
The knife-wielding gangsters besieged the Sofusha office to
collect loans, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Sofusha, an organization with more than 30 members, was
established in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Thompson Aims for First Olympic Individual Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- After five gold medals all
from relay events, Jenny Thompson is pursuing her first-ever
individual gold in the Olympic Games when the U.S. swimming trials
will start in Indianapolis on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At 27, Thompson who is tied with speedskater Bonnie Blair for
the most Olympic gold medals by an American woman, will enter her
fourth Olympic swimming trials, and mostly likely the last chance
to attempt for an individual title in the quandrennial Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's important to me because I feel I'm capable of doing it,"
Thompson said, "If this is my last Olympics, I can know that I'm
ending the closest i can get to my potential."
</P>
<P>
"If I stopped now, I would feel disappointed, not because I
didn't get a gold medal but because i didn't try. I feel I owe it
to myself."
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Thompson finished second to Zhuang Yong of
China in the 100-meter freestyle, wherein she even set a world
record four months before, becoming the first swimmer outside
former East Germany to set a world mark in the event in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago at the Olympic trials, Thompson missed all the
individual events by finishing the best of the third place in the
100-meter freestyle as only two swimmers qualify for each event.
</P>
<P>
Despite her three gold medals from the relays, her individual
gold remaines elusive after the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Thompson began to reassess her career and has been
swimming faster than ever, using weight training, yoga and
stretching exercises to increase her strength and flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Last year, she set a world record in the 100-meter butterfly of
57.88 seconds, breaking a mark by Mary Meagher that had stood for
18 years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Thompson broke her own American record in the 100m
freestyle in 54.27, set a personal best of one minute 59.49
seconds in the 200m freestyle and came within two-hundredths of a
second of her best in the 50m freestyle in 25.20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
At the trials which will run through August 16, Thompson will
wear the Fastskin bodysuit made by Speedo to try the individual
freestyle and butterfly events, hoping for an eventual hit for any
Olympic individual gold medal.

<HEADLINE> All-Woman Jumpers Make Olympic History in Equestrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- History was made on Sunday
when an all-woman show-jumping equestrain team earned the right to
represent the United States in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Never before in the male-dominated sport has an all-woman team
competed for any country in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Margie Goldstein-Engle, 42, qualified in the top spot at the
Del Mar Horsepark, and will lead her women compatriots Nona Garson,
Laura Kraut and Lauren Hough into history.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more women riders here," Goldstein-Engle said, "
In Europe it's the opposite. There will probably be more women on
our team than all the others put together."
</P>
<P>
Goldstein-Engle, Garson and Kraut led the field by so much
going into the final round, they didn't even have to jump,
although Goldstein-Engle brought her Perin, a 10-year-old
Westphalian gelding out to give him a shot at the liverpool, a
jump he has never attempted.
</P>
<P>
Kraut and Garson chose not to jump the final round.
</P>
<P>
For Hough, however, the final round was crucial as she trailed
Todd Minikus by 0.25 faults, and was tied with Nicole Shahinian-
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
After Shahinian-Simpson committed 12 faults, knocking her out
of contention, Minikus recorded a round of eight, taking over the
fourth and final qualifying spot.
</P>
<P>
Hough, an Olympic team gold medalist and individual silver
medalist in the 1984 Games, came next and she dazzled the crowd
with perfection through the first eight jumps before just brushing
No. 9 an oxer for her only fault.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't hit me yet," said Hugh, 23, "I'm in shock, but I
didn't want to think about it. I knew coming down the last line I'
d make it and I just wanted to get it over with."

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Gained Money From Kidnapping: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Philippine official said
Monday that Abu Sayyaf kidnappers have obtained some 245 million
pesos(6.13 million U.S. dollars) paid by foreign countries for the
release of eight hostages including six Malaysians and two Germans.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief of staff Angelo
Reyes admitted during Monday's cabinet meeting that the virtual
ransom payments under the name of "board and lodging" fee were
handed over in backdoor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said the money is now being used to acquire rebel
firearms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Other government officials, including chief hostage crisis
negotiator Secretary Robert Aventajado downplayed Reyes' admission
during the cabinet meeting, stressing that the Philippine
government has stood by its no-ransom policy.
</P>
<P>
Press secretary Ricardo Puno, for his part, supported
Aventajado's claim that the government has had nothing to do with
supposed payments to the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think anything about the Abu Sayaf's supposedly
receiving ransom money. The chief negotiator as we heard is still
maintaining his policy of no ransom and he will continue to talk
to them on that basis," Puno said.
</P>
<P>
However, Puno also said that the government cannot control the
flow of money if there are groups willing to pay ransoms to the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary also admitted that the Abu Sayyaf has
acquired more firearms and ammunition but stressed that the AFP is
now in addressing the situation.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government is still confident that hostage
release negotiation would resume, and that the remaining 30
hostages, including 13 Filipino evangelists led by Wilde Almeda
will be released soon.
</P>
<P>
Among the other hostages are five French nationals including
three journalists, three Malaysians, two Germans, two Finnish
nationals, a South African couple, two Filipinos, and one Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue on Kashmir Cannot Exclude Pakistan: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday insisted that
any dialogue aimed at a final solution to the long-standing
Kashmir dispute cannot exclude it.
</P>
<P>
"A peaceful negotiated settlement of the Kashmir dispute has to
be through a dialogue between India and Pakistan in which
participation of Kashmiri leaders is indisputable," said Foreign
Office spokesman Riaz Muhammad Khan at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations Security Council resolutions on
Kashmir have recognized Pakistan and India as the two principal
parties to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot see a dispute be solved outside the perimeter
identified by U.N resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Khan, the first of all conditions for a just
settlement of the Kashmir dispute is India's termination of all
oppression against the Kashmiri people and the Kashmiri freedom
struggle."
</P>
<P>
He urged India to stop "massive human rights violations" in
Kashmir and "respond positively to the international community's
call for a dialogue with Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent communication between the Indian
government and Hizbul Mujahideen, a major Muslim militant group in
India-controlled Kashmir, Khan said that put to test India's
sincerity to a negotiated, peaceful settlement of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The development ought to lead up to a peaceful solution of the
dispute in accordance with international norms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hizbul Mujahideen, which announced unilateral ceasefire late
last month, has been engaged in talks with the Indian government.
However, the group also insisted on Pakistan's involvement in a
tripartite dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The group has asked India to respond "positively" to its
requirement otherwise it would resume fighting against Indian
forces in the India-controlled part of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Signs New Tax Code </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
announced Monday that he has signed the new Tax Code into law,
describing it as "a major event in the life of the country."
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting of the cabinet and the presidential
administration in the Kremlin, he said that he inked the bill
Sunday, thanking all the cabinet members who had contributed to
drafting the code and promoting it in the Federal Assembly,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Finance Ministry is expected to submit its 2001
budget draft to the cabinet, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines of the new tax code are to lower tax rates,
reduce tax categories and expand the foundation of taxation for
increasing tax collection and enhancing business activities, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The new tax code will introduce a flat income tax of 13
percent and other measures designed to boost the troubled Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Introducing personal income tax, value-added tax and
consumption tax, the new code also will consolidate all existing
social charges, involving several payroll taxes, into a single
social, lower social security tax.
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the package include eliminating loopholes such
as income tax exemptions for soldiers and judges.
</P>
<P>
The new 13 percent flat tax, which would take effect next year,
replaces an existing progressive tax rate ranging from 12 percent
to 30 percent. That will mean a tax increase for poorer Russians
who now pay 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the excise will be much higher after the
code becomes effective. Especially, the consumption tax for
alcohol and vodka will rise to five percent with the rate for beer
up to 10 percent, while the index of tobacco probably tops to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian government leaders say the new tax code will
be a major step in reviving stalled market reforms.
</P>
<P>
The government, which consistently fails to meet its tax
collection goals, says the lower rate will cut evasion and boost
government revenue by encouraging businesses and individuals to
report their true incomes.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the single rate will also boost tax revenue by
making it easier to calculate and collect taxes. The government
is also hoping the lower rate will encourage Russians to bring
home and invest some of the billions of dollars now lodged in
secret foreign bank accounts. The tax burden on companies is
believed to fall by 25 percent after the new code comes into force.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion is a major problem in Russia, with most businesses
and private citizens avoiding tax altogether or underreporting
their incomes. Business leaders complain that the combined burden
of income tax, profits tax and social security taxes would drive
them out of business if they paid in full.
</P>
<P>
After being elected as head of state in March, Putin has
repeatedly vowed to press ahead with market reforms, which stalled
during the inertia of recent years.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Lures Taiwan Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Heilongjiang Province in northeast
China, known as China's largest "granary", has become a new magnet
for investors in agriculture from Taiwan, according to sources
with the Cross-Straits Agricultural Co-operation Seminar, which
opened here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The province was designated last year, along with some other
provinces, to initiate zones for cross-straits cooperation with
the aim of improving Chinese farm produce competition
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianmin, vice-governor of Heilongjiang, today told the
three-day seminar that 43 joint-venture agricultural projects were
set up in the province last year, with 26.9 million US dollars of
investment. The projects have introduced investment, quality seed
strains and advanced agricultural techniques from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
More Taiwan investors are eyeing the farm produce processing
industry in Heilongjiang, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has approved 750 Taiwan-funded
agricultural projects, involving 900 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang with fertile black soil, a large area of grassland,
well preserved natural forests and wetland, is China's largest
grain producer. Its annual grain production capacity has reached
30 billion kg, 65 percent of which sold on the market.

<P>
HARBIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A new around of agricultural
restructuring supervised by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture
has created an opportunity for investors from Taiwan, said Vice-
Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo at today's Cross-Straits
Agricultural Cooperation Seminar here.
</P>
<P>
China is committed to improving the quality of farm produce,
accelerating the growth of the animal husbandry and breeding
industries, and upgrading agricultural machinery, which has
created a considerable market for Taiwan investors, the vice-
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan has advanced agriculture. Its experience
is of great value for reference in the rural reform and the
implementation of mechanized farming in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interests of both sides of the straits to combine
the advantages in agricultural resources, labor and research
achievements from the Chinese mainland with investment, technology
and quality agricultural products from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Officials from many agricultural provinces attending the
seminar vowed to optimize their investment environment and
services. More preferencial policies on approval formalities,
taxation and land use are expected to be extended to investors in
agriculture from Taiwan, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Taiwan's investment in agricultural projects centers on
Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan and Shandong provinces in southern and
eastern China. More investments are expected to flow further
inland to places such as the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
western China and Heilongjiang Province in the northeast.

HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) revised its forecast of the tourist arrivals in
2000 to 12.5 million, a 10.4 percent increase over 1999, prompted
by the steady growth in tourism for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures announced Monday by HKTA show that total

increase of 15.7 percent over the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, noticeable improvement was seen in tourism

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Land and
Resources recently issued a circular urging local land and
resources departments to curb rampant illegal land dealings.
</P>
<P>
The circular was based on investigations conducted by officials
sent by the ministry in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei and
Zhejiang and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that local land and resources departments
have violated disciplinary laws.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that in the past six years, local
land and resources departments across the country were involved in
1,822 criminal or disciplinary cases, with 480 officials punished
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases were uncovered in developed areas, mainly in
the eastern and coastal provinces. Leading land officials were
often implicated in the cases, abusing their powers to feather
their own nests.

<HEADLINE> Rural Welfare System Benefits Three Million Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 2,000 out of China's 2,687
counties have established a rural welfare system to some extent,
which currently benefits more than three million poor farmers,
according to an official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs today.
</P>
<P>
The minimum life security system aims to provide allowances to
rural families the per-capita annual income of which is below the
regional average.
</P>
<P>
"It is a reform step based on the traditional relief system in
rural China, which makes the previous temporary relief efforts
more standardized," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1999, some 930 million yuan in cash and
goods was distributed among some 3.16 million poor farmers, of
which half came from the state and half came from collectives.
</P>
<P>
The rural welfare system is different from the urban welfare
system in the aspects of relief contents, methods, standards,
cycles and fund sources.
</P>
<P>
The allowance, given to farmers quarterly or every six months,
can basically ensure the daily necessities of poor farmers, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Too Early to Discuss New Summit With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here Monday that it is premature to discuss a new summit
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to earlier remarks by Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat who said another summit with Israel and the
United States could take place later this month, the prime
minister's office said it was not clear whether the Palestinians
are ready for a breakthrough and there are no signs yet of
concessions on the part of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the official Wam News Agency of the United Arab
Emirates that U.S. President Bill Clinton has talked about another
summit being held after the Democratic Convention next week in Los
Angeles, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat has confirmed that
Clinton has discussed the possibility of a second summit with him
at Camp David when the Israelis and Palestinians were trying to
clinch a peace accord under the mediation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also told Israel Radio that he was shocked by the fact
that neither Barak nor the Israeli cabinet has publicly condemned
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, of calling the Palestinians snakes.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yosef criticized Barak for racing to make peace with "
snakes" on a Saturday night sermon broadcast on Shas' radio station
network.
</P>
<P>
He also called the six million Jews who perished in the
Holocaust during the Second World War as reincarnated sinners. His
remarks on the Holocaust victims provoked angry responses among the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the rabbi's comment would have implications on the
interface relations between the Israelis and Palestinians. He also
said the entire region is endangered by the growing extremism in
the Israeli establishment, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted Palestinian officials as saying that the
interim agreement negotiations between the two sides are to
continue next week. The interim issues include those such as the
final redeployment of Israeli forces on the West Bank and the
release of Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons,
totaling about 1,600.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini has said that the Palestinians recognize
the interests of the Jewish people in the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary published on the International Herald Tribune on
Monday, Husseini said that the Palestinians seek to share the city
as part of a peace deal with the Israelis. He noted that the
Palestinians do not seek to divide the city of Jerusalem as it is
already divided.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton sponsored the July 11-25 Camp David
summit to help Israelis and Palestinians hammer out a peace deal to
settle the final status issues such as the status of Jerusalem,
border, water resources, the future of Jewish settlements and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The summit collapsed due to unbridgeable differences on both
sides, particularly on the thorniest issues of Jerusalem and the
return of Palestinian refugees.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Conduct Population Census in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will officially launch a
nationwide population census on October 22 this year, Anatolia News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the State Institute of Statistics (DIE) Sefik
Yildizeli told reporters Monday that all preparations for the
population census are expected to be completed by the end of
August. The task will cost some 26 trillion Turkish Liras (about 40
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said a curfew will be imposed throughout the country when
necessary during the population census.
</P>
<P>
A total of 910,000 people will serve as counting and control
officials during the course, Yildizeli said.
</P>
<P>
"Three minutes are required to count each person and each person
will be asked 43 questions. One control official will be
responsible for 10 counting officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the population census, Yildizeli said, "
construction systems of buildings and their ages will also be
investigated. The data will contribute to working out a quake
action plan."
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the General Population Count made in
November 1997, Turkey's population was 62.8 million.
</P>
<P>
A decrease in the rate of population growth has been observed in
recent years in parallel with the decrease in the total fertility
rate in the country in general.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual average population increase was 15.1 per
thousand between 1990-1997. The population is expected to reach 65.
3 million by the middle of 2000, according to official prediction.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Reports High Crime Solution Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police (
PNP) recorded a 93.43 percent crime solution efficiency during the
first semester of the year, Edgardo Aglipay, chief of the PNP-
National Capital Region, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aglipay, along with other top PNP officials, reported about the
peace and order situation in the country during the cabinet
meeting presided over by President Joseph Estrada at the
Presidential Palae.
</P>
<P>
In the same meeting, Reynaldo Wycoco, PNP deputy chief for
administration, also cited the 39 percent drop in heinous crimes
committed, as well as the decline of 20 percent in kidnap-for-
ransom cases.
</P>
<P>
He said the figure on kidnapping incidents could have lowered,
had it not been for the kidnap-for-ransom activities of the
terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group in the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Wycoco said in the National Capital Region (NCR), no kidnapping
incident was recorded between June and July this year, an
indication that the campaign against kidnap syndicates has been
successful.
</P>
<P>
However, Wycoco admitted that the rate of kidnapping in the
country could still go up, as the Abu Sayyaf prepares to abduct
more victims, in an effort to raise more funds to beef up its
defense capability and sustain its fight against the government.
</P>
<P>
Armed forces officials admitted that the government intends to
go all out against the Abu Sayyaf, as soon as the remaining 29
Filipino and foreign hostages are released.
</P>
<P>
Wycoco said this reality may be the reason the Abu Sayyaf would
want to drag the negotiations for the release of its hostages, in
an effort to delay any military action against them.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports to U.S. to Increase by 6 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai exports to the United States
are expected to grow by 6 percent this year, thanks to continued
growth in the U.S. economy, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Inspector attached to the Ministry of Commerce Orachit
Singkalavanich was quoted as saying that Thai exports to the U.S.
market steadily increased in the first six months of this year,
reaching 6.76 billion U.S. dollars or a 17.3 percent year-on-year
increase; while imports rose 3.4 percent to 3.40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trend led to an estimation that total Thai exports to the U.
S. market would reach 15.18 billion dollars at the end of this
year, an increase of 6.50 percent from the previous year, she said.
</P>
<P>
Key Thai exports to the U.S. this year include IC circuits,
computer chips, frozen seafood, rubber gloves, natural rubber
products, furniture and cement.
</P>
<P>
She cautioned, however, that the direction of U.S. imports was
changing, with countries in South and Central America, rather than
Asian countries, emerging as key sources, particularly textile and
garment products, and footwares.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring countries, namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and
Vietnam are also becoming key rivals for Thai exporters, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Orachit, therefore, suggested that Thai manufacturers and
exporters adjust their business strategies and planning to meet
the new challenges, and to maintain their competitiveness in the
long-run.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Asks More Money for Protected Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Environment and
Natural Resources Secretary Antonio Cerilles stressed Monday that
there is a need for more public investment in the management and
conservation of the country's protected areas.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that these protected areas "represent
the last frontier of our flora and fauna as well as our last great
natural areas of intrinsic, inspirational and recreational values.
"
</P>
<P>
Cerilles said that the conservation of the country's
biodiversity, the management of its ecosystem, especially in the
protected areas, are expected to face more difficulties unless
more funds will be pumped into the proposed 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
To effectively conserve biodiversity through the country's
systems of more than 100 protected areas, he proposed at least 600
million pesos (15 million U.S. dollars) be given to the management
of these areas.
</P>
<P>
"The money being spent for protected areas and biodivesity
conservation should not be viewed by Congress as a burden or
unrecoverable expense. Instead, it should be seen as an investment
similar to that in public education or health," Cerilles said.
</P>
<P>
Cerilles said that protected areas provide safeguards for
ecosystems essential in maintaining life-support systems; for
culturally important landscapes, historic monuments and other
heritage sites; and for sustainable use of wild resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Railway has
recently approved the building of two railways to promote this
opening-front Fujian Province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, in southeast China, now has only three railways,
totalling 1200 km, or 0.35 km for every 10 thousand people, much
lower than that of national standard of 0.54 km.
</P>
<P>
The 277-km Wenfu Railway, which connects the neigboring
Zhejiang Province, one of the two and costing 6.2 billion yuan (
747 million US dollars), is to be constructed in early 2002. The
325-km Ganglong Railway, which connects Jiangxi Province, the
other and costing 8 billion yuan (964 million US dollars), is to
be completed at the end of 2004, according to a local railway
official.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the two new railways will fundamentally
change Fujian's backward state in railway transport, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Neighborhood Committee in Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Kong Ruoxue, a 22-year-old
college graduate, has become a hot topic of conversation recently
among residents of Chaoyang District in this capital city of Jilin
Province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Kong is Jilin's first college graduate who works with
neighborhood or residents' committee.
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood committee is a self-governed organization in
urban China. There are more than 117,000 such committees
nationwide, which play an important role in China's political,
economic, cultural and social affairs as well as in people's daily
life.
</P>
<P>
For decades, less-educated or retired women are the dominant
staff in residents' committees. Kong's participation through
public election brings new vitality to this traditional grassroots
management unit in China.
</P>
<P>
Majoring in international trade, Kong holds a firm belief to
make full use of her knowledge, such as the consumption psychology,
statistics and marketing, to serve the people in her community.
</P>
<P>
"Kong's recent creation of a software program on managing the
local population has saved us from door-to-door investigations,"
said Guo Zhimin, who has worked in the same committee for 15 years.
"We have never imagined that we now use computer software to the
neighborhood committee."
</P>
<P>
More educated young people like Kong are showing great interest
in the community service all over China. Open election by
residents has replaced appointment in the formation of the
neighborhood committee in recent years. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin,
and many other major cities are also trying to improve the
community service system.

HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 260 vocational education
and training professionals from 20 countries gathered here Monday
to share experience and exchange views on "Vocational Education
and Training for Life Long Learning in the Information Era" at the
IVETA Conference 2000.
</P>
<P>
The International Vocational Education and Learning Association
(IVETA) Conference 2000, jointly organized by the IVETA and Hong
Kong's Vocational Training Council, is to provide a stimulating
and fruitful experience for all those involved or interested in
the development of vocational education and training in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, opened Monday, focuses on the impact
of information technology on the development of VET pedagogy,
management, and administrative support. It will also address
issues such as human resources development, manpower training,
program development, social responsibilities and skills for the
new millenium.
</P>
<P>
Officiating guests at the opening ceremony included Zhong

</P>
<P>
"The concept of lifelong learning opens the way to discussion

<HEADLINE> Education Top on HK Government's Agenda, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region is giving top priority to education
and allocating a considerable sum of money for life-long learning,
a Hong Kong official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century is described as the Information Age, in which
the primary resource is "knowledge," said Fanny Law, Secretary for
Education and Manpower, at the opening ceremony of the
International Vocational Education and Training Association
Conference 2000.
</P>
<P>
To equip people with necessary knowledge, Law said, the
government's spending on education has become the largest single
item of expenditure, with an annual allocation of 7 billion U.S.
dollars, making up 22.3 percent of the government budget in the
current financial year.
</P>
<P>
The government provides nine years of free and universal
education from the age of six. At the age of fifteen, about 90
percent of the students continue their education in mainstream
schools; the rest in vocational training or the workplace, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the challenges of a knowledge society, Hong Kong's
education system is undergoing a comprehensive review, covering
the academic structure, the curriculum, assessment and pedagogy,
according to Law.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the over-arching education objectives, and to
meet the rapidly changing market demands, Hong Kong government's
approach to vocational education and training also changes.
</P>
<P>
While equipping students with up-to-date industry-specific
skills is still necessary to meet job requirements, this has to be
balanced with the need to develop in the young people the ability
to adapt and respond to changing circumstances, and the aptitude
for lifelong learning, Law said.
</P>
<P>
The Vocational Training Council (VTC), as Hong Kong's key
provider of vocational education, has fully taken on board the
demands of a knowledge society, and introduced training modules on
the core generic skills of communication, and information
technology in the comprehensive certificate and foundation courses
on vocational education, Law said.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the University Grants Committee last year
showed that 370,000 people, or about one-tenth of Hong Kong's
working population, had attended continuing education courses at
the equivalent of tertiary education. Another 330,000 people
enrolled in continuing education courses at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
To promote lifelong learning, the government recently launched
a comprehensive database on continuing education, accessible
through the Internet, to help those who are interested in further
studies to identify courses that best suit their personal
interests and development needs.
</P>
<P>
The latest count shows that nearly 600 institutions currently
provide more than 5 000 courses.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that no one is deprived of lifelong learning for lack
of financial means, the government provides non-means tested loans
to students of continuing education and professional courses, Law
said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the government is actively considering a flexible
and open system for mutual recognition of qualifications among
training providers, and the development of a qualifications ladder.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand of the information technology age, the
government launched the "Digit 21" IT strategy in 1998. Equipping
people with the know-how to use IT is a task encompassed in the
strategy, Law said.
</P>
<P>
Under a five-year strategy on IT education, the government has
committed 4 billion U.S. dollars for capital investment and 70
million U.S. dollars per annum from 1999 onwards, she said.
</P>
<P>
Law admitted that, like other economies, Hong Kong is faced
with an acute shortage of IT practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Following a detailed analysis of IT manpower requirements, the
government has formulated a manpower strategy aimed at increasing
the supply of IT manpower, enhance the range and relevance of IT
training.
</P>
<P>
To increase the supply of IT practitioners in the short-term,
the government granted 23 million U.S. dollars to the Vocational
Training Council to upgrade its IT infrastructure and provide
intensive training programs over a three-year period, Law said.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes U.S. Allowing Chen Shui-bian to Make Stopover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has made
solemn representations to the United States for allowing Chen Shui-
bian of Taiwan to make a stopover in the U.S. on route to central
America in mid-August, expressing strong resentment and firm
opposition.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the matter today, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said that China has urged the U.S. to act as
it preaches, and honor the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
its relevant commitments, to avoid severely damaging bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities often play tricks to conceal their real
motives in creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". Zhu
said that the Chinese government has long opposed the U.S.
engaging in any official exchanges and contacts with Taiwan and
allowing Taiwan political figures to make a stopover in the U.S..

<HEADLINE> Arafat: New Palestinian-Israeli Summit Possible Late August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) --- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said another U.S.-sponsored Palestinian-Israel peace summit
will possibly be held after August 14, the official Emirates News
Agency (WAM) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about a possible new-round Camp David
summit, Arafat, who arrived here on Sunday night from Libya as part
of a tour to rally support, said U.S. President Bill Clinton has
raised the possibility of holding a new summit after the Democratic
National Convention, which will open on August 14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the agency after his arrival here that the
Palestinian side is still trying to hold an Arab or Islamic summit
or even call a meeting for the Jerusalem Committee.
</P>
<P>
The palestinian leader also stressed that the the Arab-Islamic
position on Jerusalem and support for the Palestinian negotiator
were "strong and clear".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Clinton's recent remarks on shifting the U.S.
embassy to Jerusalem, Arafat said, " we must take into our account
the current presidential elections campaigns in the U.S."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Due in Turkey to Push Mideast Peace Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami will visit Turkey this weekend to update Turkish
leaders with the issues taken up at last month's Camp David peace
summit, Anatolia News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials told the agency that Ben-Ami will not request
anything from Turkey, adding Israel is "satisfied" with Turkey's
statements issued after the Camp David summit and after Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's visit to Ankara last week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here last Saturday to brief Turkish leaders
on the latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks,
tried to rally support from Ankara for his declaration of an
independent Palestinian state on September 13 with or without a
peace agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Turkey to play a more active role in the Middle
East peace process, especially in the talks with Israel over the
fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Ottoman Turks ruled Jerusalem, as well as the rest of the
Middle East, for 400 years until early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Turkish leaders have assured during meetings with Israeli
officials that they will stress Ankara's sensitivity over the
Jerusalem issue and urge the Israeli government to review its
policies over the holy sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
However, they voiced no clear support for Arafat's decision to
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. During Saturday's talks,
Turkish leaders advised Arafat to be moderate, saying his
unilateral move will bring about confusion and chaos to the region
and should be thought over.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said Turkey is in favor of maintaining
negotiations and refraining from unilateral moves, an attitude in
parallel with a tripartite declaration issued at the end of the
Camp David summit which failed to produce any agreement.
</P>
<P>
They told the agency that they hope Ankara will recommend Arafat
to keep from taking unilateral actions, adding Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has sent a letter to his Turkish counterpart
Bulent Ecevit to this end.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Israeli government does not want
Turkey's direct intervention in the Middle East peace process, but
appreciates Ankara's moderate advice to Arafat while Arab countries
are reluctant to pressure Arafat to make concessions in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Turkey is trying to pursue a balanced position
between its Muslim brother Palestine and its Mideast ally Israel.
</P>
<P>
When the Middle East peace process was launched in Madrid,
Spain, in 1991, Turkey allowed the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Office in Ankara to be turned into an embassy.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Turkey has formed close military, political
and economic ties with Israel in order to contain their common
rivals Syria and Iran in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948. Ankara lowered its level of diplomatic representation to
charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv in 1981 when Israel declared
Jerusalem as its "eternal" capital. It also closed its consulate-
general in Arab East Jerusalem as well.
</P>
<P>
And Turkey reciprocally upgraded its diplomatic relations with
Israel to the level of ambassador in 1991 when it turned the PLO
Office in Ankara into an embassy.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Will Maintain Pressure on Fiji: PM Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark reassured deposed Fiji Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry here Monday that her country will maintain its pressure
for a return to democracy in Fiji, Television New Zealand reported.
</P>
<P>
The reassurance was made when she was meeting with Chaudhry at
the Beehive, the headquarters of the New Zealand government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the deposed Fiji prime minister gave Clark
a full briefing about Fiji's situation.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry told Clark that he is pleased with the sanctions
against Fiji which New Zealand has put in place so far, but firmer
actions may be needed if the Fijian authorities do not set an
acceptable timetable for a return to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
Clark said Chaudhry's message is that international pressure is
vital.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Clark told local reporters that it would be
helpful if legal action is taken against Fiji's coup leader George
Speight, who is now held by the Fijian military. But, she added,
the situation there is still worrying.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the sanctions New Zealand has in place will remain,
and wider trade sanctions will be considered only if the situation
in Fiji deteriorates substantially.
</P>
<P>
She called on the Pacific island nation to return to democracy
as soon as possible, saying her country will give "the strongest
support to those who support the restoration of democracy."
</P>
<P>
"We have drawn the line under our relationship with Fiji, which
is now cool, distant and formal," the New Zealand Prime Minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry arrived in Wellington Sunday. Upon his arrival at the
airport, Chaudhry told reporters that Speight should be charged
with treason.
</P>
<P>
He said he is grateful for New Zealand's tough stance and smart
sanctions against Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry said he would urge New Zealand to toughen its
sanctions against his coup-torn country if it fails to return to
democracy swiftly.
</P>
<P>
At present, New Zealand sanctions against Fiji include cutting
military ties, cutting aid and banning the coup plotters from
travelling to New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reform Revenue Collection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reassured the public Monday that it continues to introduce reforms
in the revenue collection system so that the government can lessen
its need to borrow funds for its priority projects.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a press statement
that this effort may take years, as it requires a computerized
database and a professional collection staff.
</P>
<P>
"We have to overhaul our revenue collection system. We cannot
do that in one to two years. We have to put in a computerized
system, professionalize the revenue collection agencies," Zamora
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while President Joseph Estrada is bent on
introducing reforms to the revenue collection system, he has been
in office for barely two years.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have indicated that the Philippine economy
cannot grow much because of perceived flaws in the revenue
collection system.
</P>
<P>
Zamora, however, said introducing changes in the system is not
an easy job, as many of the problem have deep roots.
</P>
<P>
On July 24, Estrada stressed the need for reforms when he
submitted to Congress the government's proposed budget of 725
billion pesos (18.1 billion U.S. dollars) for fiscal year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the proposed budget is anchored on a spending
approach that is "strategic and reforms-driven," and was drafted
with the country's strengths and weaknesses in mind.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says 160 Chechen Rebels Killed at Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military said Monday
that its artillery and air force killed about 160 rebels in the
republic of Chechnya during air strikes and shelling at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Powerful strikes were delivered against rebel groups in several
of the republic's districts, particularly north and northwest of
Gudermes, Nozhai-Yurt district and the Grozny district, the Itar-
Tass news agency quoted the office of the Russian presidential
aide on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces pounded rebel concentrations in the forests
near Chechnya's capital of Grozny, the second biggest city of
Gudermes, Nozhai-Yurt and Urus-Martan districts, killing more than
160 rebel fighters and mercenaries and wounding scores of others,
the Interfax news agency quoted the press center of the Russian
Combined Forces in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' losses were especially severe in the forest north
of Gudermes, where Russian units found dozens of bodies of the
militants after federal artillery shelling and air raids,
according to the press center.
</P>
<P>
Russian air force killed over 40 rebels in Nozhai-Yurt, Urus-
Martan districts on Sunday. Su-25 attack planes flew four missions,
An-30 reconnaissance planes flew two, and Mi-8, Mi-24 and Mi-26
armed helicopters conducted 30 sorties over the districts,
destroying rebel targets, reconnoitering the areas, protecting
federal army convoys and transporting cargo.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who had infiltrated neighboring Ingushetia and
fired at Russian helicopters several times Sunday, were killed in
a motor car while trying to escape. Under the rebels' fire, a
federal Mi-8 helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing
near a village in the Ingush republic's territory close to the
Chechen-Ingush border, with one of the 16 paratroopers on board
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the rebels' threat to stage a large-scale
offensive on August 6, the so-called Ichkeria (rebels' Chechen
republic) Independence Day, did not materialize thanks to
preventive steps taken by the federal authorities, the press
center said.
</P>
<P>
There were no hit-and-run attacks or land mine explosions
reported in Grozny. Two militants were killed in the city Sunday
when they resisted federal troop's checking, Tass cited the press
center as saying, adding that eight members of Chechen warlord
Ruslan Gelayev's bandit group were captured and 12 people had been
detained in Achkhoi-Martan district on suspicion of involvement in
bandit formations.
</P>
<P>
"They said the federal forces have destroyed a large bandit
group numbering about 40 people not far from the administrative
border of Chechnya and Ingushetia," Yastrzhembsky's office said.
</P>
<P>
An influential Chechen rebel field commander, former chief of
the Ichkeria security service Ibragim Khultygov surrendered to
federal units, and well-known rebel field commander Wahhabbi
Musali Khaskhanov, an emir or "inspirer of a bandit group" was
also seized at the weekend, according to the office.

Beihai, a coastal city on Beibu Gulf in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, have become popular with Chinese,
especially those from Pearl River Delta in neighboring Guangdong

<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Continental Airlines of the
United States, the world's sixth largest airline, announced Monday
it will launch the first-ever daily non-stop Boeing 777 service
between Hong Kong and New York.
</P>
<P>
The flight, effective March 3, 2001, "will mark the first time
an airline has flown scheduled non-stop service between the two
cities, saving travelers a minimum of two or more hours en route,"
said David Grizzle, Continental Airlines' Senior Vice President of
Corporate Development.
</P>
<P>
The new service will be the longest non-stop flight operated by
a U.S. airline and the longest scheduled non-stop flight ever
flown out of New York, Grizzle said. The 7,337 nautical-mile trip
is also the longest route operated with a B-777 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is the largest market from New York that is
currently without scheduled non-stop service, and it is clear that
most travelers prefer a non-stop," he said. "As New York's
hometown airline, we are very pleased to link two of the world's
leading cities."
</P>
<P>
The new service will be operated daily with a 283-seat Boeing
777-200 aircraft, carrying 48 passengers in the Business First

<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market index

according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Running on its fourth straight winning streak, the market was
of its largest rise since May 31, and was triggered to another
fresh high level within this year on buying spree. The recent

<HEADLINE> Bilingual People Increase among China's Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of bilingual people,
who have mastered both Chinese and languages of other ethnic
minorities, is increasing steadily.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Liberation Army Daily, it is estimated
that 68 million Chinese use ethnic minority languages, accounting
for about 60 percent of the ethnic minority in the country.
Except for the Hui and Manchu nationalities, which adopted
mandarin Chinese, all ethnic minorities in China have their own
languages, which total more than 80.
</P>
<P>
However, before the founding of New China in 1949, the majority
of the ethnic minorities did not have their own languages.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the Chinese government began to help the ethnic
minorities invent and improve their languages and great success
has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 83 newspapers and 184 magazines have been
published in 17 ethnic languages.

<HEADLINE> City on "Silk Road" Eyes Developing Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A 2,600-year-old city near the
world famous "Silk Road" will be revived by taking advantage of
its tourism potential, but transportation seems to be a major
obstacle toward achieving such a goal.
</P>
<P>
"As a city of rich historical and cultural resources, Tianshui
will spare no effort to tap into its tourism potential," said Vice-
Mayor Sun Weixi.
</P>
<P>
Located in the eastern part of China's northwest province of
Gansu, Tianshui has been known as the starting point of the "Silk
Road" and one of the cradles of the Chinese nation. It has over
245 sites of historical and cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
However, the rich tourism resources have not brought much
wealth to Tianshui, whose poor transport facilities are deemed as
a major barrier to the tourism boom in the city.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that only about 800,000 visitors tour the city
each year, and an overwhelming majority of them come from
neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
The local government has come to realize the importance of good
transportation, and lots of effort has been put into improving the
city's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, a high-quality road connecting the city with
the northwest transportation hub, Xi'an, will soon to be finished
and a large airport is scheduled to be completed in four years.
</P>
<P>
The city will also build a highway exclusively for tourists,
which will link downtown Tianshui with the Maijishan Grottos, a
major tourism resort with equal fame as the renowned Dunhuang
Grottos, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"Once the problem of transportation is solved, we will
certainly witness the booming of Tianshui's tourism," Sun said
with confidence.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Grottoes to Apply for World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANSHUI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Maiji Mountain Grottoes, known
as the "Oriental Sculpture Museum", in Tianshui, west China's
Gansu Province, will apply to the United Nations' Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the World
Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
With more than 1,600 years of history, the grottoes contain
over 7,000 pieces of clay sculpture, which are of high artistic
and academic value, said Hu Chengzu, head of the Maiji Grottoes
Art Institute.
</P>
<P>
He said relevant government departments are now involved in
preparing apply to both the world natural and cultural heritage
lists.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes were built on cliffs, 80 meters above the ground,
in 402 A.D. and have been improved over a dozen dynasties
including Northern Wei (386-534), Western Wei (535-556), Northern
Zhou (557-581), Sui (581-618), Tang (618-907), the period of Five
Dynasties (907-960), Song (960-1279), Yuan (1271-1368), Ming (1368-
-1644) and Qing (1644--1911), and have created a history of China'
s sculpture art.
</P>
<P>
Located beside the Tianshui, a major city in east Gansu, the
grottoes, along with Mogao Grottoes in the province's Dunhuang
area, Yungang Grottoes in Shanxi Province, and Longmen Grottoes in
Henan province, are the four most famous grottoes in China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to clay sculptures, there are a total of 1,300
square meters of frescos and more than 2,000 pieces of pottery,
bronzeware, ironware, jade articles, ancient books, documents,
paintings, calligraphy and other cultural relics in the 194
grottoes.
</P>
<P>
"It is really a miracle that all those clay sculptures and
other relics are preserved so well after more than 1,600 years,"
said Hu, adding that the grottoes remain the biggest grottoes in
the world which have such a large number of clay sculptures.
</P>
<P>
The Tianshui municipal government has already issued a long-
term program to protect the relics in the grottoes and has begun
to collect data on the geography, water, temperature and moisture
in the environment surrounding Maiji Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The local government will also clear the illegal construction
around the grottoes and organize farmers to return land for
farming to forestry to meet the standards of the world heritage
application.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Writer Arrested in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Ahmad Zeid-Abadi, a writer working
with the Tehran-based daily Hamshahri (Citizen), was detained
Monday morning under an order issued by the press court.
</P>
<P>
Zeid-Abadi, who also worked with other periodicals, was taken
away by a group of more than 10 people who claimed they were acting
on behalf of the court dealing with offences committed by
government employees, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Zeid-Abadi's wife Mahdiyeh Mohammadi told reporters that the
group searched their house thoroughly and took away some of the
writings and documents belonging to her husband.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a judge of the Tehran press court confirmed the
detention of Zeid-Abadi, saying he was arrested because he had
defied an earlier call to report to the court.
</P>
<P>
Hamshahri, run by the Tehran municipality, is one of the few
pro-reform papers left since the conservative judiciary launched a
massive crackdown on reformist press in April.
</P>
<P>
So far some 21 papers and journals, most of them pro-reform
ones, have been closed down by the judiciary on the so-called
charges of defamation and violating Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary has also ordered the arrest of a number of other
reformist journalists on similar charges. Zeid-Abadi was only the
latest case.
</P>
<P>
The press law, which was amended by the previous conservative-
dominated Majlis (parliament), has served as a powerful tool for
the judiciary to crack down on pro-reform papers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
Reformists, who won an overwhelming victory in February's
parliamentary election, pledged to overturn the restrictive clauses
in the press law in open sessions of the new Majlis, which started
work on May 27.
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday, reformers opened their session in disappointment
because Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karrubi announced a scheduled debate
on rewriting the press law had been withdrawn from the Majlis
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on an order from supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, who had reportedly written a letter to the Majlis,
saying that rewriting the press law in such a juncture is against
the interests of the state and the system.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the supreme leader, who is believed
to stand by the conservatives, made a direct intervention on Majlis
affairs. Khamenei's intervention was clearly a severe setback for
reformers, more than two months after they started work in the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi's announcement on Sunday sparked a brawl among
parliament members, some even engaged in physical scuffling on the
Majlis floor. It was the first such event since the new Majlis
started work, but obviously it was not the last.
</P>
<P>
With the precedent of Khamenei's direct intervention, it will be
very difficult for the new Majlis to carry out its work, which, as
reformers pledged in election campaigns, will focus on pushing
forward President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami has announced his decision to seek re-election
in next year's presidential election. In such a situation, the
factional struggle in Iran will certainly accelerate in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
According to an IRNA report, some 50 conservative figures
gathered in front of the Majlis building here Sunday evening to
protest the brawl by some parliament members over Khamenei's order
to cancel the debate on the press law.
</P>
<P>
The protesters slammed the performance of the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance for its encouragement of press
freedom.
</P>
<P>
A cleric addressing the protesters also blasted certain bills
currently being reviewed by the reformist Majlis, terming some of
the Majlis members as agents of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The protest was clearly pre-organized by the conservative
establishment, as an IRNA correspondent covering the news of the
protest was detained for one hour by two armed officers and thus
was not able to thoroughly report the event, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat in UAE to Garner Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday night from Libya
as part of a campaign to rally support in the wake of the failed
Camp David peace talks with Israel last month, the official WAM
news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said upon arrival that he had briefed UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on the latest developments of the
Camp David peace summit, adding that Sheikh Zayed is following the
negotiations step by step.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised UAE's principled positions on fully supporting
the Palestinian stance on Jerusalem, refugees and other issues
discussed at the Camp David summit, which ended on July 25 without
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned a statement made by UAE Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan on Saturday, which
denounced an announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton to move
the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the move as a violation of the
international law and resolutions, and warned that it will strip
the U.S. of its role as an impartial mediator.
</P>
<P>
Arafat commended the position as "firm and clear," the WAM
added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Anti-Money Laundering Law to Be Effective in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A new law aimed at fighting money
laundering is expected to take effect from mid-September in
Thailand, an official report said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The law, designed to deter illegal activities, was originally
supposed to take effect in last August, but was postponed because
of technicalities and fears of possible loopholes, according to
the report, which was released by Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, it said, banks must report deposits exceeding
two million baht ( 50,000 U.S. dollars ), as well as the source of
the funds, to the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO).
</P>
<P>
However, some banks said they won't be ready by mid-September
because providing depositor information to AMLO is laborious,
taking time and increasing operating costs.
</P>
<P>
AMLO Secretary-General Vasana Puemlarp recently opposed the
banks' move to delay the implementation of the law, arguing that
they had been notified long before the effective date.
</P>
<P>
The law was drafted in line with the United Nations'
conventions against illicit drug trades to prevent criminals from
using their illegally-acquired wealth to influence politics.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Asked to Cooperate in Fire-Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday called upon
Asian countries to adopt a systematic trans-boundary cooperation
in fire-fighting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Housing and Local Government Minister Ong Ka Ting
made the call when opening the 21st International Fire Chiefs'
Association of Asia (IFCAA) general conference here.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation was reflected in the successful collaboration
between Malaysia and Indonesia in dousing widespread forest fires
in Kalimantan and Sumatra which caused the haze in the region in
1997, Ong Ka Ting said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian-Indonesian fire-fighters were able to contain the
forest fire within 16 days, he said, adding "This is a showcase to
prove that systematic cooperation across countries and borders can
overcome adverse situations caused by fire disasters."
</P>
<P>
The two-day IFCAA conference, themed "Fire Safety and Disaster
Management -- A Borderless Approach", are believed to act as a
catalyst to form better systematic trans-boundary cooperation
among its 18 members in fire-fighting, and to promote research,
expertise exchange and sharing contemporary developments in safety
and disaster management.
</P>
<P>
The association is rotating its biennial general conference
among its members to promote cooperation and the exchange of
knowledge in fire-fighting.
</P>
<P>
At the conference here, 14 papers were tabled by speakers from
Australia; China's Taipei; Hong Kong, China; Japan; the
Netherlands; Malaysia; Singapore; United Kingdom and United States.
</P>
<P>
And in conjunction with the conference, the Malaysian Fire
Protection Association (MFPA) is holding an exhibition of the
latest fire safety products from 40 companies.

<HEADLINE> Three Injured in Indonesia's Oil Refinery's Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- An oil refinery in Indonesia's
South Kalimantan province was reportedly caught fire on Monday
morning, injuring three workers, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fire triggered panic that the country may face oil shortage,
said the report Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the oil refinery belonging to the state-owned oil
and gas company PT Pertamina in Balikpapan, South Kalimantan
province, caught fire and exploded on Monday morning at about 06:
45 a.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
Three people, all Pertamina workers, were reportedly injured
due to the explosion which was described as a powerful bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono suggested
sabotage and terror action in the incident which coincided with
the opening of the Assembly's annual session.
</P>
<P>
"There is an indication of sabotage. But such a thing is not
confirmed yet," Yudhoyono told reporters in the sideline of the
Assembly's session.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has asked the police as well as the Indonesian
Military (TNI) to launch an investigation into the explosion, "
including to safeguard another important public facilities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But, an interim report issued by the local police said that the
police found no evidences on the possible terror action or
sabotage in the incident, saying "it is purely an accident."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Spokesman of the local authority W.W.F. Welan was
quoted as saying that the explosion will reduce the country's oil
production about 20,000 barrels per day. "It means that Balikpapan
may face premium shortage," Welan said, adding that the refinery
has now returned to a normal condition as soon as the firemen were
able to overcome the fire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the total production of the refinery reached 265,000
barrels of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the country was forced to import premium from
neighboring countries in its bid to meet the premium need in the
country. The country faced premium shortage last month due to the
damage of oil refinery in Balongan, West Java province.
</P>
<P>
The accident has triggered panic and aroused speculations that
such a thing was part of the effort from political opponents of
incumbent President to unseat him ahead the annual session of the
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Pledges to Pursue Peace Process in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said Monday that the government was "doubly determined"
to pursue the peace process in Jammu and Kashmir and keep up the
fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected any dialogue with Islamabad unless a "
conducive atmosphere " was created for it.
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader told Parliament that New Delhi had shown
exemplary tolerance, patience and restraint in the face of extreme
provocation by Islamabad, adding, "We have shown a degree of
generosity that few other countries can match."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Pakistan has misread our generosity and our
desire for friendly relations as weakness and has adopted cross-
border terrorism as an instrument of state policy to launch a
terrorist campaign in different parts of India."
</P>
<P>
Replying to clarifications on his statement on the recent spate
of killings in Jammu and Kashmir, he indicated, "These killings
have not and will not deter us" and "we are committed to
protecting our national interests and preserving the national
unity and none should doubt that we have the means to do so."
</P>
<P>
Expressing the government's determination to press on with the
dialogue with Hizbul Mujahideen, he said it was aimed at efforts
to bring militants overground.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the ongoing dialogue with Hizbul could be
outside the Constitution, Vajpayee said the dialogue would be
within the framework of Constitution but in the course of the
dialogue if issues were raised which were outside the Constitution,
the government would not be unwilling to talk.
</P>
<P>
"No condition has been imposed and dialogue should continue,
terrorists come into the open and killings stop," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kashmir should not remain a blood stained land and
asserted that New Delhi will never surrender before terrorism but
"fight it with all our might."

<HEADLINE> Former Corsican Separatist Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A former chief of Corsica's pro-
independence nationalist movement was shot dead Monday morning in
a bar on the island in the Mediterranean in a mafia-style
execution operation by five gunmen armed with automatic weapons,
said the gendarmerie.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Rossi and his bodyguard, Jean-Claude Fratacci, were
gunned down in a bar in Upper-Corsica, when the gunmen arrived at
the bar on foot and spilled a wave of bullets on the facade and
terrace of the bar before entering the bar, where the two men were
sitting, said the gendarmerie quoting witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Rossi, 40, was a historic figure of the Corsican nationalist
movement and served as a leader of the National Liberation Front
of Corsica-Historical Trend until 1998.
</P>
<P>
French police are now unable to tell who could be responsible
for the assassination, but they said it is more probably a common
criminal case than one resulting from the political rivalry among
the Corsican nationalists.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- His Majesty King Bhumibol
Adulyadej has approved the appointment of President and Vice
Presidents of Thailand's first elected Senate, the Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
His Majesty the King endorsed on August 4 the appointment of
Sanit Vorapanya, a senator from Lopburi province, as President of
Thailand's first-ever elected Senate, and Chalerm Promlert and
Buntan Dokthaisong as the Senate's First and Second Vice
Presidents respectively, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The royal approval followed secret votes by all 200 elected
senators at their first meeting here on August 1 to select the
Senate's Speaker and Vice Speakers.
</P>
<P>
The country organized its first senatorial election on March 4,
which was part of a political reform, aimed to eliminate vote
buying and other irregular practices, and create free and fair
elections eventually.
</P>
<P>
The March 4 poll was, however, followed by four senatorial by-
elections in some provinces due to suspension of elected
candidates for found evidences of frauds and forms of vote buying.
</P>
<P>
The 200-seat Senate was completed in late July, after the last
elected candidate in the northeastern province of Ubon Rachathani
was unanimously endorsed by the Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> First Non-stop Flight Between HK, NY to Be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Continental Airlines of the
United States, the world's sixth largest airline, announced Monday
it will launch the first-ever daily non-stop Boeing 777 service
between Hong Kong and New York.
</P>
<P>
The flight, effective March 3, 2001, "will mark the first time
an airline has flown scheduled non-stop service between the two
cities, saving travelers a minimum of two or more hours en rout,"
said David Grizzle, Continental Airlines' Senior Vice President of
Corporate Development.
</P>
<P>
The new service will be the longest non-stop flight operated by
a U.S. airline and the longest scheduled non-stop flight ever
flown out of New York, Grizzle said. The 7,337 nautical-mile trip
is also the longest route operated with a B-777 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is the largest market from New York that is
currently without scheduled non-stop service, and it is clear that
most travelers prefer a non-stop," he said. "As New York's
hometown airline, we are very pleased to link two of the world's
leading cities."
</P>
<P>
The new service will be operated daily with a 283-seat Boeing
777-200 aircraft, carrying 48 passengers in the Business First
cabin and 235 in coach.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Main Opposition Against Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's opposition leader
Ranil Wickremesinghe said Monday his party would not extend
support for the proposed draft constitution brought forward by the
government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga because her ruling
People's Alliance (PA) has gone back on many issues.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the parliament, Wickremesinghe of the main
opposition United National Party (UNP) cited the issues of the
abolition of the Executive Presidency, merger of the north and the
east for 5 years instead of 10 years and the powers vested to the
independent commissions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proposed constitutional councils have been
politicized and the council members could influence the police,
judicial and election commissions.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said he requested the government to send
the draft constitution to all other parties and the Buddhist
clergy and keep the masses informed but the government has failed
to carry out.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe accused the government of bypassing the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels and the people and
presenting it to the parliament. He also said that his party's
request to carry out a referendum before the term of the present
parliament has gone unheeded.
</P>
<P>
Wickremesinghe said that he believed that a political solution
is needed to politically end the ethnic war between government
troops and LTTE rebels which has taken over 60,000 lives during
the past 17 years.
</P>
<P>
On Monday PA Parliamentarian Dixon Perera crossed over to the
UNP, creating an uproar in the parliament. However, UNP member of
Parliament Harinda Corea crossed over to the PA government side
while Wickremesinghe made his statement in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Probe Officials Supporting MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered Monday government agencies to investigate
intelligence reports that several officials have been supporting
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in its fight against the
government.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the order to the Armed Forces of the
Philippines and the Philippine National Police during the cabinet
meeting at the Palace, the first since he arrived from an official
visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"These people should be arrested and charged, if there is proof
of their involvement with the MILF. I don't care whether they are
senators, congressmen or any high official," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has yet to see the names in the list of alleged
MILF supporters, but pointed out that at least 50 names are listed
in the intelligence report.
</P>
<P>
He said government officials and employees were allegedly
providing
financial and other material support to the MILF to sustain its
war against the government, even after the fall of its camps.
</P>
<P>
During the cabinet meeting, Armed Forces chief of staff Angelo
Reyes admitted that among the "power factors" that have sustained
MILF's operations are the support of "a network of extremist
leaning politicians."
</P>
<P>
The network, according to Reyes, also includes "key government
officials, government contractors and professionals," although he
did not give details.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, on his part, said initial
information reaching his office indicates that only officials in
the local level are involved with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is the country's largest rebel group which has been
fighting for an independent Muslim state in Mindanao for more than
two decades.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports to United States Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made progress in
boosting exports to the United States although the country has not
yet been given normal trade relation status by the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam News Agency, Vietnam's exports to the
United States have been increasing in recent years. Vietnam's
export earnings rose to 504 million U.S. dollars last year from 50.
4 million U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The volume of goods worth 305 million U.S. dollars was exported
to the United States in the first six months of this year. The
United States is currently ranked Vietnam's seventh biggest trade
partner.
</P>
<P>
Seafood took the lead among the country's exports to the United
States, with total export value registered at 125.5 million U.S.
dollars in 1999 (equal to 25 per cent of the country's export
value to the United States).
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese seafood export to U.S. market valued at 118 million
U.S dollars in the first half of this year, increasing over 60
times in the 1994-1999 period.
</P>
<P>
Footwear was ranked second among Vietnamese exports to the U.S.
market with an export value of 102.6 million U.S. dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese crude oil exporters registered an export value of 38.
4 million U.S. dollars from selling 194,163 tonnes of crude to the
United States in the first half of this year. As a result, the
United States becomes Vietnam's third biggest oil importer.
</P>
<P>
Ranking fourth among the country's exports to the U.S. market
was coffee. Vietnam attained a coffee export value of 59.2 million
U.S. dollars and over 26.2 million U.S. dollars last year and in
the first half of the year 2000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Garments and Textile products have been Vietnam's major export
items in recent years, but local exporters earned only 34.7
million U.S. dollars and 25.4 million U.S. dollars from exporting
garments and textile products to the United States last year and
in the first half of this year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other products such as cashew nut, pepper, rice, handicrafts,
fresh and dried fruits from Vietnam have made their debut in the U.
S. market. However, their export volume and value remained low.

<HEADLINE> First Literary Works of Hani Group Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The first set of literary works
written by people of the Hani nationality, an ethnic group without
a written language until the 1950s, was published recently in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "Contemporary Literary Series of Hani
Nationality," is a collection of 11 stories written by 16 Hani
writers using 2.2 million words in total. Of the authors six are
female writers.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese sociologist described the publication as the
formation of a contingent of writers of Hani nationality. The book
's preface says, "The emergence and development of Hani language
and Hani literature mark the start of a brand new historical
period for the Hani nationality."
</P>
<P>
The Hani ethnic group had a population of 1.25 million, most of
whom live in Yunnan Province. For centuries, they have kept
records of events on wood, stone and shells. It was not until 1957
that a written form of language based on the Latin alphabet was
created.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the Chinese government
helped the Hani people create their own language system and ethnic
culture and trained a great number of artists and writers.
</P>
<P>
Mao Youquan and A'duo were among the first group of writers
trained in the 1950s and 1960s. Lang Que, a poem and prose writer
of Hani nationality, appeared in the 1970s. The first batch of
female Hani writers emerged in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
So far, 18 Hani writers have been admitted into the Yunnan
Provincial Writers' Association.

<HEADLINE> (Recast) Chinese DVD Player Producer Gets Credit Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Hongtu High Technology
Company Limited, a major Chinese digital video disc (DVD) player
manufacturer, has been given credit support from a bank for its
complete machines exports.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here recently, Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Shanghai Branch will provide an
additional credit line of 63.42 million U.S. dollars to Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will provide the company, which is based in
east China's Jiangsu Province, a credit line worth 50 million U.S.
dollars for the establishment of a letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai World Trade Development Co. Ltd. and APEX Digital Inc.
of the United States will be responsible for the sales of DVD
players produced by Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
A well-known company listed in a Chinese bourse, Hongtu's sales
volume exceeded 760 million yuan last year, jumping 90 percent
over the previous year, said Liu Xiaofeng, chairman of Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
Liu predicted that the demand for DVD players may stand at
around 10 million sets this year, 60 percent of which comes from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The exports of DVD players have become a driving force behind
the growth of China's exports, he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Though Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef made a point
of calling the Holocaust martyrs "saints" in a sermon given Sunday
evening, the furor over his comments on the subject Saturday night
looked unlikely to abate.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier weekend sermon, Yosef had said the Jews who died
in the Holocaust were resurrected sinners being punished for crimes
committed in past lives.
</P>
<P>
He also denounced Prime Minister Ehud Barak as "senseless",
saying he is "running amok" in pursuit of peace with the Arabs, and
in doing so had "placed snakes in our midst. What kind of peace can
you make with a snake?" He further referred to the Palestinians
as "evil-doers."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- No violence is expected between the Palestinians and Israel
in the foreseeable future, according to an updated Israel Defense
Forces Military Intelligence (MI) appraisal presented to the
General Staff last week.
</P>
<P>
The report says Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is giving
absolute priority to bringing talks with Israel to a successful
conclusion. He is also inclining toward postponing the declaration
of an independent Palestinian state from the originally planned
September 13 to November 15 (the date on which the Palestinians
proclaimed their independence in 1988), or perhaps even to Fatah
Day on January 1.
</P>
<P>
MI disputes the assessments of senior officers in Central
Command that suggest the Palestinians want to achieve "independence
through confrontation" and will therefore initiate another round of
violence before the question of a permanent settlement with Israel
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Chief Rabbinate Council will consider a proposal by
Rabbi, She'ar-Yishuv Hacohen, the Chief Rabbi of Haifa, on Monday
to establish a synagogue on the Temple Mount, a holy site which
Israel and the Palestinians had sovereignty disputes.
</P>
<P>
The discussion had drawn a warning from the Mufti of Jerusalem,
Ekrima Sa'id Sabri, who said Sunday that "if the Al-Aqsa Mosque (on
the Temple Mount) is harmed, not only the Muslims here but the
Muslims all over the world will not sit idly by."
</P>
<P>
Israel's two chief rabbis, Yisrael Meir Lau and Eliahu Bakshi-
Doron, are both against reversing the halakhic (Jewish Religious
Law's) stricture against Jews entering the Temple Mount compound
for reasons related to ritual uncleanness.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has been in charge of no less
than 11 ministries over the last month, began divvying up the goods
Sunday, appointing caretaker ministers for four portfolios.
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's cabinet meeting, Barak made the following
appointments to portfolios that have been vacant since Shas, the
National Religious Party, and Yisrael Ba'aliya quit the government
last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak is sending two ministers, Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Transport and Tourism Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, on an overseas mission to explain the Israeli
positions put forward at Camp David.

CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>

tons which are sufficient to meet consumption for at least six
months. The country is expected to see a surplus of more than 750,

for Public Business Sector Mokhtar Abdel Khatab.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The board of directors of the Social Fund for Development
held a meeting in Cairo on Sunday. The meeting, chaired by Egyptian
Prime Minister Atef Obeid, reviewed the fund's resources of 1.887
billion Egyptian pounds (535.14 million U.S. dollars) this fiscal
year, of which 1.268 billion pounds (362.29 million dollars) were
earmarked as loans to youths, 476 million pounds (136 million
dollars) for public projects and the rest for technical services.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Ahmed Beltagui said that
Egypt has got 245 floating hotels on the Nile River and Lake
Nasser. The hotels comprise 13,000 rooms and account for 14 percent
of the total capacity of Egyptian hotels.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The battle against smuggling in Egypt took a new turn with
the announcement Sunday that the Ministry of Supply and Internal
Trade would use hi-tech devices to examine imported goods. Minister
Hassan Ali Khedr declared an all-out war against smuggling,
promising tough new measures to curb the growing phenomenon. And
the country's customs posts would be tightly monitored.

<HEADLINE> Wahid: Indonesia to Tackle Separatist Threats With Reconciliation Spirit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
determined to continue its effort with reconciliation spirit in
tackling the wide spread disintegration threats coming from
various parts of the country such as provinces of Aceh and Irian
Jaya, but adding that it may take repressive measures.
</P>
<P>
The determination was made by President Abdurrahman Wahid when
delivering his progress report Monday before the annual session of
the Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR). Wahid said that
horizontal conflict which has been taking place in Indonesia is a
real threat to the country's territorial integrity and needs to be
swiftly handled to prevent it from spreading throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "the handling of conflict in Aceh, the
country's predominantly Muslim province, is done by combining the
humanitarian approach and the maintenance of laws."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government is determined to continue the
process of reconciliation in Aceh. "If the security condition is
back to normal, the government will be able to effectively
rehabilitate the destroyed infrastructures caused by the conflict,
" he said, citing that the government is currently drafting a bill
on Aceh Special Autonomy as mandated by the Assembly's session
held in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to be fully implemented in the province
within this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with the Irian Jaya issue, Wahid also
said that the government will also give special autonomy status to
the province and the implementation of the status is expected to
coincide with the one in Aceh.
</P>
<P>
As regards the communal bloodshed in Maluku and North Maluku
provinces, the government comprehends the (nearly) two year long
horizontal conflict as a serious threat to "the esteemed values of
brotherhood among us as a nation."
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts toward reconciliation between the opposing
parties will therefore be carried out. At the same time, for those
who violate the laws an even stricter action will be taken, Wahid
said.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a nearly two
year communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians.
Thousands of people have been killed while tens of thousands were
forced to take shelter in the neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Facing all these the government is determined not to
compromise, let alone tolerate the separatist movements in this
country. I also need to underscore the similar stand that would
prevail in facing all kinds of violent actions no matter who does
or where it takes place," Wahid said.

<HEADLINE> Multidimensional Crisis Aggravate Poverty in Indonesia :  President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Monday that multidimensional crisis which has hit
the country since 1997 has given rise to two setbacks in the
endeavor towards the solution of the poverty problem in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the plenary session of the annual session of
the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Wahid said that, "the
conditions of the poor people have aggravated, resulting from the
shortage of job opportunities and the decline of their purchasing
power."
</P>
<P>
He also said that besides, various social maladies have also
spread such as the abuse of narcotics and other dangerous drugs,
prostitution, violence and the erosion of moral values. "Various
natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and fires have also
accelerated the aggravation," Wahid added.
</P>
<P>
The president also revealed that in various pockets of poverty
such as urban slums and underdeveloped areas, a high death rate of
mothers and a low degree of education participation among school
age children have been recorded.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the spreading of infectious diseases such as
tuberculosis, malaria, dengue fever, HIV/AIDS continues to be
rampant," he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that all of those problems have burdened the
endeavor to build up the people's welfare and to alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
"On these grounds the government will seriously continue to
push forward the role of the members of the community as the main
actors of the development. The empowerment of the community, in
particular the people in the poor brackets will continue to be
effected by means of cross sector co-ordination.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Indicates Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid indicated here Monday that he will reshuffle his cabinet
some time in the near future after the annual session of the
Assembly completed, but he did not elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
"In due course, we will conduct cabinet reshuffle. This means
there will be a clear division of responsibility among the
ministers," Wahid said when delivering a progress report speech
before the session.
</P>
<P>
"I myself have yet to determine who would be replaced and how
the reshuffle would take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement however triggered further speculations that
the incumbent President probably will pick up what he said as "the
First Minister" in charge of coordinating the working of cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Rumors has been spreading that Wahid will appoint minister of
Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as the First Minister.
</P>
<P>
But it seems that such a move would be opposed by
Parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
"I know that cabinet reshuffle is a prerogative right of the
President. But I don't think that such a move (appointing the
First Minister) will be fruitful. The President only needs to
coordinate his cabinet ministers. There is no needs (to appoint
The First Minister)," Hatta Rajasa, a parliamentarian of the
Reform Party told reporters in the sideline of the session.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wahid also said that he might reshuffle his cabinet in
August.
</P>
<P>
Since he took reign in October last year, Wahid has made
cabinet reshuffles for several times. The last reshuffle took
place in April this year, when Laksamana Sukardi and Jusuf Kalla
were removed from their posts as Minister of Investment and
Minister of Trade and Industry, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The move however triggered anger and disappointment among
parliamentarians and forced the House to file a motion for
interpellation to the president last month.
</P>
<P>
Wahid cabinet now has been under fire for their alleged failure
in dealing with the protracted economic and political crisis in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says 160 Chechen Rebels Killed at Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military said Monday
that its artillery and air force killed about 160 rebels in the
republic of Chechnya during the air strikes and shelling last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces pounded rebel concentrations in the forests
near Chechnya's capital of Grozny, the second biggest city of
Gudermes, Nozhai-Yurt and Urus-Martan districts, killing more than
160 rebel fighters and mercenaries and wounding scores of others,
the Interfax news agency quoted the press center of the Russian
Combined troops in the North Caucasus as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' loss was especially severe in the forest north of
Gudermes, where Russian units found dozens of bodies of the
militants after federal air raids, according to the press center.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who had infiltrated neighboring Ingushetia and
fired at several Russian helicopters Sunday, were killed in a
motor car while trying to escape. Under the rebels' fire, one of
the federal helicopters was forced to make an emergency landing
near a village in the Ingush republic's territory close to the
Chechen-Ingush border, with one of the 16 paratroopers on board
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the rebels' threat to stage a large-scale
offensive on August 6, the so-called Ichkeria (rebels' Chechen
republic) Independence Day, did not materialize thanks to
preventive steps taken by the federal authorities, the press
center said.
</P>
<P>
There were no hit-and-run attacks or land mine explosions
reported in Grozny. Two rebels were fatally wounded there and
eight people were detained Sunday on suspicion of being members of
separatist bands.
</P>
<P>
An influential Chechen rebel field commander, former chief of
the Ichkeria security service Ibragim Khultygov surrendered to
federal units at the weekend, according to the press center.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 3 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Hongtu High Technology
Company Limited, a major Chinese digital video disc (DVD) player
manufacturer, has been given credit support from a bank for its
complete machines exports.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here recently, Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) Shanghai Branch will provide an
additional credit line of 63.42 million U.S. dollars to Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will provide the company, which is based in
east China's Jiangsu Province, a credit line worth 50 million U.S.
dollars for the establishment of a letter of credit.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai World Trade Development Co. Ltd. and APEX Digital Inc.
of the United States will be responsible for the sales of DVD
players produced by Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
A well-known company listed in a Chinese bourse, Hongtu's sales
volume exceeded 760 million yuan last year, jumping 90 percent
over the previous year, said Liu Xiaofeng, chairman of Hongtu.
</P>
<P>
Liu predicted that the demand for DVD players may stand at
around 10 million sets this year, 60 percent of which comes from
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Market Share of Domestic Mobile Phones Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phones produced by
Chinese enterprises are favored by an increasing number of Chinese
users.
</P>
<P>
These phones will account for half of the domestic market share
in the next three to five years, said President of the Eastern
Communications Co. Ltd Shi Jixing in a recent interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's mobile phone market reported that the market share
of domestic mobile phones has increased from 1-2 percent in the
past to 10 percent today. The figure is expected to climb to 15
percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the first three months of the year
there were 800,000 mobile phones manufactured by ten designated
Chinese enterprises. All their mobile phones were almost sold out.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by a research firm in 30 cities
showed that 41 percent of respondents were willing to buy domestic
mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Insiders predict that the number of Chinese mobile phone users
will increase by 28 million this year, 10 million more than last
year. Five million of them will buy domestic mobile phones.

<HEADLINE> Relics Prove Chinese Playing Go Chess 2,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a porcelain chessboard from the Western Han Dynasty (
206 BC - 24 AD) in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the earliest discovery of a chessboard ever unearthed
in China and proves that Chinese people started playing Chinese go
chess more than 2,000 years ago, according to archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The chessboard was found at the ruins of a watchtower at the
tombs of Emperor Jingdi of the Western Han Dynasty and his empress.
The chessboard, slightly damaged, and unequal measuring 28.5 cm to
5.7 cm long, 19.7 cm to 17 cm wide and 3.6 cm thick.
</P>
<P>
The chessboard is carved with 17 ordinate and 17 transversal
lines, which is quite similar to the modern chessboard.
</P>
<P>
Li Gang, a research fellow with the Shaanxi Provincial
Archaeological Research Institute, said that this chessboard might
be made from a floor tile and it does not belong to the royal
family since the carvings on the chessboard are too rough.
</P>
<P>
Li said the chessboard could have been made by the tomb guards
who played chess to pass the time. "That proves that chess had
been played not only by nobles, but also by ordinary people like
tomb guards more than 2,000 years ago," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
China is the birthplace of go chess, however, the exact date
for the appearance of the game is still unclear at present.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a stone chessboard made in the Eastern Han Dynasty
(25-220) was found in Wangdu County, north China's Hebei Province
in 1954.

<HEADLINE> Women Have Bigger Say In Family Matters in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women are now having a
bigger say in family matters as family incomes rise and people's
educational backgrounds improve, according to a recent national
survey.
</P>
<P>
Men are doing more house chores, said the survey conducted by
the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The four-month survey paves the way for the revision of China's
1980 Marriage Law. 4,000 men and women in 10 provinces were
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
In 80.4 percent of the families, major economic and other
matters were decided by both husband and wife after discussions.
Only 13.3 percent of husbands have the final say while only 5.5
percent wives do.
</P>
<P>
When the husband has higher income, he usually leaves the
family matters to his wife. When the wife earns more, she is
usually more interested in making decisions, said Ding Lu, an
official with ACWF.
</P>
<P>
However, the urban vs. rural differences exist, too, in family
matters, since 7.8 percent house wives in cities have the final
say. The number in the countryside, in contrast, is 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that men are doing more house chores than
before.
</P>
<P>
In 45.9 percent of the families, household affairs are shared
by both husband and wife. However, most of the work is still done
by women. Only 2.1 percent of husbands are doing more household
chores than wives.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Sunday the
international community has begun to perceive the fact that "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) is a separate and
independent state."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks as the U.N.-brokered third round of
proximity talks on Cyprus ended on Friday in Geneva without any
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rauf Denktash, leader of the self-acclaimed TRNC only recognized
by Turkey, said on Saturday in Istanbul that they did their best to
reach an agreement based on two independent states in Cyprus during
the talks, but Greek Cypriots showed no flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey sent its troops to the
north following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The fourth round of talks will start in New York on September
12.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish State Minister Suayip Usenmez said on Sunday Turkey
will be dependent on other countries for oil, which has strategical
importance, adding production and search activities within the oil-
resource-poor country will stop as "these actions are not
economical."
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Tourism Minister Erkan Mumcu said on Sunday Turkey is
living in a "magnificent tourism season," adding the country hosted
1.5 million tourists in July.
</P>
<P>
He said the figure shows that Turkey will exceed the target of
10 million tourists for the whole year, predicting there is no
reason why the number cannot reach 12 million by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Forestry Ministry officials Sunday warned people
living in forest-intensive western and southern provinces, such as
Adana, Antalya, Balikesir, Izmir, Mersin, Mugla and Kahramanmaras,
against possible forest fires that might break out in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry asked people not to light a fire in forests or
throw away burning cigarette buds, urging local authorities to
check the electricity transmitting cables passing from these areas.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, a total of 20,080 hectares of forest land were
burnt in Turkey by 153 fire spots, compared with last year's 1,496
hectares by 395 fire spots in the same period.

<HEADLINE> Three Wounded by Israeli Fire at Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli soldiers on Sunday wounded
a 13-year-old boy who was hurling rocks at an observation post
beside the Fatima gate in the village of Kfar Kila and two
journalists nearby, An Nahar newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists, one from AFP and the other for Radio
Canada, were injured in abdomen and shoulder respectively while
Israeli soldiers fired back at the rock attackers. The wounded were
taken to hospital in Nabatieh.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Army said the teenager was wounded by a rock, not a
bullet during disturbances at the gate where Lebanese citizens
threw rocks, metal bars and bottles at Israeli soldiers and farmers
working on the far side of the border fence.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers fired warning shots into the air twice and then, when
they shot at the ground, a rock that was struck splintered and hit
the boy, the army said.
</P>
<P>
But a doctor at Nabatieh hospital said the boy was injured by a
bullet that ricocheted off the ground and into his foot.
</P>
<P>
Several Lebanese and Palestinian refugees have been wounded at
Fatima Gate since Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authority has warned its soldiers will be permitted to
fire back if rocks are thrown from the other side.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Recovers, President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Monday that the country's economic situation is
now better than before, saying that the economy has now moved
away from the crisis circle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the annual session of the People's Consultative
Assembly to deliver a working report for his nine months in office,
Wahid said that the government has also made achievements over the
past nine months.
</P>
<P>
"The recovery programs having been implemented, our economy has
now moved away from the crisis circle, although it is still in the
early stage and is not strong enough yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements made in the last nine months, although
objectively speaking many, are still meagre compared to the
expectations of the government itself as well also the assignment
it has to shoulder pursuant to the message of the Board Guidelines
of State Policy (GBHN), namely to meet the expectations of the
people at large," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
In this occasion, Wahid also revealed the government policy in
the future to boost the ongoing economic recovery program.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, sustainable and just economic recovery will be
underpinned by four pillars of program, namely : the maintenance
of the macroeconomic stability, the strengthening of economic
institutions, the improvement of structural policies, and the
protection and the empowerment of those who have been left behind,
who don't have ability and who are poor," Wahid stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in a bid to maintain a conducive
macroeconomic stability the government will continue its national
economic recovery efforts by inviting foreign investors to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The president said the economic relations with other countries
should be directed towards utilizing all the potentials of these
countries which have financial capacity, managerial expertise,
technology and necessary networks.
</P>
<P>
Wahid added that in the area of monetary, the government will
continue to adopt a monetary policy in line with the economic
target and needs which have been fixed, citing that the government
will also honor the independence of Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, in determining monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
"In the context of maintaining macrostability, the government
will continue to cooperate constructively with the Bank Indonesia
to strengthen our economic fundamentals so that these will be
realistically reflected in the exchange rate of rupiah," Wahid
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Determined to Carry Out Reforms: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Monday stressed that the government is determined to carry
out the reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The government's resolve and determination to continue
overcoming the crisis, safeguarding the national integrity and
carrying out the reforms will ever be incessant, no matter how
dreadful the problems and challenges are which we are confronting,
" the president said in his working report to the annual general
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The president also said the government will endure its deep
commitment to keep on developing democratic life, human rights,
justice, supremacy of law, social welfare, regional autonomy,
stability and social order.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, these major tasks should be carried out by the
entire people of Indonesia. Of course the government plays a key
role in encouraging the components of the society in a bid to take
an active part and give their contribution (to overcoming the
crisis)," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
The president's report was read out by Cabinet Secretary
Marsilam Simanjuntak before the members of MPR following the
opening ceremony of the first ever MPR annual general session
which will last until August 18.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government remains unbending to carry
through its resolve to take any appropriate chances to bring the
country and the nation out of the lingering multidimensional
crisis. The government's policies and measures to consistently
bring into existence a clean and good governance will continue to
progress.
</P>
<P>
"This will be carried out mainly through the performing of
steady and justifiable measures to put an end to the KKN (
corruption, collusion and nepotism) practices in the government's
institutions, to improve the judiciary institutions' independence
followed by the refined professionalism and moral integrity, and
to improve transparency in information and policy making," he said.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the problems, the president asked the Indonesian
people to give full support to the government.
</P>
<P>
The president assured that the government would work even
harder and proceed to strive for more accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
"More than 200 million Indonesian people will be very thankful
and glad should, through wisdom, intelligence and compassion, we
be able to produce a genuine national solution in an orderly,
democratic as well as decent and ethical manner, for otherwise, we
would fail to build consensus and find an accurate solution," he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines Join Battle Against Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- As wildfires raged Sunday
across almost 750,000 acres in the western United States, more
troops moved into the state of Idaho to bolster firefighting
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The Marines have landed!" said fire information officer Renee
Snyder, referring to 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton, California.
</P>
<P>
Troops were sent to Idaho's Salmon-Challis National Forest,
about 200 kilometers northeast of Boise, to help build a fire line
around the blaze, which was sparked by lightning on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 kilometers to the east, 500 Army soldiers from Fort
Hood, Texas, worked on mop-up duty at the Burgdorf Junction fire
in the Payette National Forest, where more than 22,000 acres have
burned. Another contingent from the same camp is scheduled to
arrive soon.
</P>
<P>
In Idaho, even as word came that beleaguered crews would get
reinforcements from Canadian firefighters and more U.S. Army
troops, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne said it could be autumn before some
of the blazes in his state are controlled.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of blazes have made Montana a leading hot spot on the
West's fire map. Sixteen large fires in the state have burned
about 140,000 acres so far.
</P>
<P>
"The Northern Rockies area is the hottest place in the country
at the moment, and it's mostly Montana," said Lynn Pisano-Pedigo,
spokeswoman at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.
</P>
<P>
In California, eight new fires had scorched more than 88,450
acres by Saturday. The largest blaze -- 72,730 acres in the
Sequoia National Forest about 250 kilometers north of Los Angeles -
- was 80 percent contained, according to fire information officer
Gil Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
The estimated size of the area on fire in the West has jumped
by more than 200,000 acres since Saturday, according to new data
from airborne infrared cameras, the National Interagency Fire
Center said.
</P>
<P>
The center now counts 64 large wildfires covering 941,771 acres
up from 62 fires on 739,800 acres Saturday night in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming,
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is expected to tour Idaho's fire areas
Tuesday and speak with some of the more than 1,500 military troops
who have been sent in to help exhausted civilian fire crews, the
White House announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials said about 20,000 firefighters have been struggling
to contain the fires, which so far this year have burned 3.9
million acres in 63,242 blazes, nearly twice as big an area as
normal.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts on Sunday offered little hope of relief from the hot,
dry weather that has helped create what officials have called the
worst fire season in the West in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Capello Wins Mosport Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Rinaldo Capello of Italy beat
Jorg Muller's BMW to win the Grand Prix at Mosport sports car race
at Mosport International Raceway in Bowmanville, Ontario on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian nursed his Audi R8 prototype around the course on
rain tires because the track was initially wet, but still won.
</P>
<P>
Capello, who teamed with Allan McNish for the Audi triumph,
posted the closest finish in American Le Mans Series history,
beating Muller to the line by just .148 of a second.
</P>
<P>
The McNish-Capello machine led the last 35 laps, but the last
one offered the breathtaking finish.
</P>
<P>
Muller was on dry tires and was reeling in Capello at the rate
of four to seven seconds a lap. He caught Capello at Turn 3, then
waited until the final corner to make a move, diving under Capello
and just missing victory at the line.
</P>
<P>
McNish set the fastest lap in Mosport history in race
competition with a speed of 123.942 mph (199 kph) on the sixth lap
of the race.

TIANJIN, August 7 (Xinhua)-- North China's largest port city,
Tianjin, plans to attract more foreign investment with newly
measures, the latest Sino-Japan seminar indicated.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will concentrate on introducing more foreign capitals
in about 25 key projects of information, biology, new energy and
materials and other hi-tech sectors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to continuously attracting international big

sized and small companies this year, adding that the city will
establish an enterprise center this year for their career
development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the port city will explore more information accesses,
including the Internet, to introduce Tianjin to the world and
invite multinational enterprises. At the same time, Tianjin is
trying to improve the investment environment and offer better
services.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin used a total of 2.5 billion US dollars of foreign funds
and approved 540 foreign-funded enterprises in 1999, swelling the
number of foreign-funded enterprises so far established to 12,000,
involving a total contractual foreign funds of 25 billion US
dollars, statistics showed.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Foreigners Enter Shanghai Visa Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 foreign
passengers have visited Shanghai this year without applying for
visas before entering the Chinese metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers came from the United States, Japan and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has allowed passengers from certain countries to pass
through customs via its two international airports and stay in the
city for 24 hours without a visa. In some cases the time limit can
be extended to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The visa-free policy has been carried out since January 1 with
approval from the central government.
</P>
<P>
The two international airports are Pudong and Hongqiao.
Shanghai is the only city in China with two international airports.
</P>
<P>
The policy has been welcomed by foreigners. "It helps us a lot
to freely enter and leave Shanghai," said German tourist Smith
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
An official at Shanghai Customs said the policy is also
favorable to the development of transportation and trade in the
city.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed foreign citizens, except those law offenders, to
pass through Pudong or Hongqiao international airports.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who make a stopover in Shanghai are also allowed to
visit Shanghai's neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai customs has made pamphlets to publicize the policy. It
also opens special channels at the airports and deploys officers
to handle visa-free services for foreign passengers.
</P>
<P>
The officers said the policy is still in its embryonic stage
and is being carried out on an experimental basis.

<HEADLINE> Wahid: Conflicts, Power Struggle Threaten Indonesia's Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) - Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said here Monday that mounting conflicts and power struggle
among elite politicians and forces in Indonesia is really
threatening the existence of the unitary state and national
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual session of the country's highest law-
making body of the Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR), the
president said that the government faces difficulties due to a
wide spread communal conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The political atmosphere, we feel, is flowing and affecting
the intensity of controversy and physical conflicts among certain
parts of our society," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the area of security and politics, Wahid said, his
government inherited a situation that is laden with conflict of
interest, followed everywhere by various law violations.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that, "even though the government that was formed
from the result of the 1999 general elections already possessed
legitimization and reflects the will and desire of the people, its
existence cannot automatically cool down the atmosphere of
conflict, which deeply rooted in politics, economy and society."
</P>
<P>
The annual session of the assembly was opened by its Speaker
Amien Rais on Monday morning and is expected to be closed on
August 18.
</P>
<P>
All factions in the Assembly will express their respective
opinions, questions and criticism of the President's speech until
August 9.
</P>
<P>
But there is no sign, so far, that the president will be
impeached due to his alleged failure in dealing with the huge
complex problems which have been deteriorating economic and
political situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Ruling Party Lawmaker Crosses Over to Main Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's member of Parliament
Dixon Perera of the ruling People's Alliance (PA) on Monday
crossed over to the main opposition United National Party (UNP) at
the beginning of the parliamentary debate on the government's
contentious new draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
Perera is the PA member of Parliament for the district of
Colombo. His crossover is viewed as a major blow to the government
who is trying to muster a two-thirds majority or 150 votes to push
through the draft in the 225-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the government is short of 25 votes due to
the crossover of Perera and the noncooperation of the UNP and some
Tamil parties.
</P>
<P>
The Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress M. Ashraff opened
the debate in the parliament Monday morning on the new
constitution which aims at politically resolving the 17-year civil
war between majority Sinhalese dominated government troops and
Tamil Tiger rebels who demand a separate state in Sri Lanka's
north and east. The debate was covered live on the national
television.
</P>
<P>
The UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is scheduled to make a
statement to the parliament on Monday and then the party would
stage a walk out. The three-day debate began amidst growing
opposition to the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The UNP had a meeting last night where all their members of
parliament agreed to support the party line.
</P>
<P>
However two UNP members of Parliament who are accused of
crossing over to the government side on Monday had not presented
themselves at the meeting. They are Mervyn de Silva, member of
Parliament from the south of Sri Lanka, and Sarath Kongahage from
the central hills of the country.
</P>
<P>
The PA government of President Kumaratunga has been lobbying
heavily to woo the UNP members of Parliament. It was confirmed by
Minister of Environment Mahinda Wijesekara in a speech made over
the national television. He said, "We have the right to speak to
the opposition members to get their support."

<HEADLINE> China Develops Genetic Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
genetically modified pesticide which, it is claimed, will get rid
of the most vicious vegetable pests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qi Yipeng, in charge of the group at Wuhan University
in Hubei Province which developed the pesticide, said that the new
pesticide is environmentally friendly and able to kill eighty
percent of sugar beet noctuids, minor vegetable moths and dark-
green moths within two to three days.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that the new pesticide is likely to be put into mass
production soon.
</P>
<P>
The scientists developed the pesticide by combining the genetic
elements of two existing viruses of vegetable pests. The pesticide
does no harm to the natural enemies of the vegetable pests. It is
also totally harmless to man and animals. Moreover, it will not
produce any residues that pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to international agreements that China has signed,
the country will increase the proportion of environmentally-
friendly pesticides to 60 percent of the total used in the country
this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Moves to Crack Down Jewel Scams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai tourist police are working
with the Tourism Authority of Thailand and other agencies
concerned to curb the long-standing problem of jewelry scams, the
Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Unscrupulous jewelry companies, tuk tuk drivers, illegal tour
guides, commercial bank staff and tour operators are all involved
in duping foreign tourists into buying high-priced cheap jewelry,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are working with the Thai Gem and Jewelry
Traders Association to establish common standards and a
recognizable logo that visitors can use to identify reputable
stores, Chanaphat Choeisombat, superintendent of the tourist
police, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said brochures advising foreign visitors to be aware of
being cheated will be distributed on flights coming into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Tourist police have been instructed to patrol popular areas and
keep a close watch on tuk tuk drivers and illegal tour guides who
approach foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
The commerce ministry is also helping with the investigation,
and the revenue department of the finance ministry has been asked
to inspect tax payments of shops suspected of being involved in
scams, and tour companies are being warned they could face
deregistration.
</P>
<P>
About 477 tourists, mostly Westerners and Japanese, complained
of being defrauded by gem dealers last year. About 120 tourists
have filed complaints so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 people were arrested in relation to running gem scams
each month and were charged with causing a nuisance to others and
fined a maximum of 1,000 baht, Chanaphat said.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Corruption charges and documents
against Indonesia's former president Soeharto will be submitted to
court on Tuesday morning, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman told
reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had originally planned to file the paperwork at the
South Jakarta District Court Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Barman Zahir, who heads Jakarta's higher prosecution
office, said this would be delayed while state lawyers put the
finishing touches on the documents.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities are reportedly looking for a new location
for the corruption trial of Soeharto because of the expected
massive interest in the case.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the Attorney General's Office declared Soeharto,
79, as a defendant in corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutors said Soeharto would be charged with
corruption for the misuse of 1.4 trillion rupiah (150 million U.S.
dollars) from seven charities he controlled during his 32-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that prosecutors are likely to ask the judge to
imprison Soeharto for life when his massive corruption case is
tried in the South Jakarta District Court.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Plans to Borrow 4.43 Bln Dollars Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
proposing to raise some 177.3 billion pesos (4.43 billion U.S.
dollars) in foreign and local borrowings next year to finance the
expected budget deficit of 85 billion pesos (2.13 billion dollars)
for the year 2001,a local newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Daily Inquirer quoted data from Department of Budget and
Management as saying that the total borrowings would also be used
to settle maturing obligations of 81.6 billion pesos (2.04 billion
dollars) and bring down the Treasury balance by 6 billion pesos (
150 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"This borrowing level is 59.8 billion pesos (1.5 billion
dollars)lower than the 237.1-billion-peso (5.9 billion dollars)
borrowing level for 2000, significant inasmuch as the budget
deficit for 2001 is higher than the 62.5-billion-peso (1.56
billion dollars) programmed deficit for this year," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Of the proposed 177.3-billion-peso borrowings, the government
plans to borrow 112.3 billion pesos (2.8 billion dollars) from
domestic market, while 65 billion pesos (1.6 billion dollars) will
come from abroad, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> World Congress on Forestry Research Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The 21st International Union
of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO) World Congress opened
here Monday to address issues of future developments of forest
research in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The six-day congress, themed "Forests and Society: The Role of
Research," will focus on subjects such as sustainable forest
management, forests and society needs, environment change and
forests, economic and social aspects of forestry in developing
countries, and management of forestry research.
</P>
<P>
Some 2500 participants from 91 countries and regions are
attending the congress, the first being held in a developing
country since IUFRO was established in 1892 to promote
international cooperation in forestry research and related
sciences.
</P>
<P>
At the official opening of the congress, Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad urged the developed countries to
reaffirm and put into action their commitments to provide concrete
financial assistance and technologies to developing countries to
achieve sustainable management of their forests.
</P>
<P>
"If the world is to achieve sustainable forest management, the
transfer of technology from the North to the South on preferential
terms as agreed to in Rio must be forthcoming," Mahathir said in
his keynote address delivered by Primary Industries Minister Lim
Keng Yaik.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir believed IUFRO can play an important role to
facilitate this transfer of technology, hoping this congress will
help develop more concrete networks which will serve as effective
conduits for North-South transfer of technology.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for a legally-binding instrument for
addressing a whole range of issues on forestry and timber in a
holistic, integrated and comprehensive manner to facilitate the
achievement of sustainable forest management.

<HEADLINE> Tight Security Imposed Around Sri Lankan Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Security around the Sri Lankan
Parliament will be tightened between Monday and Friday when the
proposed new constitution and proposals for a new electoral system
will be debated, the official Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Inspector General of Police of Western Province (South)
Jayantha Wickremaratne was quoted as saying that intelligence
reports had been received that several organizations will attempt
to disrupt the peace during the proceedings of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In addition to tight security, traffic in the parliament area
in eastern suburban Colombo will also be curtailed during the
proceedings and the public has been requested to use alternative
roads.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to go ahead with the new legislation
despite mounting opposition from political parties, national
organizations and the powerful Buddhist clergy claiming that there
was inadequate public debate on the proposed new laws.
</P>
<P>
They have also expressed surprise at the government's haste to
rush through the legislation when the parliament will be dissolved
on August 24 and the next general elections must be held by early
November.
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds majority in the parliament is required for the
legislation to be passed and government is banking on a crossover
of at least 15 members of the main opposition United National
Party to obtain it.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist clergy and other organizations have called on all
members of the parliament to oppose the legislation which they
describe as anti-national.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, sees the new legislation as a
political solution to the country's ethnic conflict, which has
seen a 17-year war during which more than 60,000 persons have been
killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will help four
neighboring countries in Southeast Asia in developing their trade

<HEADLINE> "Dubai Millennium" Retired After Severe Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Fate dealt Dubai's Godolphin
stable a cruel blow on Saturday, when the world's most famous
racing operation lost it's "dream" performer Dubai Millennium to a
freak accident on the Newmarket Gallops in England.
</P>
<P>
Dubai Millennium, as his owner-breeder General Mohammed bin
Rashid Al Maktoum, crown prince of Dubai and minister of Defence,
called "the best horse he has every seen," was discovered by his
trainer Saeed bin Suroor to have suffered a severe fracture of his
right hind leg shortly after working on the Limekilns.
</P>
<P>
A hastily arranged x-ray revealed that the "lateral condylar
fracture" was in fact career-ending injury and meant that the four-
year-old colt would never set foot on a race track again. He was
immediately retired to stud, according to local media on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We're devastated," Suroor told the United Arab Emirates media
from Newmarket, "it's the worst news we could have ever had. The
vet informed us that he will require surgery for this serious
injury which means that his career is over."
</P>
<P>
The news that sent shock waves through the racing industry came
only hours after General Mohammed had proposed a sensational 12
million U.S. dollars match race with French champion Montjeu, a
clash that would have fired the imagination of racegoers across
the globe.
</P>
<P>
Suroor was on hand to supervise Dubai Millennium's gallop under
regular work rider 'Tony', and said that the Dubai World Cup
winner had turned in a typically brilliant piece of work. "He
looked to be in his best shape," said Suroor. "He worked fantastic
and completely outran his lead horse Fly To The Stars.
</P>
<P>
"But as we were leading him to his stable I noticed a swelling
on his right hind leg. On closer examination I discovered it was
pretty serious and was immediately worried," said Suroor
describing the incident. "We quickly arranged for an x-ray, which
revealed that he needed a major operation and that there was no
way he would ever race again.
</P>
<P>
"We contacted General Mohammed instructed that he will be
retired to stud in Darley where he will stand as a stallion," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement on Godolphin's website, General Mohammed had
thrown down the gauntlet of a contest, which was scheduled just
eight days before, to Montjeu's owner Michael Tabor, inviting him
to race Montjeu against Dubai Millennium for a winner's purse of 6
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> External Fertilized Ovums Grow Better in Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists claimed that it
would improve the quality of embryo and increase preganancy rate
if more than one ovums fertilized in vitro were cultivated
together.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally doctors cultivated only one oosperm each time in
order to keep close watch on it and avoid interactive pollution
among the oosperms.
</P>
<P>
But the latest study by a group of Chinese scientists in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province showed that more growth
factor will be secreted if more than one oosperms were cultivated
together.
</P>
<P>
As a result, women who recieve such oosperms are easier to get
pregnant with better embryos, said Zhang Yulan, head of the
research group.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and her partners have done the experiment with 323 ovums
fertilized in vitro. The pregnancy rate was up by nearly six
percentage points.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The "grain for green" program,
an ecological recovery project, has been launched in Hunan
Province on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>

The project now underway in Hunan is estimated to cost 80
million yuan (about 9.6 million US dollars) to return 13,000 ha of
farmland to grassland and expand afforestation by another 13,000
ha.
</P>
<P>
According to related regulations, farmers will be compensated
with 300 yuan for each ha of farmland they surrender. The

<P>
The regulations also point out that farmers who plant trees
should be beneficiaries of the afforested area.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River valley is one of the world's important
ecosystem zones. It suffers from serious soil erosion and
desertification as a result of heavy logging.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China began to take measures to restore the natural
forests along the river by returning farmland to grassland and
forests on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have been considered crucial for harnessing the
rampant flooding on the river, which has been attributed to the
deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 million people, or nearly a third of China's total,
live in the river valley. The river's ecological environment is
vital for sustainable economic development of the region.

<HEADLINE> GSM Introduced to Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- GSM (Global System of Mobile
Communications) went into service Thursday at the construction
site of China's biggest water control project -- the Three Gorges
Dam.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Hubei Province Mobile Telecommunications
Company, the developer of GSM service, said the base stations of
the GSM in the Three Gorges Dam area are capable of handling phone
calls simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The construction site of the Three Gorges Dam covers an area of
15.28 sq km. Previously, contacts among design organizations,
construction companies and equipment suppliers were limited, as
the project developer, the Yangtze River Three Gorges Project
Development Corporation, practiced closed management at the
construction site, causing the telecommunications signals in the
area to be weak.
</P>
<P>
There were also no China Telecom base stations there.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei Province Mobile Telecommunications Company spent 40
million yuan to bring GSM service to the construction site of the
gigantic water control project on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, China's longest, in early April. Workers completed
the construction in just four months.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xugui, an official with the Engineering Department of the
Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, said
that he believed the improved telecommunications conditions will
not only provide a powerful guarantee for ensuring the successful
completion of the dam, but also promote the development of tourism
in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his company will cooperate with the China
Mobile Group in the near future and invest 100 million yuan in
erecting a permanent mobile telecommunications network that will
cover the entire Three Gorges Reservoir area.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Clinton's Visit Promotes Tourism in Tiny Chinese Village ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past two years many changes have taken place in the
isolated village. Television is now a household necessity.
</P>
<P>
Although this is still a small village, most children, like
their counterparts in big Chinese cities, have developed an
interest in learning English in primary school.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jiashuai's 12-year-old daughter, Zhao Weiyan, scores A
grade in each of her English test. She said that she was motivated
by the eagerness of going to the United States to see lanes laid
with big stone slabs in Clinton's hometown, which the president
told her are similar to the ones in Yucun.
</P>
<P>
He Gelan's house now has a telephone on which she can make long-
distance calls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourism is booming in Yucun. On May 1, over 1,000
tourists visited the village.
</P>
<P>
Visitors are often surprised by the openness and generosity of
the villagers, when they find themselves warmly greeted by farmers
in any farmhouse they call at.
</P>
<P>
When Jane Murray, deputy secretary general of the World Energy
Council, visited the village in June this year, she asked the
villagers: "Don't you feel bothered by tourists?"
</P>
<P>
She was told that they welcome tourists, because in addition to
fruit-growing and fishing, tourism gives them another source of
income.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton was really a great advertisement for Yucun,"
said Murray.
</P>
<P>
She gave a high appraisal of the popularization of biogas and
solar energy in Yucun, which have completely replaced wood as the
fuel for the 120 households in the village over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Clinton's Visit Promotes Tourism in Tiny Chinese Village ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Tourists are flocking to the
pretty village of Yucun, which U.S. President William Clinton
visited on his visit to this Chinese tourism mecca in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The centuries-old village that can only be reached by boat was
a stopover on Clinton's cruise down the Li River. The American
first family spent 40 minutes visiting the village, during which
Zhao Jiashuai remembered clearly the 16 minutes they spent in his
500-year-old house with intricately carved beams and windows.
</P>
<P>
It was a highlight in the Chinese farmer's life. Zhao said that
he has kept in mind every moment. He now devotes most of his time
guiding tourists around the village in Clinton's footsteps,
explaining what scenes impressed the president and what Clinton
said during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The farmer, wearing a worn white shirt and blue trousers, which
was exactly what he was wearing in pictures taken with the
President two years ago, said that he noticed the American
president did not wear a tie in his visit to Yucun.
</P>
<P>
"I wore my everyday clothes to welcome the president. His
casual dress made me feel at ease," he said.
</P>
<P>
Framed pictures featuring Clinton's visit to Zhao's house are
the major decorations on the stone walls in the spacious sitting
room.
</P>
<P>
An abacus in the village's small grocery, which aroused
President Clinton's interest, has been framed on a wall, along
with enlarged photos of Clinton and the family of the grocery
owner, Zhao Jiachang.
</P>
<P>
"The abacus has become a symbol of Sino-American friendship,"
said Zhao Jiachang. He bought a new abacus to do his accounts.
</P>
<P>
A few international brands such as Coca-Cola and Kodak can be
found on the shelf of the grocery. They are new items, according
to the owner.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that he introduced the goods for tourists. Villagers
are still unlikely to buy such luxuries.

<HEADLINE> China-made Anti-Aids Drug Experimented in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Clinical experiments in Thailand
on 28 people with AIDS have proven that a China-made compound
pharmaceutical drug is effective in the treatment of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The medicine Fufang SH was developed by a group of Chinese
scientist headed by Luo Shide, a professor at the Kunming
Botanical Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The experiment was carried out on the patients at Sapatong
hospital of Ban Chiang Mai city in Thailand, according to an
agreement signed between Thailand and the Kunming Botanical
Research Institute in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The HIV virus in nine AIDS patients were reduced considerably
after they took the medicine for three months. The HIV infection
in 16 other patients had stayed stable, which suggests that the
virus has been controlled, according to Thai Public Health
Minister Korn Dabbaransi.
</P>
<P>
After tests on 1,000 kinds of medicinal herbs for 13 years,
they found 150 medicinal herbs are active in fighting the AIDS
virus. Then they made a compound drug with five herbs as the
principle ingredients.
</P>
<P>
The medicine has been proven safe, non-toxic and cheap.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Genetic Pesticide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
genetically modified pesticide which, it is claimed, will get rid
of the most vicious vegetable pests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qi Yipeng, in charge of the group at Wuhan University
in Hubei Province which developed the pesticide, said that the new
pesticide is environmentally friendly and able to kill eight
percent of sugar beet noctuids, minor vegetable moths and dark-
green moths within two to three days.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that the new pesticide is likely to be put into mass
production soon.
</P>
<P>
The scientists developed the pesticide by combining the genetic
elements of two existing viruses of vegetable pests. The pesticide
does no harm to the natural enemies of the vegetable pests. It is
also totally harmless to man and animals. Moreover, it will not
produce any residues that pollute the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to international agreements that China has signed,
the country will increase the proportion of environmentally-
friendly pesticides to 60 percent of the total used in the country
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education has
started an advertising campaign for the first time to recruit
Chinese college teachers to work in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This year's recruits will be working in Mali and Gabon,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The ad was published in the People's Daily on June 30,
recruiting four college teaching positions in mathematics, physics,
chemistry and biology.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the ad had been well received but did not say
exactly how many applications were received.
</P>
<P>
The applicants, being able to teach in French and 27-58 years
old, must currently be college teachers or researchers who have
taught in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Applicants, ranging from recent college graduates to
experienced professors, were still coming in after the July 20
deadline. This reflects teachers' enthusiasm for the academic
exchange program, said Liu Chenggang, vice-division chief of the
International Co-operation and Exchange Department under the
Ministry of Education.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Cement Production Picks Up in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's cement production picked
up in fiscal year 1999-2000, which ended in March, with 350,784
tons following a three consecutive years' fall in the output since
1995-96, according to the latest issue of the official Economic
Indicators available Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's cement production fell from 523,611 tons in 1995-
96 to 501,989 tons in 1996-97, 483,442 tons in 1997-98 and then to
333,513 tons in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Because of the fall, the country spent in 1997-98 83.7 million
U.S. dollars importing cement.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure was then reduced to 65.5 million in 1998-99 and
42.1 million in 1999-2000, while endeavors for boosting cement
production were made in order to save the foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the rising demand for cement in its
infrastructural construction such as roads, bridges and dams,
Myanmar is also making efforts to build more cement plants.
</P>
<P>
In last June, Myanmar signed an accord with a Chinese company
to build a 500-ton-daily-capacity cement plant in Kyaukse, central
Mandalay division of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Myanmar is also trying to get a foreign
loan of 150 million dollars to build a 4,000-ton daily-capacity
large-scale cement plant.

JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian authorities are

whoever planted a bomb that exploded outside the Philippine
ambassador's residence in Central Jakarta last week.
</P>
<P>
"We are coordinating with the U.S. to exchange all sorts of
information, ranging from the type of the bomb to the suspects,"
National Police chief General Rusdihardjo was quoted by Indonesian
Observer Monday as saying.
</P>

</P>
<P>
"That's a possibility. We are still looking forward to
searching for the producer and the suspect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rusdihardjo said police have accepted U.S. help in order to
close the case as soon as possible.

It was reported that the Philippines has offered to help
Indonesian investigators find the bombers.

<HEADLINE> Africa Sports Beat Esperance 2-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Africa Sports, helped by
striker Fadel Keita who is the top goalscorer in this year's
African Champions League, defeated favorite Esperance 2-1 in
group one of the competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Keita, who scored five goals in four matches in the first two
knockout rounds, returned from a broken jaw to net twice in the
opening 15 minutes in Abidjan as the home side scored their first
points of the league phase of the Champions League.
</P>
<P>
The result restored the Ivorian club's chances in the
competition after they lost their opening group match to Mamelodi
Sundowns of South Africa a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Esperance still leads the group on goal difference from Africa
Sports and Sundowns, whose game away at Sable de Batie of Cameroon
in Douala was postponed on Sunday because of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The big weekend winners were Ghana's Hearts of Oak, who scored
a 4-2 away win over Jeanne d'Arc of Senegal on Saturday to take
the lead in group two.
</P>
<P>
The four goals were the most scored by a visiting team since
the league format was introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It was another player returning to action who stole the show,
18-year-old Ishmael Addo scoring twice for the Ghanaian side in
Dakar.
</P>
<P>
Addo, suspended for Hearts' last game in the Champions League,
scored twice in the second half to break a 1-1 deadlock at the
interval.
</P>
<P>
Hearts of Oak lead the group two standings with a full haul of
points from their opening two matches, followed by Al Ahli of
Egypt, who have three points from their 3-1 win over Lobi Stars in
Cairo on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The next round of matches in the two groups are to be played
on August 19-20. The two group winners meet in the Champions
League, to be played over two legs, in December.

<HEADLINE> Safin Takes Toronto Masters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Marat Safin beat Harel
Levy of Israel 6-2, 6-3 to win the Masters Series in Toronto on
Sunday for his third title this year.
</P>
<P>
Marat, who won in Barcelona and Mallorca in the spring,
clinched his first win in a Masters Series tournament, earning 400,
000 U.S. dollars and lifting him from eighth to fourth in the
Champions Race, accorting to reports.
</P>
<P>
Levy, the first Israeli to reach an ATP Tour final since Amos
Mansdorf in Tel Aviv in 1994, played aggressively and offered a
determined challenge, but committed far too many unforced errors
to offer a serious threat. As a result, the eighth seeded Russian
was in control for most of the match, only stuttering in the first
and final games.
</P>
<P>
Safin, who saved three match points against Pete Sampras in
the quarter-finals, allowed the energetic Levy to break his serve
in the opening game, but then conceded just four points in his
next seven service games. It was only when serving for the match
that he almost let Levy back, but he recovered from 0-40 to win
the title in just 54 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Russian faces a qualifier in next week's Master Series
tournament in Cincinnati, and is in the same quarter of the draw
as Sampras. Andre Agassi is the top seed, and he will face a stiff
challenge from Toronto semi-finalist Wayne Ferreira.

Monica Seles 6-0, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3 on Sunday to capture the 535,000
U.S. dollar tournament in Carlsbad for her third consecutive

Spaniard Conchita Martinez and giant-killer Amy Frazier, who
stunned Hingis in a quarter-final match.
</P>
<P>
Seles, ranked sixth and seeded fourth, was vying for her
fourth title of the year. But the nine-time Grand Slam winner

"I'm not disappointed at all with my performance tonight," he
was quoted as saying. "The main thing for me was that I didn't
feel any pain in my leg, which I had just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't jumped much this season and my timing is off,
therefore I intend to compete as often as possible until Sydney."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Deny Preparations for New Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, here Monday denied that there have
been preparations for a second Camp David summit to work out a
permanent peace deal between Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, is secretary general of the
Executive Committee of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). He
was accompanying Arafat in a multi-national tour to rally support
for Palestinian positions.
</P>
<P>
He said before the departure of the Palestinian delegation that
any future summit should be well prepared. Arafat left here Monday
evening after concluding a one-day visit to the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Abbas praised the UAE's repeated call for an Arab summit, saying
Palestinians want the summit to be held on the issue of Jerusalem
so that all Arabs could take their share of responsibility on the
issue of Jerusalem, according to the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arafat had briefed Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, Abu
Dhabi crown prince and deputy supreme commander of the armed
forces, on the outcome of the difficult days that the Palestinian
team had spent at the failed Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Arafat accused Israel of wanting "Tailor-made
peace." But he said another U.S.-sponsored summit would possibly be
held after August 14, whereas Israeli Prime Minister Barak declared
it is "too early to discuss new summit."

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Qatar to Rally Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Qatar Monday to continue his support-rallying campaign
after the failure of the Camp David talks with Israel in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Monday night from the United Arab Emirates
for a two-day visit and he will hold talks with Qatari Crown Prince
Sheikh Jassem bin Hamad al-Thani first due to the absence of Emir
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the official Qatari news agency
QNA said.
</P>
<P>
Hamad, who is in Sudan on a mediation mission between Sudan and
Eritrea, may return Tuesday to meet Arafat, diplomats in Doha said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat began a tour to Arab and Islamic countries to rally
support after the talks with Israel in Camp David near Washington
fell apart last week. The talks had been designed to come up with
consensus between Israel and the Palestinians over final status
issues to lay ground for a permanent peace deal by September.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides failed to solve their difference over the core
issues, especially the fate of Jerusalem. Israel proposed a shared
sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem, which was rejected by the
Palestinians who want the whole east part under their total
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Germany Boosts Campaign Against Far-Right Extremism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The German government Monday
announced that it would launch a federal wide project as its
latest action against the swelling far-right racism.
</P>
<P>
In the initiative named "Show Face," leading roles in all
fields of German society will speak out in television, radio and
other media to encourage the public's rejection of racism,
government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye told a press conference in
Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
The project, due to begin in September, is an "all German
action," Heye stressed, adding that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
will set the campaign against far-right extremists a major task
after his summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's wife Doris Schroeder-Koepf will work for the
initiative together with a dozen sports, film and television stars,
said Heye.
</P>
<P>
German Jewish leaders, also appearing at the press conference
broadcast by the Pheonix television, called the recent increase of
neo-Nazi violence "serious" and "intolerable."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot allow a handful of criminals to destroy what have
been built up in the past 55 years," said Paul Spiegel, chairman
of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Facing a series of far-right violence and indications that
German far-rightists are expanding their influence, politicians of
both the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) and its conservative
opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Monday called on the
social courage to fight back.
</P>
<P>
Agela Merkel, chairwoman of the CDU, pledged more "
concentrated actions" in German youngsters against far-right
extremism, and said the government should totally prohibit neo-
Nazi demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much looking-away, too much fear.... We should
show our social courage," she told the ZDF television.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily said last weekend he
planned to deploy the elite Federal Border Protection police
forces to help local authorities cope with the far-right crimes.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Clement, SPD premier of Germany's most populous North
Rhine-Westphalia state, Monday vowed to ban hard-core far-right
groups such as the National Democratic Party (NPD).
</P>
<P>
The NPD's flagrant propaganda for anti-Semitism violence has
aroused widespread outrage. A special parliamentary committee will
launch investigations into the party and in a poll most law-
enforcement agents agree to prohibit it.
</P>
<P>
The Bild newspaper reported Monday there were 760 cases of far-
right offenses against 838 people during the first half of this
year, growing monthly by about 10 percent. Thirty-one cases were
convicted, and 96.3 percent of the suspects were freed.
</P>
<P>
Another report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper
said the far-right groups were using the Internet as their major
propaganda base.
</P>
<P>
An Internet domain name firm in Frankfurt said someone had
registered a web site named www.Heil-Hitler.de, offending the
ultimate taboo of post-war German society.
</P>
<P>
Just on Monday, two cases of crime suspected to be of neo-Nazi
background were reported. In Bavaria state, the police found a
bomb near a Jewish house and in Rhineland-Palatinate state, a
Jewish cemetery was found painted with Nazi swastikas.
</P>
<P>
In a poll released last weekend, some 89 percent of plain
Germans said the government was "incompetent" in fighting against
far-right extremism.

<HEADLINE> 21st Century To Be L. American Century: Mexican President-Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente
Fox has said the 21st century will be a Latin American century,
and proposed to strengthen the Organization of American States (
OAS) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
"In general we Latin Americans did not do too fine in the 20th
century," said Fox, referring to the continuos economic crisis in
the region, during an interview released Monday by the Venezuelan
newspaper "El Nacional."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced the 21st century will be a Latin American
century, for we have done already the democratic and political
corrections, and learned from the mistakes of neo-liberalism and
wrong economic processes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fox, winner in the July 2 elections, will be in office on
December 1 as Mexico's first president coming from the opposition
in 71 years.
</P>
<P>
The future head of state described Mexico, Brazil, Argentina
and Chile as the "development take-off engines for Latin America."
</P>
<P>
He said his government considers of utmost importance the
rapprochement of Mexico to South America and to the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Fox departed Sunday for South America on a trip that will take
him to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, where he will meet
with each country's leader.
</P>
<P>
He made a call for the revitalization of the OAS, "giving it a
great moral authority and a capacity to act that contribute to the
development of our nations."
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the IDB in "economic and capital terms"
will be a very powerful stabilizing factor for every Latin
American economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fox said he will be an "enthusiastic promoter of democracy in
Latin America" and regretted the "slow pace" at which negotiations
are moving for the establishment of the Free Trade Agreement of
the Americas (FTAA) in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Of Mexico, Fox said "we are for globalization" and about the
political conflict in the state of Chiapas, he said he will insist
in resuming negotiations with the rebel Zapatista Army of National
Liberation, which have been stranded for five years.

WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. air quality continues to
improve as six major pollutants have fallen remarkably over the
last decade, according to a new report released by the
Environmental Protection Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide improvement in air quality is as follows: carbon
dioxide concentrations down 36 percent; lead concentrations down
60 percent; nitrogen dioxide concentrations down 10 percent; smog
concentrations down 4 percent; and sulphur dioxide concentrations
down 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even with the improvement, 62 million Americans still live in
areas with unhealthy air, said the report, which was finished
after 10-years' measurements.
</P>
<P>
The EPA said air pollution remains a problem in many rural
areas and some national parks as well, and more steps are being
taken to improve air quality, such as controlling wind-blown smog,
requiring cleaner engines in cars and trucks and reducing the
sulphur in gasoline and diesel fuel.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Launch Project to Eliminate Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
to launch a major agricultural project to ensure recurrent food
shortages dogging the country are put to an end once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The planned project, to be undertaken in collaboration with the
World Bank, will focus on boosting productivity in the agriculture
sector, Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives William Kusila
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The food situation in the country is not satisfactory, but we
should not lose hope," said the minister in his address at a
public event celebrating the Peasants Day held in the eastern
Morogoro Region.
</P>
<P>
According to Kusila, the project is aimed at encouraging more
farmers to join savings and credit societies that will
recapitalize small scale farmers and enable them to purchase
expensive farm inputs such as fertilizer, pesticide and seeds.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was encouraged by the increase in the
number of credit and saving societies in the country from 728 last
year to 902 this year.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make a special appeal to more farmers to join
these societies because they are instrumental in eradicating
poverty," Kusila said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Tanzania is facing a grain deficit of some
662,876 tons in the year 2000/2001 because of a lower-than-
expected harvest in the just ended farming season.
</P>
<P>
Of the 88.6 million hectares of arable land in the eastern
African country, only about half is currently being exploited,
leaving millions of Tanzanians in a constant state of hunger.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Earns 13 Million U.S. Dollars From Coffee Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda earned 13.45 million U.S.
dollars from exports of 291,029 bags of coffee in July this year,
according to a monthly report available on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The monthly report released by Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) for July says that this earning represents an
increase of 9 percent from the 12.35 million dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
The report says, however, the volume and value fell by 14.9
percent and 38.1 percent respectively, compared with exports in
July of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, the total export since last October amounted to 2,
465,396 bags valued at 146.1 million dollars as compared with 3,
125,326 bags worth 250.5 million dollars in the previous
corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in volume is attributed to the prolonged dry
weather in the central and eastern regions of Uganda, and the
value decline was due to the falling coffee price on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export is a major foreign exchange earner of the east
Africa country, accounting for 60 percent of the country's total
foreign exchange earnings.

LUANDA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
office in Angola has cut down the number of people receiving
relief food in the northern province of Malange from 240,000 to
150,000 in order to concentrate its food aid on the most
vulnerable groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hans Vikoler, a WFP official in Malange, was quoted on Tuesday
by the official news agency Angop as saying that the decision,
backed by the Malange provincial government, allowed to increase
food ration for each of the most needy person.
</P>
<P>
He added that some 15,000 tons of foodstuffs were delivered
during the first six months of this year to Malange, capital city
of the province, and to the districts of Cacuso and Cangandala.
</P>
<P>
Vikoler said that the WFP's current reserve for the displaced
persons in the province is estimated at some 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Hans Vikoler considered as "positive" the WFP's assistance to
the community kitchens as the rate of children with malnutrition
in Malange has shrunk from 36 percent in August of 1999 to the
current 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malange is one of provinces that suffered most from the 26-year

by Jonas Savimbi, with most infrastructure destroyed and a large
number of residents displaced.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Urged to Settle on Route for Returning Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) Tuesday urged both Ethiopia and Eritrea to
agree on a common route to let people fleeing a two-year border
conflict between the two countries return home safely.
</P>
<P>
"We urge both governments to agree on a common routing for
future border crossings, and to invite the ICRC again to
participate, so as to continue to monitor the security of all
concerned," the ICRC office in Addis Ababa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean authorities reportedly organized the return of 567
Ethiopians at the end of July via the Mereb River, a border river
between Ethiopia and Eritrea, without the knowledge and
involvement of the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
"Among this group were pregnant women, little children and 39
psychiatric patients. These people had to wade through the Mereb
River, and at one point the water was up to their waist," the
statement said, adding some people died during the operations.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC also said that some 2,700 people, mainly women,
children and old people, were sent from a camp 65 kilometers north
of the Eritrean capital of Asmara on Wednesday, dropped off 40
kilometers from the front line, and had to walk for 18 hours
before they reached Ethiopian positions.
</P>
<P>
"These people were exposed to cold, rain, lack of food and
water as well as the danger of minefields," the ICRC statement
said, calling on Eritrea to "cease from this type of operation".
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea, who had been fighting each other over
border disputes since May 1998, signed the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement on June 18 to end their two-year border
conflict, which has left more than one million people displaced.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, some 10,000 Ethiopians and Eritreans
have returned home since the signing of the ceasefire agreement.

capital Bissau which was also attended by President Iala,
declaring that he considers himself as "consultant" of the
president in the future.
</P>
<P>
The military leader asked the generals and soldiers to be more
patient, because "it is impossible that the president resolves all
the problems related to the military". "We should have patience
and confidence in him," he said.

On his turn, the president promised that in one year from now,

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Southern Africa on Unfavorable Factors in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lack of resources, skills and
access to markets is affecting productivity in the farming sector,
representatives of smallholder farmers in the southern African
region said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were attending a four-day smallholder farmers conference
which started on Sunday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Malawian representative George Kanyamapiri said that
smallholder farmers did not have enough resources to purchase
inputs like crop seeds and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The problem in Malawi is being compounded by overproduction
especially of maize as this is not supported by favorable markets,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean representative Mutsa Chesi said lock of reliable
technology in Zimbabwe was affecting agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"The smallholder farming sector in Botswana is crippled by lack
of strong farmers' organization to represent them," said
Botswanian representative Edward Kemsley.

MEXICO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Health Secretary Jose
Antonio Gonzalez said on Monday that laws on abortion will prevail
in favor of women's health.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the controversy generated by the recent approval

even in the case of pregnancy produced after raping, Gonzalez said
he did not know why local legislators adopted such a step.

A number of feminist groups and legislators of the ruling

In Mexico, abortion is allowed in case of congenital

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC Summit Meeting Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Yue
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The two-day summit attended
by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of
state ended in Windhoek, Namibia, on Monday evening with fruitful
results.
</P>
<P>
The most remarkable achievement during the summit is to give a
green light for the revised SADC Free Trade Agreement to be
implemented on September 1.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol, initially agreed by SADC member countries
in 1996, envisages that 85 percent of intra-SADC trade will be
liberalized by 2008 and the remaining 15 percent will be tariff-
free by 2012.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the trade deal, South Africa and its partners in
Southern African Customs Union, namely Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho
and Swaziland, will open their markets faster than the rest of the
SADC.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, regarded as a significant drive towards economic
integration in the southern African region, will also enhance the
SADC's ability to attract foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
SADC, which was established in August 1992 on the basis of the
former Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference, now
has become a 14-nation regional bloc, including Angola, Botswana,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the DRC, Seychelles and Zambia will be temporarily
excluded from the trade agreement implementation group because
Angola, the DRC and Seychelles have yet to sign the trade
agreement while Zambia has signed but not ratified it.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC Executive Secretariat expressed the hope that
the four member states will be integrated into the free trade
agreement by January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders also joined the voice in calling on the
developed world to pay greater attention to the poor African
countries' heavy debt burden.
</P>
<P>
As outgoing SADC Chairman and Mozambican President Joachim
Chissano mentioned at the opening ceremony of the summit on Sunday
that five SADC member countries, namely Mozambique, Angola, Zambia,
Tanzania and Malawi, are facing acute debt problems.
</P>
<P>
"Improved economic prospects can only come into reality in the
SADC countries, in Africa and in the developing world at large if
the current economically debilitating debt is forgiven in its
totality," Chissano emphasized.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the SADC leaders also discussed the
deteriorating AIDS situation in southern Africa, the worst hit
region by the fatal disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed on a multi-sectoral approach to fight the
spread of the AIDS epidemic and reached a consensus that the
western pharmaceutical companies should offer cheaper anti-AIDS
drugs to SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants' discussion also centered on the conflict in
the DRC. It is notable that the SADC leaders' efforts to push
forward the peace process were shadowed by President of the DRC
Laurent Kabila's absence at the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC leaders still decided to hold a special
meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, on August 14 to discuss ways to end the
two-year conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the SADC heads of state also expressed their
full support for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's land reform.
</P>
<P>
The summit elected Namibian President Sam Nujoma as new
Chairman of the SADC.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Delays Recommendation on Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen announced here Monday that he would delay his recommendation
to President Clinton on whether to build the national missile
defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's assessment of how and when to move forward with
the system will take several weeks longer than planned, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
"A number of difficult issues remain to be resolved," Cohen
said in a brief written statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issues include whether the rocket booster to be used for
the antimissile system can be ready for full-scale production by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Another issue is whether the Pentagon should go ahead with the
next flight test of the antimissile system as scheduled for this
fall after the July 7 test failure.
</P>
<P>
"I will make no recommendation about the future of the NMD
program until I have analyzed their findings," Cohen said. "I
expect that to happen and to report to the president within the
next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Officials here said Cohen, who previously indicated that he
would make the recommendation by mid-August, is unlikely to do so
until early September.
</P>
<P>
The NMD system is widely opposed by the international community
including Russia and China as it might trigger a new round of
global arms race.

<P>
BOGOTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel National
Liberation Army (ELN) on Monday rejected the upcoming visit of U.S.
President Bill Clinton to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
ELN's second commander-in-chief Antonio Garcia said, "Clinton
is not welcome because he will not come in a disposition
Colombians have to look for peace. It seems more likely that he
will come with a contrary attitude -- to support military actions.
"
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to visit the Colombian city of Cartagena
on August 30 to meet his counterpart Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that Clinton will indicate his full
support for the Plan of Colombia, a strategy to fight drug
trafficking, eradicate illegal crops, seek peace with rebel groups,
strengthen democracy and reactivate the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Washington has already announced a 1.3-billion-dollar economic
and military aid package for the Plan.
</P>
<P>
The ELN and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
reject any kind of U.S. assistance, saying it will intensify the
conflict and cause an exodus of coca-leaf peasants to other
Colombian regions and neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended higher
Monday in hope that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest
rates any time soon because of the slowing U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 99.26 at 10,867.01,
reaching the highest level in nearly three months. The blue chip
index rose 61.17 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 75.63 at 3,862.
99, extending its gain of 27.48 points in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 16.39 at 1,479.32.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as investors continued to show interest in
technology stocks in hope that the slowing economy would prompt
the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged at the
August 22 meeting. The central bank has raised rates six times
since last summer in an effort to cool off the economy and keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
About 10 days ago, a report on a stronger-than-expected annual
growth of 5.2 percent in the second quarter ran against a majority
belief that the economy was cooling off after the six rate hikes.
The report hit the stock market after its release.
</P>
<P>
But a stew of the reports, including the July unemployment rate
last week, showed a fresh sign that the economy is slowing. The U.
S. Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate
held steady at 4 percent in July, showing that the tight job
market might be easing a bit.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment report relieved fears of more hikes in rates.
The new data pushed stocks higher last Friday and continued to
drive shares up today.
</P>
<P>
Among the stocks rising today were data networking company
Cisco Systems Inc, computer chip maker Intel Corp., software
company EMC and chip maker Texas Instruments.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 5.73 at 663.52 and the American stock
Exchange index rose 7.49 at 915.46. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 6.26 at 509.87.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange with 1,717 up, 1,156 down and 484
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 850.44 million shares from 943.74
million in the previous session.

of Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of state
ended in Windhoek, Namibia, late on Monday with agreements on a

civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting decided that the long-awaited SADC free
trade agreement is set to be implemented on September 1 after a
final version was approved by the SADC leaders.
</P>
<P>
They agreed, in the absence of President of the DRC Laurent

<HEADLINE> Ruling Delayed on Northern Irish Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland Parades
Commission Monday delayed a ruling on Saturday's proposed march by
the Protestant Apprentice Boys through a nationalist area in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The Apprentice Boys want to march along the lower Ormeau Road
before traveling to Northern Irish city of Londonderry, for the
group's annual parade marking the 1689 relief of the city from a
siege by the forces of the Catholic King James II.
</P>
<P>
The commission delayed its decision, which was expected on
Monday, until Wednesday because the body has received further
representations.
</P>
<P>
The commission has also delayed a ruling on the main parade in
Derry, as talks between the Apprentice Boys and the nationalist
Bogside Residents' Group are due to continue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission said: "We have received
representations in the last 24 hours. The position is being very
carefully assessed but there will be no determination before
Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
Nationalist residents of the lower Ormeau Road are objecting to
the loyal order parade going through the area.
</P>
<P>
However, there were scuffles and minor injuries on the Ormeau
Road after nationalists attempted to block the route of the parade.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Lower Ormeau Concerned Community group,
Gerard Rice, said he remained optimistic that this Saturday's
event would be restricted.
</P>
<P>
"We're not surprised the decision was delayed," he said. "But
we would be absolutely shocked and dismayed if the parade was
allowed to go ahead."
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Apprentice Boys and the nationalist Bogside
Residents' Group in Derry have so far failed to reach agreement
over Saturday's parade in the city.
</P>
<P>
The main area of contention involves the so-called feeder
parade along the lower Ormeau Road, where in a ballot last week,
90 percent of residents who voted remained opposed to loyal order
parades.
</P>
<P>
Both the Bogside residents and Apprentice Boys have said they
want to find agreement, but the residents' group has said its
response to the main Apprentice Boys parade in Derry will be
dictated by what happens on the lower Ormeau Road.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland Parades Commission was established in 1997
to determine whether conditions should be placed on contentious
parades in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> ALADI to Analyze Integration Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers of
the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) will analyze
the region's integration process in light of world economic
globalization when commemorating the 12th anniversary of the
creation of this organization, ALADI Secretary-General Juan F.
Rojas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from member countries will hold a meeting here
on August 11, at which Uruguayan President Jorge Batlle will
deliver a speech and final documents will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Latin America must find new ways to integrate
itself with economic globalization, especially defining new lines
of action for sustainable integration.
</P>
<P>
According to Rojas, economic crisis affecting the world economy
in 1998 had a growing impact on Latin America in 1999 and affected
the integration process in the region.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in a historical fall of 20 percent in inter-
regional trade, less progress in regional trade negotiations and
fewer new free trade accords.
</P>
<P>
Despite these problems, Rojas said, exports of member countries
to the rest of the world in 1999 posted a record high of 253.4
billion dollars, up 21.5 percent over the 1998 level.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Voices Support for Zimbabwean Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) on Monday expressed its full support
for Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and his controversial land
reform program and urged Britain to provide recourse.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that to have a land reform program which is
fair and just to all the stakeholders, it is imperative for the
United Kingdom government to honor its obligations under the
Lancaster House agreement to provide recourse for that purpose,"
said a statement issued at the end of SADC's two-day summit in the
Namibian capital of Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
The statement said SADC leaders had delegated South African
President Thabo Mbeki and Malawian President Bakili Muluzi to make
representations to Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler, on
behalf of the region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe said it wants to resettle some 500,000 families on 5
million hectares of land, most of which are white-owned farms
before the rainy season begins in October.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe claimed that the British government reneged on a pledge
to provide funding for the program, as stipulated in the Lancaster
House agreement. This became the central issue in his country's
recent general elections after war veterans occupied white-owned
farms.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between Mbeki and Mugabe in Zimbabwe last week,
officials said South Africa would help Zimbabwe restore its
battered image and would take steps to stabilize its economy.
</P>
<P>
The SADC heads of state said they were disappointed by the "
partisan and biased manner" in which a sector of the international
media had misrepresented Zimbabwe's land policy.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the policy sought to effect a just and
equitable redistribution of land in a situation where 1 percent of
the population owned over 70 percent of the best arable land.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate our acceptance of the urgent need to effect land
redistribution in Zimbabwe to address land hunger and poverty
affecting millions of black Zimbabweans," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC leaders said they were greatly concerned about the
Zimbabwe Democracy Act passed by the United States Senate in June,
which it said sought to prescribe to Zimbabwe a land reform and
political dispensation "as prescribed by the U.S. Senate".
</P>
<P>
The statement said the bill sought to authorize the U.S.
president to support opponents of the Zimbabwe government,
including financing propaganda activities against Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We further note, with concern, that the bill also aims to
subvert Zimbabwe's economic foundation by prohibiting assistance
or debt relief from being extended to Zimbabwe by the U.S. and by
any international financial institutions to which the U.S. is a
member," it said.
</P>
<P>
This punitive piece of legislation was counter-productive and
unjust, and it was regrettable that it was being proposed at a
time when Zimbabwe was involved in a challenging economic recovery
program, and when SADC was trying to deepen the integration
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The bill will be a major setback in our community-building
efforts. We therefore urge the U.S. Congress to reconsider its
policy and withdraw the bill before it is passed into law," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the SADC leaders had directed the foreign ministers

<HEADLINE> Britain to Summon Yugoslav Diplomat Over Arrests of Britons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday that it
would summon the Yugoslav representative in London to demand an
explanation for the detention of two Britons arrested in
Yugoslavia last week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz said he was to call the
Yugoslav representative again to require a full explanation.
</P>
<P>
"I shall be calling the head of the Yugoslav interests section
again to see me in London to get a full explanation," Vaz told BBC
radio.
</P>
<P>
Vaz said Britain had not been officially informed of the
charges, or even been formally notified of their detention, after
the two Britons were arrested last week together with two
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely important that the (Yugoslav) regime
understands that we take this issue very seriously indeed," Vaz
said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav representative was summoned last week shortly
after the men were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Britain said the two Britons are policemen helping to train
police force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav army said on Monday it would bring terrorism
charges against the four detained last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A criminal case will be launched against two British officers
and two Canadians arrested by the Yugoslav army...since the
investigation so far confirmed they committed the criminal act of
terrorism," a Yugoslav army spokesman reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Vaz insisted that the men were in Yugoslavia for a holiday.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain would continue to press for "simple, basic
information" from Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia broke off formal diplomatic ties with Britain in
1999 when British aircraft joined NATO bombing raids on Yugoslavia
to force it to withdraw its troops from the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are represented by "interest sections"
attached to the embassies of other nations in London and Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Outraged Over Venezuelan President's Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States was outraged
Monday over Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's decision to visit
Iraq in his 10-nation tour of oil exporting nations.
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard for us to understand... given that Iraq
continues to flout its international obligations," State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Boucher said Venezuela should remember that it is a U.N. member,
which has an obligation to obey U.N. resolutions and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
"It's Venezuela's obligation... to observe all the Security
Council resolutions regarding Iraq and the sanctions regime," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez left Sunday on his nine-day visit aimed at broadening
cooperation among the members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
He said before leaving for his first stop in Saudi Arabia that
he would use the trip to "outline the need for us to make far
greater advancements in oil-related development."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that his key objective of the tour is to invite
personally OPEC members to attend the oil cartel's September
summit in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The countries Chavez will visit are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria
and Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Denies Colombian Rebel Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Raul Reyes, has not
officially "entered into Costa Rica," said Costa Rican Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Vilma Ibarra Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are no entrance records, neither with his war name, nor
with his official name, said the spokeswoman, in reference to a
report coming from Colombia, in which it was said that Reyes would
have traveled to the country last weekend to meet with the
political leader and former Colombian minister, Alvaro Leyva.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry sources said that Leyva himself, who has been
living in Costa Rica since July 1998, would be out of the country
in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Leyva has played a key role in peace negotiations in Colombia
and his presence is required quite often as a mediator in the
current peace process taking place in his country, but has kept a
total secret towards the press during this period.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas reiterated that
there is no impediment for Reyes or any other Colombian guerrilla
leader to carry out peace conversations here, as long as it is
with the approval of the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
Rojas has offered Costa Rica's territory for future
negotiations between government and guerrilla representatives. As
a matter of fact, there is already a meeting on schedule here
between sectors of the Colombian civil society before the end of
the year to analyze the situation in their country.

troops," Rwandan army chief of staff Kayumba Nyamwasa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rest of over 1,000 Rwandan army in the DRC
will return home as long as Rwanda's security is assured.
</P>

He emphasized that security is the only reason for Rwandan
troops presence in the DRC, adding that Rwanda can not presently

President of the DRC Laurent Kabila have intentions to cause
insecurity in Rwanda.

Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdrew from Kisangani last month
after three armed clashes in the city leaving many soldiers and
civilians dead and wounded.
