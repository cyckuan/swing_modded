<HEADLINE> HKSAR Government Backs Report on Quality Education: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Education and Manpower
Secretary Joseph W.P. Wong of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) government said today that the government supports
the Report of the Education Commission (EC) on Quality School
Education.
</P>
<P>
Expressing gratitude to the EC of the government for drawing up
wide-ranging recommendations after a thorough study of the issue,
Wong said, "The government supports the main thrust of the
report, which is to devolve more authority and responsibility to
schools and promote bottom-up initiatives for the school sector."
</P>
<P>
"The government will announce its decisions on the subject as
soon as possible," Wong told reporters, right after EC Chairman
Rosie Young announced the release of the report at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the news conference on the release of the report,
Young said the EC has fully considered the public views collected
during the consultation from November 1996 to January 1997 in
finalizing its recommendations in the report.
</P>
<P>
The report "focuses on ways to improve school management and
performance toward the provision of quality school education to
better meet the needs of students," Young said.
</P>
<P>
Young stressed that educational aims should be translated into
quality indicators, to be developed by schools with assistance
from the government's Education Department.
</P>
<P>
"To effectively enhance the quality of school education, a
quality assurance mechanism should be put in place. We welcome the
Education Department's plan to adopt a 'whole-school' approach to
quality assurance inspection, and recommend that quality
assurance within schools should be achieved through school-based
management, self-evaluation, and cooperation between schools and
parents," Young said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that all schools should practice school-based
management by the year 2000, Young said: "I urge the government to
accept the recommendations of the report and set aside adequate
resources for implementation."

NEW YORK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T, the No. 1
telecommunication company in the U.S., is looking for a partner,
under the pressure of WorldCom's bid for MCI, U.S. newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the WorldCom, the fourth largest telecommunication
company, offered to buy MCI, the second largest, with 30 billion
U.S. dollars. The combination, if made possible, would create a
threat to AT&AMP;T and also intensify market competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, At&AMP;T is in talks with several
companies, including GTE.
</P>
<P>
The report said that AT&AMP;T is trying to find an alliance that
would ensure its dominance in telecommunications. Other possible
partners include Sprint, U.S. West, Teleport Communications Group
and Intermedia. But all of these declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
GTE has a local phone business in 28 states and a new
long-distance unit that has won 1 million customers. GTE has a
close relationship with AT&AMP;T, it was reported, and its chief
executive, Chuck Lee, could also succeed Bob Allen at AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Exchange To Play Active Role in China's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong will perform a uniquely important role in the economic
development of China, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Donald Tsang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception to mark the stock exchange's 11th
anniversary, Tsang said that in addition to playing a pivotal role
in the international financial market, the stock exchange has
also become the most important fund raising center for
enterprises from China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Chairman Edgar Cheng of the stock exchange as saying
a few days ago that with the liquidity and robust infrastructure
of the market, Hong Kong can play a leading role as the primary
market for inland companies to access international capital.
</P>
<P>
Tsang described a seminar held two months ago in Chengdu,
southwest China, to introduce the capital raising opportunities in
Hong Kong as a "big success."
</P>
<P>
The seminar, jointly organized by the stock exchange, the
Securities and Futures Commission and the Trade Development
Council, was attended by more than 300 officials, entrepreneurs
and market professionals from China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary spoke highly of what the stock exchange
has achieved this year, which he described as a "remarkable" year
in its history.
</P>
<P>
As at the end of July, the stock exchange was rated the sixth
largest exchange in the world with a total market capitalization
of over 4.3 trillion HK dollars (550 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in market capitalization was almost 60 percent
over the previous year, which is the highest among the major
exchanges all around the world, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange also dedicates itself to providing investors
with the best and most professional services, he added. "Your
achievement in this respect has been obvious. The way our market
has met the challenges and volatility provoked by the currency
crisis in our neighboring markets in the last couple of months
speaks for itself," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also commended the stock exchange's efforts in developing
new financial products and markets and educating investors.
</P>
<P>
in his speech, Edgar Cheng, who will be stepping down soon from
the chairmanship of the stock exchange after three years in the
position, pledged that the stock exchange will continue to support
the transformation of the economy and infrastructure in China's
interior areas.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, Chief Executive Alec Tsui
of the stock exchange revealed that the stock exchange had an
average daily turnover of 16.37 billion HK dollars (2.1 billion
U.S. dollars) for the first three quarters of this year, 238
percent higher over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
And the stock exchange is making steps to double the current
trading capacity to 100 billion HK dollars (12.8 billion
U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
It is also considering setting up a second-board market for
small and medium-sized companies as a recent survey showed
profound interest in such a market.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, the barometer of the stock exchange, rose
26 percent from 11,902 points in September 1996 to 15,049 points
in September this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, India Sign Three Cooperation Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and India today
signed three cooperation agreements in geology and mineral resources,
tourism, and science and technology, South African media
reported.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela and Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral presided over the signing ceremony in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Under the tourism agreement, the two governments will establish
tourist offices in each other's countries, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Both countries are eager to boost their tourist industries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said at the end of September that the contribution of
tourism to South Africa's economy could be doubled from its present
4.5 percent and it had a potential to create hundreds of thousands of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
South African Tourism Minister Pallo Jordan said that tourism could
generate 40 billion Rand (8.5 billion U.S. dollars) annually and
create 2 million jobs if its contribution to the GDP were raised to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
India is no less enthusiastic in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has been developing tourism in an organized
manner since 1992 and has an ambitious program to develop tourism
through the use of incentives and the building of tourist-related
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also trying to cooperate in the field of
defense, including the joint development of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The accords signed today were seen as part of the Indo-South
African "strategic partnership" formalized in the Red Fort Declaration
signed by Mandela and then Indian prime minister Deve Gowda in
March, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are leading the Indian Ocean Rim Alliance for
Regional Cooperation and both are members of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM).
</P>
<P>
Mandela said after talks with Gujral that the two countries were
members of many world bodies and should cooperate and speak with one
voice in these forums.
</P>
<P>
Gujral, who is in South Africa for a visit, is scheduled to address
South African parliament this afternoon, and later he will attend a
banquet in honor of him hosted by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Gujral's visit to South Africa, the first by an Indian prime
minister, was given special significance because this year is the 50th
anniversary of India's indenpendence.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations developed quickly after India lifted sanctions
against former South Africa's all-white government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade grew to more than 600 million dollars in 1996 from
1993's 80 million.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said Monday that trade between the two countries could reach
2 billion dollars by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Specifies Areas of Cooperation With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral today specified fields of cooperation with
South Africa, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Time has come for the two countries to build "a rapidly
growing super structure of cooperation," Gujral told South
African parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said India can profit from South Africa's skills and
technology in the fields of mining and infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
India, in turn, can be of special help in the development of
small scale industries, the housing sector, human resource
development, employment-generation programs and in science and
technology as well.
</P>
<P>
A second area of great importance, he said, was the
strengthening of joint endeavors in regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We see South Africa as a bridgehead into the markets of
southern Africa and we can play the same role for your country as
a spring board into South Asia and beyond," Gujral told South
African parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to play a definitive role in
strengthening the Indian Ocean rim cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries head the Indian Ocean Rim Alliance for
Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater cooperation between the two
countries in world forums such as the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the NAM is still necessary to address problems facing
the developing world.
</P>
<P>
On United Nations reform, Gujral said both countries have an
important responsibility to help reform the global organization,
especially its Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the two leaders presided over the signing of
three agreements in geology and mining resources, tourism, and
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Indo-South African relations saw rapid development in recent
years. The two countries agreed to establish a "strategic
partnership" in the Red Ford Declaration signed by Mandela and
then Indian prime minister Deve Gowda during Mandela's visit to
India in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade grew to over 600 million U.S. Dollars last
year from some 80 million U.S. Dollars in 1993. Gujral predicted
that the figure could reach one billion by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Gujral's visit to South Africa, which is the first by an
Indian prime minister, was given special significance because
this year is also the 50th anniversary of India's independence
from Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lithuanian Foreign
Minister Algirdas Saudargas said here today that his country's
efforts to enter NATO do not contradict with its friendship with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Saudargas, who arrived here Monday, made the remarks at a
joint press conference after holding talks with his Hungarian
counterpart Kovacs Laszlo.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's geo-political situation is similar to that of
Poland, he said, adding that his country can not fully understand
Russia's worries about the Lithuanian intention to join the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The NATO summit held in Madrid in July decided to invite
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia has been strongly opposing NATO's eastward
expansion, saying the expansion is a threat to Russia's security
and is likely to stir up a fresh confrontation.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Saudargas also called on the European
Union (EU) to send officials to Lithuania for an on-the-spot
investigation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the EU will decide at its December meeting to
invite Lithuania to join the union.
</P>
<P>
Laszlo said on the same occasion that Hungary is willing to
share its experience with Lithuania in its application for the
NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Farmers Complain of Levies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers this
year forked out over 430 million Zimbabwe Dollars (34 million
U.S. Dollars) to the government under the controversial 10
percent levy on them, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said
today.
</P>
<P>
The levy has brought a heavy burden to growers and merchants
of the golden leaf, added the CFU.
</P>
<P>
CFU Director David Hasluck said heavy rains during the 1996/97
season meant that both tobacco output and revenue were lower than
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
"The amount paid by farmers this year in tobacco levies is
about 438 million Zimbabwe Dollars which, however, has pulled
most large scale commercial farmers deeper into debt," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Initial crop estimates put this year's flue-cured tobacco
output at 205 million Kilograms, but heavy rains experienced
during the early part of the year saw production tumbling to 186
million KG, earning the country about five billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (400 million U.S. Dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The levy, shared equally between growers and merchants, was
introduced in July last year under heavy protests from the
large-scale farming community.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is Zimbabwe's biggest foreign currency earner.

<P>
HARARE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-powered business
delegation from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is in
Zimbabwe on a trade and investment mission.
</P>
<P>
Native Investments Africa Group, a consortium of Zimbabwe's
indigenous business people which is hosting the Congolese
delegation, said in a statement today the two sides will sign a
government to government commercial agreement which is set to
open up trade between the two countries and is ready for the
signing of a 15 million U.S. Dollars line of credit.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese, who arrived on Sunday and will leave on Friday,

services and to identify potential partners in the economic
development of their country ravaged by several years of plunder
by former president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>

"There are plenty of advantages for Zimbabwe, from foreign
exchange earnings, employment creation, technology transfer,
barter to culture," said President of Native Investments Africa
Group Philip Chiyangwa.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 46 million people, mineral-rich DRC,

<HEADLINE> GCC to Launch Military Cooperation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) members said in Doha, Qatar today that they will
launch two military cooperation projects in "a very near future."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued to reporters after the 15th annual meeting
of the GCC chiefs of staff said the projects are aimed at
"tightening (military) cooperation and communications safety."
</P>
<P>
No details about the two projects were given. However, the
military leaders said the projects were initiated "a long time
ago" but kept hanged up.
</P>
<P>
"They are very important projects in the framework of the
(GCC) military cooperation process. It is the outcome of old
studies which just yielded fruits at this meeting," General al
Raken Hamad bin Ali al Atuiya, Qatar's Chief of Staff said
in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting took place in coincidence with a joint GCC
naval exercises off the coast of Bahrain which started on Saturday
and lasts for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari news agency said that during the meeting, the GCC
chiefs of staff discussed the latest developments in the region,
but they declined to to make public comments.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed issues related to regional security, but we
would not talked about the political matters because they should
be left to politicians," Atuiya said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Qatari general said "The GCC members would jointly
face any kind of threat to them."
</P>
<P>
He also added that the GCC states always "attach great
importance to developing their armed forces."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he and other GCC chiefs of staff have agreed
to hold joint air exercises, but said they have not decided
whether foreign participation should be invited.
</P>
<P>
"This thing will be submitted to (GCC) defense ministers. They
will make decisions. We just agreed to hold the exercises and
intensify them," said Atuiya.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and military alliance, was set
up in 1980. It groups Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman
and the UAE. They also set up a collective troops named Peninsula
Shield in the early 1990 as a major step to boost military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, due to relatively limited human resources, the GCC
countries still remained seriously reliant on a large foreign
presence, particularly that of the U.S. and its western allies
to protect their security.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Journalists Protest Media Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Journalists in Swaziland
today marched to the prime minister's office in Mbabane to
protest against a media control bill approved by the government,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Information and Broadcasting Minister Muntu Mswane had
drafted the bill after complaints in parliament of a lack of
professionalism in the local media, and of "irresponsbile and
sensational" reporting.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which was approved recently by the government and
soon to be tabled in parliament, stipulates that journalists
found to have committed a serious breach could be ordered to
issue a retraction, publish an apology or be deregistered,
said South African press reports.
</P>
<P>
Journalists who fail to comply could then face a fine of up to
15,000 Rand (3,200 U.S, Dollars) or five years' imprisonment and
the publication a fine of up to 100,000 Rand (21,000 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
President of the Swaziland National Association of Journalists
Mbuso Mkhatjwa read a statement, demanding the immediate
withdrawal of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Journalists in Swaziland believed there is a need for more
responsible reporting but through self-censorship and that
guidelines should be drawn by the media houses themselves in
consultation with the government, Mkhatjwa said.

<HEADLINE> France to Try Former Vichy Official for Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- France will put on trial Wednesday
a former Gaullist minister and senior official under the Vichy
collaboration regime during World War II, Maurice Papon, for the
arrest and deportation of some 1,500 Jews from 1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
This will be the last trial of a Frenchman for crimes against
humanity, after two other historic trials were staged by France
against the former Gestapo chief of Lyon, Klaus Barbie, in 1987,
and against former Lyon militiamen chief Paul Touvier in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Both Barbie and Touvier were convicted of crimes against
humanity and were given life imprisonment sentences. Both of them
had died.
</P>
<P>
Except the extreme-right National Front, nearly all French
political parties welcomed the decision made by a court in
Bordeaux, capital of the Prefecture of Gironde, where Papon served
as secretary general during the war under the Vichy regime.
</P>
<P>
Papon was sent to a prison in Bordeaux today from his home in
Gretz-Armainvilliers outside Paris on the eve of the first day of
his trial.
</P>
<P>
The 87-year-old former Vichy official, who later served as
cabinet minister and Paris police chief under President Charles de
Gaulle and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, issued a defiant
statement calling his trial "an until now prefabricated trial "
and "unworthy sham of a state of law."
</P>
<P>
He called on the judges to work with "independence and
impartiality" over his case, and denounced the French government
for trying to "illustrate and confirm the preferred official
declarations on `a guilty France'" based on its collaboration
with Nazi Germany during World War II.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to a declaration made in 1995 by
President Jacques Chirac, who officially recognized for the first
time since the end of the war that France made a "collective
fault" by deporting 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, said that the French
nation or the French republic had not participated in what he
called "the sad adventure of the Vichy government" and therefore
should not be held responsible for the deportation of Jews.
</P>
<P>
"The France of depth should pull itself together so that I
could face an independent and impartial justice," said Papon.
</P>
<P>
Former Gaullist Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has warned
against making Papon into a "scapegoat" for the Vichy period,
while the president of the National Front Jean-Marie Le Pen
described the trial as "absolutely absurd."

<HEADLINE> China on Course for Sustainable Growth: HSBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's economic expansion
remained firm in the second quarter driven by strong growth in
exports, said the Global Outlook quarterly of HSBC Group.
</P>
<P>
Real GDP growth in the first half was 9.5 percent and aggregate
demand is expected to remain strong in the second half on the back
of slower, but still strong, net export growth and strong
underlying investment demand, it added.
</P>
<P>
On its research paper "On Course For Sustainable Growth"
published today, HSBC said China's inflation fell to a six-year
low in the second quarter with disinflation now appearing in
several sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that coupled with still strong economic
growth, however, disinflation in China is simply a healthy
adjustment to previous over-expansion and not an indication of an
imminent recession.
</P>
<P>
It expected that with the Chinese government sticking to its
tight monetary policy, inflation was 3.9 percent in the first half
and should average 4.0 percent for 1997, down from 8.3 percent in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Israel Frees 9 Jordanian Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of 23 Jordanians detained
in Israeli jails have been released as the result of Jordanian
King Hussein's recent mediation, according to a Jordanian
government official.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 14 Jordanian prisoners were expected to be set
free soon, said Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe' here today after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The king's intervention also secured the release of a large
number of Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, including some
members of the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein raised the demand for Israel to release Hamas leader
Shiekh Ahmad Yassin, as well as Jordanian and Palestinian
detainees during a public gathering a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel then met the demand after Jordan promised to set free
two Israeli agents caught in their September 25 attack on Khaled
Mashaal, head of Hamas political bureau, here.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Minister of
Administrative Development Abdullah Ensour Monday (October 6)
admitted that the releases were the results of "a good bargain"
between Jordan and Israel, which benefited all the sides concerned
including Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. The movement has conducted a series of
anti-Israeli attacks since 1994, with many of its leading figures
staying in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is
now one of the only two Arab countries that conceived peace with

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Military Accused of Using Nerve Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone was today accused of attacking the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) with nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops, who are carrying out an economic embargo on
Sierra Leone as mandated by sub-regional leaders, were receiving
instructions on how to survive the gas, Nigeria's defense
spokesman Godwin Ugbo said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I learned they are educating our our troops on how to
overcome the effect of the gas," he said, restating that ECOMOG,
led by Nigeria, was not in Sierra Leone to fight.
</P>
<P>
Nerve gas is a kind of biological weapon used in warefare to
make the emeny weak, dizzy and worn-out. It was used during the
Gulf War and many veterans are currently suffering its effects.
</P>
<P>
The acting director of defense information also dismissed
allegations that ECOMOG was attacking the junta positions with
Scud missiles, A Soviet-made long-range weapon used by Iraqi
forces during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian does not have such a weapon and no country in the
sub-region has it," Ugbo said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that ships coming to dock in the Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown would continue to be searched by ECOMOG forces,
except those carrying food and medical supplies.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Benz to Switch to Euro in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's largest industrial group
Daimler-Benz AG announced today that it has decided to introduce
the single European currency, the Euro, as its "corporate
currency" from January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made today by the board of management of
Daimler-Benz, the Euro will replace the German mark as the
company's standard monetary unit for all relevant business
transactions from January 1, 1999, the start-up date of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The board also decided that the company's business results for
the first half of 1999 are to be drawn up in the Euro. Its
customers will also be able to choose Euro or their national
currency to pay their bills on a voluntary basis during the
transition period of the Euro from 1999 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision is basically a signal for our customers,
suppliers and partners in industry and public administration that
we see a tremendous chance both for Europe and our group in the
European Monetary Union," said Daimler-Benz Chairman Juergen
Schrempp.
</P>
<P>
Under the Euro timetable, the conversion to the single currency
will not be compulsory in its member states until January 2002,
when the Euro banknotes and coins are officially introduced after
a three-year transition period during which the Euro will only be
used in cashless transactions.
</P>
<P>
By deciding to convert to the Euro as early as January 1999,
Daimler-Benz is one of the first German companies to take such a
step at this early stage.
</P>
<P>
Daimler-Benz Chief Financial Officer Manfred Gentz estimated
the company's costs for the currency conversion at about 200
million marks (114 million U.S. dollars), with more than half of
the money used for the requisite adjustments to data processing
within the group.
</P>
<P>
However, the Euro introduction will also cut the company's
currency exposure by about 30 percent, thus largely eliminating
performance risks from unforeseeable exchange-rate fluctuation,
Gentz said.
</P>
<P>
"This would yield greater security for corporate planning, in
turn considerably enhancing the operating conditions for the
individual business units," Gentz added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks to Curb Periodic Fires on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is designing
strategic plans to curb periodic fire outbreaks on the
Kilimanjaro mountain, the highest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Chairman of the National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC) Reginald Mengi during his five-hour
tour to fire-ravaged moor land area standing at an altitude of
about 3,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Mengi was accompanied by three officials with the council and
journalists during his tour on Monday to the mountain, in
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, the official declined to give details of the proposed
plans, saying that NEMC will present the proposal to the
vice-president, Omar Ali Juma for endorsement before they were
made public for implementation.
</P>
<P>
It was earlier reported that the fire which erupted on
September 3 has allegedly destroyed over 10,000 hectares of
forest. But NEMC officials and reporters found that the figures
were exaggerated, which created unnecessary fear among tourists
who had planned to scale the 5,895-meter-high mountain.
</P>
<P>
Mengi called on Kilimanjaro National Park Management to
compile correct data on fire disasters so that true information
can be disseminated to the people and visitors to the country.
</P>
<P>
He also urged journalists to assess and verify the size of
forest areas alleged to have been ravaged by fire instead of
being spoon fed by the park management personnel whose data and
figures were sometimes conflicting and misleading.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said 500 to 5,000 hectares were affected by the
inferno.
</P>
<P>
The NEMC chairman also lashed out at some villagers in the
mountain who assumed a nonchalant attitude toward the fire. He
said that since fire outbreaks pose as a common enemy, local
villagers, like other people, were bound to extinguish it to
demonstrate patriotism.
</P>
<P>
They are not expected to stay aloof, hoping the government to
do the job, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Joins in 19 Peace-keeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has contributed forces to
19 peace-keeping operations throughout the world since its
independence in 1960, a National War College provost said today.
</P>
<P>
The country also provided 12 force/field commanders and chief
military observers during the period, said retired Maj.-Gen.
Charles Ndiomu, provost of the college's center for peace,
research and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, of the nine distinguished African generals ever
entrusted with the overall command of U.N.-peace keeping
operations, four were supplied by Nigeria," Ndiomu said at a
lecture in the capital Abuja, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, Nigerian peace keepers have
been sent on missions in a number of countries and regions,
including the former Yugoslavia, Angola, Western Sahara,
Cambodia, the Gulf, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Describing Nigeria as a credible peace-keeping nation, the
provost called on the international community to devise
appropriate strategies to cope with the resurgent of ethnic,
social, cultural and linguistic conflicts which threaten
international peace.
</P>
<P>
Other dangers that need to be addressed included disparities,
intolerance, human rights violation, the proliferation of weapons
and other forces of disintegration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndiomu also urged the international community to carry out
serious, in-depth, systematic and sustained studies in the area
of conflict and peace so as to work out the strategies.

countries all over the world.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Breaking the nearly
seven-month long deadlock in the peace process, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators finally sat down today to resume the
negotiations on implementing the signed peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the peace talks was the result of the
intensive mediation efforts launched by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and special peace envoy Dennis Ross who
presided over the meeting Monday night between Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and deputy head of Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
Levy and Mazen decided to reactivate the nine joint committees
created after the signing of the Hebron redeployment deal last
January on implementing the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed their commitments to the signed accords,
and expressed their desire to advance the peace process through
conducting negotiations and the common fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The seven-month deadlock, caused by Israel's start of building
the controversial Har Homa settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
last March, has led to increased tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
And the July 30 twin suicide bombings in the Mahane Yehuda
market and September 4 triple bombings in the Ben Yehuda
pedestrian mall in central Jerusalem, both claimed by the
militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), dealt further blows
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In its tough reaction, Israel imposed draconian sanctions
against the Palestinians, including a total closure of the
self-rule areas, a ban on the entry of Palestinian workers into
Israel and a freeze on transferring tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
The PNA denounced the sanctions as a form of collective
punishment against the whole Palestinian people, thus demanding
an end to the sanctions before resuming security cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insisted that the lifting of sanctions and
resumption of peace talks should be conditional on the PNA's real
actions to resume security cooperation with Israel and to crack
down on Hamas and other militant groups.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Ben Yehuda bombings, the Israeli government
decided to freeze the Oslo process by halting handing over more
land to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
To avoid further deteriorating of the situation, the
U.S. government intervened by trying to bridge the differences
between the two sides. In early August, Ross traveled to the
region to pave the way for the first Middle East trip by Albright
in early September.
</P>
<P>
Although Albright's visit failed to achieve a breakthrough in
breaking the peace deadlock, it did help ease the tension by
hearing complaints from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Her visit also led to the series of top-level meetings between
senior Israeli and Palestinian officials in the United States,
during which the two sides agreed in principle to return to the
negotiating table.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Top on the agenda of the
renewed negotiations are the implementation of the rest of the
Interim Agreement, primarily the opening of safe passages between
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the accelerated construction of
Gaza seaport and Gaza airport, and Israel's implementation of
further troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Despite the renewal of peace talks, outstanding obstacles
remain unresolved between Israel and the PNA in pushing forward
the peace process so to proceed onto the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Technically, it is expected to take time for the two sides to
overcome the dispute on security arrangements in the Gaza airport
and seaport. Israel hopes to execute security control over the
two ports in order to prevent the smuggling of weapons that could
threaten its security.
</P>
<P>
As for the implementation of further Israeli troop
redeployments, huge gap still exists between the two sides over
the scope of pullouts. Israel only agrees to relinquish about 40
percent of the West Bank after completing all the pullouts, but
the PNA hopes to gain over 80 percent of land on which it wants
to create a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Note for Record attached to the Hebron agreement,
Israel should have completed the first of the three-stage
pullouts by March 7, but it has been delayed due to the PNA's
refusal to accept the 9 percent scope set unilaterally by
Israel. And the second phase of redeployment has also been
indefinitely postponed due to the freeze of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the leading obstacle blocking the peace process will
be the lack of trust and confidence, which have been destroyed by
the bloodshed in late September last year and by Israel's
continued settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision in September last year to open an
archaeological tunnel near the Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest
Islamic shrine in Jerusalem, led to days of bloody clashs between
the Palestinians and the Israeli forces, in which over 70 were
killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
To rebuild the trust and confidence, both sides should
refrain from making further unilateral steps in preempting the
negotiations in the final status talks. But, unfortunately, there
has been no signs so far from the Israeli government on showing
flexibility to make compromise on the issue of expanding
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Albright has already urged Israel to create a favorable
environment to rebuild mutual trust and confidence by agreeing to
accept the time-out of its settlement activities. In the days to
come, the definition of so-called time-out will dominate the
talks.
</P>
<P>
In view of the political reality within the hardline Likud
government, which consists of some hardcore rightists insisting
on Israel's claim to all the occupied land, it will be very
difficult for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make
compromise on the settlement issues.
</P>
<P>
And the common worry amounts to be that the Israeli
intransigency, combined with prolonged lack of progress in future
peace talks, will likely lead to another circle of tension and
violence.

<HEADLINE> Israel Frees 9 Jordanian Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of 23 Jordanians detained
in Israeli jails have been released to put Jordanian-Israeli
relations back on normal track, said a senior Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 14 Jordanian prisoners were expected to be set
free soon thanks to Jordanian King Hussein's mediation, said
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe' here today
after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel now has pledged to Jordan to abide by all the provisions
in the peace treaty it signed with the kingdom, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations went strained since Israeli spies'
attack on Khaled Mashaal, head of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) political bureau, here on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Hussein raised the demand for Israel to release Hamas leader
Shiekh Ahmad Yassin, as well as Jordanian and Palestinian
detainees during a public gathering a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel then met the demand after Jordan promised to set free
the two Israeli agents caught in attacking Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Services and Minister of
Administrative Development Abdullah Ensour Monday (October 6)
admitted that the releases were the results of "a good bargain"
between Jordan and Israel, which benefited all the sides concerned
including Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. The movement has conducted a series of
anti-Israeli attacks since 1994, with many of its leading figures
staying in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and is
now one of the only two Arab countries that conceived peace with
the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Albright Calls for NATO Expansion Ratification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today launched the administration's campaign
for Senate ratification of the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"A larger NATO will make America safer, NATO stronger and
Europe more peaceful and united. That is the strategic rationale,"
Albright told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
At a summit in Madrid in July, the 16-member alliance decided
to invite former Warsaw Pact members Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join.
</P>
<P>
Albright was the first administration official to testify
before the Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Jesse Helms, a
conservative Republican. The full Senate is expected to vote on
ratification next spring.
</P>
<P>
She told the committee that NATO was enlarged because it would
"expand the area in Europe where wars simply do not happen;" it
would make NATO stronger by adding new countries that would help
accomplish alliance goals; and it gave central European countries
an incentive for resolving age-old disputes between them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright dismissed fears that NATO expansion would
create a new threat from Russia, which has strongly opposed the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The dire predictions about the end of the world if NATO
enlarged are not coming true," she said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee expressed support for the principle of
expansion, but urged the administration to strike a deal first
with Europeans on burden-sharing over the costs of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Helms told Albright that ratification of the expansion plan
"could very well succeed or fail" on whether the Europeans are
persuaded to pay their fair share.
</P>
<P>
Albright replied, "As secretary of state, I will insist that
our old allies share this burden fairly. That is what NATO is all
about."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. government estimated that the total
cost of the expansion will be some 35 billion U.S. dollars over 10
years, but said the U.S. share would be only about 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. and its allies were working to produce a
common estimate of costs by December.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today described Israel's failed attempt on the life of a
Hamas leader last month as "dangerous and detrimental" to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, Moussa warned that the chain of violence
will have its evil repercussions on the region's security.
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing state of affairs will ultimately undermine the
Mideast peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any government that respects itself can not accept what has
happened, the Egyptian top diplomat noted, adding that "The tone
of threats will never be useful and will never intimidate anybody."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the attack by two Israeli agents on Khaled
Meshaal, political chief of Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
in Amman on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestine. Most Hamas political bureau members live
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have
diplomatic ties with the Jewish state.

Speaking at the party's first annual conference since its
disastrous general election defeat in May, He said he was "under

In his interview with the Times Monday, Hague confessed that
the Tories seemed "divided, self-obsessed, arrogant and
conceited."
</P>
<P>
However, his proposed internal party reform received the
backing of over 80 percent of party members polling 143,299 votes.
Those voting against him totaled 34,092.
</P>
<P>
The Tory leader said he saw the endorsements of his leadership
by the party as "the beginning of a challenge to be met."
</P>
<P>
And he said he would do everything "in his power" to rebuild
the party. "This is the week when we get off our knees and stand
tall again," he added.
</P>

Qatar today began sending invitations to foreign states and
international organizations, Fuaz bin Ahamad al Atuiya, spokesman
of the Qatari Foreign Ministry was quoted by the Qatari news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said media reports asserting the suspense of the conference
were "not correct."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign ministry made the statement after the
Qatari news agency reported last Saturday that "Qatar has the
capacity of postponing the conference."
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE have decided to boycott the conference in
protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace process
while most of other Arab states adopt a wait-and-see stand.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League made a decision in September to leave Arab
countries free on their participation in the conference, the
fourth since it was launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel have announced their participation in the
conference. Qatar said last week that it will invite Israel's
Foreign Minister David Levy instead of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Doha said last Wednesday that the conference could be
downgraded from a summit to a conference at a ministerial level
because the atmosphere is not "appropriate" for inviting higher
level officials.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Senate to Ratify NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today launched a campaign for Senate
ratification of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"A larger NATO will make America safer, NATO stronger and
Europe more peaceful and united. That is the strategic rationale,"
Albright told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
At a summit in Madrid in July, the 16-member alliance decided
to invite former Warsaw Pact members Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join.
</P>
<P>
Albright was the first administration official to testify
before the Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Jesse Helms, a
conservative Republican. The full Senate is expected to vote on
ratification next spring.
</P>
<P>
She told the committee that NATO was enlarged because it would
"expand the area in Europe where wars simply do not happen;" it
would make NATO stronger by adding new countries that would help
accomplish alliance goals; and it gave central European countries
an incentive for resolving age-old disputes between them.
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee expressed their support for the
expansion, but urged the administration to strike a deal first
with Europeans on burden-sharing over the costs of the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Helms told Albright that ratification of the expansion plan
"could very well succeed or fail" on whether the Europeans are
persuaded to pay their fair share.
</P>
<P>
Albright replied, "As secretary of state, I will insist that
our old allies share this burden fairly. That is what NATO is all
about."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. government estimated that the total
cost of the expansion will be some 35 billion U.S. dollars over 10
years, but said the U.S. share would be only about 2 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. and its allies were working to produce a
common estimate of costs by December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright dismissed fears that NATO expansion would
create a new threat from Russia, which has strongly opposed the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The dire predictions about the end of the world if NATO
enlarged are not coming true," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Helms expressed his concern about the agreement signed
between the alliance and Russia, calling the new ties
"ill-considered."
</P>
<P>
"I confess a fear that the U.S. overture to Russia may already
have gone too far," said Helms, urging the administration not to
"rush forward into an ill-considered NATO partnership with
Russia."
</P>
<P>
Helms' target is a new council, which held its first meeting
last month in New York, that gives Russia a voice in some NATO
discussions.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Albright stressed Russia has not been granted a
decision-making role in NATO. Russia will have "no opportunity to
dilute, delay or block the NATO decisions," she said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Trains 11,074 Pharmacists in 20 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has trained 11,074
pharmacists in the past 20 years, Ivo Garrido, head of the Higher
Institute of Mozambique's Science and Technology, said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the first International
Conference of Portuguese-speaking Pharmacists here, Garrido said
these pharmacists are of primary and middle levels.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there are only five senior pharmacists in
the country which has a population of about 17 million.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Mozambican Deputy Minister of Health
Abdul Razak said parliament will approve the new draft pharmacy
act which encourages the private sector to participate in making
medicines and the liberalization of their imports.
</P>
<P>
Private participation will promote investment in drugs
production and their sales, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the conference, Renato Ronda, President of the
Association of Pharmacists of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, said
it "has committed to the moral and professional obligation of
improving the health system of Portuguese-speaking countries."
</P>
<P>
Personnel training, the restoration of the circulation
channels of the medicines, their storages and imports are high on
the agenda of the four-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 people from Portugal, Mozambique and Cape Verde are
attending the meeting while other members including Brazil,
Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe are not
represented.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says to Do Whatever to Revive Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he would do anything that could promote peace
process in the Middle East, but again he deliberately avoided to
make a direct criticism of Israel for its political assassination
of a Hamas leader.
</P>
<P>
"I would go anywhere or do anything that I thought would be
most effective in promoting the peace process," Clinton said at a
photo session in the Oval Office with visiting Israeli President
Ezer Waizman before their talks.
</P>
<P>
The president again was very careful not to scold Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when reporters asked his comment on a
failed assassination on Sept. 25 when two agents of the Israeli
intelligence service Mossad tried to kill Hamas political leader
Khaled Meshal by poisoning.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Israel's struggle against terrorism is important.
But it's also important to consider the consequences on people who
are your allies, whatever actions are taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his call for reviving the peace process in the
region, saying: "That's really the only way to ultimately get rid
of the terrorist problems in the Middle East."

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Specifies Coop Areas With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral today specified fields of cooperation with
South Africa, the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Time has come for the two countries to build "a rapidly
growing super structure of cooperation," Gujral told South
African parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said India can profit from South Africa's skills and
technology in the fields of mining and infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
India, in turn, can be of special help in the development of
small scale industries, the housing sector, human resource
development, employment-generation programs and in science and
technology as well.
</P>
<P>
A second area of great importance, he said, was the
strengthening of joint endeavors in regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We see South Africa as a bridgehead into the markets of
southern Africa and we can play the same role for your country as
a spring board into South Asia and beyond," Gujral told South
African parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
He called on both countries to play a definitive role in
strengthening the Indian Ocean rim cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries head the Indian Ocean Rim Alliance for
Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for greater cooperation between the two
countries in world forums such as the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the NAM is still necessary to address problems facing
the developing world.
</P>
<P>
On United Nations reform, Gujral said both countries have an
important responsibility to help reform the global organization,
especially its Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the two leaders presided over the signing of
three agreements in geology and mining resources, tourism, and
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Indo-South African relations saw rapid development in recent
years. The two countries agreed to establish a "strategic
partnership" in the Red Fort Declaration signed by Mandela and
then Indian prime minister Deve Gowda during Mandela's visit to
India in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade grew to over 600 million U.S. Dollars last
year from some 80 million U.S. Dollars in 1993. Gujral predicted
that the figure could reach one billion by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Gujral's visit to South Africa, which is the first by an
Indian prime minister, was given special significance because
this year is also the 50th anniversary of India's independence
from Britain.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Impounds Secret Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Liberian policemen
are keeping guard on an airfield near the capital Monrovia a day
after a South African plane made an unscheduled landing there.
</P>
<P>
Three South Africans and four Sierra Leoneans who arrived by
the plane were also being investigated by a joint team of the
Liberian security force and officers from the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Justice Minister Peter Bona Chana said this afternoon
that the aircraft had been impounded because of the secrecy about
its arrival in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to him, several items found aboard the plane have
been extended over to ECOMOG, which is in overall charge of
Liberia's security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu was
quoted as saying that his military intelligence officers were
handling the matter.
</P>
<P>
The plane arrived on Sunday on route of Sierra Leone from
Conakry, capital of Guinea, with the three South Africans and
four Sierra Leoneans on board.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leoneans have been identified as members of the
Kamajors, a group of traditional hunters fighting against the
military junta for the restoration of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah ousted in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister said the police were enforcing the
seizure of the aircraft because "it is related to the security of
the state of Liberia".

<HEADLINE> US-Syrian Talks in New York Make Little Progress: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States' ambassador
to Lebanon said today that the talks between U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and her Syrian counterpart Faruk Shareh
in New York made little progress.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones told reporters here that the gap
between Albright and Shareh remained so wide that they couldn't
reach any agreement to revive the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks of peace process.
</P>
<P>
But, he said the United States will make efforts to relaunch
the peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority through U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross who is
now in Israel for peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Jones stressed that efforts being made on the
Israeli-Palestinian track do not mean that other tracks are
neglected.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Shareh and Albright in New York was the
result of the latter's first tour of the Middle East region
including Syria last month.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke down last year after a spate
of suicide bombings hit Jerusalem. Syria refused to return to the
negotiating table, accusing Israel of not honoring the commitment
of the former Israeli government to return the occupied Golan
heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been insisting that the Syrian-Israeli negotiations
should resume from where they halted in May, 1996, but the
Israeli govenrment said that the talks should start anew without
any precondition.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting between Boueiz and Jones focused on a U.S. aid
program to train Lebanese soldiers and civilians to remove thousands
of mines planted in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Between Somali Fisherman, Foreign Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The anarchy and civil strife
in Somalia are not confined to the mainland of the country alone,
but also occur along the beach lines off Somali Coast which
stretches more than 3,333 km, the longest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Seven Somalis were wounded last week when fighting broke out
between local fishermen and four foreign fishing vessels off Ego
Beach, about 340 km north of the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Mohamud Ali Arrale, head of a local fishing company based at
Ego Beach, complained that the four foreign ships flying the
flags of Greece, South Korea, Pakistan and Italy, looted quite a
number of fishing nets with lobsters valued at more than 12,000
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arrale, who contacted the VHF radios, accused the foreign
vessels of looting and fishing in Somalia's waters illegally.
</P>
<P>
Reports said about a dozen Somalis with two small fishing
boats and equipped with assault rifles attacked the four vessels
off the coast of Ego Beach.
</P>
<P>
In the fighting that ensued, the foreign vessels used heavy
machine guns which forced the local fishermen to retreat to the
mainland, while the big ships went out of sight, Arrale added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Eid Omar, an engineer and also one of the fishermen,
said this is the third time in two months that their nets were
looted by big vessels.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the fishermen are now working with heavy
machine guns on their boats and he threatened they will destroy
every foreign fishing vessel they see in their area of operation.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to fight the illegal fishing and looting to the
last drop of our blood," Omar swore.
</P>
<P>
A similar net looting business involving foreign vessels
occurred at Adale district beach four months ago. Mohamud Alasow
Kurdi, deputy district commissioner, said the foreign vessels
have looted all the nets laid by the local fishermen. Two of the
local fishermen were wounded while fighting with these foreign
fishing vessels at the district, about 100 km east of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Abdi Wade, interior secretary of Ali Mahdi Mohamed's
faction, said the case of the illegal fishing and looting by the
foreign vessels will be thoroughly investigated and that measures
will be taken against them.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Be Questioned Over Spy Attack Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is due to be summoned for questioning by a
three-member committee over the failed attack on Hamas leader
Khaled Mashaal in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the committee, appointed by the
Israeli government to investigate the Mashaal affair, began its
work today and no deadline was set for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Local press and politicians have pointed out that Netanyahu is
the person empowered to issue the final order for such attacks.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises former legal advisor of the Defense
Ministry Yosef Ciechanover, ex-Mossad (Israeli secret service)
director Nahum Admoni and ex-police inspector-general Rafi Peled.
</P>
<P>
Two Mossad agents holding forged Canadian passports launched
the attack on Mashaal on September 25. But they were arrested on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
To rescue the two agents, Israel released Hamas founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin and allowed him to return to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The radio report quoted diplomatic sources in Jerusalem as
saying that as soon as Netanyahu knew the assassination was
botched, he decided to send Mossad chief Danny Yatom for a meeting
with Jordan's King Hussein and give Jordanians drug to neutralize
the poison injected into Mashaal's ear in order to save the life
of the two secret agents.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has promised Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan that
Israel will do its most to ensure that such attack will not occur
again, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
He also phoned Hussein Monday night and noted that the two
countries have acted "cautiously and responsibly" in handling the
Mashaal affair. Netanyahu said that the damage must be repaired to
ensure the Israeli-Jordanian relations to remain in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
The sources also confirmed that Hamas did offer a possible
ceasefire to Israel, but the intelligence information reached
Netanyahu only after the attack on Mashaal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai indicated
today that he had not been involved in making any major decisions
concerning with the Mossad operation in Jordan. He said that he
was closely involved in the affair only after it happened, and he
just made efforts to minimize the damage.

LUANDA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Gro Harlem Brundtland, former
Norwegian prime minister today pledged more health fund to
African countries if she was elected as director-general of the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks to the press here after concluding her
two-day visit in Angola.
</P>
<P>
At present, she said, African countries account for only 17
percent of WHO's fund. She promised to mobilize the
organization's fund to help promote the health cause on the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
The former premier believes that it takes close cooperation
for the whole world to overcome poverty and improve education and
health systems so as to achieve sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, she added, international organizations
must work together through various channels.
</P>
<P>
According to Brundtland, her current African tour also
includes South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania and Egypt. She will
meet with leaders of these countries and visit health
institutions to get to know health situations in African
countries and people's general demands in this regard so as to
make her election more favorable to African countries.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland arrived here on Monday in a bid to lobby support
for her campaign for the post of WHO's director-general.

<P>
KHARTOUM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
al-Bashir today met with Lam Akol, leader of Sudan's third largest
rebel faction, describing the Fashuda accord signed late September
as "a real contribution to peace."
</P>
<P>
Bashir and Lam Akol discussed the situation after the signing
of the peace agreement between the government and Lam Akol group
in Fashuda, southern Sudanese upper Nile province, Secretary
General of the Supreme Peace Council Mohamed Amin Al Khalifa told
newsmen.
</P>
<P>
On negotiations between the Khartoum government and John
Garang, leader of the largest rebel faction Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), which are scheduled to take place in
Nairobi on October 28, Al Khalifa expressed the government's
readiness and interest in reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Al Khalifa called upon Garang to be serious this time so that
the Sudanese people might establish unity and peace throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had signed peace accords with two
thirds of the principal rebel groups in southern Sudan. It signed
the Khartoum peace agreement last April with six southern rebel
groups.
</P>
<P>
However, the Garang-led SPLA still refuses to make compromise
with the government. Garang is adamantly demanding the
establishment of an independent state despite all the peace
efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has claimed lives of over a million since
1983 when the southern rebels took up arms for greater autonomy
from the Islamic north for the Christian and animist south.

ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has said that the European Union (EU) has suspended its
consideration for the time being Turkey's membership issue, the
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks in the latest edition of Gorus, a
major business magzine in Turkey, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Despite Turkey's years of efforts for full EU membership, the
European bloc has stopped considering Turkey's bid, the Turkish
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Turkey, as a part of Europe,
shared the culture of Europe and had the right to be
admitted into the European body.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the EU should not reject Turkey's efforts
on the grounds of the country's current weakness, adding these
weakness could be overcome step by step.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been sparing no efforts for a full EU membership
over the past years, but made little progress due to a number of
issues, including the Kurdish problem, human rights as well as
weak economy.
</P>
<P>
The EU's recent decision to hold accession talks with the
Cypriot government also angered Turkey, which provides political,
economic and military support for Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz discussed Turkey's EU
membership issue with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl during his
official visit to Bonn last week.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Yilmaz that Germany would support Turkey's
membership drive but Ankara should improve its human rights
record and economy first.

Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard made public the

desert region, the latest issue of Middle East Times weekly

<P>
The government has outlined the major components of a
development plan for southern Egypt, said Public Works Minister

CAIRO -- The total volume of U.S. aid to Egypt for the 1997
U.S. fiscal year reached 809 million U.S. dollars, with the
signing of new grant agreements with Cairo in September, the
Middle East Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Egypt will receive 143.5 million dollars
in U.S. grants to develop its commodities market, small and
medium-size businesses, water and waste-water schemes and
family-planning program, the English weekly quoted U.S. officials

Economy Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali said last week that
direct investment stood at 900 million dollars in 1996, up from
432 million the year before.
</P>

JERUSALEM -- Israel's tax revenues will show a shortfall in the
whole year of 1997 over the targeted revenues set by the Israeli
Treasury for this year if the revenues continue to be collected at
the current rate, the Israeli Treasury announced today.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenues totaled 81.3 billion shekels (about 23.2
billion U.S. dollars) in the first three quarters of this year,
representing a mere 1.7 percent increase over the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
But if revenues continue to be collected at the current rate,
they will show an 4.5 billion shekels (about 1.3 billion dollars)
shortfall in 1997 on the targeted revenue, which was set at 113.4
billion shekels (32.4 billion dollars) by the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Tsipi Galyam, head of Israeli State Revenue Administration,
said that in a bid to increase the revenues, he has called for
wide-spread reform of the taxation system, including widening the
tax base and a substantial reduction in tax exemptions.

<HEADLINE> Forum to Discuss Guidelines of Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Scholars of social sciences in
the capital gathered at a forum here today to exchange their views
on the guidelines of the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
They shared the common view that the banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory is the soul of the 15th Party Congress and upholding the
banner will guarantee China to realize its cross-century
development goals.
</P>
<P>
Ru Xin, a research fellow with China Academy of Social
Sciences, said that in obtaining a thorough understanding of the
guidelines of the Party congress, theoreticians need to study and
comprehend Deng Xiaoping Theory's historical position and guiding
significance expounded in Jiang Zemin's report to the congress.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that China's being at the primary stage of
socialism is the corner stone of Deng Xiaoping Theory and that
the Party reexaming the theory in Jiang's report has theoretical
and practical importance.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from this theory, we can conclude that China stays
now and will remain to be in a long time to come in the primary
stage of socialism," said renowned historian Liu Danian.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yunshan, deputy head of the Propaganda Department of the
CPC Central Committee, called the scholars and experts to further
emancipate their mind, carry on the fine tradition of seeking
truth from facts and play a more active role in promoting the
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was co-organized by the People's Daily and
Qiushi, the Party's leading journal.

STOCKHOLM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish company Ericsson
plans to increase its turnover in Russia from this year's some 350
million U.S. dollars to 850 million dollars in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Our forecasts show that we will have a turnover of 850

<HEADLINE> EU Moves on Supplementary Pension Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- In a drive toward the single
market, the European Commission today adopted a proposal for
union-wide legislation on safeguarding the supplementary pension
rights of employees.
</P>
<P>
The proposed council directive fills a significant gap in
existing European Union (EU) legislation by preserving acquired
rights, guaranteeing cross-border payments and making it possible
for workers temporarily posted by their employer to work in
another EU member country to remain affiliated to the
supplementary pension scheme in the country where they were
previously working.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, people who move from one job to another within
the 15-nation union face losing all or part of their supplementary
pension rights. This represents a significant obstacle to labor
mobility.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is deemed as the first step to removing the
obstacle to free movement that is one of the two basics on which
the single market is to be forged.
</P>
<P>
The other basic is the free movement of goods.
</P>
<P>
State pensions have already been covered by the EU free
movement legislation. But for many workers, supplementary pensions
are becoming more significant in financial terms and their
importance is still growing.

<HEADLINE> China Strict on College Diploma Granting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese students who fail to
pass the national college entrance exam must be cautious when
answering enrollment advertisements for various nongovernment
colleges and universities, according to an official from the State
Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Some nongovernment colleges avoid responding to queries
concerning whether or not they grant official diplomas to
graduates, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 nongovernment colleges and universities nationwide have
received SEC authorization to grant diplomas recognized by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Students attending other nongovernment colleges and
universities are required to pass a national exam for
self-learners in order to receive an official diploma.
</P>
<P>
Students who have attended nongovernment colleges and
universities recognized for providing high-quality education can
take a provincial exam authorized by the state government. Those
passing said exam will receive an official college education
certificate.
</P>
<P>
People holding official diplomas find it much easier to find
employment.
</P>
<P>
No changes have made in college enrollment policy, according to
the official. However, beginning autumn semester this year, all
Chinese colleges and universities will charge tuition fees
to cover between 10-20 percent of college education expenses
formerly subsidized by the government.
</P>
<P>
All colleges and universities will enroll freshmen in
accordance with the state plan, and only students enrolled under
said plan will receive official college education certificates upon
graduation.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that students enrolled outside of the
state plan will not receive official diplomas after graduation.
Nongovernmental colleges and universities supplement formal
college education by enabling people who fail the entrance exam to
receive a college education.
</P>
<P>
However, some nongovernmental colleges and universities promise
students they will receive an official diploma in order to enroll
more students and increase revenues. The official warned students
and parents to exercise caution which receiving promises of this
nature.
</P>
<P>
A list of colleges and universities authorized to grant
official diplomas will published in "China Education Daily" each
year prior to the enrollment period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese colleges and universities grant graduates legitimate
diplomas printed by a confidential professional unit.

</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island became divided after Turkish troops took over the northern
third of the island in the wake of a short-lived pro-Athens
coup. Turkey maintains about 30,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that the Cyprus problem is not a problem
between the two communities on the island but a problem between
Turkey and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The obstacle to progress on the Cyprus issue is not Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash but Turkey, he said, adding that
"That is where all the attention should be directed and our
efforts should be made to bring Turkey to realize that the
solution to the Cyprus problem is a must."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides made the proposal for demilitarization
three years ago, which promises disbanding the Cypriot National
Guard and handing over its weapons and equipment to the
U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In return, the proposal calls for withdrawal of the Turkish
troops from the island and disbanding of the Turkish Cypriot
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Clerides repeated the proposal during his direct talks with
Denktash in Montreaux, Switzerland, in August, but was rejected
by the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that the only country that can help
solve the Cyprus problem is the United States. "We hope that the
U.S. will play a role in the upcoming negotiations," he added.

<HEADLINE> Reports Show D.C. Police Department in Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Reports say police department
of the District of Columbia, the United States, loses evidence,
wastes money, makes poor personnel decisions and loads its
unmanned property warehouse with guns and drugs.
</P>
<P>
The findings were detailed by consulting firm Booz-Allen and
Hamilton Inc., in several reports obtained by The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The reports found appalling conditions in the police evidence
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
Much of the evidence found in police storage is more than 10
years old and often misclassified, according to the reports. The
evidence warehouse and drug labs also are piled high with guns and
narcotics that are "vulnerable to direct attack," one report said.
</P>
<P>
The sites are guarded only by motion sensors and alarms, the
report said. Medical evidence stored in the area also is
mishandled, routinely spoiling in the heat and creating hazardous
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The post quoted unidentified police officials as saying the
department cannot find seven percent of the 1,594 motor vehicles
assigned to it and that many felony cases are dismissed because
evidence is lost in computer crashes.
</P>
<P>
Poor personnel practices in D.C. police department was also
cited. Senior officers often were assigned to low-level posts in
the mail room, file room and photo gallery, one report said.
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Larry Soulsby, who has been chief for two years,
did not dispute the findings. "We are changing every unit," he
told the Post. "These are things that have been wrong for 20
years. They didn't occur overnight."

<HEADLINE> Brightest Star Found in Milky Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hubble Space Telescope in
Los Angeles has captured a glimpse of what is believed to be most
powerful star ever detected at the core of the Milky Way which
pumps out 10 million times more energy than the sun.
</P>
<P>
It releases as much energy in six seconds as the sun does in a
whole year, said the research team at the University of California
at Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Pistol Star was first observed in the early 1990s by
astronomers in South Africa and Japan using Earth-based infrared
telescopes. But Hubble captured the images on September 13 and 14
and realized that it was powerful. The research team released the
images Tuesday before they could publish their findings.
</P>
<P>
Researchers estimate that the Star is 25,000 light-years from
Earth, near the center of the Milky Way. It has an estimated
radius of 165 million to 235 million kilometers. The sun has a
radius of 722,000 kilometers and is 165 million kilometers from
Earth.
</P>
<P>
The astronomers estimate the Pistol Star formed 1 million to 3
million years ago and could have been 200 times more massive than
the sun back then.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Gives Green Light to Production of Eurofighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The German government today finally
gave the long-delayed approval for funding the Eurofighter
project, clearing a major outstanding hurdle to production of a
21st-century warplane for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made today by the German cabinet, the German
air force Luftwaffe would be able to order 180 Eurofighter jets at
total costs of about 23 billion marks (13 billion
U.S. dollars). It would be the biggest and most expensive military
project for Germany in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
Although okeyed by the government, Germany's eventual
participation in the project still depends on the final approval
next month by the parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, where
it could meet rejections mainly from the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
The Eurofighter project have been controversial in Germany at a
time when Bonn is struggling to curb public spending in order to
meet the fiscal requirements for qualifying for the planned single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Development of Eurofighter prototypes has already cost German
taxpayers 7 billion marks (4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG, the German contractor of
the four-nation group that will build the modern jet, argued that
the jobs and technological payoff of the project were
indispensable to the future of the company and a German place in a
European aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
German Defence Mininster Volker Ruehe today also said that
after nine years of planning and development, the Eurofighter had
reached a technical stage at which preparations for mass
production could begin.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Italy and Spain have already approve the project, with
London planning to buy 232 Eurofighters, Rome 121 and Madrid 87.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the Eurofighter project is estimated at about
75 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Air Control Agreement Initialed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea today initialed an air control
agreement, paving the way to open an inter-Korean air route for
commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement came at the third round of inter-Korean
aviation meeting held in Bangkok, Thailand, under the auspices of
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said the
Ministry of Construction and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed Tuesday to use a direct telephone line via
Panmunjom as the main control communication means and AsiaSat and
InterSat as a secondary means for linking South Korea's Taegu and
the DPRK's Pyongyang Flight Information Regions (FIR).
</P>
<P>
The two sides on the Korea Peninsula have banned each other's
national flag carriers from passing through their territorial air
space since the peninsula was divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
A nation controlling the FIR provides airplanes flying inside
the zone with flight information. If an accident takes place in
the zone, the nation is responsible for search, rescue and
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Designed to facilitate flights for international civil
airliners through the FIR of the two sides, the agreement will
take effect on February 28 next year, according to ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
When the Pyongyang FIR is used, South Korean planes flying
between Seoul and Vladivostok or American cities could reduce
flying hours by 20 to 47 minutes, while saving about 14 million
U.S. dollars worth of fuel one year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the DPRK would make a profit of some 2 million dollars
in air control fees a year, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Troops Restore Combat Capability: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Ali Al-Mumen, Kuwaiti chief
of staff of the armed forces, has asserted that Kuwaiti troops
have restored combat capabilities and are ready to repulse any
aggression.
</P>
<P>
According to local Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper today, Al-Mumen said
in an interview that the armed forces have been successfully
rebuilt to face any eventuality six years after Kuwait's liberation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had about 20,000 troops before the Iraqi invasion in
1990. However, the military was crushed by advancing Iraqi forces
and during their ensuing seven-month occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mumen said that in addition Kuwait has formed the reserves
which could join the armed forces within 24 hours to deal with any
emergency. But he did not mention the size of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders are calm recently. "But this
does not mean that we should stop our military preparations. We
should stay vigilant as long as there is a conflict," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He maintained the necessity of diversifying stockpiles of arms
and conducting intensive training of the forces.
</P>
<P>
"After liberation, we began a new phase of intensive training,
field and moralistic preparedness," he stressed, adding that the
national air, ground and naval forces are trained to keep a high
state of readiness.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War, Kuwait signed defense cooperation treaties
with the United States, Britain, France and Russia to purchase
nearly 130 billion U.S. dollars worth of advanced military
equipment within 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Maps Out Autumn Grain Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- As autumn harvest is
approaching, the State Council, China's highest governing body,
issued a circular today, urging localities to earnestly carry out
government grain purchase policies so as to protect farmers'
interests.
</P>
<P>
The circular demands the purchase prices for autumn grain
remain at the same level of last year, and grains outside the
state-set quotas should be purchased open-endedly and at the
government protective prices. Any violations should be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
Illegal dealers who buy grains from farmers at lower prices but
sell them to the state at higher prices must be timely cracked
down, the circular says.
</P>
<P>
To stem speculation, the circular calls for stricter grain
market management while banning any private firms or individuals
from involved in grain purchase. It states that "only state-run
grain enterprises have the right to directly buy grains from
farmers."
</P>
<P>
It cautions state grain shops to sell grains in accordance with
government policies, and "should not lower sale prices", the
violators should be responsible for the losses themselves.
</P>
<P>
The circular also urges local grain department to make good
preparations for the upcoming autumn purchase, including revamping
and building more granaries and barns, installing more stoving
equipment.

LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A sub-regional coastal shipping
firm for West and Central Africa was approved Tuesday during a
ministerial meeting in Nigerian capital Abuja, press report said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that about 14 million U.S. Dollars would
be needed for the establishment of the firm, which they believe,
"is a bold attempt at breaking the existing barriers on
commercial sea transportation within the West and Central African
coastal countries."
</P>
<P>
It is projected that the firm will be able to earn 60 million
U.S. Dollars in the next five years, allowing a profit of about
14.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Nigerian head of state, General Sani
Abacha regretted that maritime industry on the continent has not
kept pace with the development of sub-regional trade in West and
Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
He remarked that the sub-region "must work harder to keep pace
with the global trends, as the maritime industry is now one of
the most competitive sectors in international trade."
</P>
<P>
While decrying the domination of shipping trade in the
sub-region by foreign firms, General Abacha said the
establishment of a vibrant and dynamic coastal shipping firm will
boost sub-regional integration.

<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to launch a National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) next Wednesday, Health Minister
Ihechukwu Madubuike announced Tuesday in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the kick-off of the NHIS is in recognition
of the government's social responsibility of providing
accessible, affordable and equitable health care services.
</P>
<P>
Many Nigerian states have shown interests to NHIS, but he said
only eight states and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja have
been selected to pilot the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The eight states are Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Lagos, Ogun,
Enugu, Rivers and Borno.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the NHIS has been discussed in Nigeria for
decades, but all the previous attempts to launch it have failed.
</P>
<P>
With the costs of medical care soaring in recent times, common
Nigerians have denied access to essential medical services. There
have been many reports of patients being denied treatment for
failing to pay huge deposits.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the minister said, providing free medical
care to civil servants has become an unbearable burden to the
government.

LAGOS, October 8 (xinhua) -- The monopoly of the Nigerian
Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) came to an end Tuesday in
Lagos, with the signing of an interconnect agreement between it
and Multi-Links, a private telephone operator.
</P>
<P>

The Nigerian government deregulated the telecommunications
sector five years ago by Decree 75 of 1992, but Multi-links is
the first private firm to enter an interconnect agreement with
NITEL, thus formally ending the latter's monopoly over the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, NITEL's managing director,
Buba Bajoga remarked that the agreement "has put to rest the
public anxiety over private partcipation in the nation's
telecommunications market".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Considers Exchange Rates Merger in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
considering a merger of the country's dual exchange rates in the
1998 budget, "This Day" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although no decision has been taken, an official from the
Ministry of Finance was quoted as saying that "hopefully we will
deal with the issue (dual exchange rate) once and for all in the
1998 budget".
</P>
<P>
The official exchange rate now stands at 22 Naira to one U.S.
Dollar, while the rate at the autonomous foreign exchange market
is about 82 Naira to one Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been under pressure to merge the
two rates. It was widely expected to do so in the 1997 budget,
but it didn't take the step at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the dual exchange rate regime is now
considered by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as the sole grey area in Nigeria's economic health.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria might have to bow to the pressure if it is to benefit
from the various debt relief programs monitored by the World Bank
and the IMF, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The institutions also insist that dual exchange rate prevents
the optional allocation of resources and hinders transparency and
accountability, the report said.

<HEADLINE> An Iraq's Kurdish Party Denies Sheltering PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) has denied that it is sheltering Turkey's Kurdish
militants in northern Iraq, local newspaper Daily News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This was in response to news reports that Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party militants, escaping Ankara's cross-border
attacks, have been taking refuge in PUK-controlled area in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Shazad Said, a senior official at the PUK
Ankara office, as claiming that the rumors had been spread by its
arch rival in the region, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
</P>
<P>
PUK, led by Jalal Talabani, and KDP, under Massoud Barzani,
were the two major Kurdish opposition groups in northern
Iraq. However they turned against each other and fought for the
control of northern Iraq after President Saddam Hussein was
rendered ineffective by allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War in
exerting his influence there.
</P>
<P>
PUK, which favors continued armed struggle to topple the Saddam
regime and is said to be supported by Iran, maintains a relaxed
relationship with PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Whereas KDP has softened its approach to Saddam and was
reportedly supported by Baghdad in its turf war against PUK. It
has also been fighting alongside with Turkish government troops in
northern Iraq against PKK militants over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
"The KDP, which is now fighting the PKK, always spread rumors
whenever they encountered failure," Said told the Daily News.
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry stated in May that its massive
cross-border military operation against the PKK rebels was carried
out at the request of KDP. KDP has kept silent on this issue.
</P>
<P>
PKK militants have been fighting a 13-year-old war for
independence in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that press reports about PKK militants'
fleeing into PUK-controlled area may be a signal that Turkish
troops might launch new attacks there.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkish government troops, backed by jets and
artillery fire, entered northern Iraq to sweep PKK camps despite
strong criticism from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said that the
ongoing offensive against PKK rebels was only "a limited and
routine one."
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic sources here believe that the Turkish
troops will stay in the area for a longer time.

<HEADLINE> Democracy, Freedom Valued in HK: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Although livelihood-related
topics occupied much space in his maiden policy address, it
doesn't necessarily mean that democracy and freedom are neglected
in Hong Kong, Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region
 (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the whole society has attached much importance to
democracy and freedom, Tung told a press conference after
delivering his policy address at the Provisional Legislative
Council this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1, the way of life of the Hong Kong people has not
changed and freedom, including the freedom of the press, is well
preserved, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the SAR's political development, the Basic Law sets
out a 10-year timetable for the elections of the chief executive
and the legislative council and the arrangement meets the needs of
Hong Kong society, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll take time to move forward," he continued, adding that
all should remember that the long-term objective of the HKSAR, as
laid down in the mini-constitution of the SAR, is to have a chief
executive and a legislature elected by universal suffrage.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year period is reasonable, since many countries in the
world spent years and years in moving from indirect election to
direct election to universal suffrage, he stated.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the chief executive stressed, "the important
thing is to make sure this government is accountable to the
people, the rule of law continues to be strong and freedom
prevails, and we will make sure all these continue in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a number of questions on housing, Tung said there
is "no magic solution" to the problem. "What the government can
do is offer more land and housing units."
</P>
<P>
He voiced confidence that the three main housing targets laid
down in his policy address will be achieved -- to build at least
85,000 flats a year, to achieve a home ownership rate of 70
percent in 10 years and to reduce the average waiting time for
public rental housing to three years.
</P>
<P>
Turning to why the policy address was so lengthy and touched so
many topics, Tung said that as the first policy address of the
SAR, it signified a new era of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, it defined the SAR's direction of future
development with a macro perspective; on the other, it addressed
the issues of current concern for Hong Kong people, he said. It
took Tung two hours and 10 minutes to read the 42-page address.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the capital expenditure of 88 billion HK dollars
(11.3 billion U.S. dollars) over the next five financial years,
Tung said the money, covering long-term investment in fields such
as infrastructure and schools, will anchor Hong Kong into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The number itself, viewed as a lucky one by Chinese, is not a
design, he said, arousing a burst of laughter.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 questions were asked in the crowded 45-minute
press conference, covering old-age welfare, labor, high-tech
development, culture and relations between Hong Kong and China's
interior.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Congratulates Kim's Election as DPRK Party Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, today
congratulated Comrade Kim Jong Il, leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), on his assumption of office as
general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, Jiang said, "since Comrade Kim
Il Sung passed away three year ago, the people of the DPRK have
rallied closely around the WPK Central Committee under your
leadership and carried out Comrade Kim Il Sung's behests."
</P>
<P>
With iron will and strong determination, the people of the DPRK
have overcome all kinds of difficulties and hardships through
their own efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The people of the DPRK will continue to march on along the road
of building their motherland, striving for the peaceful
unification of the country and safeguarding peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula, he added.
</P>
<P>
China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors linked by common
mountains and rivers, he said. "There exists a time-tested
traditional friendship between the two parties, two countries and
two peoples, which was personally fostered and developed by the
leaders of older generation of our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Consolidating and developing the Sino-DPRK friendly and
cooperative ties is not only in the fundermental interests of the
two parties, two countries and two peoples, but also of great
significance for promoting peace, stability and development on the
Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia and even the whole world, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, make unremitting efforts to further
strengthen and develop the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with our joint efforts, the Sino-DPRK
traditional friendship and good-neighborly ties will surely be
developed and passed on from generation to generation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also wished Kim Jong Il and the WPK greater success in
their future work.

<HEADLINE> Ding Guangen On Publicizing Guidelines of Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangen, head of the
Propaganda Department of Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), urged propaganda officials at all levels to make
great efforts to publicizing the guidelines of the Party's 15th
national congress and mobilize the people of the whole country to
strive for the realization of the objectives set forth by the
Party's congress.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who is a member of the Politburo and a member of the
Secretariat, of the CPC Central Committee, made the call during a
recent inspection tour in east China's Anhui Province where he
exchanged views with local propaganda officials on how to carry
out the guidelines of the 15th National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Officials in propaganda departments must first of all study and
grasp the gist of the Party congress if they are to do a good
publicizing work, said Ding who also serves as head of the Central
Commission for Guiding the Cultural and Ethical Progress.
</P>
<P>
While getting across the main ideas of the report by Jiang
Zemin at the congress, propaganda officials should conduct more
investigations so that their lectures are more convincing.
</P>
<P>
"We should guard against empty talk, avoid taking one-sided
approach in understanding the guidelines and falling into
absoluteness," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Ding gave credits to the achievement Anhui has made in building
model cities, pointing out that promoting ethical and cultural
progress is a long-term task and should be carried out under the
guidelines of the Party congress.
</P>
<P>
"The key to promoting the ethical and cultural progress is
that we should serve the people and solve their practical problems
and concern ourselves with issues that touch their lives," said
the top Party propaganda official.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Tighten Curbs on Internet-Based Drug Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will clamp
down on imports and sales of unauthorized foreign drugs by agents
trading on the Internet, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Health Ministry is planning to monitor the
Internet more closely in order to track down agents behind the
illegal trade, ministry officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Such unauthorized medicines traded over the Internet include
rejuvenating drugs for insomnia and appetite suppressant, both of
which are produced in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also will warn Internet users in Japan of possible
adverse consequences of buying unauthorized drugs.
</P>
<P>
Japan's move came as the World Health Organization (WHO) called
for countermeasures against increasing illegal drug trading over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The WHO adopted a resolution at its general meeting in May
appealing for tougher control of rampant international drug
trading.
</P>
<P>
Japanese doctors and patients are still entitled to directly
import some unauthorized drugs abroad for special personal needs,
an exception which makes it difficult to control drug trading on
the Internet, government officials said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Tries to Boost Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government today
made a series of decisions to tackle the currency, monetary and
other economic issues emanating from the recent volatility and
depreciation of the country's currency and boost people's
confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
At a limited cabinet meeting held at the Presidential Palace,
President Soeharto decided that all relevant ministers and
institutions are to safeguard stocks of essential goods and strive
to maintain price stability.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered all the institutions to implement
earnestly the decision made in September to postpone and review
some government and private projects.
</P>
<P>
In order to deal with all possibilities, including external
volatility, Soeharto said, Indonesia will continue to pursue
prudent economic management and undertake those structural
adjustments needed to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness
of the country's economy in the face of global competition.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate economic activities and help medium-sized and
small businesses as well as cooperatives, he said, the government
will continue to cautiously ease liquidity as warranted by the
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the decisions reached at the meeting, the
Indonesian government is considering seeking long-term loans from
world bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
strengthen its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also said the government will continue to implement
consistently the free foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah has dropped by 50 percent against the U.S.
dollar and the stock prices plunged by more than 20 percent since
the beginning of this year following offshore speculative attacks
on the currency and a rush by local companies to hedge their
foreign borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which stood at 2,400 to a dollar in early July,
is now 3,600 to 3,700 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the depreciation of the rupiah, many sectors in
the country, especially small enterprises, banks and the tourism
sector, have been facing a very difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said Indonesia's economy is going through its
toughest time since the oil crisis in the 1980s.

PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven years after the revelation of his role in the
deportation of Jews from 1942 to 1944, former senior official of the
Vichy collaboration regime Maurice Papon will face judges today over
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
-- President Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African Republic

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation Hits 5.37 Percent in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation in the
period from January to September 1997 was 5.37 percent, narrowing
the chance of keeping this year's inflation at last year's level.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) said here today the
figure is higher than the cumulative inflation in the
corresponding period
of last year, when inflation was recorded at 4.94 percent.
</P>
<P>
In September 1997 alone, inflation was 1.29 percent while in
the same period of last year, the country saw a deflation of 0.04
percent.
</P>
<P>
The BPS said the increase in the price index of food,
multifarious goods, services and housing pushed up September's
inflation.
</P>
<P>
It said the price index of food rose by 1.91 percent,
multifarious goods and services 1.29 percent and housing 0.82
percent.
</P>
<P>
Official sources attributed the higher inflation to the
long-running dry season and the monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought has caused a rice production decrease and
forest fires in many areas while the Indonesian rupiah has
depreciated by about 50 percent following the monetary turmoil in
the Southeast Asian region.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Warns Duma Against No-confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin today urged Russia's Communist-led parliament to back
down from a threatened no-confidence vote in his government over
its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to parliament's lower house, or the State Duma,
Chernomyrdin tried to win support for key economic reforms that
include new tax laws and the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced the country and the Russian people do not need
the vote or new elections," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, the biggest parliamentary group holding 140 of
the 450 seats in the Duma, said today it will seek a no-confidence
vote next week.
</P>
<P>
They said the 1998 draft budget, to be debated in the Duma on
Thursday, sets too high targets and includes more spending in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
If the no-confidence vote passes, it will be non-binding. But
if a second no-confidence motion were passed within three months,
President Boris Yeltsin would be forced to either dismiss his
cabinet or disband the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has made it clear he might be forced to dissolve the
Duma and call a new parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
But to avert a showdown, Yeltsin told Chernomyrdin to persuade
the Duma into approving the draft 1998 budget -- an important part
of its economic program.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the economy has rebounded after six years of
decline, and a political confrontation now could lead to another
setback.
</P>
<P>
"We need to start responsible dialogue. The government is ready
for this," Chernomyrdin said while outlining Russia's economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
He said the gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure
of economic health, had risen 0.2 percent in the first nine months
of the year against the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Russian production rose 1.5 percent in January-September
1997, after falling 4.5 percent in the first nine months of 1996
over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Russian in the first half of 1997
totalled 7 billion U.S. dollars, 230 percent up against the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also predicted a good grain harvest this year at
84-85 million metric tons.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Manages to Tackle Power Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- There will be no power
blackout in Tanzania as the government is taking measures to
tackle the present power crisis resulted from long-time drought.
</P>
<P>
This was assured by Minister for Energy and Minerals Abdallah
Kigoda when talking to industrialists and other businessmen here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said that the government is aware of the seriousness of the
problem to the country's economy and is doing all it can to alleviate
it.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will exempt from paying duty to
industrialists who will import generators for power supply to
their industries.
</P>
<P>
He listed short-term measures in addressing the power crisis
such as leasing of power budgets to prospective investors,
importing power from neighboring Zambia for which the two
countries signed a memorandum last June.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said that a long-term measure is the Songo Songo
gas-to-electricity project whose contract will be signed at the
end of next month or early December.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing began last month in the whole country of
Tanzania. Preliminary forecast says that due to erratic power
supply, industrial production is likely to fall by more than 15
percent in the 1997/98 financial year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Italian Defense Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian held talks this evening with Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
Chi, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and state
councillor, noted that the Chinese government always values
developing friendship and cooperation with Italy, an important
country in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
High-level exchanges between the two countries in recent years
have turned a new page in Sino-Italian relations, said Chi.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the rapid development of relations between
the two armed forces, an important component in Sino-Italian
ties. He noted that said development can be seen in increasing
exchanges of visits between leaders of the two armed forces and in
active cooperation in the technical field.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges, which have helped to enhance mutual understanding
and provided an opportunity to learn from each other, have been
conducive to the building of the armed forces of both nations,
said Chi.
</P>
<P>
He said that Andreatta's visit not only will promote exchanges
between the two defense departments and enhance relations between
the two armed forces, but will also contribute to the overall
development of friendly bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said that he and his colleagues are visiting at an
important time following the recent 15th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party which attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the number of visits by military
delegations from many countries clearly illustrates China's
increasing role in Asia and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta said that continued growth in bilateral relations
will enable the two armed forces to exchange views during frequent
reciprocal visits.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also exchanged views on the international situation
and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chi presided over an earlier welcoming ceremony for Andreatta
who arrived today as a guest of the Chinese Defense Minister.

<P>
PYONGYANG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Pak Sung Chul, vice-president
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), today hailed
the sound development of the friendly ties between DPRK and China.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK government and the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) will

between the two countries," Pak said during a meeting with a
visiting Chinese delegation headed by Qi Huaiyuan, president of
the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries (CPAFFC).
</P>
<P>
Pak, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the WPK
Central Committee, congratulated the Communist Party of China
(CPC) on the successful convention of its 15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
The historic congress showed the will of the CPC and the
Chinese people to fully push the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics towards the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the
CPC headed by Jiang Zemin, will score fresh achievements in
carrying out the spirit of the CPC congress.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's return to China, Pak said that China's
resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 is
a splendid achievement gained by China in its reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
It is also a success in the implementation of the "one country,
two systems" policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Qi said the CPAFFC, a non-governmental
organization, will continue its efforts to further consolidate and
develop the Sino-DPRK friendship.
</P>
<P>
The five-member CPAFFC delegation arrived here on Tuesday for a
four-day visit to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE>   Netanyahu, Arafat Meet Secretly to Boost Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of further thawing
in ties between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and PNA leader Yasser
Arafat held a secret meeting this morning to give a boost to the
just-renewed peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two leaders since the
peace process grounded to a standstill in March when Israel began
building the controversial Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu and Arafat met for three
hours early this morning at the Erez checkpoint between
Israel and the Gaza Strip. The meeting was arranged by visiting United
States special peace envoy Dennis Ross, who has just presided
over the ceremony Monday night of resuming the peace talks after
a nearly seven-month deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders first talked privately in a "good atmosphere"
and then were joined by Ross, Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak
Molcho, PNA deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) and Palestinian
Council Speaker Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala).
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, which was kept away from the press, Netanyahu
and Arafat reportedly agreed to work together to fight terrorism
and advance the peace process. They agreed to renew the security
talks between Israeli and Palestinian intelligence services on
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Arafat that Israel would not relax its
continuous fight against terror and he expected the PNA to adopt
the same policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Ross hailed the summit as a "new
beginning" between the leaders and for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders agreed that, in addition to the
negotiations that have been resumed on the interim committees,
they should see all these kinds of resumption and contacts on
all levels between the two sides and the two leaders be held at
a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously trying to make headway on the interim
issues, we also clearly want to try to find the best possible
way to move forward on the broad questions to allow the whole
process back on track," Ross said, noting that major differences
between the two sides remained.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the negotiations between Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Mazen scheduled for next week in
Washington had been postponed to the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Arafat summit indicated a further thawing in
the strained relations between the two sides and the two leaders
since early this year because of Israel's settlement activities
and the recent wave of terror attacks in Jerusalem launched by
the militant Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held just after both sides agreed Monday to
reactivate the nine joint committees on implementing the rest of
the Interim Agreement, was the first positive sign showing that
the derailed peace process was finally back on track.
</P>
<P>
But tough tasks are awaiting for negotiators from both sides
as they will try to solve the differences over the interim
issues, including the opening of the safe passages, construction
of the Gaza airport and seaport and release of Palestinian
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
In addition, huge gap still exists between the sides over
deciding the scope of the three-phase Israeli troop redeployments
in the West Bank, which should be completed by mid-1998. The
first and second stages of pullouts, scheduled to be finished by
September 7, have been indefinitely delayed by the scope
dispute.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to
establish a regional apex body for a women's organization in East
Africa, according to a news dispatch from Arusha, northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Magaga Alot, a senior member of the East
African Commission at a gender workshop in Arusha on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper "Role of Women in the East African
Cooperation (EAC)", Alot said when full fledged, the evisaged
women's regional organization will among others, serve as a
center for articulation, harmonization, and promoting of women's
rights and roles within the framework of the EAC and regional
integration.
</P>
<P>
Alot said that the apex body will also address issues such as
women's participation in decision-making at all levels and access
to social resources, including education, employment, health and
population services.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Women account for roughly 50 percent of the
combined population of the three (EAC) member states of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania" and the EAC cannot ignore the plight or
contribution of half of its human resource while pursuing
regional integration and development.
</P>
<P>
Alot noted that what women need and deserve is nothing more
and nothing less than the affirmation of their equal rights and
opportunities under the law and in the society at large.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Stock Market Set for Record-Breaking Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) is
set for a record-breaking year in spite of the prevailing
political and economic uncertainty in the country, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted NSE Chairman Jimnah Mbaru as saying Tuesday
that at the end of last month, turnover in the equities secondary
market was more than 5 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 80 million
U.S. Dollars), 28 percent higher than the 1996 turnover.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the turnover should easily surpass the 94
million Dollars mark by the end of the year, compared with 61.2
million Dollars in 1996 which was itself an 18 percent increase
over the 1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
The NSE has attracted a net foreign investment of 21.4 million
Dollars since the beginning of this year despite the stand-off
between the Kenyan government and the International Monetary Fund
in July.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, as one of the leading stock
exchanges in Africa, the NSE must have benefited from the pool of
investment funds set aside for African markets.
</P>
<P>
Mbaru was addressing brokers, bankers, investors and the
business fraternity when he launched the Nairobi Stock Exchange
Facts and Figures 1997 Handbook in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of reliable, timely, relevant and
accurate information for the stock market, which "has become a
powerful tool transcending geographical boundaries and moving
financial markets worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The handbook is edited and published by Economic Intelligence
Ltd. which is specialized in the provision of strategic research
and financial information service to local and international
investors, corporate executives and business analysts.

<HEADLINE> Desertification Threatens Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- One third of Uganda experiences
frequent and prolonged drought and is threatened by
desertification, reported the local daily, The New Vision today.
</P>
<P>
Israel Kibirige Sebunya, State Minister for Agriculture was
quoted as saying the most threatened areas of the country are
those in what is known as "cattle corridor" stretching from
Karamoja, in the northeast, through Teso in the east and
Nakasongola in the central part to Rakai and Nyabushozi in the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
Sebunya pointed out that drought, commonly experienced in many
parts of Uganda in recent years is largely responsible for the
recent famine in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the causes of land degradation which leads to desert-like
conditions, the minister said that in addition to drought,
overgrazing of cattle, deforestation and poor farming practices
are major land degrading factors in the dry lands of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
These factors have been intensified by poverty, a factor which
compels people to over exploit the land resource in order to
survive.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Accused of Trying Third Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will amend its constitution
early next year to remove the two term limit clause and allow
President Frederick Chiluba to hold a third tenure of office, claimed
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
At a weekly news briefing here Tuesday, Bweendo Mulengele,
UNIP secretary for publicity and information, claimed without
proof that the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD)
wants the two term presidential limit constitutional clause
changed to allow President Chiluba a longer period, the Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The relevant bill will be submitted before parliament by
January 1998 after an MMD convention that will have Chiluba as
sole candidate, said Mulengele.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, the president's tenure of
office is limited to two five-year terms. Incumbent President
Chiluba came to power in 1991 and was reelected last year.
</P>
<P>
Mulengele's allegations were denied by David Mpamba,
government spokesman and minister of information and broadcasting
</P>
<P>
He said there is no such plan to amend the constitution which
the MMD itself formulated.
</P>
<P>
Richard Sakala, Chiluba's public relations and press
assistant, said that the president is working toward improving
democracy in Zambia and therefore cannot do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
The president never thought of that and the MMD has never
planned to change the constitution to stand for the third term,
said Sakala, adding Chiluba will leave the office at the end of
the day and allow a logical succession.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Invited to Join Talks with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioanuis Kasoulides has reaffirmed that his government invites
Turkish Cypriots to take part in the coming accession negotiations
with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, Kasoulides said at a press
conference after talks with EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg
Tuesday that "the invitation still stands, despite the fact that
the first reaction of the Turkish Cypriot leader was negative."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has asked the Turkish Cypriots to join
the Cyprus delegation which is expected to negotiate the country's
entry to the EU early next year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in his last round of
direct talks with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, refused to
negotiate a settlement for the protracted Cyprus problem unless
the EU freezes the accession talks with the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
The two communities on the east Mediterranean island has long
been embroiled in a bitter vendetta, with Greece and Turkey
standing by each of them. In 1974 Turkey sent troops to take over
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup by
the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The island has since remained divided and in 1983 the Turkish
Cypriots declared a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was reportedly infuriated by the EU decision to go ahead
with accession talks with Cyprus while it is left behind.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister assured his EU counterparts that
Cyprus could act as a bridge between the EU and the eastern
Mediterranean region as soon as it becomes an EU member.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus is ready to help in Albania's economic
reconstruction and wishes to contribute to EU's involvement toward
this goal.

<HEADLINE> Employment Bill Criticized in Zambian Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The employment amendment bill
came up in parliament here Tuesday amid criticism from
independent and opposition parliament members that its enactment
will condemn workers to shanty-town dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the bill, Labor and Social Security Minister Peter
Machungwa said that the government wants to make employees less
dependent on their employers by making it not mandatory for
employers to accommodate their workers.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill also seeks to reduce government intervention
into the worker-employer relations because this is deterrent to
economic growth and makes it difficult to attract investment into
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Some independent and opposition members said that the issue of
accommodation is a crucial one and should not be left to
collective bargaining because bulk of employees have no unions to
represent them.
</P>
<P>
Independent member Crispin Sibetta said it is surprising that
the government which mostly comprised former labor leaders is now
in the process of passing a law to make even the provision of
advances of salaries for workers negotiable.
</P>
<P>
Labor and social security deputy minister Syamuchaye
Madyenkuku said no reasonable employer with the capacity will
deny his employees houses, housing allowance or advances of
salary.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK)
has issued licenses to four new coffee auctioneers as a further
step in the liberalization of the industry, the East African
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
Coffee auctions have in the past been the preserve of Kenya
Coffee Auctions, a subsidiary of the CBK, but now the company
will have to fight for business among the new entrants.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held here Tuesday to introduce the new entrants,
CBK public relations manager Paul Kivila said that CBK was
committed to total liberalization of the coffee industry.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the coffee farmers in the country were now
free to choose who will be auctioning their products among the
new companies.
</P>
<P>
Kenya resumed its weekly coffee export auctions Tuesday after
canceling the September 30 auction due to supply shortage.
</P>
<P>
The next auction will be held on October 21 and the auctions
are expected to remain once-weekly probably in early November
when the supplies of new coffee crop begin coming in.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A cholera outbreak in Nyanza
Province, south-western Kenya, so far has killed 118 people in
four months, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ten people died of the disease in Migori and Rachuonyo
districts between last Friday and Sunday night, a medical source
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some areas where cholera is biting in are short of drugs and
only get a limited supply of oral rehydration fluids, thus
worsening the situation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It seems more deaths go unreported as they occur deep in the
rural areas, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has dispatched medical teams to tour
the affected areas, in a bid to curb cholera's spreading, which
is fueled by lack of clean drinking water and poor sanitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Initial step has been taken
toward establishing the first private university in Ethiopia
sometime next year, the government newspaper, The Ethiopian
Herald, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a U.S. information service press release, the report
said, the proposed institution is reportedly intended to provide
"American-style education" to students from surrounding countries
as well.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, investors and U.S. university
represen- tatives reached the decision to "develop" the American
University of Ethiopia (AUE) last Sunday and later visited the
future site north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The occasion marked the signing of an agreement providing for
the creation of the university between founding investors and
California State University (CSU), Stanislaus.
</P>
<P>
The report said the initiative was taken in response to
sustained interest by faculty who have taken sabbatical or
used vacation time to serve the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The AUE founding investors were quoted by the report as saying
that the purpose is not only to provide "badly needed additional
places for qualified university students" but also create "a
dynamic resource for technological transfer and human resource
development".

<HEADLINE> Drought-Hit Zambian Farmers Urged to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) has urged farmers to reduce the size of their cattle herds
in view of the impending drought.
</P>
<P>
ZNFU president Ajay Vashee said in Ndola, northern Zambia,
Tuesday that it is important for the farmers especially in the
drought prone areas to reduce the size of their herds to avoid
losing cattle during the drought.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers should start culling now. It is important to
lessen the pressure on the pasture because of the drought that is
impending," he was quoted by Times of Zambia as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vashee also warned poultry and pig farmers that the prices of
stock feed might rise because of the expected shortage of maize.
</P>
<P>
"Stock feed largely depends on maize and because of the
situation at hand, the prices will go up," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said ZNFU will embark on a country-wide tour to educate
farmers on the impending drought and there is currently a
shortage of drought resistant seeds.
</P>
<P>
However, he said farmers in the northern region of the country
could plant maize because the prices will be good if the
government does not manipulate the market.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not interfere or manipulate the market
the prices will be reasonable. For this reason only maize will be
profitable and farmers in good rainfall areas should plant
maize," the farmer union leader said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farmers to Plant Maize to Limit El </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South African farmers are
working out the best time to plant maize in a bid to limit the
potentially devastating effects of the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers agreed to choose maize as a better crop to
withstand drought which might result from the coming El Nino
phenomenon, but they had different views over the best time for
planting maize.
</P>
<P>
There are two schools of thought on the best planting time.
Some believe that it is better to plant early and cash in on the
present high moisture levels of the soil, but others feel it is
best to delay planting and adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
National Maize Producers' Organization Director Kit le Clus
said early this week that farmers could not delay decisions any
longer.
</P>
<P>
He said it was best to plant hardy, drought-resistant
cultivars, choose lands with a high soil moisture content, and
possibly bring planting times forward.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and weather analysts have kept warning that the
current season could see one of the worst droughts in memory in
South Africa as a result of the potent El Nino phenomenon
developing in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suffered the worst drought caused by the El Nino
phenomenon in 1982-83, which caused damages of about 2.1 billion
U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australia Gains From Smooth U.S.-Indonesia Ties: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia can only gain from
using its "unique" position to help smooth relations between
Indonesia and the United States, Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said today.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister confirmed a previously undisclosed agreement
for senior Australian and American officials to discuss Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The officials held their first meeting in Washington on
September 16, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to use Australia's special knowledge of its neighbor
Indonesia to help heal a rift between Jakarta and Washington, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Australia was particularly worried that Washington's sharpened
criticism of human rights abuses in Indonesia was damaging
relations between two of its most important friends.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is listed as one of the four most important nations
to Australia in a white paper on foreign affairs and trade
released in August by the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists today during his tour of the island
state of Tasmania, Howard confirmed that he raised the issue with
President Bill Clinton in Washington in June.
</P>
<P>
He had told President Clinton that Australia had a "particular
knowledge of this region and particular knowledge of circumstances
inside Indonesia," which meant that Australia could play a role in
better explaining to the Americans what was happening in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said President Clinton responded favorably and, as a
result, working parties of officials from both sides had got
together.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be benefits to Australia in being seen to
be a country with close links with nations like Indonesia and
being able to use them to help the United States gain a better
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"And it's in our interests that the Americans remain involved
in the region, in our interests that Americans properly understand
the dynamics of the Indonesian polity and the dynamics of the
Indonesian economy," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
As 60 percent of Australia's exports go to Asia, Australia is
keen to see stable and smooth political and economic development
in the region, particularly Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Australian economists have already been worrying about the
negative impact on Australia's economy and job creation caused by
the financial crisis going on in Southeast Asia, which they fear
would affect the region's imports from Australia.

BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China attaches great importance to
anti-corruption, which is an extremely important part of the Party
and government work.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important guarantee for the success of the
country's cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," the premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting with a delegation from the
Republic of Korea (ROK) led by Shi-Yoon Lee, chairman of the Board
of Audit and Inspection of the ROK, in Zhongnanhai, site of the
Central Government.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the ROK guests on China's work of supervision,
Li Peng said the Chinese Communist Party and the Central
Government have always attached great importance to discipline
inspection and the supervisory work of the government
functionaries and public servants, advocating diligent work and a
clean government.
</P>
<P>
"We are intensifying our efforts in this regard so as to ensure
that the Party discipline and the state laws and regulations are
strictly observed," Li said, adding that relevant departments are
stepping up their work to improve education, legislation and
supervision in this field.
</P>
<P>
China's supervision departments and the ROK Board of Audit and
Inspection have established good working relations and have had
many beneficial exchanges, Li noted, hoping that there will be
more such exchanges between the two sides in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Supervision Cao Qingze was present at the
meeting.

The expo will also feature various aviation technology
seminars, financial business discussions, and a series of
commercial negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits will cover over 10,000 sq.m. in the China
International Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Organizers predicted that the four-day expo will attract over
100,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
The expo is jointly sponsored by the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), Aviation Industries of China,
China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation,
China Aviation Supplies Import and Export Corporation, the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Hong
Kong-based China Promotions Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors noted that the biennial aviation expo is the fourth
largest one of its kind in the world, and the largest of its kind
in China. The scale of the event has remained constant since the
first expo held in 1984.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation sector continues to enjoy rapid and
sustained development, with a roughly 20 percent annual increase
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to remain at around 12 percent through
the end of the century, with China requiring the addition of some
250 airliners, according to estimates by Chen Guangyi,
director-general of CAAC. The country's 43 airline companies had a
total fleet of 800 aircraft at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
International aviation companies are eyeing the booming Chinese
market which is a major reason why the current Beijing Aviation
Expo is such a huge attraction, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> Manila Releases More Fund to Fight Against El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that he has ordered the release of an extra 700 million pesos
(19.7 million U.S. dollars) for water projects as part of the
government's effort to mitigate the effects of the El Nino
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said the fund was in
addition to the 800 million pesos (22.5 million dollars) released
in the past two weeks for water projects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the release of the funds is really intended to
create people's awareness about the need to save water now, even
if it is still raining these days.
</P>
<P>
The new fund will be used for small water impounding projects
and small farm reservoirs for communities, water conservation and
water recycling in order to ease possible drought caused by El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a large-scale meteorological phenomenon that develops
in the Pacific Ocean, is associated with extreme climatic
variability such as devastating drought, winds and rains.
</P>
<P>
Weathermen forecast that El Nino will strike the country and
its Southeast Asian neighbors late this year and is expected to
last for eight months.

<HEADLINE> New Policy for 1998 Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- New and less fluffy balls will
be used and an overall roof policy will be in effect at next
year's Australian Open, according to the tournament's organizers
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Big serve-and-volley players complained last year that the
balls used in the first grand slam event of the season were too
soft and slow and were causing wrist and elbow injuries.
</P>
<P>
The decision of using new balls was made to avoid high
percentage of rejection as last year.
</P>
<P>
The roof policy also sparked controversy this year. A heatwave
hit the tournament and the organizers had to shut the roof on the
center court.
</P>
<P>
Tournament director Paul McNamee said at a news conference that
they would have an overall heat policy next year including when to
shut the roof and when to suspend play on outside courts.
</P>
<P>
Prize money next year will be lifted by five percent to 7.2
million U.S. dollars, organisers said.
</P>
<P>
Current singles champions Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis have
both confirmed they will defend their titles.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Seeking IMF Long-Term Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is considering seeking
long-term loans from world bodies, including the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), to strengthen its financial sector, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at strengthening the country's foreign
exchange reserves, Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said following
a limited cabinet meeting on economy.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said that the government has been closely consulting the
World Bank and the IMF about the matter and that the two bodies
will send their teams to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the amount and terms of the long-term loans
the country will obtain from the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering obtaining long-term loans from
international financial institutions and these loans will merely
function as standby loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Soedradjad
Djiwandono said the country's foreign exchange reserves stand at
21.4 billion U.S. dollars, consisting of 20.532 billion dollars
kept in the central bank and 900 million dollars in private banks,
which are enough to finance the import of non-oil/gas commodities
in the next five months.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country also has standby loans worth nearly 2
billion dollars which can be disbursed any time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie also said the government will list all private loans to
know their exact amounts and their maturity dates.
</P>
<P>
On the monetary crisis in the country, particularly the
rupiah's depreciation by about 50 percent since the beginning of
this year, both Mar'ie and Soedradjad considered the devaluation
an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
"Although the rupiah has been floated, we will continue to try
to prevent further depreciation (of the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar)," Mar'ie said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah is now 3,600 to 3,700 to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie and Soedradjad reiterated the government's determination
to maintain the free foreign exchange system.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, today
congratulated Comrade Kim Jong Il, leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), on his assumption of office as
general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).
</P>
<P>
In his congratulatory message, Jiang said, "since Comrade Kim
Il Sung passed away three year ago, the people of the DPRK have
rallied closely around the WPK Central Committee under your
leadership and carried out Comrade Kim Il Sung's behests."
</P>
<P>
With iron will and strong determination, the people of the DPRK
have overcome all kinds of difficulties and hardships through
their own efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The people of the DPRK will continue to march on along the road
of building their motherland, striving for the peaceful
unification of the country and safeguarding peace and stability on
the Korean Peninsula, he added.
</P>
<P>
China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors linked by common
mountains and rivers, he said. "There exists a time-tested
traditional friendship between the two parties, two countries and
two peoples, which was personally fostered and developed by the
leaders of older generation of our two countries."
</P>
<P>
Consolidating and developing the Sino-DPRK friendly and
cooperative ties is not only in the fundermental interests of the
two parties, two countries and two peoples, but also of great
significance for promoting peace, stability and development on the
Korean Peninsula, in Northeast Asia and even the whole world, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, make unremitting efforts to further
strengthen and develop the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with our joint efforts, the Sino-DPRK
traditional friendship and good-neighborly ties will surely be
developed and passed on from generation to generation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also wished Jim Jong Il and the WPK greater success in
their future work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese health official today
said that China must improve the level of its drug research and
strengthen regulation of new drug development in order to gain a
greater share of the international drug market.
</P>
<P>
Shao Mingli, director of the Drug Policy and Administration
Bureau under the Ministry of Health (MOH), noted that China
still lags far behind developed countries in terms of
undertaking and analyzing drug-related clinical research.
</P>
<P>
Shao made the remarks during an international symposium on the
clinical development of drugs and the application of statistics,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Clinical research is one of the most important components in
the drug development process, with experts noting that global drug
development and international cooperation are emerging as a major
trend in pharmaceutical research, development and regulation.
</P>
<P>
"China, a large emerging market for pharmaceutical products, is
becoming an increasingly important player in collaborative
clinical research and drug development," said Ling Su
from US-based Merck Research Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The event marks the first time China has invited hundreds of
overseas drug policy-makers and clinical researchers to discuss
clinical research and product regulation with Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Participants came from a number of countries and regions,
including the United States, Britain, and Singapore.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Okays Controversial Uranium Mining Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government today
gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining
plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in
revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today defended the
government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on
development and environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000
square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World
Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason, therefore, why it should not go ahead,"
Howard was quoted today by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
evening TV news program as saying.
</P>
<P>
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated the
Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could
provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently to lobby domestic support for the
decision, the minister made it clear that the government is
looking to Jabiluka's export potential rather than uranium for
domestic use.
</P>
<P>
"Jabiluka means Australia could become the leading world
uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to
peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total
of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product
over 28 years.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision however has been condemned by
environmentalists and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dark day for Australia when our most precious World
Heritage area is consigned as a 60 million ton radioactive waste
dump," Wilderness Society national spokesperson Virginia Young
said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said the
government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area
and environmental concerns.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif today assured the visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook of his commitment and contribution to the advancement of the
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also briefed Cook, who called on the prime minister
earlier in the day, on the sweeping and revolutionary measures
adopted by his government to deregulate, liberalize and privatize
the economy, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his hope that these measures would
encourage and stimulate the interest of British investors to
invest in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Cook said the new Labor government of
Britain is anxious to further strengthen its ties with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Cook praised the Pakistani government's economic policies and
described the future outlook of British investment in Pakistan as
good.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif briefed Cook on the Indo-Pakistan dialogue,
particularly on the Kashmir issue, and the latest situation in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed that he has approached the dialogue
with sincerity of purpose.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that India would reciprocate and especially realize
the importance of the Kashmir issue to the improvement of
relations between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The continued tensions in the Subcontinent, whose root cause is
Kashmir, has been hindering the progress of nearly 1 billion
people, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the need for a just and fair solution to the
Kashmir issue, Cook said Britain would be happy to help in any
manner that is possible to facilitate the resolution of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Sharif and Cook also exchanged views on the forthcoming
Commonwealth Summit to be held this month, according to the
sources.

"His clarification that 'science and technology is the primary
productive force' is characterized by the distinctive flavor of
the day," said Gong.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 experts and scholars attending the symposium

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Leader Optimistic About Ties with Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
expressed optimism about the future relations between the SAR and
the motherland, noting that they share the same fundamental
interests.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his first Policy Address before the Provisional
Legislative Council this afternoon, Tung said Hong Kong has
"incomparable advantages" including that Hong Kong is "the
southern gateway to China" and that Hong Kong's "future economy
will also be strongly supported by the rapid development" in the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the overall economic development of the SAR and
the motherland, prospects are bright," he said. "Strengthening
economic cooperation with nearby provinces and cities is of
particular importance to the future development of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said: "Hong Kong's reunification with China under the 'one
country, two systems' concept requires us to appreciate and accept
one practical and profound truth: Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability are closely linked with those of the mainland." Also, he
continued, Hong Kong and the motherland "share the same
fundamental interests."
</P>
<P>
It also is the starting point for the SAR government when
formulating policies for the SAR's relationship with the
motherland and strategies for the SAR's long-term development, the
Chief Executive said.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, he said, Hong Kong and the motherland have
established broader and closer relationship in many areas. With
Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the relationship between
Hong Kong and the motherland should flourish comprehensively in
all fields such as the economy, finance, trade, transport,
culture, education, science and technology, tourism and sports,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of reform and opening up in the motherland has
given new energy to Hong Kong's economic development," Tung noted.
"In our daily lives, we enjoy the benefits of our country's rapid
economic development."
</P>
<P>
According to the Chief Executive, building on past cooperation,
the SAR government and the relevant inland areas' authorities have
agreed that a Hong Kong and Motherland Major Infrastructure
Projects Coordinating Committee be re-established to handle a
number of cross-boundary infrastructure projects between Hong Kong
and Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
It will conduct in-depth studies on specific projects, such as
the Western Corridor, the Zhuhai Lingdingyang Bridge, the Tonggu
Channel, air traffic control coordination between the new airport
and the Pearl River Delta, the Lok Ma Chau and Huanggang boundary
crossings and others, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, "in order to strengthen comprehensively
Hong Kong's regional cooperation with Guangdong province, the SAR
government and the Guangdong provincial government, in conjunction
with relevant central government departments, will establish a
high-level framework to study and coordinate major issues such as
infrastructure, environmental regulation, supply of non-staple
foods, water supply, social welfare, business investment and the
speeding up of the flow of passengers, traffic and freight across
the border, enabling cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong
province to rise to new heights."
</P>
<P>
"Taking stock of the situation around us, for more than a
century conditions have not been better or more promising for our
country than they are today," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"China's remarkable achievements are recognized all around the
world," he emphasized. "Our country has bright prospects from
which Hong Kong is sure to benefit."
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said Hong Kong had finally broken free from
the psychological constraints brought about by the colonial era,
noting that "we should have the courage to set aside past modes of
thought and plan Hong Kong's long-term future with new vision."
</P>
<P>
"We the people of Hong Kong have begun to write our own
history," he said, stressing that as the motherland's economy,
culture and spirit develop and as the world continues to progress,
the Hong Kong people "will rise to the challenge of this brave new
era."

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The revenue surplus for the first
seven months of the year in Macao dropped 36 percent from the same
period of last year, the Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the revenue balance had declined 310
million patacas (about 39.24 million U.S. dollars) from the same
period last year, it quoted data from the Macao Currency and
Foreign Exchange Supervision Department as showing.
</P>
<P>
The total revenues increased only 0.7 percent to nearly
five billion patacas (about 632.9 million U.S. dollars), while the
total expenditures increased 4.8 percent to 4.7 billion patacas
(about 594.9 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It showed that the tax revenue from casinos rose four
percent only. Casinos contribute nearly half the revenue income in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
While foreign trade remained brisk for the past months, other
leading economic sectors, including tourism and related
industries, suffered a blow this year due to security problems
over the past few months, observers said.
</P>
<P>
But expenditure kept rising. The cost for the rising salary of
civil service increased 10 percent, and government's expenditure
in buying goods and service rose 13.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up First Coal-Fired Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Power Development
Board (BPDB) has undertaken a scheme to set up a coal-fired power
generating station at Barapukuria in an effort to solve the
country's power shortage, sources from the BPDB said today.
</P>
<P>
This project was taken up as part of the BPDB's "Power System
Master Plan" which was approved by the government in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The production of coal in Barapukuria in the northern part of
the country would start at the end of 1999 and about 1 million
tons of coal is likely to be produced from the mine annually, out
of which 700,000 tons will be used for running the power station.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas, furnace oil and high-speed diesel are now being
used for generating electricity in Bangladesh, whose only
hydropower plant, the Kaptai Power Station, meets just a fraction
of the demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
Badly-needed power stations could not be set up in the northern
and western regions of the country to meet the growing demand for
power due to the lack of fuel locally, the sources pointed out,
adding that if local mineral resources are used, the production
cost of power will be lowered considerably.
</P>
<P>
Recently several coal deposits have been discovered in the
northern part of Bangladesh, including the Barapukuria Coal Mine,
which is the first to be undertaken for development.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Parties Feud on Slush Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) and main opposition National Congress for New Politics
(NCNP) began a new round of feud on alleged secret funds.
</P>
<P>
Kang Sam-jae, secretary-general of the NKP, accused in a news
conference Tuesday that the NCNP's leader Kim Dae-jung had stashed
away 67 billion won (about 75 million U.S. dollars) in slush funds.
</P>
<P>
Kim and his party immediately denied the charges, saying the
allegations are nonensial and groundless.
</P>
<P>
A reminder of the slush funds which finally put former
presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo into the jail, Kang's
allegations sent a shock wave through the political community.
</P>
<P>
Political observers say the allegations are the NKP's first
broadside in a life-or-death struggle with the NCNP for winning
the presidential election only two months away.
</P>
<P>
Saying the NKP had evidence to back up his claims, Kang called
on the prosecution to launch an investigation into Kim's finances.
</P>
<P>
But while the prosecution said it had no reason at this time to
launch a probe, NCNP officials said they will take legal action
against the NKP secretary-general for libel.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the ruling camp's desperate campaign to smear
our leader as the NKP's presidential candidate Lee Hoi-chang's
public approval ratings are running low," said NCNP spokesman
Chung Dong-young.
</P>
<P>
Kim is leading the four candidates in all opinion polls while
the NKP's Lee trails by Kim by at least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that with his current popularity
among voters and barring a big scandal, Kim will be able to win
the December 18 presidential election, the fourth bidding for Kim.
</P>
<P>
The allegations, however, if found to be true, could seriously
damage Kim's popularity and his candidacy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sinhala Commission Report Rekindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Heavy media debate has been
going on and a string of demonstrations have been held in Sri
Lanka since the Sinhala Commission published its Interim Report
that criticized the peace package initiated by the government.
</P>
<P>
About 800 monks from all over Sri Lanka prayed for the peace
process at a gathering in the center of Colombo Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But their views were not shared by other Buddhist monks. On the
same venue, a sit-in protest was held on September 30 by some 200
monks to show their support for the Sinhala Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Report, which was published on September 17, said
the devolution proposals and the draft constitution would endanger
the future of Buddhism and lead to the break-up of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said Sri Lanka should remain a unitary state for all time.
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the government to retain full control over
legislation, administration of justice, police forces, state land,
harbors and airports and archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it recommended that the National Joint Committee
(NJC) should call on the people to reject the devolution package,
saying the Sinhala people, as well as the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the country are facing grave dangers.
</P>
<P>
The Sinhala Commission was appointed two years ago by the NJC,
which groups 56 professional, religious and other associations, to
examine the injustice directed to the Sinhala community since Sri
Lanka won its independence in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member commission comprises former judges of the Supreme
Court, professionals and intellectuals, whose strong influence
gives the non-official organization importance in Sri Lanka's
political arena.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the report was made after talking with all
walks of the Sinhala people in the country, including Buddhist
clergy, intellectuals and politicians from both the government and
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, many argue that the report does not reflect the views
of those who support the devolution package of the government.
</P>
<P>
The peace package and the Draft Constitution of President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's Peoples' Alliance government seeks the
devolution of power through the establishment of a Union of
Regions, through which the government hopes to pacify the Tamil
community and end the 14-year-old ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, more autonomy will be given to the Northern
and Eastern provinces, where Tamil rebels have been fighting a
guerrilla war for a separate state of their own since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The report of the commission has aroused strong public debate
in newspapers and other media. Demonstrations were held either by
the people supporting the devolution package or by those opposing
it.
</P>
<P>
Within the government opinion is divided as to whether the
proposals should be drastically changed or even abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has
stated that the Sinhala Commission's report should be "consigned
to the dustbin of history" and described it as "the biggest
conspiracy against the Sinhala people."
</P>
<P>
His remarks added fuel to the already heated debate and a
demonstration was called in Colombo on September 30 to press an
apology from him.
</P>
<P>
While the minister insisted that he would never bend to any
mounting pressure, Agriculture Minister and General Secretary of
the ruling People's Alliance D.M. Jayaratne urged the
Parliamentary Select Committee to hear and consider the views of
the Sinhala Commission.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Sino-US Economic, Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said
today that great progress has been made in Sino-US relations
over the past year, especially in bilateral economic and trade
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the US should continue their efforts to ensure a
long-term and stable development of bilateral economic and trade
relations, he said during a meeting with visiting US Commerce
Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
Daley is visiting China as the guest of Wu Yi, Chinese minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. The two ministers
co-chaired the 11th Session of the Sino-US Joint Committee on
Commerce and Trade (JCCT), which opened in Beijing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The present level of bilateral economic and trade relations has
resulted from concerted efforts of the governments and business
communities of both countries, and indicates that the economies of
the two countries can supply each other's needs, the leader said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and the US share extensive common interests
and have enormous co-operation potential in safeguarding the world
and regional peace, and in furthering co-operation in such
sectors as economy, trade, culture, science, technology and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that governments and leaders of both
countries will take a broad and long-term view, take the overall
situation into consideration and work together to bring a
"healthy, stable and ever-growing Sino-US relationship" into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
On China's economic development, Jiang said that China will
unswervingly step up economic restructuring, open wider to the
outside world and develop a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, China is ready to
make still greater contributions to the world's economic
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Daley described Sino-US relations as one of the most important
bilateral relations in the world. US President Clinton and the
American people are looking forward to President Jiang's upcoming
state visit to the US, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief the visit will certainly push bilateral
ties up to a new level.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present session of the JCCT, an important
meeting before President Jiang meets with President Clinton later
this month, is both positive and constructive.
</P>
<P>
The US side is willing to push forward bilateral economic and
trade cooperation together with the Chinese side by making full
use of the present momentum in the development of bilateral
relations, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Petrochemical Industry Expanding Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China's National Petrochemical
Corporation (SINOPEC) has established co-operative relations with
companies and financial institutions in 50 countries and regions,
the "People's Daily" overseas edition reports today.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, SINOPEC exported 3.37 million tons of
petrochemicals valued at 710 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To make up for crude oil shortages on the domestic market, the
company has gotten enterprises in coastal areas and along the
Yangtze River to refine imported crude oil and opened processing
businesses supplying materials.
</P>
<P>
SINOPEC has also publicized its exportable technology and has
exported products to the United States, Italy, and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Catalytic cracking technology exported by SINOPEC was tested by
a US company this September for a petrochemical plant in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
When China's petrochemical industry expanded with the reforms
and opening up, many overseas petrochemical companies invested in
China or looked for co-operation with Chinese petrochemical firms.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, SINOPEC had raised 8.356 billion US dollars
in overseas funds via various channels for a number of state
petrochemical projects.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up 152 Sino-foreign joint petrochemical
ventures, involving a total investment of two billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Increases in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased 6.5 percent in August compared with a year ago,
while the cumulative output for the first eight months of this
year was about one percent higher over the same period in 1996,
the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the chemicals industries continued its high output
in August scoring an increase of 30.1 percent. The cumulative
output for the first eight months of 1997 grew 15.5 percent with
the petrochemicals as the main contributor.
</P>
<P>
The output of petrochemicals was 101.1 percent higher in
August, arising from the significant expansion in capacity of
several petrochemical plants, bringing the cumulative output up
57.7 percent for the first eight months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The output of electronics products rose 3.7 percent in August,
lower than the nine percent growth recorded in July. Disk drives
output still registered healthy growth, though growth rate was
lower than previous months, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
It said that higher output in telecommunication products and
semiconductors was negated by declining output of personal
computers and consumer electronics. The cumulative output for the
first eight months of 1997 registered a marginal decline of 0.5
percent compared with the same months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The EDB also said that export demand lifted up output in the
machinery industry by 10.2 percent, for there were more deliveries
of machinery to overseas buyers in August. In the meantime, the
transport equipment industry grew 13.4 percent with higher output
from both the marine and aviation segments.
</P>
<P>
The EDB also noted that output of fabricated metal products and
rubber/plastic products continued to decline 8.3 percent and 0.9
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Action on Environment Protection Inadequate: ESCAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
said here today that action to protect the environment in the
region has been "inadequate and slow."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Fourth Session of the ESCAP
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Adrianus
Mooy, executive secretary of ESCAP, said industrialization and
consumption in the region have not changed much and are still
largely unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
He added that exhaustion of natural resources, caused by
population growth, harmful agricultural practices, urbanization
and poverty, is still a matter of grave concern.
</P>
<P>
Mooy highlighted the environmental aspects of coal-based energy
and its efficient use for economic growth. He urged participants
to study how the region's growing energy demand could be met and
how the environmental impact of coal production and use can be
eased.
</P>
<P>
Thai Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Yingphan
Manasikarn said on the occasion that to address environmental
issues effectively, Asia-Pacific countries need regional and
international support in the form of technical assistance,
funding, capacity building and transfer of environmentally sound
technologies.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the committee will discuss
refinement and promotion of methodologies for integration of
environment and development, environmental aspects of coal-based
energy and its efficient use, and environmental management of
mineral resources development.
</P>
<P>
At the panel discussion this afternoon, participants discussed
ways to set standards and goals for environmental quality, when
monitoring and enforcement capabilities are lacking in many
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Several speakers recommended that economic instruments and
other fiscal measures be used as powerful tools for promoting
environmentally sound human behavior. Besides, environmental
legislation management standards, environmental reporting, natural
resource accounting, and fiscal policy tools are also important
measures in the protection of the environment.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Propose Special Market for Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that Malaysia will propose that a
specific market be set up for currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been given the responsibility by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to handle efforts to come
up with regulations for currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the establishment of a specific market for
currency trading was very important because the method used now
was not transparent and was open to abuse for the purpose of
manipulation and speculation.
</P>
<P>
"We know that all trading have specific markets. There is a
place to sell shares as well as commodities, there is a place to
sell anything and traders must be registered. But we find that in
currency trading there is no specific market and we do not know
who is trading," he told reporters at the Parliament House lobby
here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been voicing the need for supervision and
transparency in foreign currency trading because in its view, the
lack of these mechanisms had allowed for the currencies of certain
countries to be attacked by manipulators and speculators for their
own gains.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the mandate bestowed by the IMF and the World
Bank had given fresh impetus to Malaysia in its quest for more
transparent currency trading so that it could not be easily
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
He said that his Deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who is also Finance
Minister, had been given the responsibility to come up with the
proposals, including regulations deemed able to curb manipulative
and speculative activities in currency trading, he said.
</P>
<P>
"One of his proposals is sure to be that we must have a
specific market where these currency traders can register
themselves and get a seat number. If they want to trade they go
there and we know who is trading, where the money comes from, how
much credit they get from the bank. We must know all this because
only then can we trade," he said when asked what form the specific
market suggested should take.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the currency trading practiced now was
completely hidden was acknowledged by the money traders
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that with the lack of transparency in hedge fund
transactions, there appeared to be some double standards here when
some quarters had called for openness and transparency while for
some people including international financier George Soros, they
could undertake transactions secretively.

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law to Be Maintained in Hong Kong: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said he is
confident that the Judiciary will continue to uphold the rule of
law in Hong Kong by dispensing justice without fear or favor.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his first Policy Address this afternoon, Tung said a
credible and independent judicial system underpins Hong Kong's
present success. The Basic Law provides for the continuation of
the rule of law and the judicial system beyond July 1 with no
fundamental changes, and the judicial system continues to operate
fairly and independently as before.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the establishment of the Court of Final
Appeal of the HKSAR, for the first time in history Hong Kong has a
fully integrated system of courts. Another milestone in the
judicial system has been the establishment of a bilingual court
system in which the Chinese language can be used along with the
English language.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that further improvements will be made to the legal
aid system.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that the government is determined to maintain
the police force as one of the finest in the world and further
improve its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Let me make it clear that the SAR will not tolerate any form
of corruption," he stressed. "The SAR government is committed to
the fight against corruption in every area of public and private
life."
</P>
<P>
Talking about the system of government, Tung said his
administration is devoting attention to preparing for the election
of the first SAR Legislature and to the steady development of Hong
Kong's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We have just established the Electoral Affairs Commission to
oversee the elections, to ensure that they are carried out openly
and fairly," he said, adding that a vigorous, territory-wide
campaign to register voters and update the electoral roll will be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong has a dedicated, honest and efficient civil
service that has gained the deep respect of the local and
international community alike.
</P>
<P>
"I've tasked the Secretary for the Treasury to lead a special
group to develop and implement a target-based management process
to achieve continuous improvement in public services," he said.

<HEADLINE> To Improve People's Well-Being, Top Priority: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive
 of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), today
promised to improve well-being of the SAR people, describing it as
 the top priority for his government to improve housing, education
 and care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"I realize from the outset that this (the question of housing)
is a highly complex problem," said the Chief Executive while
delivering his first policy address before the Provisional
Legislative Council this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He stated: "I set my administration three main targets: to
build at least 85,000 flats a year in the public and private
sectors; to achieve a home ownership rate of 70 percent in ten
years; and to reduce the average waiting time for public rental
housing to three years."
</P>
<P>
Achieving these targets will be a considerable challenge, Tung
said, stressing that "my administration has responded vigorously
to the challenge." The Financial Department of the SAR government
has set up a special task force to attack the problem, known as
the Steering Committee on Land Supply for Housing.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will provide 120 hectares of land for
private housing up to March 1999, and an additional 260 hectares
in the following three financial years, he said. There will be
about 285 hectares of land for public sector housing over the same
 period, he added.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing demand from more international
professionals operating in Hong Kong, 117 hectares of land
sufficient for at least 9,000 large flats, will be sold before
March 2002 in addition to the 64 hectares already included in the
sales program up to March 1999, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need of major improvements to the
transport infrastructure for ensuring that all suitable land can
be used for housing, and the focus will be on high capacity,
environmentally friendly railway and road systems.
</P>
<P>
"Education is the key to the future of Hong Kong," Tung said,
noting that "our education system must be firmly rooted in the
needs of Hong Kong, must enable us to contribute to the
development of our country and must give us an international
outlook."
</P>
<P>
He said the SAR government will allocate 5 billion HK dollars
to establish a Quality Education Development Fund and will raise
recurrent expenditure on basic education by 7.6 percent in the
coming year.
</P>
<P>
"Caring for the elderly is the responsibility of every
family: we need to provide a sense of security, a sense of
belonging and a feeling of health and worthiness," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that for the elderly to feel secure, they must
first be financially secure.
</P>
<P>
"We will establish the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes in 1998
 so that in 20 to 30 years all the workforce will have provision
for their retirement," he said, adding that the SAR government
will increase monthly payment for the elderly by 380 HK dollars in
 the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
More important for the elderly than cash is a place to call
home and the effective delivery of other good services, he pointed
 out.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Replace Firefighters in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
today decided to replace in stages its firemen fighting the forest
fires in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Housing and Local Government Minister Ting Chew Peh said this
was decided by the Cabinet which discussed the haze situation and
efforts by the Malaysians to douse the forest fires in Sumatra and
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The government is very concerned with the well-being of the
Malaysian firemen there and also that of their families, he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the replacement exercise would begin in the
next few days and the Fire and Rescue Services Department had been
alerted.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 Malaysia firefighters went to Indonesia in late
September to help the Indonesian authorities deal with the fires
which are blamed for the haze blanketing several countries in the
region including Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Ting said the number of Malaysian firefighters in Kalimantan
would be increased from 200 to about 500 and the figure in Sumatra
would be reduced from 1,000 to less than 800.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysians were reportedly successful in putting out 80
percent of the fires in the areas assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, he said the replacement exercise would
not jeopardize firefighting operations in Malaysia which has more
than 8,000 firemen.
</P>
<P>
The minister praised the private sector for their contributions
towards helping local firemen in Indonesia and hoped that more
would come forward to offer generous donations.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Interest rate-sensitive stocks
underpinned a firmer close on the Australian share market amid
cautious optimism that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could
cut rates in the coming weeks.

The all ordinaries index ended at its high for the day, up 14.1
points at 2768.4.
</P>

the market" because of a general lack of direction domestically.
Economists also believe there is still an opportunity for the RBA
to cut rates.
</P>
<P>
The RBA today maintained its silence on rates following its
October board meeting Tuesday to consider monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index lifted 27.9 points to 4556.5, while
the all resources index added 2.7 points to 1361.0.

<P>
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
stronger today cheered by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)'s
silence on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The RBA board met Tuesday to consider monetary policy and in
the current climate of easier policy foreign exchange market
participants had feared its members might have given the go ahead
to lower the 5.0 percent cash rate today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 72.47 U.S. cents up from 72.30
previously.
</P>
<P>
"The market bought it initially on the no-rate-move decision by
the RBA from the low of 72.30 U.S. cents to these level," said
Rothschild Australia trader Paul Macarounas.
</P>
<P>
Many market participants believe that other windows of
opportunity for a rate cut remain, either after key jobs data
tomorrow or following third quarter inflation release on October
22.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, Australian dollar ended at 88.66 up from
88.14 against the Japanese yen and at 1.2761 up from 1.2689

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Govt to Resolve Boat People Issue: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said the
SAR government is developing strategies to resolve the remaining
aspects of Vietnamese boat people problem as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Tung said in his first Policy Address, which was delivered here
this afternoon, that for over 20 years Hong Kong has played an
outstanding part in coping with the burden of Vietnamese boat
people.
</P>
<P>
So far 143,000 refugees have been resettled to third countries,
69,000 migrants and illegal immigrants have been repatriated to
Vietnam. Today only 1,300 refugees and 800 migrants remain in Hong
Kong, to which recently have been added about 1,000 illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"We have done our part as citizens of the world. It is time to
bring this issue to a close one way or another," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SAR government is pursuing arrangements with the
Vietnamese authorities to secure a faster pace of repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"We are pressing the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and the international community to work harder to
arrange for resettlement of the remaining 1,300 refugees," he
said. "We will also continue to press the UNHCR to repay the debt
that is owed to Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said in pursuit of these objectives, the SAR government has
the full support of the Central People's Government. Tung himself
will also be urging the British government to discharge its
continuing moral responsibility to assist in reaching a full
solution to this problem.

<HEADLINE> FDI Projects Become New Point of Growth of China Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The input of foreign direct
investment (FDI) has accelerated the economic development in China
with FDI projects becoming a new point of growth of the national
economy, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 297,000 approved FDI projects as of August this
year, over 145,000 have started operation, employing more than
17.5 million people, said Hu Jingyan, deputy director general of
the Foreign Investment Administration under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a China Investment Policy Seminar organized by the
ministry, Hu said, in 1996 the actually paid-in foreign capital of
FDI projects made up close to 15 percent of the national total
investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the gross trade value of FDI enterprises reached
137 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, up 25 percent over the previous
year and making up 47 percent of the gross value of national
commodity import and export.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of FDI has accelerated the national
industrial restructuring, renovated a large number of state-owned
enterprises, improved the efficiency and level of national
industry, and fostered the national economy," the Chinese official
stressed.
</P>
<P>
With the further deepening of reform and opening and further
perfection of the market economic structure, FDI enterprises will
play a bigger role in the development of the national economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, since 1993 China has been the country with
the most FDI among the developing countries for four years in a
row, and ranked second in the world after the United States.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, held in conjunction with the '97 China (Hong Kong)
Investment Symposium, was aimed at explaining to local investors
the latest investment environment and policies of China's interior
areas.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Calls for Rational Approach for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif today underlined Kashmir as the root cause of tension in
South Asia and said peace and stability will remain a distant
dream unless the leaders of the region display restraint and adopt
a "rational approach."
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks in his note of thanks for an address by
British Queen Elizabeth II, who is on a six-day visit to Pakistan,
at the joint sitting of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The British Queen called upon the leaders of Pakistan and India
to show a high degree of statesmanship for the resolution of
contentious issues between them through talks.
</P>
<P>
"Reconciliation will take time but the effort must be made,"
she said. "I am convinced it will be worthwhile for the more than
one billion inhabitants of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Sharif agreed with the Queen on that statesmanship is required
for the resolution of the problems of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the leaders of this region display similar wisdom and
self-restraint and adopt a rational approach, South Asian peace
and stability will remain a distant dream," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, imperative to remove the main cause of the
tension that has afflicted South Asia for the last half a
century," he said, referring to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute with
India.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said Pakistan has taken the initiative to resume the
dialogue with India, hoping that India will reciprocate "our
sincerity by seriously addressing the Jammu and Kashmir question
and other outstanding issues in a structured and comprehensive
manner."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, true peace has been a stranger to South Asia,
the storm clouds of tensions have dominated the political
landscape of South Asia for far too long, the root cause is the
unresolved core issue of Jammu and Kashmir," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The pledge must be redeemed and the atrocities against the
people of Kashmir must be brought to an end," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister also underscored the plight of the
people of Afghanistan as a saga of human suffering, saying no
country in the world has suffered more from the tragedy of
Afghanistan than Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, have a vital interest in the restoration of
durable peace in that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured full support to the U.N. efforts to promote an
inter-Afghan dialogue aiming to establish a lasting peace in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Economic Policies of Central Government Not Applied in HK: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The economic and trade
legislation, policies and administrative measures of the central
government applicable to enterprises of China's inland will not be
applied to Hong Kong, a senior Chinese official reassured here
today.
</P>
<P>
The central government will not interfere in the economic and
trade affairs that fall within the high autonomy of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), An Min, assistant minister
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, told a China
investment policy seminar.
</P>
<P>
He described the application of the central government's
policies as "stopping at Luohu (Lo Wu) Bridge", which is situated
between the inland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, new forms of
cooperation will emerge in trade and economic areas between the
inland and Hong Kong on its original firm basis, expanding to new
areas and rising to higher levels, the Chinese official predicted.
</P>
<P>
To greet the early arrival of this date, the "one country, two
systems" principle should be unswervingly followed and the Basic
Law should be applied in a serious manner, to consolidate Hong
Kong's status as an international trade, finance, shipping and
information center, An Min said.
</P>
<P>
"The economic and trade relations between the two sides shall
further develop in accordance with international economic and
trade rules," he continued.
</P>
<P>
According to him, measures should be taken to fully guarantee
the participation of Hong Kong in multilateral and bilateral
economic and trade activities. As a separate customs region, HKSAR
may maintain and develop economic and trade ties with other
countries and regions independently in the name of "Hong Kong,
China", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will renew efforts to improve the investment
environment of the inland and, in particular, will adopt measures
to encourage more investors to the midwest of China.
</P>
<P>
China's inland has become the world's second largest recipient
of foreign investment, with significant contribution from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1996, Hong Kong accounted for 99 billion US
dollars, or close to 60 percent of the inland's utilized foreign
capital, making it the largest investor in the inland.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation to keep local businessmen informed
of the latest investment environment and policies of the inland,
with speakers coming from the inland's key economic-related
ministries and commissions.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held in conjunction with the '97 China (Hong
Kong) Investment Symposium which, entering its fourth year,
brought a record total of some 900 investment projects from 29
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR to Set Up Commission on Strategic Development, Tung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will set up a commission
on strategic development, with an aim to "keep up with" world
trends in competitive terms, said Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his first policy address before the Provisional
legislative Council, Tung said that Hong Kong's development
strategy will be based on two principles -- a free market economy
and a prudent fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Together with our emphasis on adding value, these
principles will uphold Hong Kong's competitiveness, maintain the
lifeblood of Hong Kong's economic development, and protect the
interests of every citizen."
</P>
<P>
"As this is an important issue with far reaching consequences,
the SAR government will set up a commission on strategic
development," Tung said, "I will be the chairman, and members of
the commission will include government officials, members from
industrial, commercial, financial and grass roots sectors, and
also academics."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the commission will be tasked to conduct

HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
described it as "the most fundamental task" for his government to
promote the well-being of the people, stressing the need to build
Hong Kong into a more prosperous and stable region.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his 42-page policy address in the building of the
Provisional Legislative Council this afternoon, Tung pointed out
that Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are closely linked with
those of the motherland and expressed his determination to
implement the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
"To promote the well-being of the people is the most
fundamental task of a responsible government," he said. "We must
work to build Hong Kong for ourselves and for future
generations: a Hong Kong that is civilized, prosperous, stable and
democratic, filled with a new vitality."
</P>
<P>
Tung outlined in his first policy address the priorities of his
 government in the future work as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Increase supply of land and build supporting infrastructure
to ensure that the target of constructing at least 85,000 flats a
year will be met, and build new major railways and new major
roads;
</P>
<P>
-- Set up a Quality Education Development Fund with 5 billion

curriculum and examination system;
</P>
<P>
-- Increase monthly payments for the elderly by 380 HK dollars,
 set up 12 elderly health centers in 1998-99 to provide preventive
 and curative services, and provide additional 23 social centers
for the elderly in 1998-2002;
</P>
<P>
-- Reform training and retraining programs to make workers more

workers for tomorrow's industries;

<P>
-- Continue to provide job training and retraining and services
 to help new citizens find employment;
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to prepare for the legislative elections scheduled
for May 1998;
</P>
<P>
-- Further improve services of the government officials and
employees to "promote the objective of managing for results";
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to sustain the rule of law and independent
judiciary, and improve police's professional training and
efficiency in combating crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Tung said Hong Kong has "incomparable advantages" such as: a
high-degree autonomy under "one country, two systems", abundant
financial reserves, social and economic systems that work well,
and a sound, comprehensive legal system.
</P>
<P>
"We are the southern gateway to China and an international
financial, trade and shipping center. Our future economy will also
 be strongly supported by the rapid development" in the inland
areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need for Hong Kong to "keep up with world trends
in competitive terms" and "maintain the vitality" of its economic
development, Tung said, "The SAR government will set up a
commission on strategic development" for this reason and he
himself will be its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive said that the policy of reform and opening
up in the motherland has given new energy to Hong Kong's
development. "The 15th Congress (of the Chinese Communist Party)
under the leadership of President Jiang Zemin has just set out the
 goal of building China into a major power by the middle of the
21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the prospects of the overall economic development of
Hong Kong and the motherland are bright, stressing the need for
Hong Kong and the inland areas of the motherland to raise their
cooperation to "new heights."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1,
he said: "We the people of Hong Kong have begun to write our own
history. Each step we take today will set our course for decades
to come."
</P>
<P>
As to the "one country, two systems" principle, he said that
Hong Kong and the motherland share the same fundamental
interests. "This is the basis for successfully implementing 'one
country, two systems'. It is also the starting point for the SAR
government when formulating policies for our relationship with
the motherland, and strategies for Hong Kong's long term
development," the Chief Executive said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he continued, the Basic Law gives "solemn and
inviolable legal protection for the "one country, two systems"
principle.
</P>
<P>
"In years gone by, the people of Hong Kong, mostly Chinese,
have created the miracle that is Hong Kong.... I sincerely hope
that each and every one, with the same sense of responsibility and
 commitment that we have towards our own families, will join hands
 to achieve our goals as we move steadily forward," Tung
concluded.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today
pledged that his administration will strive to improve the
environment for business in Hong Kong and maintain its economic
vitality.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the first Policy Address of the SAR before the
Provisional Legislative Council this afternoon, Tung said the
government's efforts will be directed to increasing Hong Kong's
external competitiveness, increasing friendliness to business
within Hong Kong and to promoting a healthy competitive
environment.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything to remove obstacles and constraints to
business development. We will give the private sector freedom to
set its own direction, to explore and to seize opportunities," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Talking about business friendly environment, Tung said Hong
Kong already has one of the world's most business friendly tax
regimes, the government's intention is to keep the tax regime
simple, predictable and competitive. Related government units are
also working closely with the private sector to cut red tape,
reduce costs of compliance and improve services.
</P>
<P>
He said that 98 percent of Hong Kong's businesses, employing
about two thirds of the workforce, are small enterprises. The
government is working on a scheme to help small and medium
enterprises seek loans from commercial banks to finance
pre-shipping activities.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will work to improve Hong Kong's
position as a premier financial center by maintaining a world
class supervisory regime without over-regulation, by providing
state-of-the-art financial infrastructure and a well trained,
adaptable workforce, and by maintaining the rule of law, a low and
predictable tax regime, an open market and a level playing field.

Tourism, which is Hong Kong's major earner of foreign exchange,
will continue to be stressed in government programs, he said. The
government will extend a loan of 100 million HK dollars to the Hong
Kong Tourist Association to start up an International Events Fund,
designed to bring together private sector partnerships to stage 50
major international events here over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the manufacturing industry should not be
neglected, Tung pointed out that innovation, adapting to new
technologies and developing new industries will always be
important for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to inject up to 500 million HK dollars into the
Applied Research Fund, specifically to support the
commercialization of research in information technology and other
high technology fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
"My aim is to make Hong Kong an innovation center not just for
ourselves, but for South China and the region, adding value to our
economic hinterland, from which in turn we draw benefit," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will ensure land supply for a number of
scientific and industrial developments.
</P>
<P>
The government will take more effective enforcement actions
against all forms of infringement against intellectual property
rights, especially the sale of pirated and counterfeit goods, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that key to Hong Kong's economic efficiency and
international competitiveness is openness and competitiveness
within Hong Kong's economy, and the SAR government is fully
committed to promoting competition.
</P>
<P>
In terms of overall economic development of the SAR and the
mainland, prospects are bright, he said, adding that with Hong
Kong's return to the motherland and with the government support,
the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland should
flourish comprehensively in all fields such as economy, finance,
trade, transport, culture, education, science and technology,
tourism and sports.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said today
that the SAR government will try to make Hong Kong a leader in the
information world of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
In his Policy Address delivered this afternoon, Tung said the
responsibilities of information technology (IT) coordination now
divided between several bureaus will be regrouped, and one Bureau
Secretary will lead and coordinate the work of all those
throughout the government organization involved in information
technology and the related areas of broadcasting and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
This bureau will also be responsible for coordinating overall
information technology development in Hong Kong, he said. The
bureau will also be responsible for formulating relevant policies,
laying down regulatory framework and commissioning pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will launch a five-year IT education
strategy to promote the use of IT to enhance teaching and
learning.
</P>
<P>
"Within five years, we are aiming to have teaching in at least
25 percent of the curriculum supported through IT. Within ten
years, we aim to see IT being applied comprehensively in school
life, and all our teachers and Secondary 5 graduates being able to
work competently with IT tools," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government aims to ensure that the private sector
has an open market and a well developed skills base which it can
use to build on the head start in the field of the hardware of IT
infrastructure. And the government has opened negotiations to
secure liberalization of international telecommunications services
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"My administration will harness the new technology to improve
its efficiency and services," he stressed. "The real challenge is
for the business sector, indeed for the whole community, to
experiment, adapt and develop these new tools to enlarge our
vision, conquer new markets and create new patterns of life for
our entire community," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first electronic nautical
chart, namely, software that contains hundreds of nautical charts
and a large amount of navigation information, is being installed
on seagoing ships.
</P>
<P>
The new chart was invented by Harbin Engineering University,
according to Hao Yanling, head of a research group, to make sure
that ship captains could check course, port, or beacon information
promptly, instead of laboriously looking through many books and
charts as in the past.
</P>
<P>
The electronic chart also analyses information from satellite,
Hao says, "If you want to calculate the distance between the ship
and any point, the only thing you have to do is to draw a line on
the computer screen, and you get the correct figure immediately,"
along with course, speed, wind speed, and other information.
</P>
<P>
If the ship is on a wrong heading or there is an obstacle
ahead, the monitoring system will warn the ship.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say that when connected with the operational
system, the electronic chart can automate navigation.

FUZHOU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan investors have more than
1,500 agriculture-related projects in Fujian province on the east
coast of China, involving nearly a billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Luo Fuzhi, from Taiwan, spent 300,000 US dollars last year
raising fish on 6.6-ha of leased land in Fujian's Zhangpu county,
and he is not worried about returns because the fish are doing
well.
</P>
<P>
Another investor put 20 million yuan into a 33-ha fish raising
base with 208 ponds in Fotan Township in the same county, and
produced 1.14 million fry in May, all of which are doing well.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation between Fujian and Taiwan began in 1985, and
Fujian has imported more than 1,500 new types of crops from
Taiwan, and some 400 pieces of produce-processing equipment, as
well as planting, breeding and processing technology.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Rules Out Currency Devaluation Possibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's currency, the taka,
will not devaluate further in the wake of massive erosion in the
value of most Southeast Asian currencies, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident and sure that there will be no reflection of the
Southeast Asian (currency) crisis in Bangladesh," the Financial
Express quoted Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria as saying
Tuesday at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister claimed that the economy in this South
Asian country is sound and is performing in full gear.
</P>
<P>
The minister asserted that the economy will be kept stable, and
there will be no change in the country's monetary policy or
exchange rate in the wake of the currency crisis in ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said one reason that Bangladesh will not change
the exchange rate is that Bangladesh's trade relations with South
Asian countries are not as extensive as with countries in North
America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
There has also been no impact of the crisis in neighboring
countries like India and Pakistan, the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Identifying currency convertibility in the capital account as
one of the reasons behind the crisis, the minister said that
Bangladesh is yet to make its currency convertible in the capital
account.
</P>
<P>
The economy of Bangladesh is performing well and growing
steadily despite disruptions caused by various problems like power
shortage, the minister stated.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of outbound
passengers carried by Thai Airways International (THAI) in fiscal
1997 dropped by 30 percent and inbound passengers by between 10-15
percent, THAI President Thamnoon Wanglee said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the exact figures of THAI's performance in fiscal 1997
are not yet available, it is estimated that judging by the drop in
the numbers of travelers to and from Thailand, THAI's profits
might have slid by 10 to 15 percent for fiscal 1997, which ended
on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the baht since July 2 had caused losses of
3.5 billion baht (95 million US dollars) in the last quarter of
fiscal 1997 alone, the Bangkok Post today quotes Thamnoon as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During fiscal 1996, the national flag carrier generated 78
billion baht (3 billion dollars) in income, with a 4.5 percent net
profit from the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the depreciation of the baht and economic downturn,
Thais have refrained from overseas traveling.
</P>
<P>
Beginning October 1, THAI has raised its fares by 5 percent for
all classes on Japanese routes and for first and business class
tickets on flights serving the United States, while fares of all
classes to and from Europe, Australia and New Zealand have risen
by 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Makes Efforts to Develop Renewable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
making great efforts to develop renewable energy, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The development of renewable energy gets great attention in the
national energy program and is aimed at providing energy
particularly in rural areas, Endro Utomo Notodisuryo, director
general for electricity and energy development, said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a tropical country, Indonesia is blessed with abundant
renewable energy resources such as bio-mass, solar energy, wind
energy and geothermal energy, the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the proportion of renewable energy in the
total energy supply is still insignificant, less than 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has taken several measures to enhance
the production and utilization of renewable energy. They include
international cooperation to seek financial support, transfer of
technologies and exchange of information, market development and
tax exemption for renewable energy equipment, technical training
and lifting small power purchase tariff for private and
cooperative sectors.
</P>
<P>
Recently the government also launched a project aimed at
providing electricity to 1 million households within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The growth of demand for energy in Indonesia in the recent 10
years was 10 percent per annum, higher than the 2 percent annual
growth of the world energy consumption, said Notodisuryo.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 80 percent of Indonesia's energy comes from
oil and natural gas, but coal, hydropower and solar power have
increased sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that at present only 70 percent of Indonesia's
62,000 villages have electricity.

<HEADLINE> Mini Yuanmingyuan to Be Showed in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese artists have completed
the recreation of the landscape of Beijing's Yuanmingyuan
(Yuanming Garden), which was destroyed 137 years ago in invasions
of Beijing by foreign armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The miniature Yuanmingyuan will be soon displayed in the east
coast city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Some 140 artists spent four years on the miniature version of
the so-called "Garden of Ten Thousand Gardens", whose Renaissance
architecture was brought to the ground by French and British
forces in 1860. The eight allied powers then pillaged and burned
the garden a second time during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.
</P>
<P>
By using maps and pictures drawn by imperial court painters of
the Qing Dynasty, the artists made 4,198 copies of its
architecture, a 30th the size of the originals.
</P>
<P>
The artist Liu Zuo, from Langfang city in Hebei province, and
his group of associates made the large creation out of an
unconventional material - Chinese sorghum straw.
</P>
<P>
The tiny, delicate buildings and 40 islands connected by
ornamental bridges around 250 hills will be seen in the Tianjin
Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
Organizers leased 5.3 hectares of land for the 3.8 million yuan
exhibition, which was paid for by five companies from Beijing and
Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Peso Further Slides Amid Sentiments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency of peso
has further slid during the past few days, breaking the
psychological mark of 35 pesos to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso depreciated to an average of 35.537 pesos per dollar
on Tuesday, hitting an intra-day record low of 35.981 pesos
despite the reimposition of a three-tired volatility band on
trading between the peso and the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The Bankers Association of the Philippines imposed a
two-percent volatility band starting Tuesday. According to the
rule, if the peso fluctuates beyond two percent of the reference
rate, the trading will be halted for 30 minutes. After resumption,
the band would be narrowed down to one percent and after three
recessions, the trading would be suspended for the whole day.
</P>
<P>
However, the rule backfired on Tuesday. The peso breezed down
by two percent to 35.625 pesos per dollar from 34.926 pesos per
dollar within half an hour of the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
After business was restarted, another vertical drop of one
percent soon brought the peso down to the all-time low of 35.981
pesos. The Central Bank was forced to step in to halt the slide by
selling U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the peso also drew local bourses to
new lows. The 30-share composite index of the Philippine Stock
Exchange fell by 40.61 points to close at 1920.63 points after
declining 68.43 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market failed to firm up because market
sentiments were for the peso to weaken due to many factors, one of
which is the rising demand for the dollar by companies importing
goods for Christmas and New Year.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor is foreign investors' confidence being
eroded by the country's quick changing of policies against the
current currency meltdown, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank imposed a 1.5 percent volatility band before
the regional financial turmoil and abandoned it on July 11 in the
face of sharp falls of the peso and other currencies.
</P>
<P>
To arrest the free fall of the peso, monetary authorities
tightened money supply in the market by raising the Central Bank's
overnight borrowing rate and commercial banks' liquidity reserve
rates to record highs, but then reduced them very quickly.
</P>
<P>
The changes signaled to the investors that Manila lacks
effective ways to handle the financial woes, analysts said.
However, monetary officials insisted that it is necessary to take
these steps.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that monetary authorities' actions also brought
about another grave and sensitive issue in the country. The
interest rates are soaring, making businessmen shy away from
borrowing money and the cost of production higher.
</P>
<P>
From only 14 percent on Wednesday last week, the average
interbank overnight loan rate has gradually climbed to Tuesday's
160 percent. The benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill rate also jumped
to 20 percent from 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
To ease the liquidity crunch that caused the higher interest
rates, the Central Bank has decided to reopen its overnight
lending facility starting today at a lower rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
It stopped lending overnight funds two months ago to banks
which were suspected of making profits by using their excess funds
to speculate against the peso.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the right thing to do now is to regain the
investors' confidence through correct and stable policies.
Monetary authorities have expressed confidence that the country's
economy would survive the turmoil and become more healthy and
dynamic.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh left for Japan today on a three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
He is being accompanied by a strong entourage, which includes
Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently Industry Minister Korn
Dabbaransi, Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya, Foreign Minister
Prachuab Chaiyasarn, Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee and a
number of leading business executives.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at boosting bilateral economic and trade
ties and investment.
</P>
<P>
According to government spokesman Varathep Rattanakorn, the
prime minister told the cabinet on Tuesday that Thailand's
economic downturn would not be the main issue on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Varathep said cooperation in the development of the Mekong
river sub-region would be discussed, in the context of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and broader Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chavalit is expected to pay a courtesy call
on the Japanese emperor and hold talks with his counterpart
Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
The Thai delegation will also meet Japanese private sector
representatives from key industries to brief them about Thailand's
policy on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was reported that Thailand will ask Japan to extend
the repayment terms for debts incurred by Thai private firms and
seek cooperation to allow Thai companies to buy back controlling
shares which have been acquired by Japanese shareholders, once the
Thai economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest foreign investor in Thailand and has
played a major role in contributing to the 17.2 billion US dollar
standby credit, arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
to help Thailand shore up its foreign reserves.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine May Raise Import Duties on Consumer Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government is
considering an increase in import duties on consumer goods by 2 to
2.5 percent in a bid to save the country's crumbling light
industry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament Tuesday, Ukraine's Industrial Policy
Minister Vasyl Gureev described the light industry situation as
critical. He said the production of light industry in 1996 was
only 16 percent of that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under a program to boost light industry production, the
government had pledged to spend 11.3 million hryvnas (6.1 million
U.S. dollars) on renovating the sector in 1996 and 55.9 million
hryvnas (30 million dollars) this year. But the sector received
only 510,000 hryvnas (276,000 dollars) in 1996 and none in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result, foreign-made commodities, including toilet tissues,
napkins, sausage, cheese and many other daily necessities, flooded
the Ukrainian market, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In another move to reinvigorate the sector, the government and
the National Bank of Ukraine may offer long-term credit to
indigenous enterprises on preferential terms, he said.

<HEADLINE> OECD Agrees to Admit Russia in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
Donald Johnston said here today that OECD has agreed in principle
to admit Russia but has not decided on when to grant the country
membership.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference, Johnston praised Russia's
achievements in establishing a market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Russia still has much to do and has to
complete all required reforms to standardize its economy before
its entry into the economic organization.
</P>
<P>
So it is still too early to talk of the exact date to
incorporate Russia as a OECD member, said Johnston, who arrived
here on Sunday for a working visit.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said realizing a balanced budget and
formulating tax laws serve as a base for Russia's present reforms.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that there are some negative facts existing
in Russia's economic development, mainly slow privatization,
inefficient medium and small-sized enterprises, and an absence of
laws for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
OECD, headquartered in Paris, groups 29 countries.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Hold Referendum on Entry into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian National Assembly
decided today to hold a referendum on November 16 on the country's
entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The referendum move was adopted by a two-third majority.
Opposition members of parliament withdrew from voting as a sign of
protest.
</P>
<P>
NATO decided in early July to admit Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic into the organization. Poland and the Czech
Republic will not conduct any referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, however, declared at the start that it would hold a
referendum, but mainly to survey the public opinions on the
issue. The result of the ballot would have no bearings on the
government's policy on the nation's entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
The government changed its original intention later under the
pressure from the opposition and declared that the result of the
poll would determine whether or not Hungary should join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution on referendum also covered land purchase
by foreigners in addition to the NATO issue.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties opposed the phrasing of questions for the
referendum and deemed it necessary to hold separate referendums on
the two different issues.
</P>
<P>
Recently, they collected nearly 300,000 signatures, urging the
government to conduct a referendum on their requests.
</P>
<P>
Today, when the government put the draft resolution to vote,
all the opposition parties withdrew from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Horn Gyula said in a TV interview
Monday that there were no political or legal obstacles to the
referendum advocated by the government.
</P>
<P>
He accused opposition parties of setting obstacles to thwart
the smooth holding of the referendum as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kovacs Laszlo said at the National
Assembly Tuesday that the referendum could not be postponed due to
the tight schedule. Otherwise, he said, Hungary would possibly be
excluded from NATO.

MOSCOW, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Tarasov said today that Russia will not give up
its role in Balkan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov made the remarks at a news conference when a reporter
asked why Russia had not been invited to attend the meeting of
defense ministers of southeast European countries, which was held
last Friday in Bulgaria's capital Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said defense ministers of some member countries
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and participating
countries of the Partnership for Peace Program attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said it was inappropriate for the organizer to make the
conference have the nature of a "bloc" and to restrict
participants according to their proximity to the NATO and its
membership.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov reiterated that it is Russia's main principle and
position to continue to participate and promote the process of
stability and security in this region.

</P>
<P>
There are altogether 22 countries or regions investing in
Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Large Batch of Drug Seized in Northern Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Highway police in northern
Thailand Monday seized 598,000 amphetamine pills, a kind of
habit-forming stimulant, and arrested the man who transported
them, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest quantity of narcotic drugs seized so far
this year in the country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, highway police stopped a BMW car for a
search at a checkpoint in Phayao province in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
They found boxes of amphetamine pills, also known as "speed
pills" locally, in packets on the back seat.
</P>
<P>
The driver, Ilyas Maseng, 25, was then arrested. He said he had
been hired for 3,000 baht (81 U.S. dollars) to drive the car from
a BMW center in Chiang Rai to a client at a bus terminal in
Lampang province. Both provinces are in northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Tuesday, police said the seizure was
part of an ongoing narcotics suppression operation along the
country's northernmost border, which is often infiltrated by drug
smugglers from the opium-producing golden triangle.

According to official sources, industrial zones are being set
up in areas of Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Myaungmya, Hinthada, Myeik,
Yenangyaung and Pyay.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 industrial zones planned in Myanmar, those in the

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Privatize Loss-Making State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
determined to privatize the country's loss-making state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) as a matter of principle, not at under any
pressure, said well-informed sources from the Bangladesh
Privatization Board (PB) today.
</P>
<P>
The PB has already drafted a legal framework to be placed
before Parliament to pave the way for the government to privatize
the SOEs, PB Chairman Kazi Zafar Ullah stated Wednesday during his
dialogue with economic reporters.
</P>
<P>
The draft, the PB chief said, will be sent to the Ministry of
Law for its voting before being placed in Parliament so that all
hurdles could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
"We have laid the foundation of privatization," the PB chief
said, "Now the pace will be accelerated."
</P>
<P>
"We want to make units more profit-making and efficient," he
added, "We want to reduce our staggering losses of 434 billion
taka (about 977.47 million U.S. dollars) of different SOEs in last
25 years."
</P>
<P>
The PB has finalized 32 SOEs for privatization, the PB chief
stated, adding that out of those, the board has already issued
letters of intent for handing over nine SOEs.
</P>
<P>
Government shares of nine other SOEs are now being sold with
the approval of the prime minister, the PB chief continued.
</P>
<P>
The PB chief also emphasized the need for mobilization of
public opinion in favor of privatization and called for media
support and coverage in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Haze Covers Indonesia's Capital, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The hazardous haze caused by
forest fires in central and east Java is also affecting life in
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, although its millions of residents
have not noticed it, an environmental impact control official
said.
</P>
<P>
The haze is hanging at an altitude of 3,000 feet above the
earth's surface, Nabiel Makarim, deputy head of the Environmental
Pollution Control Agency said here last night.
</P>
<P>
Based on satellite imaging records, the haze shrouding Jakarta
is quite thick and contains particles that may pose a threat to
the human respiratory system. "We all have to be careful," Makarim
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, head of the National Meteorology and Geophysics Agency
Sri Diharto said the haze also covered the Sunda Straits, one of
the busiest water ways in the country.
</P>
<P>
He warned all airplanes and ships to stay alert while crossing
the Sunda Straits.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged drought this year, fires have ravaged
about 300,000 hectares of forests in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Irian
Jaya and Java islands in the country.
</P>
<P>
The fires in the thick forests have generated dangerous
pollution levels in the affected areas and neighboring countries,
such as Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Former Sri Lankan President Found Guilty of Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Presidential
Commission of Inquiry has found former President Ranasinghe
Premadasa guilty of conspiring the assassination of
parliamentarian Lalith Athulathmudali in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the commission today quoted a report of the
commission submitted to President Chandrika Kumaratunga on Tuesday
as saying that without the former president's order, no one would
dare to carry out the assassination, in which Athulathmudali was
shot dead on April 23, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested to indict three other persons
including Western Provincial Council Member U.L. Seneviratne, who
were believed to be involved in the murder of Athulathmudali.
</P>
<P>
The commission also found former cabinet minister Sirisena
Cooray guilty of refusing to appear before the commission for
hearing. It therefore recommended Cooray be deprived of his civic
rights for seven years.
</P>
<P>
Athulathmudali initiated a motion of impeachment against the
then president Premadasa while he was a minister in Premadasa's
cabinet in 1991. He later formed the Democratic United National
Front.
</P>
<P>
He was shot dead while addressing a political rally in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Premadasa was himself assassinated a week later while
participating in a May Day parade.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Urges Support for Proposed Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
Tuesday appealed to his Communist allies in parliament not to
bring down the government over proposed welfare cuts in the 1998
draft budget.
</P>
<P>
Reforming the welfare state "is the last and indispensable step
on our march toward Europe," Prodi told Parliament in a nationally
televised speech.
</P>
<P>
He said however the proposed budget was open to further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The government says the budget cuts are needed to reduce
Italy's deficit, and thus allow the country to meet the criteria
for participation in the European Union's single currency, set to
debut in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Communist Refoundation, who won only 8 percent of the vote in
the last election but had the balance of power in the lower house
of parliament, says the 1998 draft budget measures cut too deep
into social welfare and pension benefits, and don't do enough to
stimulate employment.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Communist Refoundation Fausto Bertinotti had
indicated that his party would vote against the measures, a move
that could prompt a government crisis.

<HEADLINE> Russians Survive six-month Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Russians have landed in
Phuket, Southern Thailand, after six months adrift on their yacht
without food supplies, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Vidimir Medvedev, 44, and his son Maxim, 14, said they had
survived on rain water and what they could catch after losing
their supplies and communication gear in an accident in the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The Russians were found by two villagers on Sunday who took them
to a Phuket hospital where they were admitted.
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, Dr. Nauvarat Somnam quoted the Russians as
saying their yacht had struck a rock in the Indian Ocean while
heading from South Africa to Australia. They collected rain water
and used telecommunication antennae as spears and rods to catch
fish and prawns, she said.
</P>
<P>
They had set sail from Russia on August 1995 on an
around-the-globe trip in which they called at Japan, Canada, the
United States and South Africa. Their last port of call had been
Cape Town, South Africa, which they left on April 27.

<HEADLINE> Maradona's Urine Sample too Small for DNA Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona's urine
sample is too small to be submitted for DNA tests, and the
legendary soccer star said Tuesday that somebody switched
his urine sample with an aim to ruin his career.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who will celebrate his 37th birthday later this
month, was tested positive for "illegal substances" after the
match against Argentinos Juniors on August 24.
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't enough urine for a (DNA) test," Maradona's
lawyer, Hugo Wortman Jofre, told public after meeting with
investigating Judge Claudio Bonadio.
</P>
<P>
Bonadio, who has ruled that Maradona can continue playing until
his investigation is completed, later said he would ask forensic
experts if the urine sample could be tested by others with better
technology.
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who has confessed to indulge in drugs before the
August game.
</P>
<P>
His positive test stopped the fifth comeback of his
controversial career. Despite Bonadio's ruling to allow him to
play again, Maradona has missed Boca's last three games because of
a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
Maradona has twice received 15-month bans for drugs-taking. In
1991, he tested positive for cocaine while playing for Italy's
Napoli. In 1994, he was refused to compete in the World Cup after
testing positive for a cocktail of performance-enhancing drugs,
including ephedrine.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Panama will create a
specialized University of the Americas near the shores of the
Panama Canal, a Panamanian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Johana Gonzalez, an official of the Panamanian Assembly, said
the bill to create the university was passed by Panama's
parliament and will be ratified by Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares.
</P>
<P>
This inter-American education project is part of a wide-ranging
plan the current Panamanian administration is undergoing along the
canal, which will be turned over to Panama at the end of 1999 by
the United States in accordance with the Torrijos-Carter treaty.
</P>
<P>
The military bases and houses left by the U.S. Army in the
canal area are being turned into schools, universities, tourist
zones and industrial and commercial centers.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Carlos Smith said the institution will play a major
role in implementing changes in Panama and the hemisphere. The
new university will serve as a model for universities in the
future, which should have largely social prospects.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the university aims to foster research,
gain and disseminate knowledge, especially in social and education
oriented subjects, said Smith.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Farmers Object to the Import of U.S Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chilean farmers have expressed
their objections to the government's decision to give a green
light to the import of U.S. wheat.
</P>
<P>
Chile's National Agriculture Society Chairman Ricardo Ariztia
said the decision has alarmed experts and members of society.
</P>
<P>
Chile's purchases of wheat from the U.S. were suspended in
March 1996 because of the existence in some American States of a
fungus that attacks wheat.
</P>
<P>
Ariztia said by agreeing to import U.S. wheat, Chile may be
putting its own agricultural products in danger.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chile has a wheat-cultivating area of 400,000
hectares, which provides jobs to 30,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Acts to Arrest Soaring Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will reopen its overnight lending window starting
today to ease the liquidity crunch that caused interbank call loan
rate to hit a record high of 160 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank, said the bank
will lend one-day funds at a rate of 15 percent, local newspaper
the Manila Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The bank stopped lending overnight funds to commercial banks
two months ago to curb speculative activities against the peso.
Monetary officials suspected that these banks were using their
excess funds to bet against the peso, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Central Bank will also bring down its
overnight borrowing rate, which jumped to a record high of 30
percent in July and August, from 14 percent to 12 percent starting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank is also studying the possibility of cutting
banks' liquidity reserves beyond the scheduled one percent
reduction each on October 15 and November 15, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The liquidity reserves, a portion of the reserve requirement on
a bank's deposits that can be used to purchase government
securities, currently stand at six percent.
</P>
<P>
Starting early last week, the Central Bank has been
intensifying its mopping up operations to make sure money supply
levels in the country are kept within the target of the
International Monetary Fund programs.
</P>
<P>
It increased its overnight borrowing rate from 12 percent to 14
percent or even higher, triggering a funds shortfall that led to
the surge in the cost of money.
</P>
<P>
From only 13.59 percent last Wednesday, the average interbank
call loan rates climbed to 35.28 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill rate also rose to a six-year
high of 20 percent on Monday from only 14.957 percent the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
Higher interest rates made businessmen shy away from bank
credits, or raised the cost of production. In the long run, they
will erode the country's economy.

CAIRO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today for
their first talks in eight months on the stalled Middle East peace
progress.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports reaching here, the two leaders met
at the Erez checkpoint on the border between Israel and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, the meeting has begun," reports quoted an
unidentified Palestinian official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two leaders was the first since peace
talks were suspended in March after Israel launched a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The peace process was thrown into a deeper crisis when Islamic
extremists launched a series of suicide bombings over the past few
months which have killed 24 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting came after U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
arrived in the region on a mission to revive the peace process
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu have not met since February 9 when they
held two hours of talks also at the Erez checkpoint.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Means to Keep Freshness of Bottled Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a capsule to
use in bottled beer to extend the freshness from three or four
months to a half year or longer.
</P>
<P>
The patented technique, which helps keep the air out of beer,
is especially useful in rural and remote areas where oxidization
and deterioration of bottled beer has been a big problem. Under
ordinary conditions, bottled beer can be kept for three or four
months, and in summer it can be kept for only about 20 days.
</P>
<P>
The technique was developed by Yang Wenyuan, a senior
technician at the Nanjing Institute of Electronics, and Li Xuzhi,
an associate professor at a university in Nanjing, after more than
8,000 experiments over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
With the capsule, oxygen in bottled beer can be reduced from
one milligram to 0.03 milligrams within two days. Experiments at
three large breweries in Shandong and Beijing showed that the
capsule does a remarkable job of preserving the freshness of
bottled beer.
</P>
<P>
One Nanjing company has started producing the new
capsules.

our ninth meeting," said Stark, who narrowed their head-to-head
score to 3-6.

ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The First Conference of Parties to
the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)
convened in Rome today. Developing countries immediately called
for material and financial support to prevent desertification.
</P>
<P>
"The Group of 77 and China", said Tanzanian Minister of State
Bakari Mgonde, "called for all the parties to provide equal
treatment in terms of provisioning available resources to
developing country."
</P>
<P>
"Success in combating desertification and drought, particularly
in developing countries, will depend on their ability to acquire
and utilize the appropriate science and technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
J.E. Afful, Ghanaian environment minister, said African
countries need the continuing support of the international

desertification.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegate John Garamendi argued that there is not a lack of
commitment on the part of the United States to assist developing
countries in their effort to combat desertification.

<HEADLINE> Damaged Grotto Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LANZHOU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Binling Temple Grotto in
northwest China's Gansu province, which was severely damaged, is
going to be repaired and reinforced by the Northwest Branch of the
Railway Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Binling Grotto is on the upper end of the Liujiaxia Reservoir
and is one of China's oldest grottoes, with an inscription that
dates back to the Western Qin Dynasty and has tremendous artistic
and historic value.
</P>
<P>
The Liujiaxia Reservoir has caused more rainfall in the
vicinity, and rain water seeped into the grotto through crevices,
leaving the temple inside unstable. The rain water also
accelerated the weathering process and there are cracks in several
places, leaving some parts in very dangerous condition. It is
feared that if the structure is not repaired soon, it will
collapse and destroy the grotto.
</P>
<P>
The northwest branch of the Railway Research Institute is in
charge of the repair project and will reinforce the grotto and use
horizontal holes as drains for water flow, to lessen damage that
rain has done to the rock.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that this project will be finished by 1999.

<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexican airline
denied today that it is leaving Colombia due to the security
problems related to drug traffickings over the past few months in
that South American country.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of Mexicana de Aviacion in Colombia, Marinao
Ortega, said, "the company does not have any intention to withdraw
from Colombia."
</P>
<P>
Mexicana de Aviacion flights between Mexico City and Santa Fe
de Bogota are sufficiently healthy, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
Mexicana officials said Sunday they were considering the
suspension of flights to Colombia if the Colombian authorities
could not guarantee the security of the company`s airplanes which
have been used to transport drugs.
</P>
<P>
Ortega said, "There are certain presures for all airliners
traveling to this country, but these are security matters that
will be handled correctly."
</P>
<P>
The senior executive expressed his confidence that Colombian
authorities will take measures to prevent drugs from entering the
country through Mexican airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Mexicana de Aviacion schedules four 156-passenger flights a
week between the two capitals, which covers 50 percent of the
flights between the two countries. Another 50 percent is covered
by Colombia's Avianca.
</P>
<P>
About 31 kilograms of cocaine were discovered hidden in a
Mexicana airplane on the Bogota-Mexico City route last Tuesday and
a similar case was found in August.

Harbin, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Two years ago, when Xuan Wenjie
lost her job in Harbin, the capital of northest China's
Heilongjiang province, she broke down and cried -- but now, she
has become the boss of a wholesale market and has become quite
well known.
</P>
<P>
When the state-owned sector in this city started reforms,
300,000 workers found themselves out of work. In order to help
them find jobs, the local government made all possible
arrangements. It allocated re-employment funds and relief funds,
and provided job skill training. The labor department also set up
labor markets and job recommendation services.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200,000 laid-offs in Harbin who, like Xuan, have
found re-employment, accounting for 60 percent of all the jobless
workers in this celebrated old industrial base.
</P>
<P>
The local government also encourages private enterprises and
the service sector has become an important re-employment
channel. The government also supports increased state-owned
enterprise reforms, by offering help to workers, for example, to
open enterprises, and encourages workers to find jobs themselves.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that, with the going of reforms, unemployment is
inevitable, and how to solve the re-employment question is still a
problem.

QUITO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran Defense Minister Ramiro
Ricaurte denied his country plans to buy Sukhoi Sur-27 aircraft,

Ricaurte said the allegation is by no means true. While

army for external and internal security."

Ricaurte said.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador and Peru have not reached a solution so far on their
border dispute that led to war between the two in early 1995.

"We are confident both countries will reach a dignified,
peaceful and just solution, while at the same time we are ready to

BELGRADE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Westendorp,
representative of the Dayton peace agreement, called for the
elimination of political leaders and party influence in the
operation of the Pale Radio and TV station, reported the Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug today.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Momcilo Krajisnik, a member of the presidency of
the Republic of Bosnia, Westendorp also urged Krajisnik to
withdraw from the station's management commission, saying it was
the precondition before the station's control and management were
restored.
</P>
<P>
However, in a speech to station staff members on strike today,
Dragan Kalinic, chairman of the National Assembly (parliament) of
the Republic of Srpska, accused the international community of
interfering in the republic's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The international community has no right to decide the
arrangement of personnel affairs. The right to appoint and remove
members of the working staff of the Pale Radio and TV station is
the responsibility of the Serb government of Srpska, the
parliament leader said.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred soldiers of the NATO-led Stabilization Force
(SFOR) last Wednesday seized two Serb radio and TV stations --
Banjuluka and Pale -- in a bid to silence propaganda hostile to
the Dayton treaty signed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The station's employees have been on strike since last Saturday
in protest against the SFOR's action, which was seen as another
sign of NATO's get-tough policy on Serb factions who are not
complying with the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Recycling Waste in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The long-imagined dream of
turning waste into cash became a reality recently in south China's
Guangzhou, where a new environmental protection project has
changed the city's disposal methods.
</P>
<P>
The city collects over 4,000 tons of garbage daily, and its two
major garbage dumps only have a 3 or 4-year capacity, so the city
was faced with a mounting garbage problem and decreasing dump
space.
</P>
<P>
However, the newly established Sanxin Fertilizer Plant, which
has a daily disposal capacity of 1,500 tons, is expected to ease
this pressure. It uses new technology to disinfect and sort the
garbage, recycling iron and steel, and using plastics, rubber, and
tires for petroleum and diesel oil, and remaining organic
materials to produce 167 varieties of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
The plant can produce 50,000 tons of highly-effective
biological fertilizer annually, dispose of 5,600 tons of waste
plastic, and produce 4,000 tons of petroleum and diesel oil.
</P>
<P>
The city's Environmental and Sanitation Administration Bureau
is holding talks with an American company to establish a garbage
disposal plant with a daily capacity of 1,000 tons, which can
produce acetic acid and alcohol through a gasification process.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou spent 500 million yuan last year on the Datansha
Resources Power Plant, which generates electricity by burning 900
tons of garbage every day.

<P>
ROME, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Another strong earthquake hit
central Italy earlier this morning, causing further damage to the
ancient basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi.
</P>
<P>
The latest quake, measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale, was
centered in the mountainous Colfiorito region on the borders of
Umbria and Tuscany, in the same area as the two stronger tremors
that occurred on September 26.
</P>
<P>
Officials said here there were no fatalities from the new
tremor that occurred at 01:24 (23:24 GMT Monday), but two women
were injured amid general panic.
</P>
<P>
Last month's quakes killed 12 people, left some 40,000 homeless
and caused damage to many historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
According to the monks of Saint Francis of Assisi, today's tremor
brought down more stones from the pediment of the basilica, whose
treasures include frescoes by Giotto and the 13th century painter
Cimabue.
</P>
<P>
The monks said the tremor also caused cracks in a ceiling of
the papal apartments. The September 26 earthquake brought down two
vaulted domes covered with frescoes by Cimabue.

<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Local firefighters have
controlled the fire raging across the Sino-Kazakhstan border in
northwesternmost China's Altay region, today's China Daily quoted
sources from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as saying.
</P>
<P>
"On Sunday afternoon, about 170 firefighters in Altay's Habahe
County put out the fire, which had crossed into the county's
Qibengde district on Saturday afternoon to form a 200-meter wide
fire belt, devastating more than 660 hectares of land, mainly
covered by grasses and shrubbery," Yin Juxian, an official with
the Xinjiang Meteorological Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Yin's observatory monitored by satellite a 2,600-hectare fire
that broke out in Kazakhstan on September 22.
</P>
<P>
Wind pushed heavy smoke into neighboring Altay from September
24 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the 117,600-square-kilometer Altay, one of the
cleanest regions in China, complained that for the first time they
breathed polluted air.
</P>
<P>
According to Yin, Kazakhstan border authorities informed their
Chinese counterparts in Altay on October 2 that the overwhelming
fire might attack the vicinity.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The output value of the
township enterprises and township industrial businesses of east
China's Jiangxi Province recorded a year-on-year increase of 45
percent each in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, more than 20 percent of the
rural per capita income was generated from township enterprises in
the first half of the year, and the rural per capita income had an
11.9 percent growth over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the growth to the provincial
government's efforts to develop township industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages the building of township industrial
zones in the outskirts of towns with good water and power supply,
transportation, and communications. It also places importance on
creating better investment climate for these industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the 267 township industrial zones in
Jiangxi realized an output value totaling 17 billion yuan, with
pre-tax profits of 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The growth of township industrial zones has strongly backed the
economic development of small towns, a local official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
set October 17 as International Day for the Eradication of Poverty
due to the fact that global poverty remains widespread.
</P>
<P>
According to fact sheets issued by the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) here today, almost one-third or 1.3 billion people live on
less than a U.S. dollar a day, the poverty line set by the World
Bank for international comparison.
</P>
<P>
UNDP also gave the following figures to alert the world to the
severity of the issue:
</P>
<P>
-- some 840 million go hungry every day and face food
insecurity;
</P>
<P>
-- well over a billion lack access to safe water;
</P>
<P>
-- nearly a billion are illiterate;
</P>
<P>
-- women comprise 70 percent of the world's poor;
</P>
<P>
-- nearly a third of the people in the least-developed
countries are not expected to live to the age of 40;
</P>
<P>
-- half of Sub-Saharan African population will live in absolute
poverty by 2000;
</P>
<P>
-- more than 100 million live in poverty in industrialized
nations;
</P>
<P>
-- in these countries 37 million are jobless;
</P>
<P>
"Unless the growth in impoverishment is halted, the gap between
the poor and the rich will widen further, challenging
international peace and security," UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP has allocated 60 percent of its core resources for the
least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Agreements to reduce poverty have been reached by global
conferences in the 1990s, among them the target of reducing severe
and moderate malnutrition by half among children under age five by
2000 from the 1990 level.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Laser Test May Be Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
has canceled the laser test at a satellite because of whether and
technical problems and it may have no more opportunity to schedule
another time for test because of the lifetime of the target.
</P>
<P>
The department planned to fire a ground-based laser at an
elderly Air Force satellite, but Pentagon spokesman Mike
Doubleday said today that poor weather and technical glitches
would likely force the experiment to be scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
Testers first tried to fire the Army's Mid-Infra Advance
Chemical Laser, or MIRACL, on Saturday, but a software breakdown
thwarted the attempt. They made a second effort last night, but
the test was again canceled because of poor weather over the White
Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
Since the target satellite's battery is fading rapidly, the
test may be canceled, and no future tests have been scheduled. The
military does not have another near-obsolete satellite on which to
experiment.
</P>
<P>
"There is some question that there will be any further
opportunities" for the test, Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the experiment could mark a step toward
approval of space warfare technology. But Pentagon argued that the
test was to determine U.S. satellites' vulnerability, saying a
nation increasingly dependent on satellites must have the
technology to protect them.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steps up Air Patrol in No-fly Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on Tuesday
that U.S. air patrols in U.S.-imposed no-fly zone in southern Iraq
has increased as Iraqi aircraft continued to skirting over the
area.
</P>
<P>
"The numbers have gone up. Numbers of (U.S.) sorties have gone
up... last week," Captain Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said it was because "there have been violations of the
no-fly zone by Iraqi aircraft." The "violations" had taken place
in both northern and southern no-fly zones, "but primarily in the
south."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi aircraft would "risk getting shot down" if they fly over
the no-fly zones, Doubleday said. "We've done that in the past. We
stand ready to do it in the future. But I'm not in any position to
predict if and when that will occur."
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials, speaking privately, said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein appeared to have begun a new round of testing the
flight bans after Iranian F-4 fighters bombed one of Iranian
guerrillas' bases inside southern Iraq on Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the United States ordered the aircraft carrier
Nimitz to said at a top speed to the Gulf, five days ahead of
schedule, as a warning to Iran for its violating the no-fly zone
in southern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> German Swimming Coaches Charged in Doping Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors in Berlin have launched
a lawsuit against two German swimming coaches in connection with
the alleged systematic doping of swimmers in former East Germany,

criminal proceedings have been started against the systematic and
institutionally approved use of performance-boosting substances in
former East Germany, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Full-scale Talks on N. Ireland Get Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) - The historic full-scale peace
talks for 76 years on a political solution in Northern Ireland got
underway today at Stormont, Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Eight political parties representing the minority Catholics,
who want unification with the Irish Republic, and majority
Protestants, who want to stay British, sat down together at the
start of what is expected to be of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, which seeks the end of British rule and
reunification with Ireland, is taking part in the talks for the
first time thanks to a ceasefire by the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) in July.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Secretary Mo Mowlam said the talks could be a "defining
moment" for Northern Ireland's future. Politicians had it within
their grasp to lay foundations for a peaceful and harmonious
future, she added.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a crucial day in that it is the start of the process
proper. It is a very weighty task which is on our shoulders
collectively," said Gary McMichael, leader of the pro-British
Ulster Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator of Sinn Fein, said he hoped
the talks would "bring an end to conflict on this island".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams also said in an interview
published in Spain today that he saw an unprecedented chance of
peace in Northern Ireland under the new Labor Government.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. head issued a
statement here today, trying to clarify an accusation of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR by the radio
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, the Secretary General, said that he deplored the
radio and television broadcasts in the east of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo which "falsely accused" the UNHCR of arming
Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has a consistent policy of humanitarian action around the
world, he said. "It has never been involved in the provision or
supply of arms to any refugee groups," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The charges are completely without foundation. I reiterate my
full confidence in the High Commissioner and in UNHCR staff in the
region, who have performed with great courage and distinction in
extremely difficult circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon those who are behind this unfounded anti-UNHCR
media campaign to cease their false accusations, which could have
a serious effect on the work and well-being of innocent
humanitarian workers in the region," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Bill Stalled in Two Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate, entangled in
partisan infighting, dealt a serious setback Tuesday to
legislation to overhaul the system of campaign finance laws. Two
key procedural votes failed to gain enough support to advance the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
Backers of the bipartisan bill, which is cosponsored by
Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Russell
Feingold, have been threatening to attach it to other major bills
pending in the Senate if they cannot pass it on its own.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans lost the first of the two procedural votes and
Democrats the second.
</P>
<P>
On the second of the two votes, the Senate voted 53-47 to push
the McCain-Feingold bill forward. That was seven short of the
number needed to force another, straight majority-wins vote on the
measure, but showed the bill's strength as eight Republicans
joined the 45 Democrats in supporting it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier majority Republicans failed, 52 to 48, eight fewer than
required, to advance a proposal that would make it harder for
unions to spend members' dues on political campaigns. The labor
movement spent large sum of money in the last election on behalf
of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said he thought the Senate
did the "right thing," in halting the McCain-Feingold bill in its
tracks because of what he said were constitutional problems with
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Lott said, "The Senate has been provided more than adequate
debate on this bill."
</P>
<P>
But Democrats were furious that the only votes allowed were
procedural ones requiring 60 votes for passage.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, the vast majority of Republicans are
refusing to allow this Senate to act on one of the most important
pieces of legislation to be brought up in this Senate, in this
Congress," said Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
McCain-Feingold supporters called Lott's union measure a
"poison pill," saying it was designed to ruin the legislation's
chances.
</P>
<P>
While all 52 votes in favor of the procedural motion to allow a
vote on Lott's amendment were cast by Republicans, three
Republicans joined the 45 Democrats in opposition.
