<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The governors of 11 central banks
and monetary authorities in the Asia/Pacific region expressed
their hope here today for increased cooperation to stabilize the
regional currency markets in times of emergency.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the recent developments in currency markets in
East Asia during the one-day closed-door meeting of the second
governors' meeting of the Executives' Meeting of East Asia and the
Pacific (EMEAP).
</P>
<P>
The conference is attended by banking officials from Australia,
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK),
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The governors reached consensus that central banks in the
region should give due attention to the factor of price
fluctuation in stock markets, real estate and other assets,
besides the traditional price indexes, when making monetary
policies.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, noted
after the meeting that the governors particularly emphasized
stabilizing the foreign currency market and making active efforts
to guard against speculative encroachments on the foreign exchange
markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
The governors also held that it is essential for member
countries to further increase cooperation in a bid to help
stabilize the regional currency markets, Dai added.
</P>
<P>
As part of such efforts, a computer secretariat will be set up
after the meeting, so as to help the EMEAP members share information.
</P>
<P>
The governors also affirmed during the session that a series of
major coordinations and adjustments made by member countries were
positive in coping with the challenge of the recent developments
in regional currency market.
</P>
<P>
So it is fairly appropriate not to consider admitting new
members to the EMEAP at the meeting, since all the bank governors
present regarded the organization as still in its preliminary
stage of development, and this is conducive for the member countries
to have a candid exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
The officials also stressed on the importance of improving
cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the
Federation Reserve System (FRS) of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the EMEAP has decided to hold a separate session with
the FRS at its 14th meeting of deputy governors of the central
banks of member countries, which will is expected to be held in
the Philippines in November this year.
</P>
<P>
EMEAP was established in 1991 to provide its members with
chances to exchange views on regional economic and monetary issues.

<HEADLINE> Five Feared Dead after Apartment House Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were feared dead
in a suspected natural gas explosion which destroyed a four-story
apartment house in the western Germany city of Duesseldorf on
Thursday, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
After rescuing two people alive and recovering three bodies
from the debris on Thursday, Rescue workers using special cameras
and sniffer dogs found another body and located a possible fifth
on Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police later also corrected the number of residents registered
as living in the house from 15 to 14. Seven of them are believed
to be on vacation and two at work at the time of the explosion at
about 3:00 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unclear so far how many are still buried
under the ruins because fire fighters on Thursday night found five
identity cards which do not belong to the 14 registered residents.
</P>
<P>
The building is the only one in the street that is not
connected to the public gas supplies. But a gas pipe powering
street lights runs just in front of the house. Gas explosion is
suspected because of a strong smell of natural gas immediately
after the accident.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges not to Evacuate Montserrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government has pledged
that it would not evacuate the Caribbean island of Montserrat,
which has been devastated by a series of powerful volcanic
eruptions.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office minister Liz Symons said in a statement
issued this afternoon: "I wish to make it clear that the British
government have no intention of evacuating Montserrat in the
present circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The British government made the announcement following press
speculation that Britain was considering evacuating the tiny
island in eastern Carribean.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to helping the people of Montserrat by
providing emergency aid now, and through a long-term program which
will maintain the economic and social viability of the island in
the future," Symons said.
</P>
<P>
"But the decisions on the island's future must include
consultation with its people. The Chief Minister is visiting UK
next month. and we intend to hold discussions on a whole range of
issues," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that volcanic eruptions on the British territory
have killed about 20 people, making hundreds of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the British government decided to grant
some 41 million pounds (about 68 million U.S. dollars) in a bid to
help local residents.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Orphanages Need More Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of children in Ukraine's
overcrowded and poorly financed orphanages grew by 10-15 percent
in 1996, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
A survey, conducted by the International Women's Club and the
Kiev-Mohyla Academy School of Social Work in 109 orphanages and
boarding schools in May, showed that most of the children in the
orphanages were abandoned by their parents.
</P>
<P>
There were many cases of parents refusing to claim their
new-born babies from hospitals or abandoning children with mental
and physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
At the Dnepropetrovsk orphanage for babies with nervous system
and psychological disorders, 77 of the 200 orphans in residence
were abandoned by their parents, while 37 came from families which
could not afford them and 35 were removed from parental custody
under the law.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that orphanages housing 300-400
children aged seven and above have problems of getting clothes and
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Many orphanages and boarding schools in the country are
receiving foreign and domestic non-governmental assistance.
</P>
<P>
A boarding school hosting 280 children in the village of
Beregin of Zakarpattia received medicines, clothes and hygienic
items from Holland, Denmark and Norway in April, and it also
received medicines from a charity run by Lyudmia Kuchma, wife of
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Banks, private companies, state enterprises and government
employees are also active in contributing foods, clothing and
money to the orphanages and boarding schools.
</P>
<P>
However, most orphanages and boarding schools in Ukraine still
lack sponsors and humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that adoption is rare in the country, with only
four of the 300 children at the boarding school in the village of
Vovkovintsy, Khmelnytsky Oblast, were adopted last year.

<HEADLINE> Dublin, Sinn Fein Urge Unionists to Stay in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams today jointly urged Northern
Ireland's unionists to stay in the peace talks to salvage the
fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
After an hour of talks in Dublin, Ahern, Adams and leader of
Northern Ireland's Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party John
Hume made a joint statement, appealing to the pro-British
unionists to back a struggling talks initiative aimed at ending
decades of strife with pro-Irish republicans.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that ultimately we can resolve this problem only
with the participation and agreement of the unionist people," the
three leaders said in a statement which Ahern read to journalists.
</P>
<P>
Irish Republican Army (IRA), which has been fighting against
the British rule of Northern Ireland over the past 28 years,
called a ceasefire last weekend so as to gain a seat in September
peace talks for its political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace process was dealt a blow when the Protestant
unionist parties voted against the arms surrendering plans on
Wednesday in protest of Sinn Fein's participation in the peace
talks without a commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
Ahern hoped London and Dublin could persuade the unionists, who
speak for Northern Ireland's majority Protestants, to stay in the
talks -- which Sinn Fein will be allowed to join on September 15
if the IRA ceasefire is judged genuine.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that the two governments remain in the
driving seat. I hope we can find a way to give satisfactory bona
fides to the unionists and Trimble to get them to come to the
September 15 talks," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
The British government said that peace talks on Northern
Ireland's future will go ahead despite unionists' opposition to
the arms surrender plans.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound Is Hitting UK's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The pound's rise on the foreign
exchanges markets has had a dramatic impact on export orders and
is threatening to cause a sharp slowdown in Britain's economy,
according to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly survey, the CBI said that exporters are
pessimistic about prospects than at any time since 1980. Orders
are falling faster than at any time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said 39 percent of manufacturers reported a fall in
export orders while 19 percent recorded a rise. That gives a
negative balance of 20 percent, compared with 7 percent for the
four months to April and 1 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
However, factory output is expected to continue increasing as
domestic orders are rising at their fastest rate for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs
committee, said the dichotomy between weak export and strong
domestic demand left the Bank of England facing a tough decision
on monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
But Buxton concluded that "any interest rate rise in the short
term would be unwelcome".
</P>
<P>
City analysts believe the High Street boom will force the Bank
of England to raise interest rates for the fourth time when it
meets on August 7.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey was carried out between June 20 and July 9,
at which time the pound averaged DM2.91 and 1.67$. Since then
sterling has continued to appreciate against the D-Mark.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strength of the pound, Britain's trade performance
improved in May. The trade gap with the rest of the world narrowed
to 500 million pounds (800 million US dollars), according to the
latest data released by the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Imports fell 5.5 percent from April's record levels to 14.6
billion pounds (23.16 billion US dollars) while exports, fell by
2.5 percent to 14.1 billion pounds (22.56 billion US dollars) in
May.
</P>
<P>
Although the figures showed do sign yet of an export slowdown
due to the strong pound, economists predicted that this was only a
matter of time.

58.57 against the Dollar on Thursday, compared with 58.81 on
previous day.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday afternoon, dealers were selling the Dollar at
58.40 as exporters were eager to sell their Dollars and importers
opted to stay out of the market hoping to buy dollars later at a
cheaper rate.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling had suffered significant loss since July 7 when
opposition parties in the country organized mass rallies to press
for constitutional reforms in Nairobi and some other cities.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling rate versus the Dollar had eased to as low as 62
and some commercial banks had exhausted their stock because of
panic buying triggered off by speculators.
</P>
<P>
On July 11, the Central Bank of Kenya had to intervene in the
market by providing 29 million Dollars into the market, which was
believed to be the largest amount of Dollars the CBK has sold to
calm a jittery market for several years.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) has started to
stabilize with the number of shares traded on July 14 increasing
to 766,000 from 365,000 on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Following Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's meeting with 17
religious leaders and the leader of the Official Opposition
Wamalwa Kijana, "greater stability has been apparent in the
financial market."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Thursday by Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi and CBK Governor Micah Cheserem said that "some of the
depreciation of the Shilling has been reversed and the Nairobi
Stock Exchange has registered an increase in activity."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CBK Governor Cheserem has been re-appointed to
another four-year term of office, said the "Kenya Gazzete" issued
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the announcement of the
re-appointment was expected to help calm local financial markets
which have been nervous due to the turbulence sparked by
constitutional reform calls.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem took over as governor in 1993 at the height of
financial mismanagement in the banking system and accusations of
corruption at the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
He then moved to restore discipline, helping to reduce money
supply and cut inflation to current single-digit figures from
around 101 percent in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
The CBK governor said last Wednesday that the Kenyan economy
was stable even after the recent riots which rocked parts of the
country resulting in the steepest depreciation of the Shilling in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Hong Kong Rugby Sevens Set for March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- One of Hong Kong's famed
sporting events -- Hong Kong Rugby Sevens -- will be held next
March after signing a sponsorship agreement here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three-year agreement between the Hong Kong Rugby Football
Union (HKRFU) and the Peregrine Investment Holdings will anchor
the tournament's future into the next millennium, as organizers
put it.
</P>
<P>
The HKRFU also announced that the 1998 event of the Hong Kong
Rugby Sevens will be set for March 27-29 in the Hong Kong Stadium,
 with a prize money of five million U.S. dollars on offer for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
"Peregrine's involvement allows us to further raise the high
profile reputation of the Hong Kong Sevens which in turn enables
us to encourage further the expansion of the game both locally and
regionally," said Peter Duncan, Chairman of the HKRFU.
</P>
<P>
"We are embarking on a new era in Hong Kong as the handover is
completed and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been
established," said Philip Tose, Chairman of Peregrine.
</P>
<P>
"The Peregrine Group feels it is appropriate that a new title
sponsor is stepping forward in a long-term commitment to a
tournament that, to so many, means Hong Kong. Our sponsorship is
in keeping with our never wavering faith in this great city and
world-class financial center. We have, if you like, picked up the
ball," he added.
</P>
<P>
After 23 years, Hong Kong Rugby Sevens has become the world's
largest and most popular Sevens rugby event.
</P>
<P>
Next year's event would revert back to the successful 1996
formula, which means six pools of four teams for the
preliminaries. The 24 teams split into six pools according to
their performance will have a single round-robin play within the
pools and then enter the Cup, Plate and Bowl finals according to
the pool performance.
</P>
<P>
China, which joined in the International Rugby Football Board
in March this year, is one of the teams to be invited to the 1998
event, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Rugby Football Association has applied to join in
the Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) which has now eight members.
</P>
<P>
The application is scheduled to be discussed at the ARFU's
annual meeting in December in Singapore, HKRFU officials
said.

<HEADLINE> International Community Won't Accept S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S Ambassador to Sierra Leone
John Hirsch said today that the international community will not
accept the continued presence of the (military) government in
Freetown and does not recognise it in any way.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued from the neighboring Guinea, was carried
by the clandestine pro-democracy radio set up by Nigeria in
support of ousted President Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Hirsch, who was in Guinea since the May 25 coup, said the
almost seven-week strike has shown people's determination to see
the democratically elected government of Kabbah back.
</P>
<P>
The central issue now seems to be whether the military
government and the former rebel combatants genuinely have the
interest of the people of Sierra leone at heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
If they do, they will certainly step down and spare the
people, in whose interest they claimed to have done what they
did, further pains and suffering, he added.
</P>
<P>
Another round of talks between the junta representatives and
the ECOWAS committee on Sierra Leone will be held in Abidjan,
capital of the Ivory Coast on July 29 to work out modalities for
the junta to restore constitutional order in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a junta spokesman denied a claim by Nigeria that
the Sierra Leone army and former rebels were violating the
ceasefire agreement in a series of bloody clashes throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no clashes. We are abiding by the ceasefire
agreement," said Major John Milton, deputy director of defense
information in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the Nigerians have some motives up their sleeves. It is
there own imagination," he added.

<HEADLINE> PNA Reacts Strongly to Jewish Housing Plan in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) reacted strongly today to Jerusalem municipality's
decision to authorize a Jewish housing plan in East Jerusalem,
warning this will kill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem's hardline Mayor Ehud Olmert confirmed at a news
conference here today that he had authorized American
entrepreneur Irving Moskowitz to carry out the plan to build 70
Jewish housing units in the Arab neighborhood of Ras Amud near
Mount of Olives, citing that Moskowitz had obtained all necessary
permits for the project.
</P>
<P>
The planned housing project immediately sparked strong reaction
from Palestinian officials, who warned that it would end the
already stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat said in Gaza today that he was
watching the developments closely and would hold urgent talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during his visit to Cairo
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Abu Rudeineh denounced the housing plan as
"an attempt by Israeli extremists to destroy the peace process."
Arafat's adviser on Israeli affairs Ahmed Tibi said the plan was a
"declaration of war" against Palestinians in East Jerusalem and in
general.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat sent a letter of
protest to Israel's Prime Minister's Office, saying the plan must
be scraped if the peace process was to be salvaged. He has also
sent letters to officials in the United States, European Union and
the United Nations to seek their support to stop the Ras Amud
project.
</P>
<P>
To calm the situation, Israeli Prime Minister's Office
announced today that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked
his adviser Yitzhak Molcho to talk to Arafat, promising he would
take steps to stop the project.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman David Bar-Illan said that, although the
Israeli government insisted on its rights to build settlements
anywhere in Jerusalem, it held that this was not an opportune time
to carry out the Ras Amud housing plan. He added Netanyahu would
invoke laws on public safety and national security to prevent the
plan at this time.
</P>
<P>
The housing project triggered different reactions from Israel's
leftist and rightist political camps.
</P>
<P>
Some rightist coalition lawmakers welcomed and expressed their
support to the plan. Hanan Porat of the National Religious Party
called it a brave move to authorize the housing project. Rehavam
Zeevi, leader of the ultra-rightist Moledet Party, said building
in Ras Amud was as legal as France's building in Paris and
Britain's building in London.
</P>
<P>
But leftist politicians expressed grave concern about serious
consequences that would be caused by the housing project on the
moribund peace process.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party leader, Ehud Barak, said the plan was
reminiscent of the decision to open the underground Hasmonean
tunnel in East Jerusalem last September, which sparked a
widespread Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. But Barak welcomed
the announcement by the Prime Minister's Office on the
government's opposition to the plan.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, blasted the
Ras Amud project for being part of the city's inappropriate
policy which began with opening the underground Hasmonean tunnel
and continued with the construction of the Har Homa settlement in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Hasmonean tunnel in East Jerusalem last
September triggered a widespread Israeli-Palestinian violent
confrontation which killed over 70 people and wounded nearly
1,000 others, and the Har Homa construction has totally frozen
the peace process since mid-March.

<HEADLINE> Four Ministers Appointed by Liberian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 25 (Xinhua) - Liberia's president-elect Charles
Taylor today appointed four ministers for his cabinet to be in
charge of foreign affairs, justice, presidential affairs and
information.
</P>
<P>
The rest will be appointed by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in Monrovia, Taylor said, the Liberian
people are one struggling for one destiny. There is need for
every Liberian to join the new government in rebuilding the
nation, not only for themselves, but for the coming generation.
</P>
<P>
He called on all combatants in Liberia including United
Liberation of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO), the Liberian Peace
Council and the Lofa Defense Force, to make peace in Liberia a
reality.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has remained calm after the election, with heavily
armed west African peacekeeping troops (ECOMOG) patrolling main
streets and towns, and there is unlikely to be any disturbances
after the election.
</P>
<P>
Journalists in the capital said many Liberians have breathed a
sigh of relief that the elections are now over.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's election has been greeted with restrained feeling but
more generally welcomed by the Nigerian-dominated ECOMOG,
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
International election monitors described the election as
relatively free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"There is no substance in any allegation of fraud," said
former U.S President Jimmy Carter in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
U.S Senator Paul Simon was "extremely impressed with the level
of enthusiasm exhibited by Liberians at the polls," while the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) observer team described the
polls as "decent and devoid of violence and irregularities."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Vows to Continue Mediation Efforts for Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Pakistani diplomat said
today that his country will resume its shuttle diplomacy for the
restoration of peace in Afghanistan when he travels to the
war-torn country early next week.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our efforts to persuade the Afghan factions
to a negotiated settlement of the conflict and restore peace in
the brotherly country," Additional Foreign Secretary Iftikhar
Murshed told the media.
</P>
<P>
Murshed said Pakistan's consultations with the Afghan Islamic
Taliban militia and their northern rivals had yielded positive
results as both sides affirmed their commitment to a peaceful
settlement of the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Murshed had been scheduled to come back to Mazar-e-Sharif,
headquarters of the anti-Taliban northern alliance, on Saturday at
the head of a Pakistani delegation, but has deferred his trip
until early next week. No reason was given for the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Murshed last traveled to Mazar-e-Sharif early this month and
held talks with the leaders of the alliance including ousted
Afghan president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Uzbek warlord Abdul
Malik. He also had a ground-breaking meeting with former military
chief Ahmad Masood in Farkhar Valley.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Murshed held talks with the Taliban leadership in
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has regretted the recent outbreak of fighting in the
war-ravaged Afghanistan, but vowed to carry on its efforts to
broker peace among warring factions.
</P>
<P>
"The fighting will have no impact on our determination to
continue with the shuttle mission," a spokesman for the Foreign
Office told a weekly news conference here Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Greek's Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
expressed satisfaction with Greece's statement that it would not
rule out the possibility of exercising its right to veto
European Union (EU) membership for Central and Eastern Europe
applicant countries, if Cyprus is excluded from the next move of
EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides told his daily press
briefing here today that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis'
statement appeared in the Financial Times Thursday "absolutely
satisfies us."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek premier has reaffirmed "Greece's firm
and decisive policy toward a Cyprus solution and our efforts to
join the EU."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times, Simitis said he
hoped it would not be necessary for Greece to veto EU membership
for former Communist countries, since the lengthy accession
procedure would allow considerable time to work out a political
solution in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that the accession talks, due to start early
in 1998, should continue in parallel with efforts to reunite the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Simitis rejected Turkish threats to derail talks
on a Cyprus settlement if the EU goes ahead with accession
negotiations with the Cypriot government, noting that Greece will
use all measures offered in the framework of the EU to achieve
what it considers to be right.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot spokesman said the Greek premier's interview
"clarifies some questions raised with this month's Madrid
agreement and reiterates Greece's support to Cyprus and its
struggle."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month on the sidelines of the NATO summit in
Madrid, Greece and Turkey agreed to "settle disputes by peaceful
means based on mutual consent and without use of force and
threat of force."

<HEADLINE> 90 Percent of Africa's Debt to Be Forgiven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- About 90 percent or 270 billion
U.S. dollars of Africa's external debt will be forgiven during
the implementation of the 20 year Sub-Saharan African Plan
(1996-2016) formulated with African African-American summit
movement's efforts.
</P>
<P>
The plan, aimed at developing the region to compete with
others in the 21st century, would ensure the remaining 10 percent
or 30 billion U.S. dollars of Africa's debt to remain in the
books.
</P>
<P>
And the interest of three percent on the remaining debt would
be converted annually into local currencies and used for
education and human development.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan summary published in a
magazine released at the Fourth African African-American summit
in Harare today, the plan which would cost about 500 billion U.S.
dollars would also propose ways to convert debt to development
purposes.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the plan, an estimated two million jobs in the
sub-region were expected to have been created in manufacturing,
agriculture and informal sectors, among others.
</P>
<P>
Another 250,000 jobs are expected to be created in the U.S.
and other participating countries during the plan's
implementation period.
</P>
<P>
The plan would, therefore, develop strategies to encourage
social development, capital investment, expansion of the banking
system's capacity, creation of market economies and
revitalisation of human resources.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Flee Floods in Germany after More Dikes Burst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- About 9,500 people have to leave
their homes for safety on Friday after rising floodwaters burst
banks at several locations along the Oder River on the
German-Polish border.
</P>
<P>
After a second dike burst near the town of Aurich in the
southern part of the Oder, floodwaters were rushing through an
800-metre gap, flooding homes up to their rooftops. About 2,800
local residents were forced to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Oderbruch in the north, another dike was
threatening to break, and 6,500 people in 17 villages were told to
leave the lowlands in precaution.
</P>
<P>
According to German media reports, about 20,000 people may have
to be moved if the flood become widespread.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 rescue workers, including nearly 9,400 soldiers
were busy in evacuating people and shoring up waterlogged dikes in
the whole flooded area on Friday. Border police and soldiers were
also patrolling villages to prevent them from lootings.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry of the eastern German state of Brandenburg
said there were no acute epidemic danger at the moment yet. Tap
water was still safe, but well water must be cooked to drink.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualties in Germany so far, but
flooding has claimed 104 lives in neighboring Poland and the
Czech Republic over the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The largest German reinsurance company, Muenchener
Rueckversicherung, on Friday estimated the total flood damage so
far in eastern European countries and eastern Germany at well over
one billion German marks (540 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Raps EU Protectionist Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain has lashed out at the
European Union (EU) for its recent protectionist measures against
the exports of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy of the Bahraini Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(CCI) Hassan Zine al-Abidine was quoted by the local daily
Al-Ayyam as saying that the measures were the most harmful
sanctions against the development of the economic ties between
the EU and the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
The United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The delegation representing the GCC and the CCI raised during
its talks with the European Commission in Brussels and the
European Parliament in Strasbourg recently the issue of "the
carbon tax" and the customs tariff increases on the aluminium and
petrochemical exports of the GCC members to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The delegation urged the EU officials to offer preferential
treatment to the GCC exports in reciprocation with the treatment
received by the European exports to the GCC member states.
</P>
<P>
It called for increasing the European investments and more
joint ventures in the GCC countries as well as launching a free
trade zone between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CCI official underlined the importance of
approving the single customs tariff draft by the GCC members as
the EU attributes its refraining from concluding any agreement
with the GCC members to the GCC's lack of a unified tariff.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Secret Agents Infiltrate Into Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
dispatched an undercover unit to Tulkarm in the Palestinian
self-rule area late Thursday to arrest an Islamic Jihad activist,
reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified military sources were quoted as saying that the
IDF secret agents, dressed as Arabs, arrested Mahmoud Madawi in
the town and took him away.
</P>
<P>
Madawi, who escaped from an Israeli jail together with a
Palestinian inmate, had been serving a sentence of 17 years'
imprisonment allegedly for stabbing an Israeli and planning
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials pointed out that Madawi's arrest by the
IDF unit is a violation of the peace accord signed by the Israeli
government and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Tulkarm is one of the six cities that came under the
Palestinian self-rule under the Oslo 2 agreement signed between
Israel and the Palestinians in 1995. The Palestinian National
Authority has the sole jurisdiction in the cities.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the IDF took no notice of the
Palestinian jurisdiction to launch a secret invasion into the
autonomous area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IDF today declared Qalqilya, another self-rule
town in the West Bank, a "closed military area," and entry by
Israelis is prohibited. Nablus and Jenin will continue to be
closed to Israelis.

<HEADLINE> Drought-Hit Ethiopia Calls for Urgent Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 25 (Xinhua) --Ethiopia Friday appealed for
181,000 tons of food aid to be urgently sent to feed more than
three million people hit by drought in the north and south this
year.
</P>
<P>
The State Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission
(DPPC) said donor response to previous appeals for the aid were
very poor and the number of people hit by drought could rise,
said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
It said the failure of short rains from March to May known as
belg had hit some 1.4 million people in northern Amhara Region
only and other regions including Tigray and the south.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is bad in some parts of Ethiopia and the poor
belg rains will increase the need for food aid," U.N. World Food
Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Brenda Barton said in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for food aid and WFP is finalising
its analysis of the outcome of the belg harvest," she added.
</P>
<P>
The DPPC in June estimated 3,418,190 people would need 329,451
tons of food aid this year. Aid agencies said taking into account
aid in the pipeline, there remained a shortfall of 88,753 tons of
food and the food gap was expected to widen.
</P>
<P>
U.N. missions in June to various regions reported the belg
crop was likely to be the worst in three years. The belg rains
generally started late in Ethiopia and were poor, short and
uneven.
</P>
<P>
Grain prices in Ethiopia rose by 33 percent from mid-April to
June and fertiliser sales this year by the end of June were
estimated at half what they were at the same time the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia suffered a catastrophic famine in 1984, prompting the
"live aid" rock concert which helped raise millions of dollars to
ease the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Angola Accuses UNITA of Violating Lusaka Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan National Assembly
today passed a resolution, accusing the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), former anti-government
forces, of violating the Lusaka Peace Accord signed in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the resolution was submitted Thursday by Angola's
ruling party, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
</P>
<P>
After nearly two days' debates, the resolution was
passed with 115 supports, 64 oppositions and 13 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that UNITA has trampled on the Lusaka
Peace Accord by hiding away armed personnel and war-time goods,
launching military operations against the people, sabotaging the
re-establishment of national authorities and plunging the country
once again into the danger of war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands that UNITA hand over all arms,
dissolve all armed personnel immediately and strictly observe
the Lusaka Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi to keep his
promise by fulfilling all tasks in the peace process to make
UNITA a non-militarized party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution appeals to the international
community, the United Nations observers' mission in Angola to
take up measures to reverse the UNITA's action.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Politicians See Challenge From Liberia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerian party leaders who
were just back from monitoring Saturday's elections in Liberia,
described the success as a challenge to Nigeria's democratization
program.
</P>
<P>
They said Nigeria should emulate the transparency that
pervaded the Liberian election, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a shame if we cannot replicate what we have just
helped Liberians to do in their country," said Sen. Ibrahim
Kazaure of the United National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Saidu Umar Kurmo of the Democratic Party of Nigeria was quoted
as saying that the exercise should serve as a lesson to all
African countries on how to conduct elections, particularly with
the security and cooperation among the parties.
</P>
<P>
"The parties exhibited a sense of maturity and cooperation,
which is unusual to our democratic experience," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders were in Liberia as members of the Nigerian
government delegation to monitor the election, which has put
former warlord Charles Taylor to Liberia's number one seat.
</P>
<P>
International observers and the country's Independent
Elections Commission already endorsed the election, which also
produced a 90-member bicameral legislature, as free, fair and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of Taylor, the National Patriotic Party
candidate, will take place on August 2.

CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot stock market remained flat this week
with volumes shrinking to the lowest levels for the current year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Cyprus Investment and
Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO) today, the CISCO All-Share
Index closed Thursday at 376.7 points, virtually unaltered
since last week's closing of 376.8 points and having fluctuated
very mildly within the week.
</P>
<P>
On the very first day of trading of the current week,
activity fell to the lowest daily level of the current year
of 134,600 Cyprus pounds (about 269,200 U.S. dollars), while for
the rest of the week volumes were slightly increased but still
at extremely low levels.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cyprus Planning Bureau has predicted that the
country's economy will grow by around 3.5 percent this year as a
result of increased domestic and external demand.
</P>
<P>
In its report on economic review for 1996, released here
today, the Planning Bureau speaks of a slowdown of the Cyprus
economy in 1996 "due mainly to exogenous factors", such as the
sluggish development in European Union (EU) economies, the rise
in oil prices and the further liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Central Bank Governor Afxentis Afxentiou
expected a modest recovery of the economy this year, with real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rising by 2.5-3 percent, compared
with 1.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But for 1997, the report says the external environment is
expected to be more favorable, with Britain's economy projected
to grow by 3 percent this year, compared with 2.3 percent in
1996. Britain is Cyprus' leading trading partner.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Internet market in Lebanon is expanding at an
annual rate of 60 percent, a leading analyst of the local
information highway industry said today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Soubra, commercial manager of Datanet, a Beirut-based
communication company, said a combination of good marketing,
better infrastructure and the Internet's worldwide appeal has
made this industry attractive in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"From the demand we have been feeling in the past six months,
60 percent is the rate of internet growth. If another analyst said
75 percent, he might not be exaggerating," Soubra said.
</P>
<P>
There are 50,000 computer users in Lebanon, and one tenth of
them have subscribed the internet, he said, adding that 55 percent
of the subscribers are businessmen, while the remaining 45 percent
are households and students.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish and Italian automobile giants Tofas and Fiat
have recently signed a 262-million-U.S. dollar contract to produce
cars for Turkish and European markets.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Daily News today quoted Fiat Director
General Paoto Cantarella as saying that a new plant will be set up
in Western Turkey's coastal city of Bursa to produce the Fiat
Palio model cars.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say when and where the contract was
signed
</P>
<P>
Cantarella said the designed capability of the project is
nearly 1 million cars per year.

<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 hectares of forest
were destroyed in a fire in southern Turkey's Antalya, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The forest were burned out in a fire which took place Monday
in the Guver Canyon of Antalya, a province on the Mediterranean
coast. The economic losses caused by the fire are not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay Neyisci, an environmental expert from the Mediterranean
University was quoted as saying that not only trees but also
animals were lost in the fire.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fire-hit Guver Canyon is a natural habitat
of the endangered fallow deer and the mountain goat, adding the
canyon and the falls were also affected by the fire.
</P>
<P>
The forestry authorities should adopt new concepts and take
modern technologies in fighting forestry fires, Neyisci said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the wind and fire resistant trees, such
as cypress, should be planted in the mountains around the
country.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires cause heavy economic losses to Turkey every
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) decided
today to provide the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) with 2.3 million U.S. Dollars for industrial
standardization to promote international trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
At an agreement-signing ceremony, the head of EU delegation in
Zambia, Charles Brooks, urged the COMESA member countries to
eliminate technical barriers originating from different technical
standards so as to facilitate exchange of goods among trading
partners.
</P>
<P>
He said standardization of products is an essential supporting
service to sustained industrial development if products are
expected to be internationally tradable.
</P>
<P>
"To facilitate easy exchange of goods, further harmonization
of standards, quality control procedures, testing and
certification practices among the trading partners is necessary,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Acting COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said the funds
will be used in three areas of capacity building, development of
specific standards commonly traded within COMESA countries and
the dissemination of information to all stake holders.
</P>
<P>
He said that lack of standardization and multiplicity of
standards have constituted a major impediment to industrialization
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be used in addressing standards and quality of
locally produced goods which is a major non-tariff barrier to
intra-regional trade in the third world countries, Mwencha said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno today praised Arkansas' decision to resume background checks
under the Brady handgun act, which it had stopped doing last month
following a Supreme Court ruling that the federal government
couldn't require the checks.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that leaves only Ohio not conducting background
checks before handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
The Brady gun-control law is named after former press secretary
James Brady, who was seriously wounded in the assassination
attempt on President Ronald Reagan. It was passed after bitter
congressional battles and was strongly opposed by the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Attorney General Winston Bryant ruled late Thursday
that the Arkansas state police had the authority to conduct the
checks and charge a fee for them.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Reno said that since its passage in 1994, the
Brady Act has prevented more than 250,000 fugitives, felons and
others from buying guns over the counter.

"I commend Attorney General Bryant for this step forward in

stressed the objectives of the summit were to strengthen the
friendship and solidarity between Africans and African Americans
forged by history, culture and common destiny and to find the
ways and means to help accelerate the African development process
in a cooperative and consultative framework.

education and eradicate adult illiteracy in Africa, and reduce
and write off Africa's debt to meet education and other essential
development needs.
</P>
<P>
African African-American summit with its first meeting held in
Cote d' Ivoire in 1991, is the brainchild of Leon Sullivan of the
U.S. and had over the years been a platform to strengthen
relations between Africans and African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Harare summit, attended by more than 2,000 delegates from
the Africa, the U.S. and Europe, provided a forum for Africans,
African- Americans and international business communities to
interact and discuss specific business, trade and investment
opportunities in Africa.

seriousness in pursuing efforts to ensure peace and stability in
their countries, restructuring their economies so that they are
market driven, and espousing democracy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''Cooperation, solidarity, partnership and the
goodwill of others are all very important. We have long
mentioned the need for debt forgiveness, for fairer terms of
trade, and for better treatment by international financial
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
In his address, convener of the summit Leon Sullivan urged
Africans to work to forge stronger ties for a common goal of
improving the continent's economic climate and living standards.
</P>
<P>
He also called on African Americans' companies to increase
investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Western governments should allow Africa to sort out its own
affairs without outside interference, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sullivan Foundation has embarked on a number of programs
such as water and sanitation, teacher and nurse training, and
banking to help improve the living conditions of the people in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets Russian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov today evaluated highly the
strategic cooperation partnership between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting here this afternoon, the two ministers noted
that the state visit paid to Russia by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin in April this year was very successful.
</P>
<P>
They said Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make another
trip to China later this year, when the fifth summit between the
two countries will take place in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of visits by leaders of the two countries has
vigorously pushed forward the Sino-Russian strategic cooperation
partnership and the good-neighborly relations between the two big
countries have also exerted an important and positive influence on
international relations," the ministers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qian and Primakov in their meeting exchanged views on
international and regional issues and "reached broad consensus,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two maintained that the world today is facing many complex
problems, which should be properly addressed through peaceful
consultations and negotiations. Both China and Russia are
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and share identical
or similar views on many international issues, they noted.
</P>
<P>
"They should further strengthen consultation and cooperation
and together play an active role in maintaining world and regional
peace and stability," the spokesman quoted the ministers as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are here to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum
and Post Ministerial Conference scheduled for July 27-29.

<P>
KATHMANDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The total resources of Nepali
commercial banks increased at a sluggish rate of 3.2 percent to
90.25 billion rupees (about 1.58 billion U.S. dollars) during the
first nine months of the fiscal year 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was 17.3 during the same period of the previous

During the first nine months of the 1996-97 fiscal year, total
deposits rose by 8.6 percent to 77.3 billion rupees (1.35 billion
dollars), as against an increase of 11.1 percent in the same
period of the previous fiscal year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, a total of 12 bank branches were
established, bringing the total number of bank branches in Nepal
to 460.
</P>
<P>
The number would be 479 if the 19 branches of the Agriculture
Development Bank which are doing commercial transactions were also
included, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Israeli Settlement Plan Complicates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today warned that an Israeli plan to add another Jewish settlement
on the occupied Arab lands further complicated the Middle East
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The situation undoubtedly has become complicated," Arafat told
reporters this morning after his second meeting in a week with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at the Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria, in an attempt to galvanize the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Israel's non-abidance by the signed agreements and
violations in the occupied lands for the deadlock of the peace
process. Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled as Israel started
in March the expansion of Jewish settlement in Har Homa, East
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Today's Arafat-Mubarak meeting came two days after Israel's
Jerusalem City Council decided to build a Jewish settlers' enclave
in the 11,000-strong Arab neighborhood of Ras Al-Amoud in the
heart of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat blasted the Israeli decision as a scheme to "blow up"
the ongoing efforts to salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"This is a new challenge to the peace process by the Israeli
Mayor of Jerusalem. He feels that there are Arab, European and
American endeavors to rescue the peace process and that is why he
is putting obstacles to hinder it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has warned that such a decision, combined with the Har
Homa building, will foil ongoing peace efforts and kill the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat renewed his call on the U.S. government to haul up its
flagging profile as a key sponsor and mediator of the six-year-old
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget that we concluded peace agreements under
the sponsorship of U.S. President Bill Clinton twice in the White
House. The U.S. should shoulder its moral and political
responsibility to save the peace process and break the deadlock in
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. mediation, the Palestinians and Israelis struck
historic deals in Washington on the principles of realizing
Palestinian autonomy in September 1993 and on expanding autonomy
in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also brokered a deal on Israeli troops partial
redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron in January this
year. But since then it has slacked off its efforts.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his recent meetings with Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy as
well as a number of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels
was part of an attempt to rescue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But he complained the Natanyahu government deliberately foiled
the European initiative despite that it included "new factors" to
push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here for home this afternoon. An enlarged
Egyptian-Palestinian meeting will be held in Cairo on Sunday to
evaluate the present situation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to host a tripartite summit among Mubarak,
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues North of Kabul: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia and their rivals was continuing today
north of the capital city of Kabul, Pakistan Television (PTV) said
today.
</P>
<P>
For the past two days there had been no significant change in
the frontlines which were reported to be still around Hossein Kot
village, about 20 kilometers north of Kabul, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no clear indication today that the
anti-Taliban forces, under the commander of Ahmad Masood, the
Afghan former military chief, would attempt to storm the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Masood's forces, which have advanced to within the rocket
range of Kabul, have kept military pressure on the city with jet
and artillery bombardments while calling for a Taliban pullout
from the capital.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the United Islamic Front for the
Salvation of Afghanistan (UIFSA), the name of the anti-Taliban
alliance, said that only when the Taliban "demilitarize Kabul"
could issues including a cease-fire and exchange of prisoners be
negotiated. But it gave no deadline for the demilitarization of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in Kabul remained tense as the Taliban rushed in
reinforcements and reportedly arrested hundreds of people
suspected to be opposition fighters who were said to have
infiltrated the capital.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of foreign aid workers evacuated by road to the
Pakistani border Friday as the anti-Taliban forces were poised to
close in on Kabul. The United Nations and the International
Committee of the Red Cross have also suspended their flights to
the city.

<HEADLINE> Stone Column Marking HK's Return to China Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A stone column marking Hong
Kong's return to China on July 1 this year was unveiled today at
Sheung Tsuen Park, Yuen Long of the "New Territories".
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 people attended the unveiling ceremony for the
11.6-meter-high column, whose construction was funded by the Pat
Heung Rural Committee and began on May 13.
</P>
<P>
A dozen noted figures of the local community, including vice
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Zheng Guoxiong
and chairwoman of the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region Rita Fan Hsu Lai Tai, cut the
ribbon for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Engraved on the front of the column was an inscription by Zhou
Nan, former director of the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch, which reads
"Sky-sustaining pillar in commemoration of Hong Kong's return".
</P>
<P>
Philip Lai, chairman of the Pat Heung Rural Committee, said
that members of the committee donated more than one million Hong
Kong dollars (about 128,000 US dollars) for the erection of the
column.
</P>
<P>
With 26 villages and a population of over 20,000, Pat Heung is
known for its resistance against the British aggression in the
1890s, when more than 40 local residents sacrificed their lives in
an attempt to defend the area against British occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Pat Heung have a tradition of patriotism, and we
are ecstatic about Hong Kong's return to the motherland," said
Lai.
</P>
<P>
Participants at today's ceremony, mostly from the nearby
villages, celebrated the occasion with a deafening sound of gongs
and drums, lion and dragon dances and a grand open-air
feast.

<HEADLINE> HKAAA Applying for Suspended Woman Hurdler to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Amateur Athletic
Association (HKAAA) is now applying for its top woman hurdler Chan
Sau Ying to appeal to the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF) against her suspension from all competitions.
</P>
<P>
Chan, 26, was tested positive of ephedrine during the Zagreb
'97 EAA Meeting in Zagreb, Croatia, on June 27 this year and was
thus suspended by the world government body for track and field
for three months. The suspension started from June 27.
</P>
<P>
She was the first ever Hong Kong athlete to be suspended for
failing doping tests during international competitions.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, the HKAAA said that it
"views this matter with grave concern and every effort has been
made to rectify the matter."
</P>
<P>
HKAAA Chairman William Ko has decided to fly to Athens on
Sunday to discuss the issue with IAAF anti-doping officials. He
would ask for sample test reports, which he would send back to
Hong Kong for medical advice.
</P>
<P>
The Association has prepared a Notice of Application for Chan
Sau Ying to file in for hearing as in accordance with the IAAF
rules. The Notice of Application must reach the IAAF within 28
days.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the HKAAA believed that Chan had taken drugs by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
Chan herself is not available now for comment.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said that it's not up to the IAAF to ban the hurdler
and it is the responsibility of HKAAA to conduct a thorough
investigation and make any decision on her.
</P>
<P>
Chan won a silver medal in the 100 meters hurdles at the East
Asian Games in Pusan, South Korea in May and took a gold in an
international meeting in Belgium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local TV reports today said that the HKAAA had decided to
suspend bonus money awarded to Chan and erase her name from the
team for next month's world championships.
</P>
<P>
And Chan might not be eligible for China's Eighth National
Games in October in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Stresses Improvement of Work Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The need to improve work styles
and on-the-job efficiency with a combination of theory,
performance review and research was stressed in a speech delivered
today by Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 21st Session of the Eighth Standing Committee of
the CPPCC national committee, Li noted that the Chinese Communists
have a tradition of studying theories, for actions might be taken
blindly without the guidance of theories.
</P>
<P>
He said that many of the problems that are presently showing up
in the process of developing the socialist market economy involve
the theoretical vs. the practical approach to issues.
</P>
<P>
Also, the chairman mentioned the importance of summing up
experience, saying it is a necessary link between perception and
rational understanding of an event.
</P>
<P>
Two big leaps in the history of the Chinese Communist Party
(CPC) were the results of reviewing prior experiences, according
to Li, who is also a standing committee member of the political
bureau of the CPC central committee.
</P>
<P>
For example, the summarization of the Seventh National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party had laid a solid foundation for the
victory of the New-Democratic Revolution. And the review of
historical experience made at the Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh CPC central committee blazed a new trail for developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that summing up an event is not a simple
matter, but rather a complex process of eliminating what's false
and holding on to the truth, and discarding superficial details
while selecting the essential under the guidance of the Marxist
theory.
</P>
<P>
Li highlighted the importance of systematic research, which
focuses on soliciting ideas and public opinion and converting it
into concrete, practical plans.
</P>
<P>
He criticized those departments for either doing insufficient
research or conducting improper research in their work, noting
that research constitutes the fundamental work method of all
leading officials.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Willing to Normalize Ties with Arab Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nabeel Najim, Iraq's permanent
representative to the Arab League, has said that his country is
willing to normalize ties with all other Arab states, according to
the Iraqi News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Egyptian newspaper, Najim underlined
that his country is ready to do so even with those it has been at
odds, and to turn over a new leaf in their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq is in dire need for developing relations with
other Arab countries before the advent of the coming century in
light of the economic, social, cultural, and media challenges it
faces.
</P>
<P>
This is aimed at establishing sound inter-Arab relations which
will benefit the pan-Arab security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Najim added that what happened in the past could not deny the
existence of an "objective" vision of the present and future.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Arab countries cut off their official exchanges
with Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in August, 1990. Nine of them
joined in the U.S.-led military operations or provided facilities
in the 1991 Gulf War that evicted Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Najim urged the United Nations to lift its seven-year-old
sanctions against Iraq, which was imposed after the Gulf War
banning the sale of Iraqi oil for purposes other than food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. oil-for-food deal does not meet the
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people as more than 53 percent of
the food and medicine supply Iraq contracted has yet to arrive.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Najim also criticized Turkey's alliance with
Israel, the long-term foe of many Arab countries. He said the
alliance would "negatively" affect the Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
He called for mapping out an Arab strategy to protect the
security of the Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> China "Deeply Concerned" Over Cambodian Situation-Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed his
country's concern over the situation in Cambodia and urged the
sides involved in the fighting there to solve their problems
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"China is deeply concerned over what has recently taken place
in Cambodia," Qian, who is here to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum
and Post Ministerial Conference, told a press conference he
jointly held with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
China does not wish to see the eruption of armed conflict in
Cambodia, which had already achieved national reconciliation and
established a coalition government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that Cambodian parties and leaders
would solve their problems and disagreements through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
"Our consistent position is not to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs, but we wish to see that they will be
able to work out their problems by peaceful means," he declared.
</P>
<P>
On Chinese President Jiang Zemin's planned visit to the United
States this fall, the vice-premier said the purpose of the trip
will be the establishment of a strategic partnership between the
two countries that is oriented toward the 21st century, as the
Chinese president told U.S. President Bill Clinton at their first
meeting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States are both major countries," he
said. "We will exchange views on the international situation and
on global issues and this makes our relationship strategic."
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming visit should be more than just of protocol
significance, it should have substantive significance. In other
words, it should generate concrete results."
</P>
<P>
He said China and the United States do not agree on everything,
but it is possible for the two countries to reach agreement and
achieve results on major issues.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Qian noted that China stands for
dialogue and wants to avoid confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He called for holding such dialogue on a forum such as a
non-governmental organization forum and the topics for discussion
could cover issues such as human rights and the exchange of
judicial experience.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that "All such discussions must be based
on mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs."

<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China and New
Zealand today agreed to further strengthen their bilateral
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the talks here today between
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his New Zealand
counterpart Don Mckinnon, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign
ministry said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers shared the view that there exist great
potentials for the two countries to have mutually beneficial
economic and trade cooperation as the two countries have great
economic complementarity.
</P>
<P>
They were satisfied with the "smooth development of bilateral
relations between the two countries," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese government attaches great importance to
its relations with New Zealand and wishes to work together with it
to deepen the cooperation and contacts existing in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand minister said it is also his country's desire
to do so, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon believed that an early solution to the issue of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization would further
promote the economic and trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed some regional issues, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese, Western Firms Vie for UAE Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 26 ( Xinhua) -- Japanese and Western firms are
vying to snatch a major UAE gas project which will tap the Gulf
country's immense resources, a local newspaper said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), which runs the
energy sector, has invited bids for the 1 billion U.S. dollars
project to develop Habshan field, one of the largest oil fields in
the Middle East, the daily Gulf news said.
</P>
<P>
Technip of France, Bechtel and Fluor Corp. of the United
States, Mitsubishi and Chiyoda of Japan, and other companies
are competing for the contract.
</P>
<P>
The project will turn Habshan field located in the west of UAE,
into one of the biggest single point gas processing plants with a
total treating capacity of around 90 million cubic meters a day.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi approved the ambitious Onshore Gas Development in
1991 to exploit its largely untapped reserves of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The gas resources of the UAE are estimated at around 5.7
trillion cubic meters, the fourth largest in the world after the
reserves of Russia, Iran and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-Funded Enterprises Successful in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that the
industrial output value of foreign-funded enterprises in China's
largest trade and financial city has grown to account for over one
third of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Shanghai Statistics Bureau say that the number
of foreign-funded enterprises in Shanghai has increased to 4,020
since the city's first foreign firm, the Shanghai Schindler
Elevator Co., Ltd, was built in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The figure is still increasing, official sources say.
</P>
<P>
The total industrial output of the enterprises was 170 billion
yuan last year, accounting for 34.4 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The sources say that their output value has increased at an
average annual growth rate of 72 percent since 1980, with their
tax and profits hitting 16.9 billion yuan in 1996, growing at a
rate of 60.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ventures have employed nearly 588,000 local residents, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
After years of expanding, overseas investors have penetrated
into each sector of the local industrial economy. However, most of
them are involved in textiles, electronics, telecommunications,
foodstuffs and chemical industries, they said.
</P>
<P>
The tax and profits made by the Shanghai Volkswagon Corporation
increased to 4.5 billion yuan in 1996, making the company the
leader among foreign-funded enterprises in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Industrial specialists say that overseas investors have brought
advanced technology and skills into the city, which helps push the
city's production technology toward world standards.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai had approved 16,420 foreign-funded enterprises by the
end of June, with a total registered capital of 44 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China, Britain Working in Cooperation for Pollution Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-British cooperative project
to improve pollution-control efforts in the Yangpu Economic
Development Zone is progressing smoothly in Haikou, capital of
China's southernmost Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Yangpu is China's first economic development zone to allow
overseas investors to lease large tracts of land from the local
government. The zone will be built into a chemical industrial base
to refine offshore oil and gases.
</P>
<P>
The pollution-control project is mainly sponsored by the
British Overseas Development Agency (ODA), and covers three
Chinese coastal cities, Fuzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian Province in
the east, and Haikou.
</P>
<P>
The ODA provided 1.67 million US dollars (one million British
pounds) to finance the work, which will cost a total 2.167 million
US dollars (1.3 million British pounds).
</P>
<P>
British experts in environmental protection have formed a team
together with Chinese consultants and experts to develop a
anti-pollution program for Yangpu.
</P>
<P>
The largest chemical fertilizer plant in Asia will go under
construction in Yangpu at the end of this year. The facility is
expected to have an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons of
synthetic ammonia, and 800,000 tons of urea.

<HEADLINE> Computer Literacy Craze in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Lu Liuying, a 40-year-old
employee of the Shanghai municipal government, recently became the
one millionth person to pass a computer science examination in
China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Computer literacy has become a new craze in Shanghai: there are
now about 600,000 people like Lu who have received course
completion certificates for computer science. Statistics show that
one out of every 13 Shanghai residents has taken a test in
computer studies.
</P>
<P>
In the autumn of 1993, the Shanghai municipal government
started a "Personnel Training Project" and computer science was
one of its basic courses.
</P>
<P>
Since then, about two million books on computer science have
been published, and one million handbooks for computer use.
</P>
<P>
To help its computer students, the Shanghai computer testing
center has offered new software to be used in conjunction with the
courses.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai currently has 420 schools for computer training, and
about 120 classrooms are opened for every exam.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 20 percent of families in Shanghai
owns a computer.

<P>
FUZHOU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal Fujian Province
will spend nearly 200 million yuan (24 million US dollars) on a
dock project at Sandu'ao in Ningde Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Ningde has an 878-km coastline, a third of Fujian's total. Of
the five coastal prefectures, only Ningde lacks a 10,000 DWT
dock. Its existing shipping capacity couldn't meet the economic
development needs of Ningde.
</P>
<P>
In a feasibility report, experts said that a large-scale
deepwater wharf should be built there because of its natural
conditions. It could have an annual handling capacity of 500,000
tons, and include deepwater berths, warehouses, and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Ningde has been proposing that it build a wharf since 1996.

<HEADLINE> 1,300-year-old Stone Buddha Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A 1,300-year-old stone Buddha was
discovered recently, which was carved into the face of a perilous
part of Hengshan, a mountainous Buddhist shrine in central China's
Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
The two-meter-tall stone carving is a bit indistinct after
hundreds of years of wind and rain. Local experts believe that it
is the image of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Nothing else was reported near it, but four Chinese characters
are carved on a huge rock nearby.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say that the figure belongs to the early Tang
Dynasty (618-907) because of the style.
</P>
<P>
Master Bao Tan, the Buddhist abbot of Nantai Temple and
vice-president of the provincial Buddhism association, believes
that the carving was the work of local craftsmen acting on their
own instead of on government order, because there is no record in
local chronicles.

KUNMING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's new highway patrolmen, who
came about as part of a reformed traffic police system, have prove
their worth in stopping crime.
</P>
<P>
Highway fatalities on one experimental section in Yunnan
province, in the southeast, dropped 55 percent since policemen
started patrolling it on January 1.
</P>
<P>
They have handled 26,000 traffic violations and 169 accidents
during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Highway patrolmen are part of a new branch of the traffic
police. They handle a broader range of problems than traditional
policemen who stand in police boxes and write accident
reports. They have the right to use firearms if necessary to
arrest people suspected of serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Patrolmen began working on all of Yunnan's highways on July
1. Many cities in China have also adopted this new system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects Constructive Relationship With China, Albright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, MALAYSIA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright said here today the United States is aimed
at building the basis for a sound and constructive relationship
with China.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Albright said her meeting with Qian
today will be the fourth of its kind over the past six months,
which showed that "both our countries have attached great
importance to our relationship."
</P>
<P>
She said the United States views its relations with China as a
major relationship as it enters the next century.
</P>
<P>
She expressed her appreciation of the dialogue between the two
countries which is proceeding "with great seriousness," and "is
producing tangible, fair and growing benefits."
</P>
<P>
By the summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his
Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin scheduled for this fall, the two
sides would work to increase cooperation in the areas "where we
share the same interests and the same goals" and try to narrow the
differences between the two, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She said Qian and she would discuss the situation in Cambodia
and the issue of the Korean Peninsula at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
She said the United States is also ready to deepen the
cooperation with China on global issues including energy,
environment, law enforcement and nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly do not agree on everything, but I do think we do
agree that the important test of the relationship we are building
will be our ability to produce appropriate results in these and
other areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
"As we move forward, I know that we can continue to resolve
differences, expand cooperation and build understanding and I
anticipate that the larger and longer process of deepening ties
between our nations will produce greater benefits for both
countries," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she hoped that Jiang's upcoming state visit to
her country would show the bilateral ties between the two are
increasingly profound and useful to both countries.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Last Evening Paper to Close Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Evening Post, the only
evening newspaper now in Hong Kong, will close down as from Sunday
because of publication-related difficulties, its Board of
Directors announced today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the paper's last issue, the board
said the New Evening Post has been welcomed by the public since it
 started publication in 1950.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper has come to a deadlock -- irresolvable
financial difficulties. A total of seven local evening newspapers
have closed down one after another in the past 13 years. The
decline of the evening newspapers began in the late 1970s as TV
was becoming more popular, gaining the upper hand in intense
market competition.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Bombard South Lebanese Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces
bombarded this morning villages opposite the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon, wounding one
civilian, security sources in the area said.
</P>
<P>
In the fiercest bombardment in one week apparent retaliatory
against Katyusha attacks on Israeli positions in the buffer area,
Israeli forces fired more than 50 heavy shells, wounding a
60-year-old woman at Sohmour in Western Beqaa.
</P>
<P>
This constituted a breach of a cease-fire understanding Lebanon
and Israel reached in April, 1996 barring either side in south
Lebanon from targeting civilians, accused the sources who
preferred anonymity.
</P>
<P>
A position of the Israeli occupation forces at Ghzlan and
another of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia at
Sojoud were shelled by Katyusha rockets earlier this morning,
said Voice of the South radio, organ of the SLA militia. It denied
any casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attacks, and announced that "certain
casualties among the Israeli occupation forces and their client
militia were caused."
</P>
<P>
This was the second Katyusha attack in two weeks by the Shiite
Muslim group at Israeli targets in south Lebanon. Katyusha is
believed to the longest-range weapon of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also announced that its guerrillas carried out this
morning attacks on the Israeli positions of Rshaf and Hommeid in
the border strip with rocket-propelled grenades and machine-guns.
</P>
<P>
However, today's violence did not go beyond daily exchanges of
fire on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Isreali conflict,
where Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla warfare to oust the Israeli
occupation forces out of the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Israel proclaimed the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 ostensibly to insinuate northern Israel
from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 40 Billion Yuan Hydropower Project in '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to build a
gigantic hydropower plant for an estimated 40 billion yuan (about
five billion US dollars), with construction scheduled to begin
next year, according to sources from Three Gorges Engineering
Development Corporation, owner of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The new Xiluodu Project, to be located in the upper reaches of
the Jinsha River in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is
designed to have an installed capacity of 11 million kw which can
generate 52.6 billion kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the installed capacity of the project is
three times more than that of the Gezhouba Project on the Yangtze
River, while the construction scale is about two-thirds the size
of the Three Gorges, China's largest power project.
</P>
<P>
The project is considered one of the key steps adopted by the
government to tap into the rich hydraulic resources along the
Yangtze River. Also, the construction site is located in China's
less populous region, and thus the cost of construction will be
much lower than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of this project, the power generation
capacities of the Sanxia (three-gorges) Power Plant and Gezhouba
Project can provide an additional 800,000 kw, thus allowing
provinces in southwest China to save 24 million tons of fuel from
coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
The electricity is set to be transmitted eastward to support
the economic construction in the electricity-poor east regions.

to be submerged in a reservoir now under construction on the
Yellow River, to a spot 50 km away, where it will be used as a

In order to save the grotto from submersion, experts received
approval from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics to work out a

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha yesterday explained why his military government is
sending troops to Sierra Leone to fight against a military
takeover there.
</P>
<P>
He said the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) led by
Nigeria in Sierra Leone is not there to intervene in the internal
affairs of that country, because ECOMOG is a peace force, not a
warring one.
</P>
<P>
"We are in Sierra Leone because we have a mandate which is in
the national security interest of the Sierra Leonean people and
the entire sub-region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG is in Sierra Leone to secure and defend the democratic
interests and values of that country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abacha emphasized that the effort in Sierra Leone is a
sub-regional effort under the auspices of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS). Nigeria believes in collectivity
as the right approach to security and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
If it appeared that Nigeria's presence in Sierra Leone is
conspicuous, he said, it is because of her leading role and
commitment to ECOWAS, especially to the ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
As he is currently the chairman of ECOWAS, Abacha said Nigeria
will continue to work hard for the security and stability in west
Africa, and that it will continue to provide leadership in any
significant development in the sub-region.

<P>
In addition to the invitation of international observers, the
government would also like to settle the disputes with the
political parties on the upcoming elections through dialog,
Jordanian Minister of Interior Nathir Rasheed was quoted as saying
in an interview with the paper.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Jordanian King Hussein Wednesday issued a
royal decree ordering the go-ahead for the elections, while six
political parties have declared to boycott them.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Muslim Brotherhood, a main opposition
party, became the first to declare to boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party's general supervisor Abdul Majeed
Thneibat said on July 12 that the Press and Publication Law,
the one-person, one-vote election system, the normalization of
ties with Israel and "the government's measures to marginalize
political parties" were the main reasons behind the party`s
boycott of the elections.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, four other political parties, including the Jordan
People`s Democratic Party, the Jordan Arab Constitutional Front,
the National Action Front and the Al Ansar, followed suit.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Action Front (IAF), the biggest opposition party
in Jordan, also declared to boycott the elections Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some other political parties also showed support for
the boycott, but have not declared whether they will boycott or
not.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties now make up 23 seats in the 80-member
Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Multi-party system was revived in the country in 1989 as part
of the political reforms launched after widespread riots set
off by economic hardships. The protesters called for wider
public participation in decision-making.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Man Helps Educate Poor Rural Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A disabled young man in a
poverty-stricken area in North China has begun a program to help
school dropouts with his own private school.
</P>
<P>
Liu Weichang, who lives in Puzhai Village in Hebei Province,
says that he is sticking to his principle of helping, not
profiting from, poor rural children, with his 'Dawn' school.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old man survived polio in childhood and went on to
complete primary and secondary school. Refusing to stop there, he
passed the entrance exam for the Central Academy of Finance's
correspondence school.
</P>
<P>
After completing his higher education in 1991, Liu made up his
mind to set up the primary school in his village, which is in an
impoverished area.
</P>
<P>
The next year, 12 of his pupils managed to enter middle
schools, including seven who were able to attend the county's key
middle school.
</P>
<P>
Word of the drab three-room school spread, and with that its
popularity grew, but its annual tuition fee stayed at 200 yuan (24
US dollars) or below. And in fact, Liu exempted six extremely poor
pupils from any school fees at all.
</P>
<P>
By now, Liu can boast of a new schoolhouse and a dormitory on a
hectare of land, thanks to a bank loan. And, his teaching staff
have grown from one single teacher to 24.

<HEADLINE> Construction Brings Rent Tumbling in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A steady growth in the
construction industry in Kampala has caused an evident decrease
of rent for business space or a office, The Monitor reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Comparing to early 1990s, the rent rate in the city has fallen
by ten percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In a survey carried out in June and July in the main
commercial area of Kampala, the newspaper found a month rent for
a square meter of office space is between 3,000 to 20,000 Uganda
shillings according to the location and the state of the
buildings while in early 1990s it was 5,000 to 30,000 Uganda
shillings (some 1,000 Uganda shillings are equivelent to one U.S.
dollar).
</P>
<P>
The estates experts the paper interviewed with attributed the
fall of the rent to returning of Asian businessmen who renovated
their buildings and the construction of new shopping and office
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Michael Baligwa, a letting agent, told the paper that the rent
charges were much higher a year before due to minimal available
space to let.
</P>
<P>
Reduced number of clients like embassies and non-government
organisations in Kampala is another reason of the tumbling, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kituuka, a private land economist and valuation
surveyor, holds the rent falling is connected to the rapidly
increasing of buildings. "this is going to be a steady trend in
the future," he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Another 379 Sino-foreign joint
ventures opened in Beijing in the first half of the year, making
China's capital a new hot-spot for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The city attracted over 940 million US dollars worth of
overseas funds, 20.5 percent more than for the first six months of
last year. The city's foreign investment had been declining since
1994, but this year marked the change.
</P>
<P>
According to Nong Xiqun, director of the Beijing Foreign Trade
Commission, foreign funds are focusing on infrastructure,
residential buildings, finance, and high-tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Badaling Expressway project, at a cost of 320
million US dollars, has been approved by the commission, Nong said.
</P>
<P>
Many multinationals like Japan's Canon are looking for business
opportunities here, and 138 of the world's 500 biggest businesses
have invested in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Nong said that the city government has done its best to improve
the investment environment. Departments have simplified the annual
company exam procedures, and have set up a complaints office for
joint ventures.

CHANGCHUN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Jilin Province plans to
turn the food industry into its third major one, after automobiles
and petroleum, by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Food businesses at or above the county level are expected to
generate 25 billion yuan (3 billion US dollars) in annual output
value by the year 2000, accounting for nearly one fifth of the
industrial total.
</P>
<P>
A traditional high-yield agricultural province, Jilin heads the
country in per capita grain consumption, volume of marketable
grains, and corn exports. The province produces about 15 million
tons of corn a year, accounting for 70 percent of the province's
total.
</P>
<P>
Its food industry has 12.5 billion yuan (1.51 billion US
dollars) in output value and earns more than 300 million US
dollars in foreign exchange from exports yearly. But it focuses on
primary processing and fails to provide a variety of goods.
</P>
<P>
So, Jilin province will give priority to processing of local

million tons of corn and produce 240,000 tons of starch a year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Residential Property Industry Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors are
spending a huge amount of money on residential properties for
profit in South Africa, despite the rising crime rate in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a random survey of a few Johannesburg estate
agents and property executives this week, wealthy foreign
businessmen and investors recently have invested more than one
billion Rand (226 million U.S. Dollars) in property in the
Johannesburg region.
</P>
<P>
A steady stream of upmarket house-hunters from Malaysia, the
United States, Germany, Holland and Portugal are flying to
Johannesburg to look at properties, Melrose Estate agent Wendy
Machanik said early this week.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa properties are the cheapest in the world and
these buyers are not only interested in investing but also in
living here.
</P>
<P>
"They take a long-term view about the crime situation and
believe it will eventually be brought under control," Machanik
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that total foreign investment in South Africa
had amounted to 12.3 billion Rand (2.73 billion U.S. Dollars) in
equity on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange this year with under
five billion Rand (1.1 billion U.S. Dollars) for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Local property industrialists expressed belief that strong
demand for residential property in South Africa will continue for
years, providing the country remains stable.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has asked banks to consider
special loans and mortgages for property owners to repair old
buildings in the region, the Hong Kong Standard newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed mandatory building safety inspection scheme
worked out by the government recently, owners of the 25,000
buildings that are 20 years old or over would be required to
employ building professionals to inspect their property once every
 seven years, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As some property owners said they could not afford the
expensive inspection and the repair bills and their buildings were
too old for extra mortgage from banks, the paper quoted a
government spokesman as saying the government understood that some
of these owners had difficulties getting bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see if any help could be given by the banks to
those owners," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Standard continued, top housing managers in the
Hong Kong SAR called on the government to help resume land for
private developers to speed up the building of flats.
</P>
<P>
Fan Cheuk-hung, professional practice committee chairman of the
1,300-strong Chartered Institute of Housing, said the government
should introduce new measures to help private developers in
resuming land for its massive housing program, the daily added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya Committed to Control Oil prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government may impose
price control measures in the oil industry to enable consumers to
benefit from a liberalized petroleum sector.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi M'Mukindia was quoted as saying
on Friday that the current deregulation regime had empowered the
government to fix maximum prices of petroleum products if deemed
necessary.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with senior executives of oil companies, the
minister noted that the government was concerned that Kenyans had
not been able to reap the benefit of liberalization of the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
Since the liberalization of the oil sector in October 1994,
the retail price of the liquified petroleum gas (LPG) has doubled
while the cost of refining crude oil has gone up by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official viewed the situation as constituting total
exploitation of the local consumers and urged oil companies to
take necessary actions to reduce the price of LPG.
</P>
<P>
M'Mukindia announced that his ministry was committed to the
introduction of standardization of cylinder valves and regulators
for the LPG.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that oil companies in the country had resisted
the standardization in order to exploit the Kenyan consumers.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the government would introduce the
open tender system in the procurement of the country's crude oil
requirements in a bid to get oil at the cheapest prices.
</P>
<P>
At present, seven multi-national oil companies operating in
the east African country have formed cartels to monopolize the
local oil markets, charging unreasonable prices and driving
smaller firms out of the market.
</P>
<P>
In order to rout out monopolistic tendencies, the Kenyan
government has licensed 13 private oil companies to compete with
the giant companies.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned National Oil Corporation of Kenya and the
Kenya Pipeline Company are investing in service stations,
liquified petroleum gas import terminal and other facilities to
provide alternative services to local consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is also considering to take legal
measures to neutralize cartel and monopolistic practices in the
energy sector for the benefit of consumers.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ruling Coalition Keeps out Breakaway Faction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of India's ruling
United Front has decided to keep the Rashtriya Janata Party (RJD)
out of the coalition government, bringing to an end weeks of
internal bickering over the status of the breakaway faction, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour marathon meeting late Friday night, the
Standing Committee of the United Front decided to shut the door on
RJD.
</P>
<P>
Laloo Prasad Yadav, former Janata Dal president and Bihar chief
minister, floated the RJD on July 5 following a fierce power
struggle within the Janata Dal, the largest party in the United
Front before the split.
</P>
<P>
Yadav's opponents in the United Front, including former Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, the truncated Janata Dal and left
parties, have been strongly opposing the entry of the RJD into the
coalition, and they have been pressing Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral to remove his three ministers nominated by Yadav.
</P>
<P>
They argued that because Yadav was facing corruption charges
for his alleged involvement in an embezzlement scandal, the clean
image of the coalition would be tainted by the entry of his RJD.
</P>
<P>
Some other factions of the front, such as the Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam (DMK), favored the staying of RJD in the front and the
three ministers loyal to Yadav in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The disputes focusing on the fate of the RJD and three
Yadav-nominated ministers had posed serious threats to the
stability of the three-month-old Gujral coalition.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the United Front leaders did not take a
decision on the fate of the three ministers but left it to Prime
Minister Gujral's discretion. Gujral has publicly favored the
continued staying of the three ministers in his government.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, just hours before the United Front leaders
decided to keep out the RJD, Yadav announced his decision to
resign as chief minister of Bihar state after a special court of
the Central Bureau of Investigation had issued an arrest warrant
against him on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
But Yadav managed to install his wife as new chief minister of
the state hours after his resignation.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Strikes Western Japan, Paralyzing Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A powerful typhoon struck western
Japan this evening, drenching wide areas with heavy rains and
paralyzing land, air and sea traffic, Japanese media reported.
</P>
<P>
The center of the typhoon, the season's ninth, was located at 3
p.m. about 50 kilometers southeast of Cape Muroto on the southern
tip of eastern Shikoku Island, the smallest of Japan's four main
islands, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Packing winds of up to 144 kilometers per hour, the storm was
moving north-northwest at a speed of 20 kph.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the storm, the third to directly strike the
Japanese archipelago this year, has an atmospheric pressure of 965
hectopascals at its center.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon forced the cancellation of more than 300 domestic
air flights linking western Japan with capital Tokyo and other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
It also forced the suspension of bullet train services between
Osaka and Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, on the Sanyo Shinkansen
line. Almost all ferry services in western and southwestern Japan
were also canceled.
</P>
<P>
By this evening, the center of the typhoon is expected to reach
eastern Shikoku or the nearby waters, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency warned of strong winds and heavy rains until the
typhoon travels across western Japan through the Sea of Japan
early Sunday.

LONDON, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- London's first directly-elected mayor will be allowed to
raise money from motorists through increased car parking costs,
fines and charges for using busy roads, the Government will
disclose next week.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's booming service industries are keeping economic
growth well above the rate which the Government believes is
consistent with stable inflation, even though the manufacturing
sector is stagnating.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Women are to be given greater opportunities to serve in the
front line of the Army under a new Government drive to ensure that
the Armed Forces are "fair, modern and enlightened." With the Army
currently 5,000 under strength and facing a growing recruitment
crisis, a tough message is also being sent out to all three forces
that there will be "zero tolerance" to sexual and racial
harassment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat held a
meeting in Alexandria, 220 kilometers north of Cairo, this
morning, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between the two leaders on the
stalled Mideast peace process within a week in the Egypt's second
largest city.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has remained paralyzed since Israel began
building thousands of homes for Jews in the hilltop Har Homa on
the brink of East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are also believed to focus on the Israeli decision
giving the green light for more settlement activities in the
occupied East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a move blasted by Arafat as a "declaration of war," Israel's
Jerusalem City Council decided late on Thursday to build a Jewish
settler enclave in the 11,000-strong Arab neighborhood of Ras
Al-Amoud in the heart of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has warned that such a decision, combined with the Har
Homa building controversy, will kill the peace process and foil
ongoing efforts.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in the Mediterranean city this morning
following his European trip, is believed to brief the Egyptian
leader the outcome of his talks with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak and European Union
foreign ministers in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
As a part of a European bid to advance Israeli-Palestinian
peace moves, the EU brokered the Levy-Arafat meeting in Brussels,
the highest level contact between the Palestinian and Israeli
sides in the five-month-old peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting will be followed up by an enlarged
Egyptian-Palestinian meeting in Cairo on Sunday to evaluate the
present peace situation. Egypt is expected to host a tripartite
summit grouping Mubarak, Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein by the
end of this month.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Launches Marketing Drive to Boost Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Zambia Railway
Authority (tazara) has launched an aggressive marketing drive
aimed at boosting its business in Zambia, South Africa and the
Democratic Republic of Congo, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Moving his ministry's 1997/98 budget estimates at the National
Assembly in Dodoma on Friday, the Minister of Communications and
Transport, William Kusila, said the strategy would involve
strengthening ties with the Zambia Railways Corporation and firms
in South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The minister said jointly with the Tanzania Harbours Authority
(THA), TAZARA was now exploring new markets and intends to open
an office for its representative in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kusila also told the house that the authority was implementing
a commercialization program which include workers retrenchment,
establishment of computerised management information system and
work study.
</P>
<P>
He said in the 1995/96 TAZARA performed badly compared with
the previous year. However, he said the cargo transported by it
increased by 4 percent from 636,188 transported in 1994 to
662,523 in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on passengers, he said TAZARA experienced a big
drop of 20 percent from 1.8 million travelled in 1994/95 down to
1.5 million in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1995/96, TAZARA suffered 1.4 billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 2.3 million US Dollars) loss compared to 500
million T.Shs. (about 830,000 Dollars) profit realized in the
1994/95.
</P>
<P>
The minister said shortage of locomotives and wagons was a
major factor for the poor performance of TAZARA and that the
authority's management was not efficient enough in handling the
operations under the stiff commercial competititon.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker to Meet Muslim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The speaker of the Philippine House
of Representatives, Jose de Venecia, is scheduled to meet the
country's Muslim rebel leaders today in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia will hold talks with Al Haj Murad and Ghadzali
Jaafar, vice chairmen of the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), in Camp Abubakar, the MILF's biggest camp in
Maguindanao province, the Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia was quoted as saying the meeting is intended to push
the stalled MILF-government peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The MILF froze its low-level peace talks with Manila late last
month soon after the military overran its second biggest camp in
Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
No particular agenda was laid down by de Venecia for today's
meeting with MILF leaders, leaving many observers speculating that
the speaker's peace initiative has something to do with his
political ambition for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia has openly declared his intention to run for the
presidency in next year's elections. Like other presidential
aspirants, the speaker is also seeking President Fidel Ramos'
"blessing" as his successor.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the Muslim extremist Abu Sayyaf are the two
remaining Muslim insurgent groups still fighting the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the bigger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), has refused to accept the MNLF-Manila
peace accord signed last year. But the group began its own peace
talks with Manila this January.

<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the United States
yesterday signed an extradition treaty, the first such agreement
Zimbabwe has entered outside the Commonwealth and one to help the
country fight growing international crime.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe Johnnie Carson and
Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge signed the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is only the second that the U.S. has signed with an
African country after the U.S.-Liberia extradition treaty of
1932.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said, "with the increase in trans-boundary crimes the
world over, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, there
is need for a concerted effort at a global level to combat and
eliminate such a global menace."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and the U.S. had taken at least three years
negotiating for the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Carson said the signing of the treaty was testimony of the
high esteem the U.S. regards the Zimbabwean judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"The Zimbabwean judiciary is renowned worldwide for its
courage and independence. It is our faith and confidence in the
impartiality and professionalism of your courts which made this
treaty possible," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Muslims in Kenya
demonstrated on Friday in port city Mombasa in protest against
alleged Jewish blasphemy of the Islamic religion, according to a
"East African Standard" report today.
</P>
<P>
The placard-waving demonstrators called upon the Israeli
ambassador to kenya to apologize publicly to Kenyan Muslims and
asked the Kenyan government to sever diplomatic ties with Israel
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators walked to the Israeli consulate in the city,
burning an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and the Israeli flag.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-Israeli slogans, the demonstrators marched from
the consulate to the Provincial Commissioner's office to present
a memorandum, demanding, among other things, the immediate
suspension of diplomatic relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said that the suspension should be put in force
pending an apology by the Israeli government to Muslims and the
taking of appropriate measures against the Israeli woman who
defiled the image of Prophet Muhammad in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said that the action by the Israeli woman
was similar to that of Salman Rushdie who authored the "Satanic
Rushdie" and on whose head Iran put a price.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The third Australian athlete
participating in the 15th Maccabiah Games in Israel died of
injuries today in the tragedy of pedestrian bridge collapse,
according to the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Savinsky, 48, Australian bridge champion, died in a
hospital in Afula early this morning.
</P>
<P>
A pedestrian bridge collapsed at the opening of the 15th
Maccabiah Games in the National Stadium, Ramat Gan, at night of
July 14, sending a group of Australian athletes plummeting into
the Yarkon River.
</P>
<P>
Gregory Small, 36, and Yetty Bennett, 50, died in the tragic
event. Savinsky had been among the 66 injured.
</P>
<P>
Her condition had deteriorated due to infection in her lungs
apparently caused by pollution in the Yarkon River. She had been
flown by a helicopter to Afula hospital immediately to be
connected to a special lung machine.
</P>
<P>
Her family were at her bedside Friday night as doctors made
their last efforts to save her life.
</P>
<P>
The games closed Thursday night. A pallor of sadness hung
over the closing ceremony at Latrun in Jerusalem, a usually
festive occasion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
referred to the accident as "tragic and senseless." But he
added that "the horror did not stop the games."
</P>
<P>
According to the findings presented by a special investigating
committee, a chain of negligence, from faulty planning through
incompetent building, was blamed on all parties involved in the
collapse of the footbridge specially built for the Maccabiah
Games. No persons have so far been indicted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find Way to Determine Giant Panda Pregnancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have made a
breakthrough in ascertaining pregnancy in giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The Giant Panda Breeding Research Center in this capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province has employed enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for pregnancy testing for pandas, the
first success in this field.
</P>
<P>
According to an ELISA test, scientists can determine pregnancy
with an error rate of under five percent. They can also predict
the date of delivery.
</P>
<P>
"The ELISA method is safe and easy to operate," said Prof. Li
Guanghuan of the Center, adding that the result can be ready after
only a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
In addition, after being treated with this method giant pandas
show an increased birth rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the reason the giant panda is endangered is
its low reproductive ability.
</P>
<P>
During their yearly three-to-five-day oestrus period, mature
female giant pandas have no obvious change of vulva or any
distinctive behavior, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, fake pregnancy of some prevents scientists from
appropriate determination.
</P>
<P>
Since the first artificial reproduction of a giant panda in
China in 1963, scientists have made many achievements in
collecting male giant pandas' sperm, artificial insemination and
breeding giant panda cubs.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists still found it difficult to determine
mating time and pregnancy before the new ELISA test was developed.
</P>
<P>
A mature female giant panda can become pregnant once a year if
she successfully mates with a male.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda remains one of the most endangered species on
earth, with its population standing at about 1,000, most of whom
live in western China's Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.

<HEADLINE> China Asks U.S. Not to Let Taiwan Issue Interfere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China today asked
the United States not to allow the Taiwan question to interfere
with relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright here before they were to hold talks on
questions including Cambodia, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
said the question of Taiwan has always been the core issue in
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation of the fact that President Bill
Clinton, Albright and other U.S. officials have repeatedly
reiterated the U.S. commitment to the observance of the one-China
policy and the three joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the U.S. side will honor this commitment and
handle the question of Taiwan cautiously and properly in order to
prevent the question of Taiwan from interfering again with the
improvement and growth of Sino-U.S. relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that since the beginning of this year, ties between
the two countries on the whole have maintained a good momentum of
growth.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has returned to the motherland smoothly and China's
most-favored-nation status in trade with the United States has
been renewed for this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he added, both sides are making vigorous
preparations for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the
United States in the coming fall.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to have frank and in-depth exchange of views with
Madam Secretary of State on Sino-U.S. relations and issues of
common interest," said Qian, who has met with Albright four times
this year.
</P>
<P>
On China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Qian said it is in China's interests and also in the interests of
the international community including the United States.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out China has already made tremendous effort for
joining the WTO and hoped that the U.S. side will demonstrate
pragmatism and flexibility and solve this problem as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of nuclear proliferation, Qian said China has always
adopted a serious and responsible attitude toward the matter and
has strictly fulfilled its international obligations. "China has
no intention to carry out proliferation nor has it the political
and economic needs to do so."
</P>
<P>
On the human rights question, Qian declared, "We stand ready to
have dialogue with others in order to better understand each other
and seek common ground while shelving differences."
</P>
<P>
"However, dialogue must take place on the basis of equality and
mutual respect," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Beans, Vietnam's Second Most Valuable Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Coffee beans has became Vietnam's
second most valuable crop after rice, which gives the country an
annual export turnover of 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is ranked eighth in coffee acreage and sixth in
production among the 70 coffee-producing countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Coffee acreage in the country has increased to the present
230,000 ha, of which 180,000 ha yield beans.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 crop, Vietnam harvested a record of 300,000 tons
of coffee beans, of which some 248,000 tons were shipped abroad in
the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to export 280,000 tons this year, trying to
become Asia's second largest coffee exporter after Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
As many as 320,000 tons of coffee beans are expected to be
harvested from the 1997-98 crop and of the amount, 310,000 tons
are going for export.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's coffee is exported to nearly 40 countries with the
United States, Germany and Japan being the three biggest buyers.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's coffee is less competitive than Indian and
Indonesian coffee in the world market due to its low quality,
which results in losses of millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
What is worse is that 90 percent of Vietnam's coffee-growing
areas is covered by the robusta strain while only 10 percent was
by arabica, whose value is 1.5 to two times higher than robusta.
</P>
<P>
A further 3,000 ha will be planted with arabica coffee in the
1997-98 crop, so that arabica coffee area will make up 30 percent
of the total acreage by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to improve coffee processing technology and
expand arabica coffee-growing acreage in the coming years in order
to raise export coffee quality.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country is accelerating preparations for
joining the world coffee producers' association in order to get
timely information on the world coffee market and the latest
approaches to planting and processing technologies.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Extension ESAF Credit for Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a request of the government of Guinea-Bissau
to extend the 3-year arrangement under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) ending in March, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also agreed the country's request to increase the
amount by about 1.4 million U.S. dollars. This will provide about
6.5 million dollars to back the Guinea-Bissau's economic program
for 1997/98.
</P>
<P>
The IMF okayed a three-year ESAF credit for Guinea-Bissau
equivalent to about 13 million dollars in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. The ESAF credits carry an annual interest of 0.5
percent and are repayable over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The 1997/98 economic program seeks annual GDP growth of about 5
percent, to contain annual inflation at about 10 percent in 1997
and 7 percent in 1998 as well as to reduce the external current
account deficit to 18 percent of GDP in 1997 and to 16.4 percent
of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Guinea-Bissau joined the IMF in March, 1977. Its quota is about
14 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing
currently totals about 10 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua May Invite World Guarantors to Peace Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The group mediating Nicaragua's
so-called national dialogue may invite international guarantors to
the talks despite President Arnoldo Aleman's opposition, fueling
hopes that the Sandinistas, the main opposition, may also take
part.
</P>
<P>
The national dialogue, proposed by Aleman to resolve a dispute
over properties confiscated by the left-wing Sandinistas during
their 1979-1990 rule, began Monday without the participation of
Daniel Ortega's Sandinista Front (FSLN).
</P>
<P>
The presence of international guarantors is one of the
conditions set by the Sandinistas for participation in the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Aleman demanded that the Sandinistas surrender the properties
they confiscated in their final days of government in 1990 or
compensate people for them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas have accused Aleman of trying to
kick thousands of families who received confiscated land off their
property and return it to their former owners. Aleman has denied
the charges.
</P>
<P>
The mediating group said they may invite international
guarantors to the dialogue after meeting international diplomats
from the United States, Europe and South America Thursday who
supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said they would not insist on the participation of
the Sandinistas in the dialogue, but as a show of good will, the
Sandinistas' proposal about the guarantors should be on the agenda
of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, Aleman has repeatedly rejected the idea of inviting
international guarantors, saying only Nicaraguans can find
solutions to their own problems.
</P>
<P>
The Central American country is tense after weeks of clashes
between protesters and police in late June and early this month
left 150 people injured.
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, the battle was over student demands for an increase
in education spending. But behind it was the struggle between
leftist Sandinistas and the conservative government.
</P>
<P>
The struggle began when Sandinistas claimed balloting in
several districts in last October elections was fraudulent. Aleman
defeated the FSLN's Daniel Ortega by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
The tension has prompted fears that the country could slide
back into an open war that plagued the country in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas seized power in a 1979 revolution, ending four
decades of dictatorship. U.S.-supported Contra rebels tried in
vain to overthrow them.
</P>
<P>
Then, Violeta Chamorro replaced Ortega as president after a
landslide victory over the Sandinistas in 1990, ending a
eight-year civil war. She was succeeded by Aleman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although Chamorro entered into a pact with the Sandinistas to
lay the basis for coexistence, Aleman has insisted he will never
make a pact with the front.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to boost confidence in
the Russian currency ruble, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed
a law today that will impose a 0.5 percent tax on purchases of
cash foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The tax is expected to bring about 1 trillion rubles (172
million U.S. dollars) in revenue to the government this year.
</P>
<P>
The tax, which failed to win parliamentary approval in the 1997
budget, will apply to all foreign currencies and is expected to
lead to a slight increase in commission charges by banks.
</P>
<P>
Sales of foreign currency for rubles are not taxed.
Transactions between commercial banks also are not covered.
</P>
<P>
Years of sluggish economic growth and high inflation has
damaged Russians' confidence in their currency, and many people
have scrambled to hold their savings in foreign currency cash.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank figures show that Russians bought a total of 51.57
billion U.S. dollars in cash from commercial banks last year.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Still Scenic After Dam Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of local tourism experts
recently asked people not to be so eager for travel agencies'
"Farewell Three Gorges" tours, because the area will maintain its
beauty even after the huge dam is built there.
</P>
<P>
The central Chinese area where the multi-billion yuan
hydro-electric power project is now under construction on the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River, will continue to be a tourist
paradise, with some new scenic sites, they said.
</P>
<P>
The China Three Gorges Construction Corporation and the Tourism
Administration of Hubei Province expressed this view at a recent
meeting in Wuhan, capital of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
No tourist spots will be affected when the river is blocked for
dam work by November of this year, and out of 39 historic and
scenic sites, only 13 will be submerged by 2012 when the project
is completed, with a water level of 175 m above sea-level.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken steps to preserve some of the
important historic and tourist sites that will be under water.
</P>
<P>
Experts caution tourists about being misled by some travel
agencies who are trying to get people to join their "farewell"
trips, because the existing tourist sites will not all be
submerged until 2003, when the second phase of the project comes
to an end.

BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government's fiscal
position has improved with its fiscal deficit continuing to
decline, local newspaper Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the ninth month of the current 1997 fiscal
year (from October 1, 1996 to September 30, 1997), the deficit
fell to 12 billion Baht (465 million U.S. dollars), from 50
billion Baht (2 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of the first
quarter (December 1996) of the 1997 fiscal year.

The deficit is expected to fall further to about 10 billion
Baht (312.5 million U.S. dollars) by the end of the fiscal year,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The improved outlook is attributed to high revenue collection.
</P>

(1.14 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Central Government Aids Economic Development in Northwest Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a
landlocked area in northwest China, has made headway in economic
growth with the aid of state funding.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, Ningxia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 1996 was two percentage points higher than the
country's average level of 9.7 percent, which indicates its
economy is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is the sole autonomous region inhabited by the Hui
people. Located in the northwest mountainous areas, its traffic
conditions and economic conditions lag far behind eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
Now that China has started to shift its development focus
westward, the central government has invested heavily in the fixed
assets reformation in the area to reinforce the development of
local basic industries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central government invested some 7.2 billion
yuan in the area, an increase of 14.7 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The funding has guaranteed the construction of key projects in
Ningxia, including the Lingxin Mine, capable of producing 2.4
million tons annually in the Lingwu mining area; the fourth unit
of a hydroelectric power station with an installed capacity of
300,000 kw. A number of major projects are now under construction.
</P>
<P>
Some traffic projects, such as Baoji-Zhongwei Railway, Hedong
Airport in Yinchuan, capital of the region, and a road tunnel in
the Liupan Mountain are also underway, and will greatly improve
the poor traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the central government used to
appropriate 30 million yuan each year for a project in the Ningxia
mountainous areas to help the local people gain access to drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the central government granted three billion yuan to
the water channel project, and also reclaimed wasteland and built
irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off: Over 500,000 people in Xihaigu
Prefecture have moved above the poverty line. Last year, an
unprecedented grain harvest brought to Ningxia 2.5 billion tons of
grain, representing an increase of 26.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has become a major grain and non-staple food producer
in northwest China, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the first
five months of the year were worth 587 billion Baht (22.95 billion
U.S. dollars), up 2.3 percent over the same period of last year,
according to a Commerce Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit shrank by 29.4 percent to 144 billion Baht
(5.58 billion U.S. dollars), although imports rose by 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The source said the export figures showed the promise of a
recovery, with exporters confirming that orders have been placed
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
Though there was only a slight improvement in exports in the
past five months, the floating of the Baht would help exports
reach the 10 percent growth target and finish the year at 1.4
trillion Baht (43.75 billion dollars), the source said.
</P>
<P>
However, some exporters complained about the Baht float after
some local suppliers stopped supplying them with imported raw
materials due to higher import costs.

<HEADLINE> New Albania Cabinet Takes Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Albania's new government led by the
Socialist Party took office today, vowing to restore security and
revitalize the economy after five months of chaos.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers led by Prime Minister Fatos Nano were sworn
in by new President Rexhep Mejdani at the Palace of Brigades.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Nano named his left and center-left coalition
government, more than one month after the elections in the
trouble-hit Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The government comprises five parties and 22 ministers,
including the prime minister and fellow Socialist Bashkim Fino,
who was named deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Fino was appointed caretaker prime minister in March as Albania
was lurching towards anarchy.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani, 53, a former physics professor who joined the Socialist
Party only last year, was elected by the parliament on July 24 and
immediately asked Nano as the leader of the parliamentary majority
to form a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been ruled by a Socialist-led national unity
government since March, when former President Sali Berisha's
Democratic Party government stepped down at the height of unrest
sparked by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Heeds Complaint from Mexican Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica officials have said
that the procedural difficulties faced by some Mexican companies
will not lead to the withdrawal of foreign investment out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Three Mexican companies -- Triturados Basalticos (Tribasa),
Ingenieros Civiles Asociados (ICA) and Mabe -- have complained
that their experiences in Costa Rica are not very positive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesmen for the three Mexican firms said that the
cancellations of biddings already won are an invitation for not
returning.
</P>
<P>
In response to the complaint, Costa Rican Minister of Economy
Jose Leon Desanti and Minister of Planning Leonardo Garnier
conceded that there are many obstacles to foreign investment in
the country.
</P>
<P>
But efforts have been made over last 10 years to eliminate
them, said Garnier.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Trade Vice Minister Carlos Murillo said that what
happened with the Tribasa construction firm and Mabe could happen
with companies of any other country.
</P>
<P>
First Vice President Rodrigo Oreamuno said that government will
try to solve all the cases after careful examination.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the analysis of the free trade agreement with Mexico,
which came into force in January 1995 is expected to complete in
the next few weeks, Costa Rican authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Father Gives Part Of Liver To Save Daughter's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Yu Faqin, who was born into a
farmer's family in a small village in central China's Henan
Province in 1987, had trouble with her liver since she was only
two years old.
</P>
<P>
She was frequently bed-ridden with high fever and jaundice, and
was carried around to various hospitals on her parents' backs as
early as she could remember.
</P>
<P>
Her disease also cost her parents a fortune and they sold their
cattle and property just to cover medical costs.
</P>
<P>
Last November, when the disease turned worse, her parents took
her to Xijing Hospital, in Xi'an, capital of Northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, where she was diagnosed as having congenital
cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic duct, an advanced stage of
liver disease causing cirrhosis of the liver.
</P>
<P>
The only way to save her life was a liver transplant,
preferably part of one of her parents' liver. The cost of the
operation would be more than 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Her parents could not afford to pay anything near that amount,
but hospital authorities decided to do the operation for free. A
team of doctors from 19 departments was assembled and medicine
ordered from other parts of China and overseas, and a 200,000-yuan
microscope was brought by air from Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, for the delicate operation.
</P>
<P>
The 13-hour operation, which was done on June 30 under the
supervision of a Japanese doctor, involved transplanting a third
of her father's liver to the 10-year-old girl. Liver transplants
had only been done for eight years in China, and none had been
successful before.
</P>
<P>
She lapsed into a coma after the operation, but on the third
day she woke up. The liver graft began to function on the seventh
day, and by the ninth, it had grown a centimeter in diameter. Half
a month after the operation, the girl could manage to eat some
porridge and noodles and played with the hospital staff.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds up Highway Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding the construction
of a nationwide highway network to ease the "transport bottleneck"
holding its continuous economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to a cross-century blueprint drafted by the Ministry
of Communications, 12 major highways with a total mileage of
35,000 km - five on a north-south axis and seven on an east-west
axis - will be built across the country, linking all the 31
provincial and autonomous regional capitals, as well as the four
municipalities on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The highways will also connect all cities each with a
population of more than one million and 93 percent of the cities
each with a population of more than half a million, benefiting
about 600 million people of the country, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Cao You'an, deputy director of the ministry's
Planning Department, as saying that the ministry plan was set into
motion in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
One-day return journeys within distances of 400-500 km and
one-way trips of 800-1,000 km will be made possible on the new
highway system, the official said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 km of the national trunk highways of the network
have already been completed. They include some well-known
expressways and first-class highways for the exclusive use of
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of
Communications, by the end of 1996, the country had built 1.18
million km of highways, including 3,400 km of expressways.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres arrived here today from Brazil for a three-day
official visit to Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti and Guterres had a
private meeting today before attending the signing ceremony of the
agreement on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments in
both countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the ceremony, Sanguinetti said that
this is the first visit to Uruguay by a Portuguese prime minister,
which will contribute to developing relations between both
countries and the two regional blocs -- Mercosur and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Guterres said that through the visit he wants to develop a
framework of relations stronger than in the past, taking advantage
of the dynamic interrelation between the European Union and
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is necessary for Portugal to transform a
relation of great cultural and historical identity into a
practical relation, into relations between the enterprises,
between the societies, between the cultures.
</P>
<P>
Both countries will sign some other agreements during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese prime minister is scheduled to visit the
Legislative Palace and meet with Uruguayan Vice president Hugo
Batalla, Montevideo Mayor Mariano Arana and with some Uruguayan
businessmen this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Guterres will travel to the city of Colonia, in
west Uruguay, where he will participate in the inauguration of the
remodeling work of the Portuguese Period Museum.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Portugal and Uruguay is limited with the balance
of trade tilting to Uruguay. Uruguayan imports from Portugal were
3 million U.S. dollars while its exports to the European country
were 6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Albanian FM Pledges to Improve Ties With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Albania's newly-appointed Foreign
Minister today pledged that his country will seek to build up good
neighborly relations with its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after the sworn-in of the new
government led by the Socialist Party, Paskal Milo stressed that
improving relations with its neighbors is much better than
lingering in the state of Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Milo, who is vice-chairman of the Socialist Party and a
well-known expert on international affairs, said that in order to
create a relaxed international environment for Albania the
government should, first of all, develop good relations with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But for some historical and other reasons, there have been
tensions and unease in the relations between Albania and its
neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Milo said that the new government will pursue a new policy of
resolving differences and conflicts between neighbors through
dialogue and peaceful means, which will help promote good-will
between Albania and Italy, Greece, Macedonia and the Republic of
Serbia of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between his country and Serbia, Milo called on
both countries to usher in a new chapter without any prejudice.
</P>
<P>
But it does not mean that Albania will cease to back the
interests of the ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries,
especially in Kosovo, he added.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Albania and Serbia became restrained after
Albania supported the independence movement of Kosovo led by
ethnic Albanians.

<P>
XIAMEN, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong investment in Xiamen, a
special economic zone in southeast China's Fujian Province,
increased markedly in the first half of the year at 345 million US
dollars, up 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong funded 173 projects in the first half, up 55 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Most investment is going to industries in the form of exclusive
backing, one economist said, and some of it is an increase to
expand production after good results were achieved.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is Xiamen's largest investor. It began investing in
service trades on a small scale in 1981, but that increased
remarkably to more than a billion US dollars from 1986 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
The economic co-operation reached a high point from 1991 to
1995 at 5.8 billion US dollars for 1,132 projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, 90 percent of Hong Kong-funded ventures are showing

half of the year came from Hong Kong, and 68 percent of its 480
overseas-funded firms were set up by Hong Kong businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The two regions have co-operated extensively since the
1980s. Trade with Hong Kong was worth 130 million US dollars in
the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Co-operation covers real estate, textiles, building
materials, and pharmaceuticals. Hi-tech products, and electric
machinery and processing products have gradually replaced the
traditional farm and sideline produce, and spending on the
petro-chemical, minerals, and processing industries has increased.
</P>
<P>
China is supporting the non-ferrous metal and petrochemical
development in Xinjiang, making it a comprehensive petrochemical
base, the country's biggest cotton production base, and a key
textile center.
</P>

JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Regal of Hong Kong rallied from a
six-point halftime deficit to beat Kia Motor of South Korea 64-59
on Friday to win the eighth Asian Basketball Confederation's
Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
Led by Clifford Aaron Reed, Kia broke open a 12-12 game after
10 minutes and led 32-26 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
But Reed injured his leg four minutes before the intermission,
forcing him out of the game and allowing Regal to dominate the
second half.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong team refused to play the fast game Kia is known
for and controlled the tempo of the final.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy was to slow the game down and keep it low
scoring, about 60 or 70 points. Then we had a chance to win," team
chairman Stanley Au said, "If we came out running, Kia is too fast
a team. We would have run out of energy by the end of the game."
</P>
<P>
Yung Kam-wah, who flew in for the team's last two games, was
the leading scorer with 22 points, scoring often in the final
minutes to break a deadlocked game.
</P>
<P>
Tournament MVP Wayman Strickland contributed 12 points and five
assists.
</P>
<P>
Third place was won by the Aspac team of Indonesia with a 78-52
victory over Isuzu of Japan, and Tanduay Gold of the Philippines
finished fifth with a 94-89 victory over China's Hongshan 94-89.

<HEADLINE> Agriculture Must Be Put on AFTA Agenda: Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) countries insist that agriculture and textile products
should be on the agenda in negotiations on the creation of the
American Free Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
The four Mercosur countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay -- will reject any U.S. boycott to talks on agriculture
products, Brazilian Foreign Affairs Ministry undersecretary Jose
Botafogo Gonzalves was quoted as saying by the press in today's
issues.
</P>
<P>
The four countries want the creation of two specific groups to
negotiate textile and agriculture products during the creation of
AFTA, said Botafogo.
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to counteract the U.S. boycott to the entry of
agriculture and textile products into its market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is the sector in which we have most restrictions
in the U.S., Canadian and EU markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
International barriers to agriculture products cause a loss of
5 billion dollars to Brazil, said Brazilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks on the AFTA creation is foreseen for
July 29 in Costa Rica with the attendance of 34 vice commerce
ministers of the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Next week's meeting in Costa Rica will be the first of the
three that will precede the second summit of the Americas
scheduled for April, 1998 in Chile.
</P>
<P>
The issue of textile and agriculture products will be taken up
at these meetings.

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Factory orders for durable
goods in the U.S. increased by 2.3 percent last month, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last for three years and more, hit a record seasonally
adjusted 180.6 billion dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest gain since last January and the increase
followed a 0.4 percent decrease in May.
</P>
<P>
The durable goods increase was concentrated in transportation
equipment which were up by 7.5 percent. Military goods gained by
9.9 percent and primary metals such as steel increased by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Bookings for electrical equipment were unchanged and orders for
industrial machinery fell by 0.6 percent, the second consecutive
month of decline.
</P>
<P>
However, even excluding the volatile transportation sector,
orders were up 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, a measure of current production,
climbed by 1.8 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted 179.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the backlog of unfilled orders rose 0.3 percent to
498.8 billion dollars.

June's rebound showed that U.S. economic growth remains healthy
though subdued compared with the quick pace in the first quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced that 15 big-city school districts are joining his
program of voluntary standards, and called on more states to
follow suit, in a hope to upgrade the students' skills.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the single most important thing we can do to give
our children world-class education is to insist on high national
standards," the president said in a speech to the National
Association of Elementary School Principals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was satisfied that some big cities, including New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and Seattle, have
joined the program.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of these school districts know that "this is an
historic, astonishing, wonderful moment in American education, and
I thank them for doing it," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has pushed states to enlist schools in a voluntary
program of testing and performance measures for grade-school
students starting in 1999 when the test becomes available. But
only six states have responded to his call so far.
</P>
<P>
He accused governors of "dragging their feet" and producing
inadequate support for national school standards.
</P>
<P>
"When we don't expect or encourage our children to learn, we
indirectly encourage them to fail," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"we don't have to settle for second-class expectations or
second-class goals for any of our children," he stressed.

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned homes
in the U.S. declined by 2.6 percent in June but remained at a
healthy level, the U.S. National Association of Realtors reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the existing single-family homes sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million units last month
following an increase of 4.7 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of previously owned homes fell by 7.7 percent
in the Northeast and 6.4 percent in the West. They were unchanged
in the South and rose by 0.9 percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing home in the U.S. was 127,200
dollars in June, up by 3.5 percent from a year ago. The median
price is the midpoint, meaning half homes sold for more and half
for less.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. mortgage rates continue to favor the homes
sales. Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.69 percent in
June, down from 7.94 percent in May, according to the U.S. Federal
Homes Loan Corporation recently. They have averaged 7.5 percent so
far this month.

The 911 call made shortly before the bomb went off was intended
to bring officers to the scene, the Associated Press quoted Jack
Daulton, the agent in charge of the investigation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Daulton said that the bomber knew that officers would rush to
the Olympic park to move people to safety.
</P>
<P>
The 911 caller had warned, "There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes." And the bomb went off in just 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in the park on July 27 last year during the
Olympic Games, killing one woman and injuring more than 100

<HEADLINE> Greece Decides to Deregulate National Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government today decided
during a cabinet meeting that the national electric power market
would be deregulated, making it possible for the private sector to
produce electric power, government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, Reppas said
that the institutional, organizing and administrative framework
governing the electric power market would have to be completed by
February 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the private sector will be given the
possibility of producing electric power and that the Public Power
Corporation (DEH) will maintain public control," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was also decided that processes for linking
Greece with the European networks (cable with Italy) would be
speeded up and the institutional framework for the purchase of
electric power promoted in parliament by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Netanyahu's Opposition to New Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States today called
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition to building
a Jewish enclave in Arab East Jerusalem a positive step and
appealed for stalled Middle East peace talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
"I think the important point is that Prime Minister Netanyahu
has voiced opposition to the (Jerusalem building) project and said
he would work to prevent implementation of the plan," deputy
spokesman of the State Department James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as Netanyahu's office said that the Israeli
leader had told the Palestinian Authority he would block
construction of the settler enclave "at this time."
</P>
<P>
The construction of the settler enclave was decided by the
Israeli Jerusalem municipality Thursday. It involves the building
of a few dozed houses by American Jewish businessman Irving
Moskowitz in the 11,000-strong Arab neighborhood of Ras al-Amoud.
</P>
<P>
The municipality's decision was met with anger by Palestinian
officials who feared that building Jewish homes in such a
sensitive area would lead to a new round of violence.
</P>
<P>
Foley said, "This is a time for calm and it's a time mostly to
return to the negotiating table and we think that the fact that
the prime minister says he opposes this is a positive step."
</P>
<P>
Foley also said it was important to get the stalled peace
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians back on track
and the building project was a hindrance to this.

<HEADLINE> Another Group of Deaf Mexican Peddlers Found in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. immigration agents in
Sanford, North Carolina, have broken up an alleged ring similar to
one in New York City that forced deaf Mexicans to sell trinkets on
the street to earn money.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen deaf adults and three children in the case were taken
into custody, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The two brick houses are well known to neighbors, who said the
Mexicans peddled key chains and tiny American flags on streets and
outside supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
The deaf people didn't have complaints of beatings, but they
were being held captive and were forced to work and to turn over
the money and to bring in a minimum of money every day, Teodoro
Maus, Mexico's consul general in Atlanta, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last week, police found in New York City that 57 people, most
of them unable to hear or speak, were living in two homes. The
group, including 12 children, was allegedly smuggled into the
United States to peddle trinkets on the subways and streets.
</P>
<P>
The alleged ringleader is still at large but seven other
Mexicans face charges including smuggling and extortion in the New
York City case.

NEW YORK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street meandered
in a narrow range today, producing little changes in most major
indexes, but snapping a streak of record highs by the Dow Jones
industrial average.

<P>
The Dow fell 3.49 points in the final minutes to 8,113.44. The

Experts said that investors are more concerned about next week's
readings on employment costs, which typically account for
two-thirds of a product's price.

The Commerce Department reported this morning that orders for
big-ticket manufactured goods perked up a surprising 2.3 percent
in June, while the National Association of Realtors reported that

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile market remained
flat in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from China's Ministry of
Machine-building Industry, the auto production topped 813,600
units in the first six months, a year-on-year rise of 7.28 percent
while sales reached 774,800 units, up 7.44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the auto stock by the end of June hit 136,000 units,
a net increase of 26,000 units more than at the end of the first
quarter. Local analysts predicted the stock may go up in the
second six-month period.
</P>
<P>
According to local auto experts, the growth in both the
production and sales should be attributed to the booming market of
cars and mini-vehicles. Automakers in the period turned out
238,000 cars, or a rise of 22.99 percent, and sold 226,900, up
24.58 percent. The production of mini-buses topped 118,600,
increasing 34 percent; and the sales hit 108,100, a rise of 27.14
percent.
</P>
<P>
The FAW-Volkswagen Auto Corp. and Dongfeng Cietron Corp.,
China's two largest car ventures, grabbed more market shares in
the period. Their year-on-year growth registered 50 percent and
126 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The heavy-duty trucks and large buses also posted noteworthy
growth. Production and sales of heavy-duty trucks totaled 15,900
and 14,400 units, up 18.21 percent and 5.49 percent. Automakers
turned out 3,500 large buses and sold 2,900 units, up 54.84
percent and 59.34 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Production and sales of medium- and light-duty passenger
vehicles and trucks retained their downward trend in the period.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven major auto groups, both production and sales of
Shanghai Automotive Industry Group posted more than 20 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the performance of the others was just
"so-so."

<HEADLINE> Industry, Real Estate Magnets of Overseas Investment in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The industrial and real estate
sectors attracted 89 percent of overseas contractual investment in
this, China's largest economic metropolis, in the first six months
of this year, according to the latest statistics released by the
local government.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts consider that the investment trend is in line with
the target set for the city's future macro-economic mix. "Even though
more efforts have been paid to developing the tertiary sector,
industry at the current stage is still the cornerstone of the
local economy," a local economist said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors plan to take advantage of Shanghai's
existing infrastructure and skilled workers. More investment is
being poured into "economic pillars" such as telecommunications,
micro-electronics and domestic appliances. The number of projects
each with more than 10 million US dollars in investment reached 95
in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the largest-ever Sino-US project, the Shanghai GM
Corporation, a joint venture between the Shanghai Automotive
Industry Group and General Motors, is under construction at a cost
of 1.57 billion US dollars. Upon completion, the venture is to
produce 100,000 sedans annually.
</P>
<P>
As China has recently designated real estate as a new economic
sector for future development, more overseas capital is flowing
into Shanghai's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
In the Pudong New Area, overseas investors in the first six
months registered 317 projects with a total contractual investment
of 1.644 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first six months of this year, Shanghai approved
888 projects with contractual overseas investment totalling 2.27
billion US dollars. By the end of June Shanghai had approved an
aggregate of 16,583 overseas-funded projects.
