Philippine Airlines union, management reach breakthrough agreement

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines' management and
largest union reached a breakthrough agreement on a
management-proposed rehabilitation plan Monday, five days after the
airline's closure, a labor leader said.
	   The agreement could lead to the airline's reopening if it is
approved by union members, regulators and PAL's creditors,
officials said.
	   Alex Barrientos, president of the ground crew union, said
details of the agreement would not be released until it was
explained later Monday to the union's members.
	   Opposition within the union to the agreement is likely to be
high. More than a thousand workers protested at the union's office
Monday because of reports their leaders had accepted a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Barrientos called Monday's agreement PAL's ``last, last, last
possible hope'' and said workers would vote on it in a
union-conducted referendum.
	   ``If this fails, it's closed,'' he said of the airline.
	   President Joseph Estrada, meanwhile, flew to the central
Philippines aboard the first domestic flight by Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific Airways, which he enlisted to help fill the vacuum left by
PAL's closure last Wednesday.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, shut down after the ground crew
union earlier rejected the management plan, which would give
workers 20 percent of the company's stock in exchange for a 10-year
suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a 10-year suspension would violate workers' rights and
destroy the union. Workers voted in an earlier referendum last
Tuesday to reject it.
	   PAL, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion, has been badly hurt
by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It says creditors and
potential new investors have insisted on the suspension before they
will accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific agreed in talks at Estrada's
house Sunday to begin the Philippine domestic flights.
	   As a first step, two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be
leased to PNB Holdings, a unit of Philippine National Bank, which
is partially owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   ``We are doing it at cost,'' said Cathay Pacific chief executive
officer David Turnbull. ``This is being done at very short notice,
and it's a temporary arrangement.''
	   Turnbull said Cathay Pacific is also interested in buying a
stake in PAL if it is put up for sale.
	   ``We do have some interest in PAL in the long run,'' he said.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said up to six Cathay Pacific
planes may be leased with accompanying crews.
	   At least three smaller Philippine domestic carriers have also
said they plan to expand their operations in response to PAL's
closure, and air force planes are helping carry vital cargo,
including mail, medicine and newspapers, officials said.

Victoria state faces at least a week without gas as industry shuts
</HEADLINE>
down &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Updates in 2nd graf with gas shortage possibly lasting two
weeks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Australia's Victoria
state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
consumers are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last two weeks, state Premier Jeff Kennett said after meeting
with Esso officials.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement. There are about 100,000 businesses in
the state.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Kennett raised the possibility of a judicial inquiry into what
caused the explosion, and was waiting for a report from Esso due
Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

China warns businesses about circumventing exchange controls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a campaign to shore up the value of its
currency, China's government has warned businesses not to
circumvent foreign exchange controls, state media reported Monday.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a recent directive,
threatening businesses with loss of licenses and other unspecified
punishment if they exploited legal loopholes, forged documents or
turned to the black market to trade hard currency.
	   Government policies confining conversion of the Chinese yuan to
international trade have largely protected it from the batterings
many Asian currencies have taken over the past 15 months.
	   Despite the policies and repeated pledges by Chinese leaders not
to devalue the yuan, however, back-door pressures on the currency
are mounting.
	   The government's dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves
has stopped growing this year as exporters hold on to more of their
hard currency earnings instead of remitting them to Beijing.
	   A black market exchange rate for the dollar that is 10 percent
above official rates suggests many Chinese fell less confident
about the yuan and government policies.
	   Analysts estimate as much as dlrs 13 billion a year drifts in
and out of China through holes in its foreign exchange regime.
	   The State Council directive was the highest-level order to date
demanding an end to questionable and outright illegal foreign
currency deals. In an indication of its importance, reports on the
circular were carried on state-run television and the front-page of
national newspapers.
	   ``Some people forge documents to purchase foreign exchange; some
local authorities and companies issue debt or raise funds overseas
without approval,'' said an editorial in People's Daily, the ruling
Communist Party's flagship newspaper.
	   Such dealings ``are not conducive to the international balance
of payments, yuan stability and the healthy development of the
national economy,'' the newspaper said.
	   The State Council ordered the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange to better police banks and enterprises allowed to trade in
foreign currency.
	   The administration was told to punish businesses caught trading
without documents or with forged ones and revoke import-export
permits of firms with more than dlrs 1 million in illegal deals.
	   Reports on the directive also said a nationwide computer network
would be set up linking customs and foreign exchange regulators to
better track the trade.

Indonesian opposition leader pledges East Timor referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Indonesian political opposition leader
Amien Rais on Monday pledged to hold a referendum on
self-determination for East Timor if he became president next year.
	   Rais, who was in Sydney to give a public lecture on political
reform in Indonesia, told reporters a referendum was the only
solution for East Timor.
	   ``A referendum is the only solution to solve the problem,
however I believe a referendum must not be given as a quick fix,
because there are two conflicting groups in East Timor and we have
to ask them to sit down together and then to swear.
	   ``They have to really promise -- swear -- that whatever the
result of the referendum, they will respect it.
	   ``So after they have come to such consensus, then a referendum
can be given to the East Timorese people and it must be supervised
by United Nations bodies.''
	   Rais played a key role in bringing about the resignation of
President Suharto in May and is personally close to Suharto's
successor, B.J. Habibie.
	   Rais has declared himself as a candidate for the presidency in
1999.
	   The former leader of Indonesia's second largest Muslim
organization said he had resisted offers to join political parties
based on religion and started his own National Mandate Party
instead because he wanted a broader political base.
	   He dismissed continuing suspicions in the West that he advocated
an Islamic state, saying Indonesia's separation of church and state
was the best way to go.
	   ``I don't believe religion can be the basis of the state unless
99.9 percent of the people have the same belief,'' Rais said.
	   Indonesia's population is about 87 percent Muslim.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognized by
the United Nations.

 &UR; Padres 3, Diamondbacks 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Phoenix, Greg Vaughn became the fourth player to hit 50
homers this season and Trevor Hoffman got his major league-leading
53rd save.
	   Vaughn broke a 1-all tie in the eighth with a two-run shot off
Aaron Small (3-1). Before this year, there had never been more than
two 50-homer players in a single season.
	   Hoffman got three straight outs for his 53rd save in 54 chances,
tying the NL saves record set by current teammate Randy Myers, who
did it for the Cubs in 1993. Matt Clement (2-0) got the win in
relief.

Cambodian rivals to negotiate formation of new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS FONTAINE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A year after turning Phnom Penh into
a war zone, Cambodia's two largest political parties head to the
negotiating table this week in an attempt to diffuse post-election
tensions and form a new government.
	   An uneasy coalition between strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party and Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party in
1993 erupted in violence four years later, and it seems unlikely
that the two leaders will be able to form a stable marriage.
	   Senior officials from the two parties will nonetheless try to
hammer out a comprehensive deal in ``working group'' sessions
beginning Tuesday.
	   Hun Sen is clearly operating from a position of strength.
	   His ruling party won a slight majority in the July 26 elections
_ the opposition says through fraud and intimidation _ and his
party retains iron-fisted control of the police, military and
local-level government.
	   In the days after the preliminary poll results came in, Hun Sen
demanded he be named premier and his party be given the presidency
of parliament and five key ministries _ defense, interior, foreign
affairs, justice and finance.
	   But FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _ winners of a combined
58 out of 122 seats _ can deny Hun Sen the two-thirds vote needed
in parliament to approve the new government.
	   After launching anti-government demonstrations last month
calling for Hun Sen's ouster and threatening to boycott the Sept.
24 opening of Parliament, they have successfully forced Hun Sen to
soften his stance.
	   CPP spokesman Khieu Kanharith said that although Hun Sen refuses
to budge on his candidacy for the premiership and that of party
president Chea Sim as chairman of the National Assembly, the demand
for the five ministries has been withdrawn.
	   ``Everything else is negotiable. We need this as a precondition
to show we are serious,'' Khieu Kanharith said.
	   Second-term lawmaker Ahmad Yahya, a FUNCINPEC steering committee
member, said that despite the concession, the opposition would
still argue that it should be given the presidency because Hun
Sen's party got it after losing the 1993 election.
	   The issue over the presidency could stall the working group
until after the National Assembly reconvenes Wednesday because
FUNCINPEC has decided that the leadership of parliament should be
determined before moving on to government positions, Ahmad Yahya
said.
	   ``What we decided is that our policy is to go step by step,'' he
said. ``Without consensus and agreement in the National Assembly,
we will not form the government.''
	   Hun Sen needs FUNCINPEC to gain the two-thirds vote needed to
determine the National Assembly leadership and approve the new
government, but the junior opposition party led by Sam Rainsy,
winners of only 15 seats, could get shut out of the deal.
	   Hun Sen has repeatedly said that his party prefers a two-party
coalition with FUNCINPEC, and Khieu Kanharith said Monday that it
is uncertain whether Sam Rainsy will even be invited to the working
group sessions.
	   The pressure is on both opposition parties to form the
government sooner rather than later following two alleged attempts
on Hun Sen's life after the election.
	   The Cambodian leader _ who has claimed several plots on his life
in recent years _ has blamed the opposition for the attacks and
threatened its leadership with arrest.
	   A foreign travel ban was placed on all opposition lawmakers, but
the restriction was lifted after the opposition attended the
opening session of parliament last week.
	   Both Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy tested their freedom of movement
with a Friday trip to Bangkok.

Jobless, cash-strapped Thai man turns car thief for food
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A jobless man who drove a car through a
showroom window and hoped to sell it for food has been arrested for
theft, police said Monday.
	   Police said Yodrak Namthao, 23, broke into a used car showroom
in downtown Bangkok Sunday morning and crashed a Saab 9000 through
a front glass panel, but was stopped by police on his way out of
town.
	   The man told police that he was not a natural-born thief, but
needed money for food while he has been looking for a job. He said
he had been out of work for three months.
	   Police report that robbery and petty crimes have risen in the
wake of an economic crisis which has left more than one million
without jobs.
	   The Labor Office anticipates the number of unemployed may reach
two million by the end of this year.

Victoria state faces up to two weeks without gas as industry shuts
</HEADLINE>
down
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with gas shortage possibly lasting two
weeks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Australia's Victoria
state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
consumers are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last two weeks, state Premier Jeff Kennett said after meeting
with Esso officials.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement. There are about 100,000 businesses in
the state.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Kennett raised the possibility of a judicial inquiry into what
caused the explosion, and was waiting for a report from Esso due
Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

Report: Taiwan balanced budget last year, but red ink ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan recorded a budget surplus last year
for the first time since 1990, but rising spending points to a wave
of red ink in the future, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Officials compiling a report due for release next month say
income exceeded expenditures by about 60 billion Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.74 billion) in fiscal 1998, the United Daily News
reported.
	   But this year's budget and those following will likely slide
into deficit again with the government upping spending on
infrastructure to help pull the economy through the Asian financial
crisis, the paper quoted the unidentified officials as saying.
	   Increased tax revenues were the main reason for the fiscal 1998
surplus, especially stock transaction taxes collected as the market
climbed to new peaks last year, the paper said.
	   Stronger than expected performances by state owned industries
and a slight decline in government spending also helped, it said.
	   Increased spending on everything from military hardware to
social welfare has saddled the government with over 1 trillion
Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 30 billion) in debt accumulated over the
last eight years.
	   The government has committed itself to a balanced budget by
2001, but increased spending and assumption of local government
debts will render that goal difficult to reach, the paper said.
	   The relatively low level of public debt and strong foreign
currency reserves of over U.S. dlrs 82 billion have kept the
economy on an even keel as neighboring countries find themselves
devastated by the Asian economic crisis.

Green Bay Packers beat Carolina 37-30
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Overcoming a first half in
which his two interceptions helped Carolina take a 10-point lead,
Brett Favre threw for 388 yards and five touchdowns to rally the
Green Bay Packers to a 37-30 victory Sunday.
	   Green Bay limited Carolina to 13 first downs, including just
five in the first 52 minutes, helping the Packers to their first
4-0 start since 1966, the year they won the inaugural Super Bowl.
	   Favre, throwing for five scores for the third time in his
career, completed 27 of 45 passes. He linked up with Derrick Mayes
on three of the TD passes.
	   The Panthers (0-3) lost their fifth in a row at home.
 &UR; Saints 19, Colts 13, OT
	   In Indianapolis, the boys from New Orleans came through, and
we're not talking about Peyton Manning and Marshall Faulk.
	   Danny Wuerffel passed for touchdowns of 15 yards to Andre
Hastings with 41 seconds left in regulation and 33 yards to Cameron
Cleeland at 8:50 of overtime.
	   Manning and Faulk, both natives of New Orleans, appeared to have
the game won for the Colts (0-4) with a 78-yard touchdown
connection in the fourth quarter. But the Saints (3-0) got the ball
back with 2:49 to go, converted a fourth-and-17 with a 44-yard
completion to former Colt Sean Dawkins, and tied the game with the
TD pass to Hastings.
 &UR; Broncos 38, Redskins 16
	   In Landover, For the first time in nine years, the Broncos won a
game without John Elway. Bubby Brister did the honors, even running
the bootleg right _ the play on which Elway injured his hamstring
each of the last two weeks _ to perfection for a touchdown pass.
That started the unbeaten Super Bowl champions on their way to a
4-0 mark.
	   The Broncos have won nine straight and broke an 0-7 streak
without Elway, who decided to rest his leg and did not suit up. The
last time the Broncos won without him was in 1989 at Washington
behind Gary Kubiak, now Denver's offensive coordinator.
	   The Redskins (0-4) have been outscored 83-26 at home.
 &UR; Raiders 13, Cowboys 12
	   In Irving, Texas, a lucky bounce on a 75-yard touchdown pass and
two field goals by Greg Davis gave Oakland all the scoring it
needed. Cornerback Charles Woodson also intercepted a pass by Jason
Garrett in the end zone to stop another Dallas drive.
	   On third-and-12 with time running down in the first half, Jeff
George heaved a long pass downfield in the direction of James Jett.
The ball hit cornerback Kevin Smith in the left shoulder pad and
bounced into the arms of Jett, who ran 30 yards untouched to
complete the 75-yard touchdown play, longest of the season for
Oakland (2-2).
	   Dallas (2-2) closed in when Garrett beat a blitz to hit Billy
Davis with a 55-yard pass and Emmitt Smith scored on the next play
from the 1.
 &UR; Jaguars 27, Oilers 22
	   In Nashville, Mike Hollis kicked two field goals in the fourth
quarter and rookie Fred Taylor rushed for 116 yards as the Jaguars
came from behind for the best start in the team's short history.
	   On a day when Mark Brunell struggled and the Jaguars (4-0)
turned the ball over three times, the defense led the way with four
sacks and two interceptions against the Oilers (1-3). Eddie George
was held to 25 yards on 14 carries.
 &UR; Chiefs 24, Eagles 21
	   In Philadelphia, Philadelphia native Rich Gannon's 57-yard
completion to Joe Horn in the fourth quarter set up Donnell
Bennett's third touchdown run.
	   In the Chiefs' first visit to Philly, Gannon was 17-for-25 for
262 yards as Kansas City (4-0) won its ninth straight against NFC
opponents.
	   The Eagles (0-4) are off to their worst start in 26 years. They
made it close when Rodney Peete passed to Duce Staley for a 17-yard
TD with 61 seconds left. Staley had all three touchdowns for
Philadelphia.
 &UR; Cardinals 20, Rams 17
	   In St. Louis, Arizona scored 14 points in a 50-second span of
the second quarter and won its St. Louis homecoming.
	   Joe Nedney's 29-yard field goal with 4:04 to play gave Arizona
(2-2) its second straight win. The score was set up by a 43-yard
pass interference penalty on Dexter McCleon.
	   The game was the Cardinals' first regular-season contest in St.
Louis since owner Bill Bidwill took the team to Arizona from St.
Louis following the 1987 season.
	   The Rams (1-3) lost their eighth straight home game, wasting a
strong showing by rooking running back Robert Holcombe, who rushed
for 84 yards and scored twice.
 &UR; Steelers 13, Seahawks 10
	   In Pittsburgh, Jerome Bettis got the Steelers (3-1) back to what
they do best by running for 138 yards. Bettis went over 100 yards
for the 33rd time in his six-year career and the 23rd time with
Pittsburgh by early in the third quarter.
	   Seattle (3-1), one of the NFL's surprise teams so far, couldn't
overcome Bettis' big day, four turnovers or a suddenly ineffective
running game as it was denied the first 4-0 start in franchise
history. The Seahawks, with the AFC's leading rushing offense
(158.3 yards per game), were held to 61 yards.
 &UR; Vikings 31, Bears 28
	   In Chicago, Randall Cunningham connected on four TD passes to
four receivers _ Robert Smith, Cris Carter, Andrew Glover and Randy
Moss _ and cornerback Corey Fuller had a key interception.
	   Fuller intercepted what would have been a touchdown, and Moss
and Carter had TD receptions in a second half comeback for the
Vikings (4-0). Smith, a running back also had a 67-yard catch for a
score.
	   Moss and Carter have four TD receptions each this year.
	   Cunningham finished 16-of-25 for 275 yards. Erik Kramer was
25-of-29 for 372 yards and four scores for Chicago (0-4), which has
led at halftime in all its games.
 &UR; 49ers 31, Falcons 20
	   In San Francisco, it doesn't get any simpler than Steve Young to
Jerry Rice and it doesn't get any more breathtaking.
	   The dynamic quarterback-receiver tandem led another offensive
show by the 49ers. Young ended the first offensive series with his
200th career touchdown pass, a 66-yarder to Rice. They teamed again
just before halftime on a 26-yard pass as the 49ers (3-0) bolted to
a 31-7 lead over Atlanta (2-1) and then coasted through a rainy
second-half.
	   It was the Falcons' seventh straight loss at San Francisco,
during which they have been outscored 288-115.
 &UR; Giants 34, Chargers 16
	   In San Diego, one week after a disastrous performance in the
Kansas City rain, Ryan Leaf flopped again under the San Diego sun.
	   The rookie threw four interceptions in less than three quarters.
He was benched following the final one, which was returned 20 yards
by Percy Ellsworth for a touchdown.
	   The Giants (2-2), coming off a 31-7 loss to Dallas on Monday
night, had to travel cross-country on a short week. They played
like the opportunistic Giants of 1997 in winning on the West Coast
for the first time since beating San Francisco in the NFC
championship game on Jan. 20, 1991.
 &UR; Ravens 31, Bengals 24
	   In Baltimore, Priest Holmes, making his first NFL start, ran for
173 yards and two touchdowns and Jermaine Lewis also scored twice.
	   The Ravens (2-2) scored on their first three possessions to go
up 21-0, then held on after Cincinnati (1-3) twice cut the gap to
four points. Holmes scored on runs of 3 and 15 yards, and Lewis
caught a 73-yard pass from Eric Zeier and returned a punt 87 yards.
	   Baltimore secured the victory with an 11-play drive after the
Bengals used a 67-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Blake to Carl
Pickens to make it 28-24.

Vaughn hits 50th home run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ San Diego's Greg Vaughn hit his 50th home run in
his final game of the season Sunday night, making 1998 the first
year four players reached the mark in a single season.
	   Vaughn sent a 1-2 pitch from reliever Aaron Small into the
Arizona bullpen down the left-field line in the eighth inning.
	   He joined Mark McGwire (70), Sammy Sosa (66) and Ken Griffey Jr.
(56) in the 50-homer club. The two-run homer, which gave San Diego
a 3-1 lead, also gave Vaughn a career-best 119 RBIs.
	   Vaughn is the 10th NL player and 27th major leaguer to hit 50
home runs in a season.
	   Up until two years ago, there had been just three seasons when a
pair of players reached 50. In 1938, Hank Greenberg hit 58 and
Jimmie Foxx had 50; in 1947, Ralph Kiner and Johnny Mize each hit
51; and in 1961 Roger Maris hit 61 and Mickey Mantle hit 54.
	   In 1996, McGwire had 52 and Brady Anderson hit 50. Last year,
McGwire hit 58 more and Griffey hit 56.

Asian crisis forces BHP to close rolling mills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis has forced
steel and mineral giant BHP's Whyalla steelworks in South Australia
to close its rolling mills for almost three weeks starting Monday.
	   A spokesman for the company said about 375 of the works' 400
staff agreed to take either annual or long-service leave while
those remaining had been allocated other duties.
	   The plant would remain closed until Oct. 16.
	   The spokesman said the widely reported Asian problems had
weakened demand in a number of BHP's traditional steel markets.
	   But he said the company had been successful over the past 12
months in opening new markets in other parts of the world and
efforts in that direction would continue.
	   Another shutdown of the mills was planned at the end of the year
when routine maintenance would be conducted.
	   The spokesman said the company had no plans to reduce the shift
levels in the rolling mills and no plans to close the plant
permanently.

McGwire ends season with home run hits 69 and 70

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Even Mark McGwire couldn't believe he hit an
incredible 70 homers.
	   ``I've never even thought about it, dreamed about it,'' he said.
``It's absolutely amazing! It blows me away!''
	   The St. Louis Cardinals' slugger ended his assault on baseball's
sacred home run record as mightily as he started it. He hit his
69th and 70th homers Sunday in his last game, a fitting finale for
a year he began with a grand slam homer on opening day.
	   ``This is a season I will never, ever forget, and I hope
everybody in baseball never forgets,'' McGwire told the cheering
crowd after the game.
	   McGwire, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against Montreal Expos' rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning
Sunday. He homered off Carl Pavano for No. 70 in the seventh.
	   McGwire moved four ahead of the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa and
nine in front of the previous record set by Roger Maris in 1961.
The total distance of McGwire's homers is 29,598 feet, nearly 400
feet higher than the peak of Mount Everest.
	   President Clinton congratulated McGwire and invited the slugger
and his son to the White House.
	   McGwire lofted a 1-1 fastball 377 feet into the left-field seats
for No. 69. After stomping on home plate, he took a few slow steps,
then made several salutes to the sellout crowd.
	   Kerry Woodson, a 22-year-old body shop worker from Missouri,
wound up with the ball and said he didn't know what he would do
with it.
	   ``I reached up, closed my eyes, and it landed in my glove,''
Woodson said. ``It's a dream come true. I hope he doesn't hit any
more today.''
	   He didn't get his wish.
	   With two outs in the seventh and the score 3-3, McGwire lined a
first-pitch fastball 370 feet over the left-field wall.
	   This time, even a curtain call from McGwire didn't quiet the
46,110 fans, who remained on their feet, cheering even as teammate
Brian Jordan took a called third strike for the third out of the
inning. The Cardinals won the game 6-3.
	   The second home run ball landed in a party box and was snared by
Phil Ozerski of Olivette, Mo., who was attending the game with a
group of Washington University research lab scientists.
	   McGwire, who has 10 multihomer games this year and 53 in his
career, hit a go-ahead homer for the 24th time this season.
	   He opened the year with a slam on March 31 against the Dodgers'
Ramon Martinez, then led the home run race all season except when
Sosa twice passed him briefly _ and then for only 103 minutes
total.
	   The friendly competition between the two sluggers captivated
fans for weeks, peaking the night McGwire broke Roger Maris'
37-year-old record, with Sosa joining in the celebration.
	   Many believe their record-breaking feats _ and their
sportsmanship _ helped rejuvenate a game that lost its luster four
years ago when a strike wiped out the World Series.
	   San Diego's Greg Vaughn hit his 50th home run in his final game,
making 1998 the first year four players reached the mark in a
single season. He joined McGwire, Sosa and Seattle's Ken Griffey
Jr. (56) in the 50-homer club.
	   Until this year, there had been just five seasons when a pair of
players reached 50. McGwire figured into two of those: In 1996 when
he hit 52 and last year when he hit 58.
	   Although Sunday was the Cardinals' final game of the season, the
competition wasn't quite over.
	   Sosa, who did not homer Sunday, will get an extra game on Monday
when the Cubs face the San Francisco Giants at Chicago's Wrigley
Field in a one-game playoff for the wild-card spot _ a game in
which Sosa's stats will count.
	   ``I wish him the best of luck, along with the Giants,'' McGwire
said.

Connors edges McEnroe in fiery final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) _ Jimmy Connors beat John McEnroe 6-7 (2),
6-2, 11-9 in a tumultuous final at the PricewaterhouseCoopers
Champions senior tennis tournament Sunday.
	   It was Connors' fourth tournament title of the year and netted
him dlrs 40,000. McEnroe took home dlrs 25,000 and still has a
100-point lead on Connors in the Nuveen Masters Point Standings.
	   It was the 41st meeting between the Connors and McEnroe and
featured vintage play and behavior from both.
	   In between service winners, McEnroe sparred with chair umpire
Myron Krueger, glared at the linespeople and jawed back and forth
with the capacity crowd of 2,827. He served 14 aces, but overall
his serving percentage was a low 50 percent.
	   For his part, Connors glared at McEnroe, blasted service returns
and, at one point, walked off the court. When the match was over,
the two old foes left the court without shaking hands.

Victoria state faces at least a week without gas as industry shuts
</HEADLINE>
down
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in lead to 1.4 million households (not residents)
affected. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Australia's Victoria
state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
households are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last two weeks, state Premier Jeff Kennett said after meeting
with Esso officials.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement. There are about 100,000 businesses in
the state.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Kennett raised the possibility of a judicial inquiry into what
caused the explosion, and was waiting for a report from Esso due
Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Petr Klima, who started his career with Detroit
and was trying to make a comeback with the Red Wings, was cut
Sunday.
	   But the Red Wings offered him the chance to continue his tryout
with Adirondack of the American Hockey League. The Red Wings said
they did not know whether he would accept the offer.
	   Klima, 33, is a free agent and has not signed a contract with
Detroit.
	   Klima played for the Red Wings from 1985 until he was traded to
Edmonton early in the 1989-90 season, scoring 129 goals with 93
assists. He also played for Tampa Bay, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh,
totaling 312 goals and 260 assists in 12 NHL seasons.
	   In his last NHL season, 1996-97, he played with the Kings,
Penguins and Oilers and had two goals and 12 assists in 33 games.
He played last season in Germany, with seven goals and 12 assists
in 38 games.

Korean President predicts economic recovery next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's president predicted
Monday that his country's contracting economy will resume growth in
the latter part of next year.
	   In a news conference devoted solely to economic matters, Kim
Dae-jung said tax cuts and other pump-priming measures will help
resuscitate the domestic economy.
	   ``In a word, there will be no second financial crisis,'' Kim
said. ``If we continue reform measures as we do now, the economy
will pick up later next year.''
	   Citing shrinking domestic consumption and exports _ the engine
of the country's economy _ some analysts have warned that South
Korea may be headed for a new financial crisis.
	   But Kim said the government, backed by a record foreign currency
reserve of dlrs 44 billion, will easily be able to repay dlrs 9
billion in external debt coming due this year and dlrs 36 billion
due next year.
	   ``Despite many uneasy international factors as shown in Japan,
Russia, Southeast Asia and South America, the value of our currency
has been stable and I believe the trend will continue,'' Kim said.
	   The president said his prediction of an economic turnaround next
year depends on how fast and effectively the economy can be
restructured, especially the financial and industrial sectors.
	   ``I know there is criticism that our reforms in these areas are
not fast enough, but significant progress so far has been made and
the prospects are good,'' he said.
	   Kim said his government will finish restructuring the banking
sector by the end of this month and make more low-interest loans
available for cash-strapped businesses.
	   So far this year, the government has shut down five troubled
commercial banks and 16 finance companies and ordered seven major
commercial banks to improve their financial structure or face
closure or merger.
	   The unions of the seven banks, which have a combined 30,000
members, threaten to go on strike Tuesday to protest the government
order, which would involve manpower cuts.

Japan's Asahi, Tokai banks announce alliance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with confirmation of agreement, details of
pact &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Preparing for increased competition in Japan's
liberalizing financial sector, two midsize Japanese city banks
announced Monday that they will form a broad business alliance.
	   Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd. said in a statement that
they intend to cooperate in private banking, investment trusts and
the launch of financial products, such as derivatives.
	   The banks said they also hope to enter a cross-shareholding
agreement and eventually set up a joint holding company.
	   Asahi and Tokai said that the alliance would help them cope with
the stepped up competition expected to result from Japan's ``big
bang'' financial deregulation measures.
	   The two banks said they hope to cut costs by 50 billion yen
(dlrs 368 million) by consolidating redundant operations. The
tie-up is based on the condition that the banks will quickly write
off their non-performing assets.
	   The alliance announcement comes amid ongoing consolidation in
Japan's financial sector ahead of the introduction of the ``big
bang'' measures.
	   Earlier this month, four Mitsubishi group financial institutions
agreed to set up a securities company capitalized at about 200-300
billion yen (dlrs 1.46-2.19 billion).
	   In July, financial giants Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities Co.
agreed on a partnership in the investment banking business.
	   Tokyo-based Asahi Bank has 429 offices worldwide, employs 12,688
people and has total deposits of 20.4 trillion yen (dlrs 150
billion).
	   Tokai Bank, based in Nagoya, western Japan, has 303 offices
worldwide, employs 11,407 people and has total deposits of 19.9
trillion yen (dlrs 146 billion).
	   Reports of the partnership sent shares of the banks sharply
higher Monday morning on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Asahi shares
rose 1.6 percent to 391 yen (dlrs 2.86), while those of Tokai
gained 2.1 percent to 542 yen (dlrs 3.96).

Daylong gunbattle leaves eight soldiers injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Indian soldiers traded fire with Kashmiri
separatists hidden in a forest for 24 hours over the weekend in a
battle that left eight soldiers injured, four of them seriously.
	   Indian army sources speaking on condition of anonymity Monday
said no casualties were reported among the guerrillas, who held
strategic hilltop positions during the clash. The sources said more
troops were being brought in Monday to launch a new attack.
	   The battle began late Saturday after soldiers acting on a tip
cordoned off a Fatehpur Mountains forest district 200 kilometers
(125 miles) north of Jammu, the winter capital of Indian-held
Kashmir.
	   A heavy exchange of fire lasted until late Sunday, the sources
said.
	   Muslim militants have been fighting since 1989 in Kashmir, which
is the only Muslim-majority state in predominately Hindu India.
Some of the militants want independence, while others want to merge
with neighboring and officially Islamic Pakistan.

Opposition leader says Bali party congress will proceed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri said Monday a planned mass gathering of her political
faction will go ahead on the island of Bali next month, despite
fears that it could endanger the lucrative tourism industry.
	   Police have threatened to ban the gathering. However, organizers
said the meeting will go ahead with or without a permit from
authorities.
	   Thousands are expected to attend the congress of Megawati's
faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party, or PDI, at a beach
resort hotel between Oct. 8 and 10.
	   Many are coming from the neighboring main island of Java, which
was hit by deadly riots this year.
	   The government has called on her to move the location of the
congress amid fears that it might turn violent and scare away
foreign tourists.
	   Bali is a Hindu enclave in otherwise Muslim-dominated Indonesia,
now enduring its worst economic downturn in decades.
	   The so-called ``Island of the Gods'' is Indonesia's biggest
international tourist destination and a major source of badly
needed foreign exchange.
	   Until now, it's been untouched by the civil unrest that has
caused havoc in many other parts of Indonesia, climaxing with the
resignation in May of President Suharto after 1,200 people were
killed in rioting.
	   Megawati downplayed the prospect of trouble in Bali.
	   ``The congress must go ahead,'' Megawati told about 1,000
supporters at a policy seminar in Jakarta on Monday.
	   ``We are not wild and we are not rioters just because we support
the common people,'' she said.
	   Over the weekend, newspapers quoted Megawati as saying only
officials of the party would be invited to attend. She called on
other supporters to stay away.
	   Megawati is the eldest daughter of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding
president. With that pedigree she is regarded as a strong contender
for the presidency to be decided after parliamentary elections next
year.
	   Many of her supporters are workers and poor people hit hard by
soaring prices and mass unemployment.
	   One of the key objects of the planned congress is to try to grab
back control of the PDI, which has been wracked by political
squabbling and violence for years.
	   Megawati maintains she was deposed illegally as party chairwoman
in 1996, when dozens of her supporters were later killed or injured
in a clash with police and troops in the capital, Jakarta.
	   She has accused Suharto of being behind her ouster by a rival
party faction.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie still refuses to
recognize Megawati as the true PDI chief.

McGwire ends season with home run hits 69 and 70

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Even Mark McGwire couldn't believe he hit an
incredible 70 homers.
	   ``I've never even thought about it, dreamed about it,'' he said.
``It's absolutely amazing! It blows me away!''
	   The St. Louis Cardinals' slugger ended his assault on baseball's
sacred home run record as mightily as he started it. He hit his
69th and 70th homers Sunday in his last game, a fitting finale for
a year he began with a grand slam homer on opening day.
	   ``This is a season I will never, ever forget, and I hope
everybody in baseball never forgets,'' McGwire told the cheering
crowd after the game.
	   McGwire, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against Montreal Expos' rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning
Sunday. He homered off Carl Pavano for No. 70 in the seventh.
	   McGwire moved four ahead of the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa and
nine in front of the previous record set by Roger Maris in 1961.
The total distance of McGwire's homers is 29,598 feet (9,020
meters), nearly 500 feet (152 meters) higher than the peak of Mount
Everest.
	   President Clinton congratulated McGwire and invited the slugger
and his son to the White House.
	   McGwire lofted a 1-1 fastball 377 feet (114 meters) into the
left-field seats for No. 69. After stomping on home plate, he took
a few slow steps, then made several salutes to the sellout crowd.
	   Kerry Woodson, a 22-year-old body shop worker from Misouri,
wound up with the ball and said he didn't know what he would do
with it.
	   ``I reached up, closed my eyes, and it landed in my glove,''
Woodson said. ``It's a dream come true. I hope he doesn't hit any
more today.''
	   He didn't get his wish.
	   With two outs in the seventh and the score 3-3, McGwire lined a
first-pitch fastball 370 feet (112 meters) over the left-field
wall.
	   This time, even a curtain call from McGwire didn't quiet the
46,110 fans, who remained on their feet, cheering even as teammate
Brian Jordan took a called third strike for the third out of the
inning. The Cardinals won the game 6-3.
	   The second home run ball landed in a party box and was snared by
Phil Ozerski of Missouri who was attending the game with a group of
Washington University research lab scientists.
	   McGwire, who has 10 multihomer games this year and 53 in his
career, hit a go-ahead homer for the 24th time this season.
	   He opened the year with a slam on March 31 against the Dodgers'
Ramon Martinez, then led the home run race all season except when
Sosa twice passed him briefly _ and then for only 103 minutes
total.
	   The friendly competition between the two sluggers captivated
fans for weeks, peaking the night McGwire broke Roger Maris'
37-year-old record, with Sosa joining in the celebration.
	   Many believe their record-breaking feats _ and their
sportsmanship _ helped rejuvenate a game that lost its luster four
years ago when a strike wiped out the World Series.
	   San Diego's Greg Vaughn hit his 50th home run in his final game,
making 1998 the first year four players reached the mark in a
single season. He joined McGwire, Sosa and Seattle's Ken Griffey
Jr. (56) in the 50-homer club.
	   Until this year, there had been just five seasons when a pair of
players reached 50. McGwire figured into two of those: In 1996 when
he hit 52 and last year when he hit 58.
	   Although Sunday was the Cardinals' final game of the season, the
competition wasn't quite over.
	   Sosa, who did not homer Sunday, will get an extra game on Monday
when the Cubs face the San Francisco Giants at Chicago's Wrigley
Field in a one-game playoff for the wild-card spot _ a game in
which Sosa's stats will count.
	   ``I wish him the best of luck, along with the Giants,'' McGwire
said.

Indonesian opposition leader pledges East Timor referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Indonesian political opposition leader
Amien Rais on Monday pledged to hold a referendum on
self-determination for East Timor if he becomes president next
year.
	   Rais, who was in Sydney to give a public lecture on political
reform in Indonesia, told reporters a referendum was the only
solution for East Timor.
	   ``A referendum is the only solution to solve the problem,
however I believe a referendum must not be given as a quick fix,
because there are two conflicting groups in East Timor and we have
to ask them to sit down together ... They have to really promise _
swear _ that whatever the result of the referendum, they will
respect it,'' he said.
	   ``So after they have come to such consensus, then a referendum
can be given to the East Timorese people and it must be supervised
by United Nations bodies.''
	   Rais played a key role in bringing about the resignation of
President Suharto in May and is personally close to Suharto's
successor, B.J. Habibie.
	   Rais has declared himself as a candidate for the presidency in
1999.
	   The former leader of Indonesia's second largest Muslim
organization said he had resisted offers to join political parties
based on religion and started his own National Mandate Party
instead because he wanted a broader political base.
	   He dismissed continuing suspicions in the West that he advocated
an Islamic state, saying Indonesia's separation of church and state
was the best way to go.
	   ``I don't believe religion can be the basis of the state unless
99.9 percent of the people have the same belief,'' Rais said.
	   Indonesia's population is about 87 percent Muslim.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognized by
the United Nations.

Aborigines threaten to take genocide case to World Court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal elders who want to charge
Prime Minister John Howard with genocide said Monday they will take
their case to the World Court if necessary.
	   Their lawyer Len Lindon made the threat as he pressed their case
before Judge Ken Crispin of the Australian capital territory's
Supreme Court.
	   The International Court of Justice, as the World Court is
formally known, sits in The Hague and decides cases between nations
and involving treaties. States have to consent to its authority for
its ruling to be binding.
	   It is not clear how the Aboriginal elders would have the
authority to file a case with the International Court of Justice,
though they could contend that Australia is violating the U.N.
Convention against Genocide, which it has signed.
	   Lindon said genocide started with British colonization in 1788,
``It is continuing and will get worse.''
	   Aboriginal lawyer Michael Anderson, who also represented the
elders, said a British assumption that Aborigines had no culture of
their own had led to vicious policies of assimilation that had left
many Aboriginal communities ``spiritually sterile.''
	   ``People who are spiritually sterile depend on the grog
(alcohol) and other drugs to get them through the hardships of
life,'' he said.
	   Anderson said Australian law is still based on British
tradition.
	   Colonial authorities in Australia had ignored the instructions
of the British government, which had recognized that Aboriginal
life could be destroyed in Australia and wanted to prevent that
happening, he said.
	   But the colonial authorities had simply expected Aborigines to
die out.
	   That was made clear at a conference the Australian government
called in 1937 to deal with Aboriginal issues, when the
commissioner of native affairs in Western Australia, A.O. Neville,
said: ``We should forget that there were any Aborigines in this
country in 50 years' time.''
	   Anderson said successive Australian governments had not only
pursued policies of apartheid and genocide since colonization but
they had also kept their actions hidden from international
scrutiny.
	   The case is based specifically on Howard's successful move in
Parliament earlier this year to restrict Aboriginal land rights on
lands leased from the government.
	   Howard said then that this was necessary to give the country's
miners and ranchers the certainty of title to land they need to
conduct their businesses.
	   The case was adjourned for eight weeks, so that written
submissions on legal aspects can be made.
	   Howard was not represented in court.

 &UR; Third auction to be called for bankrupt Kia Motors

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After two previous attempts to sell
bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. failed, President Kim Dae-jung on Monday
ordered a new auction for the troubled South Korean auto firm.
	   ``A third auction will be called and various measures are being
considered to prevent it from being aborted,'' Kim said at a news
conference outlining his government's economic policies.
	   The first attempt to auction off the country's second-largest
automaker and its commercial vehicle arm, Asia Motors Co., was
scuttled by creditors Sept. 1 when bidders demanded bigger debt
write-offs.
	   The creditor banks said then that they would write off dlrs 2.1
billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt and put the company back on
the auction block.
	   But that effort failed to impress the three South Korean
automakers who submitted new bids for Kia last week. Ford Motor Co.
of the United States withdrew from the second round of bidding.
	   Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. all
said Kia's debt load was still too heavy, Kia officials said.
	   The president did not say what new conditions would be for the
third auction but local media quoted government officials they did
not identify as saying the amount of debts to be written off may be
increased to dlrs 3.2 billion.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund. Kia's collapse last year
helped erode investor confidence in South Korea's industries,
leading to a flight of capital.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses, annually. The two
companies employ more than 18,000 workers.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary
measurement of 3.8 rattled Melbourne on Monday, but was unlikely to
have caused major damage, the Seismology Research Center said.
	   Seismologist Cameron Bricker said the tremor, which occurred at
8:32 a.m. (2232 GMT Sunday), was centered near Portsea on Port
Phillip Bay, about 30 miles (50 km) south of Melbourne.
	   It was believed to have had a depth of about 6 miles (10 km).
	   ``We've had reports from right across the central business
district from people who felt the quake,'' he said.
	   Bricker said the tremor was not likely to cause major damage.
	   ``The most you would expect is that pictures would be moving on
walls, and other small objects might move around,'' he said.
	   The scale of the quake was not unusual for south-eastern
Australia, he said.
	   ``It was a little larger than we've had in the past couple of
years, but this is not unusual for southeastern Australia,'' he
said.

Victoria state faces up to two weeks without gas as industry shuts
</HEADLINE>
down
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in lead to 1.4 million households affected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Australia's Victoria
state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
households are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last two weeks, state Premier Jeff Kennett said after meeting
with Esso officials.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement. There are about 100,000 businesses in
the state.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Kennett raised the possibility of a judicial inquiry into what
caused the explosion, and was waiting for a report from Esso due
Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

Chinese police detain dissident over opposition party tactics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police will keep a democracy campaigner
in custody for 13 days for trying to form an opposition political
party, a dissident monitoring group reported Monday.
	   In a detention notice sent to his family, police charged Liu
Lianjun with ``disturbing social order'' by filing an application
to register the would-be China Democracy Party, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said.
	   The notice, sent Friday, accused Liu of distorting remarks by
civil affairs officials in eastern Shandong province who examined
the application, the group said.
	   News from Liu and fellow campaigner Xie Wanjun that their
application was not rejected outright encouraged dissidents that
the Communist Party might be ready to end a virtual 49-year ban on
opposition politics.
	   Within days, dissidents in at least eight provinces and cities
applied or prepared applications to set up China Democracy Party
branches.
	   A crackdown started two weeks ago has signaled the party's
determination to hold on to its political monopoly. Police have
detained at least a dozen democracy campaigners, often for short
periods of time. Most have connections to the China Democracy
Party.
	   Police detained Xie Sept. 21 and two days later took Liu Lianjun
away. Xie's family was notified Thursday Xie would be detained for
15 days, also for disturbing social order, the Information Center
previously reported.
	   Police in southeastern Fujian province since Thursday have also
hauled in for questioning four dissidents about plans to set up a
China Democracy Party branch, the Information Center said.
	   Police are required by law to file detention notices if they
plan to hold a suspect without charge.
	   Although such detentions are supposed to be limited to 30 days,
loopholes and other regulations allow for lengthy stays in custody
without any public filings.
	   Police also have the authority to send suspects to labor camps
for up to three years without trial.

Detectives turn attention to missing Japanese tourist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Police investigating the death of
an unknown Asian woman said Monday that they were now seeking
information on a Japanese tourist missing for 2 1/2 weeks.
	   Kayo Matsuzawa, 29, had not been seen since she checked into a
backpackers' hostel in downtown Auckland, Det. Senior Sgt. Kevin
Baker said.
	   He said dental records were being sought from Japan to establish
whether she was the woman found dead in a stairwell electrical room
in a central Auckland building last week.
	   Matsuzawa arrived in New Zealand at the end of last year and
police understand she originally stayed with another Japanese woman
in Christchurch.
	   On Sept. 11, she traveled by herself to Auckland to spend two
weeks sightseeing before a planned return to Christchurch.
	   Baker said she checked into the hostel that afternoon, paying a
deposit on her room, where she put her belongings before going out.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For someone who clung to her
husband before armed riot police wearing masks tore him away from
her, Azizah Ismail looks very composed. And determined.
	   If anything, adversity is exposing the steel concealed in the
fragile frame of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim's wife,
who exhibits the image of a pious Malay Muslim housewife with her
head draped in a white scarf.
	   ``I have to speak. They think the movement is dead,'' the
46-year-old eye surgeon said in an interview Monday, given despite
stern warnings from police that she could be arrested like her
husband was on Sept. 20.
	   ``I ask for my right as a Malaysian citizen to speak for my
husband who has no voice ... to clear the family's honor,'' she
told The Associated Press and AP Television News.
	   Anwar, 51, has disappeared. Police have ignored Azizah's pleas
for a glimpse of her husband, who is fast becoming the symbol of
reform in this Southeast Asian nation ruled by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad for 17 years.
	   She says she fears for her husband's life because ``he knows a
lot of government secrets.''
	   ``I have not heard from him. I am worried. There are so many
rumors. I do not want to believe them.''
	   Anwar was arrested hours after he organized a mammoth public
rally, the largest in Kuala Lumpur in a decade. He has been
detained under the Internal Security Act, a law that allows for
detention without trial.
	   Promises by police and Mahathir himself of a speedy trial on
charges ranging from illegal homosexual acts to treason have yet to
be met.
	   ``I would like him to be charged in an open and fair court. So
we know what the charges against him are,'' Azizah said.
	   Azizah described the charges of homosexuality as ``absurd.''
	   She said she had been married for 18 years and Anwar ``is very
normal to me. Kind, loving.''
	   He has also been a ``A very caring father and very responsible''
to the couple's six children, aged between 19 and six. ``He is a
very family man.''
	   One of the daughters, Nurul Nuha, 14, wanted the media to carry
a message to her father. ``Papa, we know you are innocent. We are
behind you ... We really love you,'' she said before a television
camera.
	   Azizah said the family wasn't prepared for this fate and neither
she nor Anwar expected Mahathir to be so harsh.
	   ``I believed in him. He was my leader. I thought of him as my
father,'' she said, refusing to criticize the 72-year-old leader
who has publicly described her husband as a ``sodomist'' unfit for
politics.
	   ``I thought the vision of Dr. Mahathir worked well with Anwar's
fight for the poor.''
	   She said that all that Anwar was trying to do was bring change
from within the system. ``My husband was just trying to protect the
rights of the people who don't have a big say in the working of the
government.''
	   Azizah has been thrust into the forefront of the movement that
has convulsed Malaysian politics with regular street protests and
huge rallies reverberating with cries for Mahathir's resignation.
	   And she says she is ready to fill the role of a leader.
	   ``When he is not here, I have to continue.''

Ruling Party, opposition reach agreement on bank bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party and opposition reached what
appeared to be a final agreement Monday on banking bills to clean
up the financial system, clearing the way for their passage in
Parliament.
	   The governing Liberal Democratic Party and main opposition
Democratic Party compromised on how much power to give a new
independent body that will be charged with regulating the finance
sector.
	   The opposition had been demanding that the body be given full
authority to chart the course of the financial sector, but the LDP
opposed that, saying it would take too much power away from the
finance ministry.
	   Early Monday, after a weekend of intense negotiation, the two
sides agreed that regulation of the finance sector would be shared
by the independent body and the finance ministry.
	   The two sides also agreed that any bank purchasing an ailing
bank that has been put under state control will be eligible for an
injection of public funds.
	   ``Compromises have been reached concerning all points of
contention,'' Yuji Tsushima, an LDP legislator, was quoted as
saying by Kyodo News.
	   The breakthrough raised hopes that the bank bills, aimed at
cleaning up about dlrs 1 trillion of bad debt in the financial
system, would be approved during the current session of Parliament
early next month.
	   Opposition and ruling parties said, however, that the session
might have to be extended by a week after its scheduled end on Oct.
7.
	   On Saturday, the two sides reached a compromise on one of their
main points of contention _ the fate of ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   The ruling party acquiesced to opposition demands that the
government acquire all of LTCB's shares, effectively nationalizing
it. The government would then sell the bank back to the private
sector after disposing of its bad assets.
	   The government has been trying to broker a merger deal between
LTCB and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. Under this weekend's
agreement, Sumitomo would be able buy LTCB shares from the
government, and turn the bank into a subsidiary.
	   Last week, the LDP and opposition hammered out a basic accord on
the banking bills which incorporated the key parts of the
opposition's rival version of the legislation. But vague wording in
the agreement caused the dispute over the bills to flare anew.

Tokyo stocks, dollar, higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks ended higher Monday, shrugging off
the failure of an affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 185.53
points, or 1.35 percent, to 13,909.37. On Friday, the Nikkei shed
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent.
	   Traders said stocks were buoyed by an advance on the futures
market and buying by public funds.
	   ``Ahead of the September book-closing, public funds may be
buying on the futures market,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager
of the stock division at Ryoko Securities.
	   Also supporting the market was news that Japan's ruling and main
opposition parties had reached an agreement on key banking reform
measures over the weekend, paving the way for passage of
legislation in Parliament by early next month, traders said.
	   Shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan dived to an
all-time low of 13 yen (9.5 cents) per share, before closing at 15
yen (11 cents), down from Friday's finish of 24 yen (18 cents). The
bank's previous record low of 18 yen (13 cents) was recorded on
Sept. 18.
	   The plunge came after a non-bank affiliate of LTCB, Japan
Leasing Corp., applied late Sunday for court protection in Japan's
largest ever corporate bankruptcy.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have debts exceeding 2.44 trillion
yen (dlrs 18.24 billion), making it Japan's biggest corporate
bankruptcy.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's largest banks, has been unable to shake off
speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed real estate
loans.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 13.59 yen, or 1.29 percent, to 1,063.52. On
Friday, the TOPIX closed down 28.08, or 2.6 percent.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar remained higher against the
yen at mid-afternoon Monday from late Friday in Tokyo. But
unexpected gains in Tokyo stocks caused the U.S. currency to tumble
from its levels earlier in the session.
	   The dollar bought 135.71 yen at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT), up 1.07 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo, but below its late New York level of
136.25 yen Friday.
	   The dollar had surged 2.10 yen to 136.74 yen in early trading.
	   Traders attributed the dollar's slide to the rise on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange despite the failure of Japan Leasing. Many players
rushed to cover short, or oversold, yen positions following the
surprise rally in the stock market, they said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond slipped to 0.800 percent from Friday's finish of
0.815 percent, driving its price up to 109.01 yen from 108.87 yen.

Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest corporate bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMS. RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes,
background &QL; 
 &UR; TOK101-102 &QC; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leasing company saddled with over 2 trillion yen
(dlrs 16 billion) in debt announced Monday it has filed for
protection in Japan's biggest bankruptcy ever.
	   Instead of starting a market meltdown, however, stocks rose and
analysts said the megafailure might actually be good for Japan's
ailing banking sector.
	   Japan Leasing Corp., an affiliate of the ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, filed for protection from creditors late Sunday,
said Hiroaki Okamoto, the company's president.
	   Okamoto said he did not know how much of the company's 2.18
trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion) in debts it would be able to pay
back.
	   ``Our efforts to restructure the company proved to be
impossible,'' Okamoto said. ``I deeply apologize to our creditors
and for the effects this will have on the financial system.''
	   The failure was the latest in a series of bankruptcies as Japan
struggles through its deepest recession in decades.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm
generally regarded as authoritative on bankruptcies, said it would
be the biggest ever in Japan.
	   But instead of inspiring more gloom, the company's collapse was
seen by many as elminating a potential sticking point in government
efforts to pass a series of banking bills to clean up the country's
bad-loan mess.
	   ``This is a step forward, and is very positive in regard to
passing the bank bills,'' said Koyo Ozeki, a bank analyst at
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
	   Japan Leasing owed 250 billion yen (dlrs 1.8 billion) to LTCB,
which is at the center of the banking reform debate, and what to do
with that debt had been a contentious issue.
	   The ruling party had supported an LTCB plan to simply forgive
its loans to Japan Leasing. Opposition parties said they wouldn't
support using taxpayer's money to bail out LTCB if it let its
creditors off the hook so easily.
	   Ruling and opposition parties reached an agreement over the
weekend on key financial reform bills, including a plan to
temporarily nationalize LTCB.
	   That would make it impossible for LTCB to write off debts owed
by affiliates, including Japan Leasing, which thus had no choice
but to file for bankruptcy.
	   Japan Leasing, which leased a variety of equipment, including
airplanes and computers, will be taken over by court-appointed
managers within the next few days, a company lawyer said.
	   Its board of directors will resign.
	   Hoping to keep the failure from setting off a market meltdown,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi urged traders to be calm as financial
markets opened Monday.
	   His call was hardly needed.
	   Tokyo's stock market started higher and continued climbing
throughout the day. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose
185.53 points to close at 13,903.37 points, up 1.35 percent.
	   Analysts noted, however, that while the fall of Japan Leasing
wasn't necessarily bad for the larger financial picture, it will
likely affect reconstruction plans for two other LTCB affiliates _
Japan Landic Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   And LTCB's share price opened sharply lower Monday, briefly
hitting an all-time low of 13 yen (9.5 cents) a share before
rebounding slightly to 14 yen (10 cents). LTCB closed at 24 yen (18
cents) a share on Friday.
	   The worst previous bankruptcy was of Crown Leasing, a lender
with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs 8.86 billion) that went under
in April 1997, according to the Teikoku Data Bank.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co.
	   Yamaichi announced last in November it was throwing in the
towel, leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38
billion) and 8,000 people without work.
	   Japan Leasing was established in 1963 as Japan's first leasing
firm.

Japan's home run king ``astonished'' by McGwire's 70th homer

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire
whacked his 70th home run of the season this weekend, even Japan's
all-time home run king was overawed.
	   ``There's no other way to say it but that it's astonishing that
he hit the 70th homer with the world's attention focused on him,''
Sadaharu Oh told Kyodo News.
	   ``The world takes its hat off in respect,'' Oh was quoted as
saying.
	   Oh hit 868 home runs over his 22-year career _ 113 more than
Hank Aaron, America's all-time home run leader. Oh also holds
Japan's single season home run record, with 55 roundtrippers in the
140-game 1964 season.
	   Oh is now manager of the Pacific League's Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   McGwire blasted his 70th homer against Montreal Expos pitcher
Mike Thurman at Busch Stadium in St. Louis on Sunday.

Three hurricanes, one extra-tropical system still swirling
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By RACHEL LA CORTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Traffic is finally starting to slow after a busy
few days in the hurricane-crowded Atlantic Ocean.
	   This past week, for the first time since 1893, the Atlantic
played host to four hurricanes at once _ Georges, Jeanne, Ivan and
Karl.
	   Georges has been the most dangerous hurricane of the year,
killing at least 300 in the Caribbean before crashing over Key West
and heading into the Gulf of Mexico toward New Orleans and
surrounding areas late Sunday.
	   But the others have begun to weaken and stall out.
	   Late Sunday, Jeanne had top sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph)
and was centered about 1,090 miles (1,745 kilometers) southwest of
the mid-Atlantic Azores Islands. Jeanne was moving north-northwest
at near 18 mph (29 kph), with tropical storm force winds spread out
up to 115 miles (184 kph).
	   ``She's holding her own,'' said meteorologist Michelle Huber.
``She could threaten the Azores in a day or two.''
	   By Saturday, Ivan had weakened to tropical storm strength once
its top sustained winds dropped below 74 mph (118 kph), the speed
that classifies it as a hurricane. By Sunday, the system located
over the east-central Atlantic was no longer even a tropical storm.
	   Late Sunday, Karl also was downgraded to an extra-tropical storm
after seeing its top winds drop to about 70 mph (112 kph). It was
about 310 miles (500 kilometers) west of the Azores and racing
northeast at near 41 mph (66 kph).
	   Even with the decrease of active hurricanes in the Atlantic, the
immediate focus remained on Georges, a deadly hurricane still
producing top sustained winds of 110 mph (176 kph) late Sunday as
it approached the north Gulf coast.
	   And, with more than two months left in the hurricane season,
there's still time for more hurricanes to form.
	   ``Hopefully, it's going to quiet down for a little bit,'' Huber
said. ``But, I'm not writing off the hurricane season by any
means.''

St. Petersburg official killed in explosion

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A high-ranking official
responsible for providing municipal services in St. Petersburg was
killed early Monday in a bombing.
	   Yevgeny Ogaryov, the deputy chairman of the northern city's
committee on consumers, was killed when he opened the door of his
sixth-floor apartment, Russian news agencies reported. Police
believe he was killed by a radio-controlled bomb in a contract
murder.
	   Dozens of St. Petersburg business men and government officials
have been killed in recent years, many of them in apparent disputes
over state property. The killings are blamed on organized crime and
are rarely solved.

Aborigines threaten to take genocide case to World Court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Aboriginal elders who want to charge
Prime Minister John Howard with genocide said Monday they will take
their case to the World Court if necessary.
	   Their lawyer Len Lindon made the threat as he pressed their case
before Judge Ken Crispin of the Australian capital territory's
Supreme Court.
	   The International Court of Justice, as the World Court is
formally known, sits in The Hague and decides cases between nations
and involving treaties. States have to consent to its authority for
its ruling to be binding.
	   It is not clear how the Aboriginal elders would have the
authority to file a case with the International Court of Justice,
though they could contend that Australia is violating the U.N.
Convention against Genocide, which it has signed.
	   Lindon said genocide started with British colonization in 1788.
``It is continuing and will get worse,'' he said.
	   Aboriginal lawyer Michael Anderson, who also represented the
elders, said a British assumption that Aborigines had no culture of
their own had led to vicious policies of assimilation that had left
many Aboriginal communities ``spiritually sterile.''
	   ``People who are spiritually sterile depend on the grog
(alcohol) and other drugs to get them through the hardships of
life,'' he said.
	   Anderson said Australian law is still based on British
tradition.
	   Colonial authorities in Australia had ignored the instructions
of the British government, which had recognized that Aboriginal
life could be destroyed in Australia and wanted to prevent that
from happening, he said.
	   But the colonial authorities had simply expected Aborigines to
die out.
	   That was made clear at a conference the Australian government
called in 1937 to deal with Aboriginal issues, when the
commissioner of native affairs in Western Australia, A.O. Neville,
said: ``We should forget that there were any Aborigines in this
country in 50 years' time.''
	   Anderson said successive Australian governments had not only
pursued policies of apartheid and genocide since colonization but
they had also kept their actions hidden from international
scrutiny.
	   The case is based specifically on Howard's successful move in
Parliament earlier this year to restrict Aboriginal land rights on
lands leased from the government.
	   Howard said then that this was necessary to give the country's

Ban continues on song satirizing Hanson using her own voice
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An appeal court Monday backed a radio
ban on a song which lampoons right-wing Australian politician
Pauline Hanson by using her voice to claim she is homosexual, a
prostitute, a transvestite and a member of the Klu Klux Klan.
	   Chief Justice Paul De Jersey upheld an injunction on the song
which prevents it being played on radio, saying it was clearly
defamatory and a ``mindless effort at cheap denigration.''
	   Hanson is suing a branch of the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
for playing the song, called ``Back Door Man,'' by Pauline
Pantsdown. The song uses rearranged excerpts from Hanson's speeches
as its lyrics.
	   The corporation claimed the song was satirical nonsense which
could not be taken seriously and was thereby incapable of being
defamatory.
	   De Jersey disagreed and dismissed the corporation's appeal
against the injunction.
	   The song contains ``grossly offensive imputations relating to
the sexual orientation and preference of a federal politician,''
that are plainly defamatory, De Jersey said in his ruling.
	   ``I consider there's no real room for debate that an ordinary
listener, not avid for scandal, would find one of the imputations
defamatory.''
	   During a brief hearing, Hanson wept as the song was played in
court.
	   ``I was very upset by it,'' she told reporters later.
	   ``The (court's) message is that freedom of speech does not
extend (to) allowing people the right to defame others and tell
lies.''
	   Pantsdown, formerly known as arts lecturer Simon Hunt, changed
his name to run in Australia's Oct. 3 national election and is
campaigning on an anti-Hanson ticket.
	   Dressed in Hanson-like garb and makeup, Pantsdown said outside
the court that the ruling was a blow to freedom of speech.
	   He said her role was that of a satirist, performing the same
role as German satirists did against Adolf Hitler.
	   The song rearranged Hanson's words into comments that Hanson had
already made by imputation, in particular on race and
homosexuality, Pantsdown said.
	   ``She has defamed me as one of the 10 percent of people in this
country who are homosexual.
	   ``I have turned those views around and satirized them. My
actions, my songs were trivial, it was a joke.''
	   Another Pantsdown song using Hanson's voice, ``I Don't Like
It,'' and another song parodying Hanson by two other comedians, are
still in circulation.

Settlers rush to U.S. to head off Israel-Palestinian accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Jewish settler leaders hurried to New York
on Monday to try to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not
to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The settlers threatened to topple Netanyahu if he went ahead
with such a deal which they fear will isolate many of the
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strips.
	   However, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh indicated Monday
that an agreement between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat was not near.
	   Speaking after a three-way meeting between U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Arafat and Netanyahu early Monday, Naveh
told Israel radio that the obstacle remains Palestinian refusal to
carry out its commitments, especially stopping extremists from
attacking Israel. ``We are not in the position of being able to say
that an agreement has been reached in these areas,'' he said.
	   Palestinians say they have done all they can to control
extremists. Arafat told a Jewish gathering in New York on Sunday
that his policy is ``zero tolerance for terror and violence.'' The
Palestinians charge that Israel is responsible for the stalemate.
	   Despite the remaining gaps, Naveh said a meeting at the White
House on Monday between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Netanyahu and
Arafat is a ``possibility.''
	   He said final arrangements have not yet been made. But he did
not expect an agreement to emerge from a White House meeting.
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Clinton on Monday. Arafat is to see
the president Tuesday.
	   In a related development, Israel TV reported late Sunday that
once an agreement on a troop pullback is signed, Netanyahu plans to
appoint Cabinet hardliner Ariel Sharon as foreign minister in
charge of negotiating a final peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Sharon's office would not confirm or deny the report.
	   Sharon, the most experienced member of Netanyahu's Cabinet,
could lead a right-wing revolt against the prime minister over the
upcoming troop withdrawal. Netanyahu apparently hopes to coopt
Sharon by giving him a crucial say over a future peace accord.
	   Sharon seeks to retain as much war-captured land as possible and
opposes full Palestinian statehood.
	   Amid radio reports that progress was being made on a West Bank
pullback, the mayors of two Jewish settlements, Uri Ariel of Beit
El and Benny Kashriel of Maaleh Adumim, jumped on a Sunday midnight
flight to New York to meet Netanyahu there. The two are leaders of
the Council of Jewish Settlements that represents 144 settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Settlers say they received
information that an agreement with the Palestinians is near.
	   Israeli officials say that the size of the Israeli pullback is
no longer a matter of contention. Under interim peace agreements,
Israel was to withdraw troops in the West Bank in three stages by
the summer of this year. The Palestinians already control seven
West Bank cities and two-thirds of the Gaza Strip. According to a
U.S. compromise proposal, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent
of the West Bank in the first of two pullbacks.
	   Before leaving for the United States, Ariel warned that signing
an agreement could spell the end of the Netanyahu government.
	   Explaining why he decided to hurry to New York, he said: ``We
want to tell him, `Mr. Prime Minister, don't take this horrible and
terrible step, and don't lead us into situations that could cause
you and your government to be deposed.'''
	   Naveh did not promise that the settlers would meet Netanyahu. He
said it depends on whether they arrive before Netanyahu is to leave
for Israel. ``They can rest assured that the Prime Minister is
standing firm on Israel's vital interests,'' he added.

Majority in Vladivostok vote against all candidates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ The majority of voters in the Far
Eastern port of Vladivostok have rejected all the candidates for
mayor, according to preliminary results released Monday by the city
electoral commission.
	   Sunday's vote capped a scandal-ridden campaign. The leading
candidate, incumbent Mayor Viktor Cherepkov, was struck from the
ballot at the last minute for violating election laws.
	   According to the preliminary count on Monday morning, 53.6
percent of registered voters had voted against all 12 candidates
remaining on the ballot after Cherepkov and another candidate were
removed.
	   Some 13.3 percent voted for Vladimir Shakhov, a deputy in the
lower house of the Russian parliament and chairman of the
Dalrosso-Group insurance company.
	   Turnout was 38 percent, more than the 25 percent necessary to
make the vote valid. Still, the election will probably be
invalidated because of the massive no-vote, city election chairman
Ilya Grinchenko said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   A city court ruled Thursday that Cherepkov could not run because
he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money, while city
official Vladimir Murashov was barred because of anti-Semitic
statements.
	   The commission instructed polling stations to strike both names
from the ballots just hours before polls were to open.
	   Vladivostok's mayoral election had been delayed for months as
Cherepkov has feuded with regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko.
Cherepkov's term expired on July 5.

Fairly strong earthquake shakes southern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.1 rocked southern Japan Monday, but there were no
immediate reports of damage or injuries.
	   The quake was centered about 50 kilometers (30 miles) under the
Pacific ocean floor, off Amami Oshima island, about 1,300
kilometers (800 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the Meteorological
Agency said.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, seismic waves caused by undersea
disturbances such as earthquakes, as a result of the temblor, which
struck at 3:19 p.m. (0619 GMT), it said.
	   A magnitude 5-level quake can cause damage to homes if it occurs
in a residential area. Japan is one of the world's most
earthquake-prone countries.

Yeltsin meets with officials to complete cabinet formation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met Monday with top
officials in an effort to wrap up formation of the new Cabinet _ a
painful process that has stretched into a third week amid Russia's
raging economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin first met with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is
still struggling to fill more than 10 Cabinet seats.
	   Confusion over the Cabinet's makeup has contributed to the
uncertainty surrounding the future course of the new government,
which is saddled with the worst economic turmoil since the Soviet
collapse.
	   The Kremlin has had difficulty finding people willing to tackle
the job. Parliamentary deputy Vladimir Ryzhkov, who was appointed a
deputy premier while on a trip abroad, said he couldn't accept the
job because he lacks the necessary experience.
	   Alexander Shokhin, a centrist who was named to the key post of
deputy prime minister in charge of financial policy, resigned
Friday after just 10 days on the job.
	   He said he was quitting to protest the reappointment of Mikhail
Zadornov as finance minister. Shokhin held Zadornov responsible for
the previous Cabinet's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and
freeze domestic debt _ a controversial move that many blame for
fueling Russia's crisis.
	   Zadornov, a liberal reformer, defended himself over the weekend,
saying the former government had few viable alternatives. He
pledged to improve the terms of the government's debt repayment.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multibillion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the Cabinet for allegedly favoring Russian
banks.
	   Yeltsin is also scheduled to meet Monday with three newly
appointed ministers: Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, Trade
Minister Georgy Gabunia, and Science and Technology Minister
Mikhail Kirpichnikov.

Cambodian opposition leaders postpone return to Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two Cambodian opposition leaders
decided on Monday to postpone their return from Thailand amid
government threats of legal action against its critics.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy left Friday for a
weekend trip to Bangkok after a controversial travel ban on newly
elected members of parliament and most other opposition figures was
lifted.
	   They were initially scheduled to return Monday, but they have
delayed their return by a few days, said officials from Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party.
	   They denied the decision was linked to renewed threats of
arrests and court summons against members of the opposition who
were involved in massive street protests calling for the ouster of
the nation's leader, Hun Sen.
	   ``But of course, we are very concerned,'' said FUNCINPEC
spokesman Kong Vibol. ``If they are going to threaten arrests, they
have to tell us on what grounds. What have we done wrong?''
	   Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said Monday that ``people
involved in organizing the demonstrations'' after the July 26
parliamentary elections will be called in for questioning this
week.
	   ``If they refuse to go or we cannot find them, the court will
issue an order for them to appear,'' he said.
	   Hun Sen has accused opposition leaders of provoking a Sept. 7
grenade attack on his home in the capital of Phnom Penh. No one was
injured in the attack.
	   His political rivals maintain the attack was staged by Hun Sen
as a pretext for cracking down on the street rallies, which
demanded the ouster of Hun Sen and alleged fraud in the elections.
	   A second alleged attempt on Hun Sen's life last week _ also
immediately blamed on the opposition _ has only added to the
tensions.
	   A 12-year-old boy was killed when a rocket exploded by Hun Sen's
motorcade in Siem Reap province. Three bystanders were injured.
	   Sam Rainsy, whom Hun Sen accused in the Sept. 7 attack, said by
telephone from Bangkok he would ``follow the developments very
closely.''
	   ``But I hope the government will refrain from issuing any
warrants or decisions to summons any opposition officials for
questioning, which can lead to detentions and so on,'' he said.
	   The July 26 elections were held one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup.
	   Hun Sen hoped to win back legitimacy and aid lost after his
takeover.
	   His Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority in the
parliamentary polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government on its own.
	   The Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC will head to the
negotiating table this week to try to diffuse tensions and perhaps
hammer out an agreement so that a coalition government can be
formed.
	   The Sam Rainsy Party, which won only 15 of 122 seats in
parliament, has been excluded from those talks.

Philippine Airlines union, management reach breakthrough agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with President Estrada announcing
agreement; trims

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Five days after the airline's
closure, the management and main union of Philippine Airlines
agreed Monday on a management-proposed rehabilitation plan that
could lead to its reopening.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said union officials agreed
to accept a key management demand _ a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement.
	   If approved by union members, regulators and PAL creditors, the
agreement could lead to the reopening of Asia's oldest airline,
officials said.
	   Opposition within the union, which represents ground personnel,
to that decision is high. Thousands of workers protested at the
union's office and at the Senate Monday, calling instead for the
government to take over the airline.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos said the agreement was PAL's
``last, last, last possible hope.''
	   ``If this fails, it's closed,'' he added.
	   PAL shut down last Wednesday after the ground crew union earlier
rejected the management plan, which would give workers 20 percent
of the company's stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a 10-year suspension would violate workers' rights and
destroy the union.
	   PAL, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion, has been ravaged by
strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   It says creditors and potential new investors have insisted on
the suspension of the collective bargaining agreement before they
will accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Earlier Monday, Estrada flew to the central Philippines aboard
the first domestic flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways,
which he enlisted to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's closure.
	   Initially, two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be leased to
PNB Holdings, a subsidiary of Philippine National Bank, which is 47
percent owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said up to six
Cathay Pacific planes may be leased with accompanying crews.
	   At least three smaller Philippine domestic carriers have said
they plan to expand their operations in response to PAL's closure,
and air force planes are helping carry vital cargo, including mail,
medicine and newspapers, officials said.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission is also studying whether there is a chance of reopening
the carrier.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volume. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

Contingency plan calls for halts in rice export
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ As part of a contingency plan in event
of a world economic depression, Thailand may halt rice exports to
prevent shortages in domestic market, a Thai newspaper said Monday.
	   Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, has not taken such
a measure since World War II.
	   The possible move was raised at a recent meeting as part of the
government's worst-scenario contingency plan to counter a global
slump, The Nation newspaper reported.
	   The newspaper quoted two unidentified government sources as
saying the contingency would be ``like preparing for war,'' and
also include controls on foreign borrowing and steps to protect the
country's export share from competitors.
	   The plan is being drafted by Commerce Minister Supachai
Panichapakdi and Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda. They will
submit it to the Cabinet in two weeks, the newspaper said.
	   Thailand is concerned that if the world economy continues to
deteriorate it could plunge into social unrest and political
turmoil like Indonesia and Malaysia, it said.
	   Thailand exports an average of 5 millions tons of rice each
year, or a third of its total production.
	   The government has been closely monitoring the international
rice trade as natural disasters in rice-producing countries have
cut short the world supply.

Poll: majority of British businesses favor joining European

currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A majority of British business executives want
their nation to join the European single currency, but most are
doing nothing to prepare for that day, according to a poll
published Monday by the Financial Times.
	   The survey of chairmen, managing directors and board members
found that 26 percent wanted to join the Euro as soon as possible,
and another 37 percent favored entry after the next election, which
must be held by 2002. Twenty-three percent said they wanted Britain
to stay out of the European currency.
	   Eleven members of the European Union are committed to launching
the currency on Jan. 1. British Prime Minister Tony Blair says he
is prepared to join the Euro when it is in Britain's interest to do
so, but has set no deadline.
	   The Financial Times' survey found that 22 percent of the
respondents were taking some steps to prepare for the single
currency but 77 percent were not. One percent didn't know.
	   The poll was carried out by the MORI polling organization, which
interviewed 753 executives by telephone between Sept. 9 and Sept.
25. The survey had a margin of error of about three percentage
points.

Creditors to propose new conditions to sell Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to eliminate reference to President Kim
Dae-jung ordering new auction

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks said Monday they would
sweeten the terms of a third auction to sell off bankrupt Kia
Motors Corp., presumably by swallowing more of its debt.
	   An official at Kia's largest creditor, state-run Korea
Development Bank, said various measures were under study but
declined to elaborate.
	   But various South Korean media reported that the banks had
agreed to write off up to dlrs 3.2 billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4
billion debt.
	   They earlier had agreed to write off dlrs 2.1 billion, but that
didn't satisfy potential buyers who demanded further debt
reductions in two previous failed auctions.
	   The creditor banks said they would conduct a third auction on an
unspecified date in October. New bidding schedules are expected to
be announced this week.
	   Previous bidders were Ford Motor Co. of the United States and
Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. of
South Korea.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ After St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire
whacked his 70th home run of the season this weekend, even Japan's
all-time home run king was overawed.
	   ``There's no other way to say it but that it's astonishing that
he hit the 70th homer with the world's attention focused on him,''
Sadaharu Oh told Kyodo News.
	   ``The world takes its hat off in respect,'' Oh was quoted as
saying.
	   Oh hit 868 home runs over his 22-year career _ 113 more than
Hank Aaron, America's all-time home run leader. Oh also holds
Japan's single season home run record, with 55 roundtrippers in the
140-game 1964 season.
	   Oh is now manager of the Pacific League's Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   McGwire blasted his 70th homer against Montreal Expos pitcher
Mike Thurman at Busch Stadium in St. Louis on Sunday.

Austalia warms up for test series with a huge victory

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Stuart MacGill's six-wicket haul,
including last five scalps off 19 deliveries, helped Australia post
a huge 333 runs victory over Karachi on the last day Monday of the
four-day tour opener.
	   MacGill, the rookie leg-spinner, coming in place of Shane Warne,
quickly wrapped up Karachi's second innings at 123 at lunch.
	   The victory comes as a big morale booster ahead of the first
test against Pakistan beginning Oct. 1 at Rawalpindi. The visitors
will play a three-test series.
	   Warne stayed back in Australia to recover from a shoulder
operation and MacGill's performance Monday could pose problems for
the Pakistani batsmen.
	   ``Of course the team's morale goes up when one goes into a Test
match with a victory behind them,'' said skipper Mark Taylor.
	   ``All the players performed outstandingly, batsmen got enough
runs while the bowlers did a splendid job,'' Taylor said after the
match.
	   Australia piled up 540 for nine in its first innings and then
dismissed Karachi for 278 in the first outing. The visitors
followed their first innings performance in the second innings and
made 194 for two before skipper Mark Taylor declared late on Sunday
and set up a challenging target of 457 for the home team.
	   Karachi, reeling at 11 for 2 overnight, started off cautiously
with Saeed Azad and Suleman Huda negotiating the opening overs of
Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz.
	   However, once Gavin Robertson removed both batsmen, Karachi
batsmen struggled to stay at the crease in front of MacGill. Huda
(21) gave an easy bat and pad catch to Justin Langer at forward
short leg and Azad (44) followed soon giving a return catch to the
off-spinner.
	   Thereafter, Karachi batsmen were devoured by MacGill who
polished off the middle-order and the tail in quick time, claiming
five wickets in space of 19 balls.
	   Azam Khan, highest scorer with 57 in Karachi's first innings
total of 278 in reply to Australians mammoth 540 for nine declared,
was the next to go, holing out in the deep to McGrath off MacGill's
full toss delivery.
	   Hasan Raza and Faisal Iqbal, nephew of Pakistan national team
coach Javed Miandad, halted the collapse briefly with the home team
struggling at 81 for five.
	   However, MacGill had Raza (24 off 27 balls) caught by skipper
Mark Taylor in the first slip while Iqbal was trapped leg before.
Skipper Aamir Sohail, who will be leading the Pakistan team in the
coming Test series, was smartly stumped by Ian Healy off MacGill
after hammering a solitary boundary.
	   MacGill then wrapped up the innings claiming the last two
wickets off successive deliveries with Ali Hussain Rizvi falling
leg before and last man Ali Gohar giving Healy his second stumping
of the innings.
	   MacGill finished with an impressive figures of 6 for 34 off 8.4
overs. McGrath (2-9) and Robertson (2-48) were the other successful
Australian bowlers.

International space station faces new delay, Russia behind
</HEADLINE>
schedule &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Participants in the dlrs 21 billion international
space station debated Monday whether to again delay its
construction after Russia failed for the third time to deliver a
key segment.
	   The station, a joint project of Russia, the United States, the
European Space Agency, Canada and Japan, has already been pushed
back a year because the cash-strapped Russian space industry has
missed two previous target dates.
	   Despite repeated pledges, the Russian government has failed to
fund construction of the service module that would serve as living
quarters for the crew.
	   It seems certain that the module won't be completed in time to
meet an April launch date, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   All the countries involved in the international space station
were taking part in Monday's debate.
	   The delay also casts doubt on a plan to launch the station's
first module in less than two months, on Nov. 20. The cargo module,
built by the Russian Khrunichev company under contract with the
U.S. firm Boeing, has already been taken to the launch site at the
Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   NASA was expected to follow with a launch of the second part, a
connecting passageway, on Dec. 3.
	   Because of the probable delay in sending up a crew in the third
stage, the dates for the first two launches may be revised. Leaving
the orbiting modules unmanned for so long is considered risky.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said, however, that Russia is likely
to push for the first two segments to be launched as previously
scheduled. With the first segment in space, the Russian space
agency might have better luck in lobbying the government for
delivery of the promised funds.
	   In an attempt to prevent new costly delays in the project, NASA
intends to ask Congress and the White House for approval to buy
additional goods and services from the Russian Space Agency worth
as much as dlrs 660 million over the next four years, according to
news reports last week.
	   However, Koptev bristled at the proposed bailout, saying the
U.S. aid would effectively deprive Russia of its current status as
a major stockholder in the project and turn it into a
subcontractor.

Reactors stopped, restarted at Ukraine's nuclear power plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was stopped at Ukraine's
Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in advance of repairs that are
scheduled to last several months, officials said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 3 was shut down early Sunday and is scheduled to be
restarted Dec. 10, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom
said.
	   Another reactor at Zaporizhia, Europe's largest nuclear plant,
was restarted Saturday after three days of repairs. The plant has
six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors.
	   A total of 14 malfunctions have occurred at Zaporizhia in the
first seven months of this year, more than at any other Ukrainian
nuclear energy facilities, according to the plant's data.
	   A minor malfunction was also reported Sunday in the safety
system of a reactor at the Rivne nuclear power plant. As a result,
the reactor was shut down and restarted within an hour.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants, which account for more
than 40 percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity
production.

Slovak vote is watershed for democracy in Central Europe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An apparent victory by Slovakia's
opposition in the young country's second nationwide election has
opened a new door for the West into Eastern Europe.
	   It also sets the stage for the departure from power of one of
Europe's few remaining autocrats _ Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar _
although some doubts remain that he will go quietly.
	   If Meciar's ruling party doesn't challenge or overturn results
that show opposition parties winning more than 60 percent of the
seats in Parliament, a new leadership that is eager to please the
West is set to take over.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties met Sunday and
declared their formal intent to unite after results indicated they
had won 93 of the 150 seats. But weeks of political friction are
likely since Meciar's party would remain the largest in Parliament.
	   Barring a stunning change when the official vote count is
released Monday night or Tuesday, Meciar's likeliest options would
be to serve as minority leader or resign.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, is
the prospective new prime minister. The 43-year-old economist and
former transport specialist rose to prominence due in part to his
plain-spoken style.
	   On Sunday, he avoided specific plans for change and said it was
important for Slovakia that the new government be formed swiftly.
	   Since Czechoslovakia dissolved six years ago, its two
ex-communist parts have gone in different directions. While the
Czech Republic swiftly adopted free-market and democratic reforms
and became a darling of Western tourists and investors, Slovakia
fell into diplomatic isolation under Meciar's heavy-handed rule.
	   The 56-year-old Meciar blocked dissent, reined in the media,
cracked down on the opposition and ethnic minorities, and was
censured by foreign governments.
	   Foreign investors fled or waited for change in the nation of 5.5
million. Relations with neighboring countries grew tense, and a
leery West bypassed the Slovaks while embracing the neighboring
Czechs and Hungarians for early entry into NATO and the European
Union.
	   Now, Slovakia appears to have rejected old-style leadership and
is poised to join its neighbors in integrating with the West.
	   Opposition parties campaigned heavily on the theme of reversing
``Meciarism'' and getting the nation into the EU and NATO, saying
they will pass laws aimed at establishing fairness and meeting
Western standards.
	   Meciar built highways and dams and provided strong and
relatively stable rule in Slovakia. He retained a loyal enough
following for his party to finish ahead of all 16 competitors.
	   But he wound up alienating not only the West but more and more
Slovaks with his increasing extremism.
	   In the end, he was outpolled by an unlikely alliance of
opposition parties _ ranging from rightists to ex-communists to
free-marketeers _ who united only out of a determination to drive
Meciar from power.
	   If it manages to form the new government, the opposition faces
daunting economic problems that may require harsh budget cuts.
	   But as the West's best chance in years to establish deeper
democratic roots in the region, they are counting on significant
foreign financial assistance to help Slovakia make the transition _
and are likely to get it.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party announced Monday it had
reached a final agreement with the major opposition parties on a
key set of bills to clean up this country's troubled financial
system.
	   The announcement raised hopes that the bills, aimed at cleaning
up about dlrs 1 trillion of bad debt in the banking sector, would
be approved early next month, during the current session of
Parliament.
	   ``We'd like to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as
possible,'' Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, said after a set of marathon talks with
the opposition that went through the weekend.
	   Last week, the LDP and opposition reached a basic accord on the
bills, which incorporated the key parts of the opposition's rival
version of the legislation.
	   But the agreement was vague, and began to unravel almost as soon
as it was announced.
	   The breakthrough Monday, however, centered on a compromise over
how much power to give a new independent body that will be charged
with regulating the finance sector.
	   The opposition, led by the Democratic Party, had demanded the
body be given full authority to chart the course of the financial
sector. But the LDP said that would take too much power away from
the Finance Ministry.
	   The two sides agreed regulation of the finance sector would be
shared by the ministry and the independent panel.
	   They also agreed that any bank whose capital falls precariously
while purchasing an ailing bank that has been nationalized will be
eligible for an injection of public funds.
	   The chief of Keidanren, Japan's main big business lobby, was
encouraged by Monday's breakthrough, but urged swift action in
implementing the legislation.
	   ``Parliament has been in session for 60 days, I hope it won't
take another 60 to get the agreement finalized and passed,'' said
Takashi Imai.
	   Opposition and ruling parties said the session might have to be
extended by a week after its scheduled end on Oct. 7.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley also welcomed Monday's
breakthrough.
	   ``We think it was a very constructive agreement. We were very
glad to hear it,'' Foley said.
	   The United States and other nations have been growing
increasingly impatient with Japan's laggard pace in approving the
bills, which are seen as essential to nursing the economy out of
its recession.
	   On Saturday, the two sides reached a compromise on one of their
main points of contention _ the fate of ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   The ruling party acquiesced to opposition demands that the
government acquire all of LTCB's shares, effectively nationalizing
it. The government would then sell the bank back to the private
sector after disposing of its bad assets.
	   The government has been trying to broker a merger between LTCB
and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. Under this weekend's agreement,
Sumitomo would be able buy LTCB shares from the government, and
turn the bank into a subsidiary.

Philippine Airlines union, management reach breakthrough agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with airline official saying reopening might come as
early as next week in 2nd-3rd grafs, edits to conform. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Five days after the airline's
closure, the management and main union of Philippine Airlines
agreed Monday on a management-proposed rehabilitation plan that
could lead to its reopening.
	   If approved by union members, regulators and PAL creditors, the
agreement could lead to the reopening of Asia's oldest airline as
early as next week, officials said.
	   ``It's possible,'' said PAL executive vice president Manolo
Aquino.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada said union officials agreed
to accept a key management demand _ a 10-year suspension of their
collective bargaining agreement.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a 10-year suspension would violate workers' rights and
destroy the union.
	   Hundreds of workers protested the agreement at the union's
office and at the Senate Monday, calling instead for the government
to take over the airline.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos said the agreement was PAL's
``last, last, last possible hope.''
	   ``If this fails, it's closed,'' he added.
	   PAL shut down last Wednesday after the ground crew union earlier
rejected the management plan, which would give workers 20 percent
of the company's stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement.
	   PAL, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion, has been ravaged by
strikes and Asia's currency crisis.
	   It says creditors and potential new investors have insisted on
the suspension of the collective bargaining agreement before they
will accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Earlier Monday, Estrada flew to the central Philippines aboard
the first domestic flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways,
which he enlisted to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's closure.
	   Initially, two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be leased to
PNB Holdings, a subsidiary of Philippine National Bank, which is 47
percent owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said up to six
Cathay Pacific planes may be leased with accompanying crews.
	   At least three smaller Philippine domestic carriers have said
they plan to expand their operations in response to PAL's closure,
and air force planes are helping carry vital cargo, including mail,
medicine and newspapers, officials said.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission is also studying whether there is a chance of reopening
the carrier.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volume. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

Serbian parliament to support Milosevic policies in Kosovo

 &UR; PRECEDE Pristina
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with Serbian parliament convening, fighting
continuing in Kosovo; CHANGES changes dateline and byline. no

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a show of unity and defiance
against NATO threats over Kosovo, Serbia's parliament convened
Monday to back the tough policies of its leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Parliament is expected to pass a resolution, proposed by the
government last week, which declares that stamping out ethnic
Albanian resistance in Kosovo is the nation's top priority. It will
blast the West for pressuring Serbia.
	   The strongly-worded resolution indicated that Serbia has no
intention of stopping its campaign against independence-minded
ethnic Albanians in the southern Kosovo province, despite new
warnings that time is running out to avoid NATO intervention.
	   The resolution is also aimed at strengthening Yugoslav President
Milosevic's position at home and rallying Serbs behind his policies
as he faces increased world pressure.
	   ``The main problem in Kosovo is separatism,'' declared Premier
Mirko Marjanovic as he submitted the government report about Kosovo
to the parliament.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against militant separatists in Kosovo
started seven months ago. Some 275,000 people have been displaced
by the fighting and hundreds killed.
	   Serbia was defying the world on the ground, too.
	   Government forces launched a new offensive late Saturday in an
area about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the Kosovo capital
Pristina.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Monday that fighting continued
overnight, in the region where rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters seemed to have regrouped following a rout earlier this
year.
	   On Sunday, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva
Reka, Urosevac and Stimlje. The attack reportedly focused on 11
villages, and three were on fire. An estimated 15,000 civilians
have begun leaving the area.
	   Police sources said the rebels recently kidnapped two Serbs,
which prompted the new action.
	   A U.N. Security Council demanded last week an end to all Serb
attacks in Kosovo and NATO finalized plans for air strikes unless
the fighting stops. The alliance has finalized plans to hit
strategic targets throughout Serbia.
	   In nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Milosevic has only ``a short period of time'' to comply
with international demands.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen said.
``A failure to do so on his part will be met with very strong NATO
action in my judgment.''
	   The Serbian government resolution said pressure on Serbia would
be counter-effective. It called for negotiations on the future of
Kosovo and offered a degree of self-rule for the province.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas while
driving out rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by the KLA.

Garbage threatens tourism in popular Thai resort city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A popular tourist destination in
northern Thailand is quickly losing its appeal as ``The Rose of the
North'' with tons of garbage piling up in the city center.
	   More than 2,000 tons of garbage have stacked up at two different
locations in the city of Chiang Mai, 580 kilometers (360 miles)
north of Bangkok, over the past few weeks.
	   The government is worried that the foul smell will drive away
tourists, who contribute significantly to the local economy, said
Natheera Kajornserilikitkul, director of the Tourist Authority of
Thailand's northern region.
	   One group of Japanese tourists have already complained,
reportedly sending a letter to authorities complaining about
smelling ``something strange'' as soon as they stepped off the
airplane last week.
	   Natheera said the municipality has not been able to find a new
dump site after the old one was filled up last month.
	   But the garbage problem is a longstanding one, with local media
reporting that it stems from political infighting between two
factions in the city government.
	   The dispute led to the resignation of the mayor, Bussaba
Yodbangtoey, Monday.
	   Natheera said the problem threatens the upcoming tourist season,
which starts in mid-October and ends in March. She pointed to
upcoming 13th Asian Games in Bangkok, during which spectators,
especially foreign visitors, are expected to visit the city.
	   But Noun Sarasorn, the deputy director in her office, said the
municipality should reach an agreement in the next few days.
	   More than 3 million people visited Chiang Mai last year, with
more expected this season because of the Asian Games and an ongoing
``Amazing Thailand'' campaign to attract more visitors.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton will host the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders in a three-way summit at the White
House on Monday in hopes of concluding agreement on a West Bank
troop pullback, an Israeli official said.
	   The summit comes amid reports that the two sides have made some

	   Late Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat met for the first

State Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright said that much work remained to be done.
	   Palestinian negotiators said the talks focused on the scope of
the pullback, as well as the opening of a Palestinian airport and
industrial zone in the Gaza Strip.
	   An Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Netanyahu and Arafat were to meet later Monday with Clinton. From
there, Arafat was to return to New York to address the U.N. General
Assembly and Netanyahu was to fly to Israel, Israel radio said.

Siberian blazes out of control, Sakhalin fires slowed by snow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Fires are blazing out of control across up to
40,000 hectares (98,800 acres) of Siberian woodland, while snowfall
has slowed the spread of forest fires on Sakhalin Island in
Russia's Far East, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   A funding shortage that has severely hampered fire-fighters is
to blame for the unprecedented scale of forest fires this year,
ITAR-Tass said. Fire-spotting planes and helicopters had been
unable to fly for lack of fuel.
	   Alexander Lyubakin, chief of the Far Eastern fire air base, said
that the federal government had provided just one-quarter of the
funds needed to put out the fires in the huge Khabarovsk territory
in Russia's Far East, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   In all, about 547,000 hectares (1.4 million acres) are on fire
in the territory.
	   On nearby Sakhalin Island, forest fires have calmed due to an
early snow. ITAR-Tass said that the fires no longer threaten
inhabited areas.

Settlers rush to U.S. to head off Israel-Palestinian accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Jewish settler leaders hurried to New York
on Monday to try to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not
to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   The settlers threatened to topple Netanyahu if he goes ahead
with a deal they fear will isolate many settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strips.
	   However, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh indicated on
Monday that an agreement between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat was not near.
	   Speaking after a three-way meeting between U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Arafat and Netanyahu early Monday, Naveh
told Israel radio that the obstacle remains Palestinian refusal to
carry out its commitments, especially stopping extremists from
attacking Israel. ``We are not in the position of being able to say
that an agreement has been reached in these areas,'' he said.
	   Palestinians say they have done all they can to control
extremists. Arafat told a Jewish gathering in New York on Sunday
that his policy is ``zero tolerance for terror and violence.'' The
Palestinians charge that Israel is responsible for the stalemate.
	   Despite the remaining gaps, Naveh said a meeting at the White
House on Monday between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Netanyahu and
Arafat is a ``possibility.''
	   He said final arrangements have not yet been made. But he did
not expect an agreement to emerge from a White House meeting.
Netanyahu is scheduled to meet Clinton on Monday, a day before
Arafat.
	   Amid radio reports that progress was being made on a West Bank
pullback, the mayors of two Jewish settlements, Uri Ariel of Beit
El and Benny Kashriel of Maaleh Adumim, jumped on a Sunday midnight
flight to New York to meet Netanyahu.
	   The two are leaders of the Council of Jewish Settlements, a body
that represents 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Settlers say they received information that an agreement with the
Palestinians is near.
	   Before leaving, Ariel warned that signing an agreement could
spell the end of the Netanyahu government. The National Religious
Party, closely associated with the Jewish settlement movement, has
10 seats in the 120-member parliament, or enough to bring down
Netanyahu's coalition.
	   Explaining why he decided to hurry to New York, Ariel said: ``We
want to tell him, `Mr. Prime Minister, don't take this horrible and
terrible step, and don't lead us into situations that could cause
you and your government to be deposed.'''
	   In a related development, Israel TV reported late Sunday that
once an agreement on a troop pullback is signed, Netanyahu plans to
appoint Cabinet hardliner Ariel Sharon as foreign minister in
charge of negotiating a final accord with the Palestinians.
	   Sharon's office would not confirm or deny the report.
	   Sharon, the most experienced member of Netanyahu's Cabinet,
could lead a right-wing revolt against the prime minister over the
troop withdrawal. Netanyahu apparently hopes to co-opt Sharon by
giving him a crucial say over a future peace accord.
	   Israeli officials say the size of the Israeli pullback is no
longer a matter of contention. Under interim peace agreements,
Israel was to withdraw troops in the West Bank in three stages by
this summer.
	   The Palestinians already control seven West Bank cities and
two-thirds of the Gaza Strip. According to a U.S. compromise
proposal, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of the West
Bank in the first of two pullbacks.

Outline of Japan's proposed banking industry reform bills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are the key points of a compromise accord between Japan's
ruling and opposition parties over a set of banking industry reform
bills:
	   _BANK BAILOUTS. The government will effectively nationalize
failed financial institutions by purchasing shares to provide
capital needed to write off bad loans.
	   _LTCB RESCUE. The government will buy all outstanding stock in
the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and place the bank
under state control. Private sector suitors such as Sumitomo Trust
and Banking Co. may then submit bids for the bank.
	   _FINANCE MINISTRY. Regulatory authority for dealing with
financial industry crises will be shared by the powerful Finance
Ministry and a new independent oversight committee.
	   _JAPANESE RTC. Two existing entities established to buy up bad
loans from banks and failed housing lenders will be merged into a
more powerful body, creating a Japanese version of the Resolution
Trust Corp. created in the United States to deal with the savings
and loan crisis of the 1980s.

Torch passed to new generation

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Rather than mourn America's Davis Cup debacle,
team captain Tom Gullikson is focusing on the future.
	   At least 21-year-old rookies Jan-Michael Gambill, whose victory
Sunday helped the United States avoid a shutout by the Italians,
and Justin Gimelstob got their Davis Cup debuts out of the way.
	   ``Hopefully, the next time they play, nerves won't be a big
factor,'' Gullikson said. ``You have to start sometime.''
	   Gambill and Gimelstob represented a sneak peak at the future of
U.S. Davis Cup, which will likely include practice partners Bob and
Mike Bryan, 20-year-old twins who just turned pro after winning
NCAA titles at Stanford.
	   The passing of the torch occurred earlier than anybody expected.
	   Playing without Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and
Jim Courier, the starless but still favored U.S. team was upset by
Italy 4-1.
	   ``Well, certainly you want the best players to play,'' Gullikson
said. ``It is not easy. I can certainly only worry about the
players who are here, who are really committed. And I think it was
a great opportunity this week for Jan-Michael and Justin to gain
some great experience.''
	   Gimelstob, who lost the doubles match on Saturday and Sunday's
``dead rubber'' singles match, said he found a silver lining in the
loss.
	   ``I don't think anything will sour me on Davis Cup,'' he said.
``I think it will test my resilience possibly, but it won't sour
me. My desire to represent my country and the pride that I feel in
doing so will always be strong.''
	   Gimelstob said he couldn't fathom stars skipping the Davis Cup
for any reason.
	   ``But different people have different views,'' he said. ``I am
also 21 years old and I don't know what it feels like to be 27 and
have 100 million miles on your body.''
	   Not only did the U.S. team fail to win, but the Americans didn't
even get the fast court they were counting on. The hard surface
inside the Milwaukee Arena was chosen by the Americans because it
was supposed to favor their fast games. But it played more like the
clay courts the Italians grew up on.
	   ``It's a perfect court for them,'' said Gimelstob, who lost to
Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 on Sunday.
	   Gullikson said his players chose a ``medium-paced court with a
high bounce and we ended up getting a slow court with a low
bounce.''
	   Something else that greatly aided the Italians, who will face
Sweden, a 4-1 winner over Spain, in the final in December, was the
makeup of the U.S. team.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee, and Courier was withheld by Gullikson because of an arm
injury.
	   That left Gambill and Gimelstob to make their Davis Cup debuts,
and Martin, who played like a rookie, getting dumped in both
singles and doubles.
	   ``I was very impressed with a lot of the tennis that our rookies
played this weekend,'' said Gullikson, who refused to disparage the
players who bypassed Milwaukee.
	   ``Recruiting is very difficult,'' he said. ``It really has to
come from their heart more than anywhere.''
	   The Italians won all six tiebreakers and dropped just three sets
all weekend before Gambill beat Davide Sanguinetti (4-6, 6-3, 6-3)
in the final, meaningless match.
	   ``I am going out there and thinking about next year,'' Gambill
said. ``Now I have two matches under my belt. I am no longer the
rookie when I come out next year.''
	   Gullikson's own future with the team will be decided in early
November when the U.S. Tennis Association changes presidents.
	   He said he wants to stay despite the turmoil of the past year as
stars such as Agassi and Sampras bowed out, criticizing such issues
as site selection and fan support.
	   ``Things don't always go smoothly,'' Gullikson said. ``Sometimes
you lose when you think you are going to win. Sometimes players who
we think should be playing aren't playing.
	   ``That is why when we get back to it maybe and win it the next
time, it will make it all that much sweeter remembering the harder
times.''

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roy Halladay, pitching just his second major
league game, came within one out of a no-hitter Sunday, losing his
bid when pinch-hitter Bobby Higginson homered in the Toronto Blue
Jays' 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers.
	   Halladay (1-0) earned his first victory in the majors, striking
out eight and walking none. The 21-year-old right-hander was trying
to become the first rookie to pitch a no-hitter since Wilson
Alvarez did it for the Chicago White Sox against Baltimore in 1991.
	   Alex Gonzalez and Shawn Green homered off Justin Thompson
(11-14).
 &UR; Yankees 8, Devil Rays 3
	   In New York, Bernie Williams went 2-for-2 to win the AL batting
title and rookie Shane Spencer hit his third grand slam in nine
days.
	   In peak form for the start of the AL playoffs Tuesday night, the
Yankees (114-48) won their seventh straight. With a .704 winning
percentage, New York became the first team since the 1954 Cleveland
Indians (111-43) to play better than .700 ball over an entire
season.
	   New York, which won the second-most games ever behind the 1906
Cubs (116-36), opens the postseason at home against Texas.
	   Williams had a pair of singles and a sacrifice fly to end the
season with a .339 average _ two points better than Boston's Mo
Vaughn, who went 2-for-4.
	   Jim Bruske (1-0) won and Rick White (2-6) lost. Tampa Bay was
1-11 against New York.
 &UR; Red Sox 6, Orioles 4
	   In Boston, Mo Vaughn drove in two runs with his 40th homer and a
single but failed to overtake Williams. Vaughn also matched his
career-high, 16-game hitting streak.
	   The Red Sox, who clinched the AL wild-card berth last Thursday,
begin their first postseason series since 1995 at Cleveland on
Tuesday, with Pedro Martinez (19-7) going against the Indians'
Jaret Wright (12-10). Boston (92-70) finished with its best record
since 1986 when it was 95-66 and lost a seven-game World Series to
the New York Mets.
	   Carlos Valdez (1-0) got the victory. Tom Gordon got his 46th
save with his major-league record 43rd in a row. Mike Mussina
(13-10) lost but the Orioles finished with a record-low 81 errors,
three fewer than the previous mark set by Minnesota in 1988.
 &UR; White Sox 7, Royals 6
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Albert Belle drove in three runs and
completed one of the most productive seasons in Chicago history.
	   Belle homered and added two singles, hiking his hit total to
200. He set team records with 49 home runs, 48 doubles, 152 RBIs,
399 total bases and 99 extra-base hits.
	   Belle had 31 homers after the All-Star break.
	   James Baldwin (13-6) gave up three runs on three hits in five
innings. Tim Belcher (14-14) was tagged for seven runs and eight
hits in five innings.
 &UR; Twins 6, Indians 2
	   In Minneapolis, the AL Central champion Indians finished the
regular season with their sixth loss in seven games Sunday as Matt
Lawton hit a three-run double for Minnesota.
	   Playing in what probably was the last game of his 21-year
career, Paul Molitor went 2-for-4 for the Twins. The 42-year-old
St. Paul native is eighth on the career list with 3,319 hits. He
has said he will announce a decision on whether he will retire in
the next month or so.
	   Eric Milton (8-13) won and Bartolo Colon (14-9) lost.
 &UR; Rangers 12, Mariners 6
	   In Seattle, Rusty Greer, Roberto Kelly, Milt Cuyler and Lee
Stevens homered for the AL West champion Rangers.
	   Greer had a two-run homer off Paul Spoljaric (4-6) in the third
inning and Kelly connected for a three-run shot in the fourth for
an 8-2 lead.
	   Tony Fossas (1-3) got the victory with 1 1-3 innings of
scoreless relief.
 &UR; Angels 4, Athletics 2
	   In Oakland, California, Jarrod Washburn (6-3) allowed three hits
in 6 2-3 innings in his first start since July 25 and Randy Velarde
went 3-for-4 with three RBIs. Shigetoshi Hasegawa got one out for
his fifth save.
	   Garret Anderson hit his 15th home run to lead off the fourth
against Jay Witasick (1-3), breaking a 1-1 tie.

Tokyo stocks, dollar, higher at mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late afternoon dollar, comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices rose Monday as investors
welcomed news that Japan's ruling party and opposition had reached
an agreement on key banking reform. The U.S. dollar also rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 185.53
points, or 1.35 percent, to 13,909.37. On Friday, the Nikkei shed
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent.
	   The weekend agreement paves the way for passage next month of
legislation aimed at cleaning up this country's troubled financial
system.
	   In currency trading, the dollar bought 135.72 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 1.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo, but below
its late New York level of 136.25 yen Friday. The dollar ranged
from 134.95 yen to 136.89 yen.
	   The dollar's rise, however, was kept in check by investors
selling the dollar following the surprise rally in the stock
market.
	   Traders said stocks were also buoyed by an advance on the
futures market and buying by public funds.
	   Monday's gains came despite the application for court protection
late Sunday by an affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan, Japan Leasing Corp., the nation's largest ever corporate
bankruptcy.
	   Shares of Long-Term Credit Bank dived to an all-time low of 13
yen (9.5 cents) per share, before closing at 15 yen (11 cents),
down from Friday's finish of 24 yen (18 cents). The bank's previous
record low of 18 yen (13 cents) was recorded on Sept. 18.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's largest banks, has been unable to shake off
speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed real estate
loans.
	   The market also welcomed the tie-up between Tokai Bank and Asahi
Bank as a sign that the banks are getting serious about preparing
for government-led ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation, said Sachio
Ichikawa at Chuo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 13.59, or 1.29 percent, to 1,063.52. On
Friday, the TOPIX closed down 28.08, or 2.6 percent.
	   Volume on the first section was about 377 million shares, up
from 368.51 million shares Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered
declines 778 to 370, with 143 issues unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond slipped to 0.800 percent from Friday's finish of
0.815 percent, driving its price up to 109.01 yen from 108.87 yen.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a show of unity and defiance
against NATO threats over Kosovo, Serbia's parliament convened
Monday to back the tough policies of its leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   Parliament is expected to pass a resolution, proposed by the
government last week, which declares that stamping out ethnic
Albanian resistance in Kosovo is the nation's top priority. It will
blast the West for pressuring Serbia.
	   The strongly-worded resolution indicated that Serbia has no
intention of stopping its campaign against independence-minded
ethnic Albanians in the southern Kosovo province, despite new
warnings that time is running out to avoid NATO intervention.
	   The resolution is also aimed at strengthening Yugoslav President
Milosevic's position at home and rallying Serbs behind his policies
as he faces increased world pressure.
	   ``The main problem in Kosovo is separatism,'' declared Premier
Mirko Marjanovic as he submitted the government report about Kosovo
to the parliament.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against militant separatists in Kosovo
started seven months ago. Some 275,000 people have been displaced
by the fighting and hundreds killed.
	   Serbia was defying the world on the ground, too.
	   Government forces launched a new offensive late Saturday in an
area about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the Kosovo capital
Pristina.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Monday that fighting continued
overnight, in the region where rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters seemed to have regrouped following a rout earlier this
year.
	   On Sunday, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva
Reka, Urosevac and Stimlje. The attack reportedly focused on 11
villages, and three were on fire. An estimated 15,000 civilians
have begun leaving the area.
	   Police sources said the rebels recently kidnapped two Serbs,
which prompted the new action.
	   A U.N. Security Council demanded last week an end to all Serb
attacks in Kosovo and NATO finalized plans for air strikes unless
the fighting stops. The alliance has finalized plans to hit
strategic targets throughout Serbia.
	   In nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Milosevic has only ``a short period of time'' to comply
with international demands.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen said.
``A failure to do so on his part will be met with very strong NATO
action in my judgment.''
	   The Serbian government resolution said pressure on Serbia would
be counter-effective. It called for negotiations on the future of
Kosovo and offered a degree of self-rule for the province.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas while
driving out rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by the KLA.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines' management and
its largest union reached agreement on a management-proposed
rehabilitation plan Monday, five days after the ailing airline's
closure, President Joseph Estrada announced.
	   Asia's oldest airline could reopen as early as next week if the
agreement is approved by union members, regulators and PAL's
creditors, officials said.
	   Estrada said union leaders agreed to accept a contentious
management demand _ a 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying a 10-year suspension would violate workers' rights and
destroy the union.
	   Hundreds of workers protested the agreement at the union's
office and at the Senate Monday, calling instead for the government
to take over the airline.
	   PAL shut down last Wednesday after the ground crew union earlier
rejected the management plan, which would give workers 20 percent
of the company's stock in exchange for a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leasing company saddled with over 2 trillion yen
(dlrs 16 billion) in debt announced Monday it has filed for
protection in Japan's biggest bankruptcy ever.
	   Instead of starting a market meltdown, however, stocks rose and
analysts said the megafailure might actually be good for Japan's
ailing banking sector.
	   Japan Leasing Corp., an affiliate of the ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, filed for protection from creditors late Sunday,
said Hiroaki Okamoto, the company's president.
	   Okamoto said he did not know how much of the company's 2.18
trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion) in debts it would be able to pay
back.
	   ``Our efforts to restructure the company proved to be
impossible,'' Okamoto said. ``I deeply apologize to our creditors
and for the effects this will have on the financial system.''
	   The failure was the latest in a series of bankruptcies as Japan
struggles through its deepest recession in decades.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm
generally regarded as authoritative on bankruptcies, said it would
be the biggest ever in Japan.
	   But instead of inspiring more gloom, the company's collapse was
seen by many as eliminating a potential sticking point in
government efforts to pass a series of banking bills to clean up
the country's bad-loan mess.
	   ___
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party announced Monday it had
reached a final agreement with the major opposition parties on a
key set of bills to clean up this country's troubled financial
system.
	   The announcement raised hopes that the bills, aimed at cleaning
up about dlrs 1 trillion of bad debt in the banking sector, would
be approved early next month, during the current session of
Parliament.
	   ``We'd like to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as
possible,'' Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, said after a set of marathon talks with
the opposition that went through the weekend.
	   Last week, the LDP and opposition reached a basic accord on the
bills, which incorporated the key parts of the opposition's rival
version of the legislation.
	   But the agreement was vague, and began to unravel almost as soon
as it was announced.
	   The breakthrough Monday, however, centered on a compromise over
how much power to give a new independent body that will be charged
with regulating the finance sector.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's president predicted
Monday that his country's contracting economy will resume growth in
the latter part of next year.
	   In a news conference devoted solely to economic matters, Kim
Dae-jung said tax cuts and other pump-priming measures will help
resuscitate the domestic economy.
	   ``In a word, there will be no second financial crisis,'' Kim
said. ``If we continue reform measures as we do now, the economy
will pick up later next year.''
	   Citing shrinking domestic consumption and exports _ the engine
of the country's economy _ some analysts have warned that South
Korea may be headed for a new financial crisis.
	   But Kim said the government, backed by a record foreign currency
reserve of dlrs 44 billion, will easily be able to repay dlrs 9
billion in external debt coming due this year and dlrs 36 billion
due next year.
	   ``Despite many uneasy international factors as shown in Japan,
Russia, Southeast Asia and South America, the value of our currency
has been stable and I believe the trend will continue,'' Kim said.
	   The president said his prediction of an economic turnaround next
year depends on how fast and effectively the economy can be
restructured, especially the financial and industrial sectors.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks said Monday they would
sweeten the terms of a third auction to sell off bankrupt Kia
Motors Corp., presumably by swallowing more of its debt.
	   ``Various attractive measures are being considered to sell Kia
without fail in a third auction,'' said one official at Kia's
largest creditor, state-run Korea Development Bank.
	   The official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, declined
to elaborate, but various news media said the banks had agreed to
write off up to dlrs 3.2 billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   They earlier had agreed to write off dlrs 2.1 billion, but that
didn't satisfy potential buyers who demanded further debt
reductions in two previous failed auctions.
	   The creditor banks said they would conduct a third auction on an
unspecified date in October. New bidding schedules are expected to
be announced this week.
	   Previous bidders were Ford Motor Co. of the United States and
Hyundai Motor Co., Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. of
South Korea.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ In a campaign to shore up the value of its
currency, China's government has warned businesses not to
circumvent foreign exchange controls, state media reported Monday.
	   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a recent directive,
threatening businesses with loss of licenses and other unspecified
punishment if they exploited legal loopholes, forged documents or
turned to the black market to trade hard currency.
	   Government policies confining conversion of the Chinese yuan to
international trade have largely protected it from the batterings
many Asian currencies have taken over the past 15 months.
	   Despite the policies and repeated pledges by Chinese leaders not
to devalue the yuan, however, back-door pressures on the currency
are mounting.
	   The government's dlrs 140 billion in foreign exchange reserves
has stopped growing this year as exporters hold on to more of their
hard currency earnings instead of remitting them to Beijing.
	   A black market exchange rate for the dollar that is 10 percent
above official rates suggests many Chinese fell less confident
about the yuan and government policies.

Chechen leader pledges to fight kidnappings, faces challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said his
government would publicly execute kidnappers to stop a crime wave
that has swept the breakaway republic, a news agency reported on
Monday.
	   Speaking on national television, Maskhadov claimed foreign
secret services were behind the Chechen gangs responsible for
frequent kidnappings in the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. He did not identify the secret services.
	   Chechnya has seen an increase in kidnappings, theft, and
violence among armed gangs, Muslim sects and ethnic groups since
its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. Maskhadov's attempts to
rein in crime have brought little result.
	   Chechnya carried out several public executions, but they were
met with strong criticism from Russia and abroad, and no one has
been publicly put to death in recent months.
	   Maskhadov's government has also encountered growing opposition
from Chechen warlords, who have refused to obey his orders.
	   Shamil Basayev, who served as Maskhadov's prime minister earlier
this year, has recently joined others pushing for the president's
ouster.
	   The warlords will gather later this week to demand that
Maskhadov take a tougher line in relations with Russia and fulfill
other demands, or resign, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov turned down these demands over the weekend, saying
that he ``rejects the language of ultimatums and doesn't intend to
respond to letters of people who are guilty of breaking the law,''
the report said.
	   Chechnya claims to be a sovereign nation, but Moscow says it
remains a part of Russia. No country has recognized Chechnya's
independence bid.
	   Despite his fight for independence, Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate and has been willing to negotiate with him.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Finished with Caribbean, Georges targets New
Orleans &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ The Big Easy was decidedly uneasy Sunday as
New Orleans prepared for its worst nightmare hurricane _ a massive
storm that could sit overhead for days, driving Lake Pontchartrain
over its levees and submerging the city.
	   ``We're just waiting for the trigger to be pulled,'' said Lt.
Col. Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana State Police.
	   Thousands didn't wait for Hurricane Georges to arrive. They
fled, turning Interstates 10 and 55 into bumper-to-bumper
processions. More than 1.5 million people were ordered or urged to
leave New Orleans and coastal areas.
	   The storm, with sustained wind of 110 mph (177 kph), was
expected to smash the Gulf Coast late Sunday or early Monday.
	   Intermittent downpours started Saturday night. Waves crossed
beachfront roads in Mississippi, including four-lane U.S. 90.
Twenty-five-foot (Eight-meter) waves clipped off fishing piers
along Alabama's coast. High surf on top of a 5-foot (1 1/2-meter)
storm surge threatened to undermine the foundations of beachfront
homes on barrier islands along the Florida Panhandle.
 &UR; CUBA: Castro says speedy hurricane evacuation saved many from
death
	   HAVANA (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said in comments broadcast
Sunday that the speedy evacuation of hundreds of thousands of
people probably saved many from dying during Hurricane Georges'
march across Cuba last week.
	   ``The first victory was to reduce the losses,'' Castro said in
government broadcasts of a Friday night ceremony honoring
neighborhood block leaders.
	   According to the government, five people died when Georges cut
across Cuba on Thursday and Friday. The hurricane killed more than
300 people in its rampage through the Caribbean.
	   In Havana, activities were back to normal on Sunday, two days
after schools and the airport were closed and public transportation
was suspended while heavy rains and winds lashed the capital. By
Sunday afternoon, skies were sunny and the winds were gone.
	   Castro told leaders of the Committees for the Defense of the
Revolution that the government must help the thousands left
homeless and assess agricultural damage.
 &UR; HAITI: Destitute farmers say flooding could have been avoided
	   BOURDETTE TI-PLACE, Haiti (AP) _ The floodwaters are receding in
Haiti's breadbasket, the Artibonite Valley, but the anger is
mounting.
	   Impoverished farmers in the central rice-growing valley long
warned of disaster if the government didn't clear silt-clogged
irrigation canals. Haiti's officials listened and did nothing, and
disaster struck.
	   Hurricane Georges dumped 20 inches (50 cm) of rain into Haiti's
central mountains last week, unleashing a terrestrial tidal wave
across the valley that swamped villages, killed dozens and left
untold numbers missing.
	   Haiti's official death toll stood at 87 but was all but certain
to rise, the government said Sunday.
	   Some 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of tomato, onion, eggplant
and rice fields disappeared under chest-high water _ leaving the
Western Hemisphere's poorest nation more dependent than ever on
foreign emergency aid.
	   ``I personally warned government authorities that this would
happen,'' an angry Oreste Jean-Baptiste, 40, said as he churned
through the muddy lanes of the delta hamlet of Bourdette Ti-Place.
 &UR; HAITI: Grenade explodes outside Haitian legislature building
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded in the
parking lot of the Haitian legislature Saturday night, damaging
some vehicles but causing no injuries, the head of the body's lower
house said Sunday.
	   The explosion occurred around midnight, and there was no damage
to the building, said chamber of deputies president Vasco
Thernelan.
	   ``The political situation is tense, but it doesn't seem the
terrorists were really determined to wreak havoc,'' he said.
	   Haiti has been without fully effective government since June
1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest elections
he alleges were rigged in favor of the political party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
	   The deadlock caused by Smarth's majority party and Aristide's
parliamentary allies has prevented the installation of a new
government since then.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Relief supplies, U.S. delegation arrive
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The U.S. hurricane
relief effort for the Dominican Republic gained steam Sunday,
including tons of bottled water and plastic tarps for thousands of
struggling storm victims.
	   The United States shipped about dlrs 500,000 worth of supplies,
including enough plastic sheeting to roof 15,000 homes. More was
coming, said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster relief for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   At least six U.S. military helicopters were due Monday to carry
relief supplies and help rescuers reach towns cut off by flooding,
downed bridges and debris-choked roads, Parmer said.
	   Chopper crews planned to fly rescuers to San Juan de Maguana,
120 miles (192 kilometers) west of the capital, where 76 bodies
were recovered on Thursday. Half the town, Parmer said, was
underwater or buried in mud.
	   ``These people aren't getting much of anything as of now,'' he
said.
	   More than 200 people were killed and 100,000 made homeless when
Hurricane Georges struck the Dominican Republic on Tuesday.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Hurricane leaves houseboat community in question
	   KEY WEST, Florida (AP) _ Hurricane Georges may have settled a
persistent debate about whether the small island at the southern
tip of the continental United States should have a neighborhood of
houseboats.
	   When the hurricane tore through the Florida Keys Friday, it
spared little of what used to be known as Houseboat Row, a flotilla
of 26 houseboats moored on Key West's southeast end.
	   A day later, all but four of the boats had sunk, were sinking,
or had been smashed apart.
	   ``What the politicians couldn't do in 10 years, Georges did in
10 hours,'' said Larry Tinkler, who returned after the hurricane to
the Tenacity, a peach-colored floating home he shared with a
roommate.
	   City officials have conducted an on-and-off effort to abolish
Houseboat Row for years. The first houseboat moored there in 1957.
Others followed, and eventually the Row had electricity, garbage
pickup and phone service.
	   In the 1970s, the Outlaws motorcycle gang took over one boat in
the floating neighborhood, named it the Proud Mary, and held wild
parties that helped prompt the city's crusade against the houseboat
dwellers.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: New Englanders from Caribbean help hurricane
victims
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Connecticut's Hispanic community
banded together this weekend to raise money, food and clothing to
aid people in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and other
Caribbean islands ravaged by Hurricane Georges.
	   Hispanics living in the New Haven area collected money, food and
other supplies, in some cases going door-to-door in search of aid.
They raised about dlrs 10,000 Saturday and planned to continue
their efforts for the next few weeks.
	   Two rooms at the Latino Youth Development offices were packed
with food, water and clothing for the hurricane victims. Some of
the donations came from food drives at city schools.
	   ``There is so much food here it is unbelievable,'' said
organizer Daniel Diaz.
	   Organizers are making arrangements with the Connecticut-based
AmeriCares relief organization to fly the goods to Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic within the next two weeks.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: All eyes on Sosa in his hurricane-battered
hometown
	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Christian
Vallenilla, 11, picked up a wooden stick Sunday, said, ``This one's
for Sammy,'' and smacked his third home run of the day in the
stadium where Sammy Sosa used to play.
	   No matter that Sosa, the Chicago Cubs slugger, failed to homer
in the Cubs' 4-3 loss to Houston Sunday. Sosa's hurricane-ravaged
hometown of San Pedro de Macoris celebrated his remarkable regular
season, one that produced 66 home runs, just short of Mark
McGwire's mind-boggling 70.
	   ``We can't ask for any more, because he's done a lot already.
He's broken a lot of records,'' said Arizmendi Nunez, a 22-year-old
San Pedro bartender. ``I feel proud because now our flag is raised
high.''
	   Georges nearly destroyed the stadium where Christian was playing
his his friends Sunday. Lighting towers twisted to the ground,
girders stretched skyward where the roof used to be, and people
draped their soiled laundry over the bleachers to dry.
	   The outfield wall is gone, and Christian's house, itself
half-flattened by the hurricane, now has a direct view of home
plate.

Newspaper: Congolese planes drop bombs on Ugandan village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Ugand (AP) _ Congolese military planes bombed a village
in western Uganda, and Ugandan army troops were sent immediately to
the area, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The government-owned New Vision said several high-flying
aircraft Sunday hit Bukaka village outside Bundibugyo, about 380
kilometers (235 miles) west of Kampala.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from Ugandan
military authorities.
	   ``After dropping the bombs, the planes retreated to the Congo. I
think such attacks are intended to provoke us into action, but we
have to study the situation,'' the newspaper quoted an unnamed
military official as saying.
	   Congo accuses Uganda and Rwanda of backing rebels who are trying
to unseat President Laurent Kabila.
	   Uganda acknowledges that under an agreement signed earlier this
year between Kabila and President Yoweri Museveni it has at least
two batallions in eastern Congo to ward off attacks on Uganda by
Ugandan rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces.
	   There have been unconfirmed reports that ADF rebels and former
Rwandan Hutu militimen and soldiers are being trained by Congo.
	   Budibugyo is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Congolese
border on a spur of the Rwenzori Mountains that juts into Congo.

Israel played role in U.N. weapons check in Iraq, inspector says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors were given key information
by Israel, starting in 1994, about how Iraq conceals its weapons
programs, a former inspector said in an interview Monday.
	   The inspector, Scott Ritter, quit his job as a member of the
U.N. Special Commission last month, saying the United States and
Britain systematically undermined efforts to get to the bottom of
Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``I can honestly say if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort,'' Ritter told the Haaretz daily, adding
that he has visited Israel several times in recent years.
	   ``The U.S. treated concealment more as an academic exercise, and
I thought Israel treated it as it is -- a matter of life and
death,'' Ritter said.
	   Ritter said he was unable to obtain concealment information from
the Central Intelligence Agency or other U.S. offices.
	   A week after leaving his post, Ritter testified before Congress
that the Clinton administration deliberately blocked UNSCOM's
efforts in order to avoid confrontation with Iraq. U.S. Secretary
of State Madeline Albright denies the charge.
	   Ritter said that Iraq would be able to reconstitute its
biological and chemical weapons capability and deliver a weapon of
mass destruction within six months of the end of U.N. weapons
inspections.

BELGRADE: surrender weapons.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council threatened additional
action if Milosevic does not stop the seven-month crackdown against
ethnic Albanians and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic fails to comply.
	   The Security Council has been insisting since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from the province
and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the majority
Albanian province.
	   There was no comment from Kosovo Albanian leaders on the
premier's statement.

Philippine stocks rise on U.S. rate cut hopes; index up 1.2 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose Monday as
hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates overpowered concerns over
Philippine Airlines' closure, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 15.04 points,
or 1.2 percent, to 1,230.50 after falling 4.79 points Friday.
	   Dealers said the market reacted positively to news that Cathay
Pacific Airways has begun flying domestic routes in the Philippines
to fill a vacuum left by the closure of national carrier Philippine
Airlines last Wednesday.
	   ``The main concern last week was the impact of the airline's
closure on domestic growth. Cathay's entry eases this concern,''
said Ricardo Puig, research head at Kim Eng Securities.
	   Puig said expectations that U.S. interest rates may be cut
Tuesday also helped support Philippine share prices.
	   Takeover speculation continued to bolster Philippine Long
Distance Telephone, which once again was the day's most actively
traded stock.
	   Traders attribute the stock's gains to bargain hunting on recent
losses related to a delay in the company's shareholders' rights
plan to deter a hostile takeover.
	   The stock is expected to remain volatile until the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules on whether the company can implement
the plan.
	   Although the possibility of a U.S. interest rate cut has been
discounted by many participants, traders expect an actual cut will
help the market improve.
	   ``We will see a further uptick when foreign funds come in as a
result of the rate cut,'' said Joey Roxas, president of Eagle
Securities.
	   Gainers outpaced losers 52 to 20, while 41 issues remained
unchanged.
	   Among the losers were Air Philippines, which succumbed to
profit-taking after more than tripling its share price in recent
days following improved earnings prospects with the closure of
Philippine Airlines.
	   In currency trading, the peso closed lower against the dollar on
brisk corporate demand for the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.890 pesos for the day, up from Friday's
average of 43.669 pesos. It was last traded at 43.940 pesos, close
to its intraday high of 43.960 pesos.
	   Traders said the peso didn't break the psychologically important
level of 44 pesos to the dollar because there were no buyers at
this rate.
	   Traders said the possibility of a U.S. interest rate cut
prevented the peso from weakening further, as some participants
expect a cut would bring more foreign funds to the Philippines and
other countries in the region.

Pakistani opposition demands probe into corruption charges against
</HEADLINE>
Sharif &QL; 
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistani opposition parties on Monday
demanded Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif be investigated following a
report in a British newspaper which accused him of tax evasion and
siphoning millions of dollars from his country's coffers into
personal bank accounts.
	   ``Sharif is corrupt and should be thrown out of power,'' Munawar
Hasan, general secretary of the opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami
told The Associated Press.
	   ``After this report the prime minister should resign, otherwise
people will throw him out and take back every penny he plundered
from the national wealth,'' he said.
	   The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper, quoted a report
prepared by the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency which said
the Sharif family was involved in tax evasion, loan defaults and
has ``phantom'' bank accounts. It did not say what these accounts
were.
	   Sharif's assets include four apartments in London's exclusive
Mayfair district, worth more than 3 million pounds (dlrs 5.0
million), while accounts and companies controlled by the prime
ministers' family have been found to contain more than dlrs 70
million, The Observer said in its Sept 27 issue.
	   The 200-page report was given to the newspaper by FIA's former
second-in-command, Rehman Malik.
	   Malik was arrested soon after Sharif returned to power, a move
that came as apparent reprisal for his investigations of graft
charges against Sharif during his first term. Malik was later
released and fled to London in June after an assassination attempt.
	   In Islamabad, a government spokesman dismissed the allegations
as ``wild, incorrect and malicious,'' while Sharif's son, Hasan
Nawaz, said the report was baseless. There was no immediate comment
from Sharif.
	   Meanwhile, Naseerullah Babar, former interior minister during
Benazir Bhutto's government told The Associated Press the report
came as no surprise.
	   ``Whatever has come in The Observer is just the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said. ``We had almost completed investigations
against him, but then our government was sacked,'' Babar said.
	   ``There is extensive proof that Sharif siphoned off millions of
dollars from the country to buy property abroad.''
	   There are several corruption cases against Sharif pending in the
courts, he said, adding that Sharif had used his influence to
suppress them.
	   ``A criminal case should be initiated against Sharif on the
basis of this report,'' he said.
	   Former prime minister Bhutto, who is also accused of graft and
abuse of power, has demanded that an opposition senator be
appointed to probe these allegations.
	   The Observer report comes as a blow to a Sharif government
facing an economic breakdown and growing opposition over a proposed
constitutional amendment that would introduce strict Islamic laws.
	   Sharif, scion of a rich business family, first became prime
minister in 1990. But his government was dismissed halfway through
his five-year term in 1993 on charges of corruption.
	   The Sharif family's wealth is built around steel, paper, sugar
and textile mills and his business empire rose astronomically
during 1980s and 1990s when he was in power.

	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   Milosevic's crackdown against militant separatists in Kosovo
started seven months ago. Some 275,000 people have been displaced
by the fighting and hundreds killed.
	   Despite the warnings, government forces launched a new offensive
late Saturday in an area about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest
of the Kosovo capital Pristina.
	   Serb sources in Pristina said Monday that fighting continued
overnight, in the region where rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters seemed to have regrouped following a rout earlier this
year.
	   On Sunday, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb
forces were attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva
Reka, Urosevac and Stimlje. The attack reportedly focused on 11
villages, and three were on fire. An estimated 15,000 civilians
have begun leaving the area.
	   Police sources said the rebels recently kidnapped two Serbs,
which prompted the new action.

	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council threatened additional
action if Milosevic does not stop the seven-month crackdown against
ethnic Albanians and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic fails to comply.
	   The Security Council has been insisting since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from the province
and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the majority
Albanian province.
	   There was no comment from Kosovo Albanian leaders on the

Israel played role in U.N. weapons check in Iraq, inspector says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.N. arms inspectors were given key information
by Israel, starting in 1994, about how Iraq conceals its weapons
programs, a former inspector said in an interview Monday.
	   The inspector, Scott Ritter, quit his job as a member of the
U.N. Special Commission last month, saying the United States and
Britain undermined efforts to uncover Iraq's arsenal of weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``I can honestly say if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort,'' Ritter told the Haaretz daily, adding
that he has visited Israel several times in recent years.
	   ``The U.S. treated concealment more as an academic exercise, and
I thought Israel treated it as it is -- a matter of life and
death,'' Ritter said.
	   Ritter said he was unable to obtain concealment information from
the Central Intelligence Agency or other U.S. offices.
	   A week after leaving his post, Ritter testified before Congress
that the Clinton administration deliberately blocked UNSCOM's
efforts in order to avoid confrontation with Iraq. U.S. Secretary
of State Madeline Albright denies the charge.
	   Ritter said Iraq would be able to reconstitute its biological
and chemical weapons capability and deliver a weapon of mass
destruction within six months of the end of U.N. weapons
inspections.

Dutch police hunt hooligans after post-match riot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) _ Police were Monday hunting the
leaders of a gang of hooligans responsible for the worst outbreak
of violence at a Dutch soccer match this season.
	   About 800 fans of FC Utrecht went on the rampage Sunday night
after their team slumped to a 3-0 home defeat at the hands of FC
Twente Enschede.
	   A police press release described the rioting as ``a low point in
the soccer history of Utrecht.''
	   Seven police officers and six Twente fans were injured in
post-match fighting. Two of the injured police had to be treated in
hospital _ one for a broken jaw and the other for a back injury.
	   One fan was hospitalized with a serious head injury after
Utrecht fans stoned the bus he was travelling in.
	   The hooligans also wrecked five police cars and tore down street
lights and traffic signs during the rioting. Police made no arrests
on the night because of the intensity of the violence.
	   In recent seasons Utrecht fans have shed their image of being
among the most violent of Dutch supporters and Sunday's outburst
took police by surprise.
	   ``This was totally unexpected,'' spokeswoman Liesbeth Tettero
said. Police had deployed 90 officers to control crowds at the
match, which was not considered a high-risk encounter meriting
beefed-up security.
	   Dutch police and soccer authorities are working hard to stamp
out hooliganism ahead of the Euro 2000 soccer championships which
are being co-hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium.

August hotel occupancy edges higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In an encouraging sign for the territory's
tourism industry, hotel occupancy rose in August compared with the
same month last year, tourism officials said Monday.
	   Hotel occupancy increased to 79 percent, compared with 66
percent last August, a report by the Hong Kong Tourist Association
said. Occupancy in August also was slightly higher than July's 76
percent.
	   Although the rates are high by international standards, Hong
Kong hotels' occupancy rates were as high as 91 percent before the
handover.
	   ``It's good that hotel rates are coming down to competitive
levels, that is good for tourism,'' said association spokesman
Peter Randall.
	   After tourists flocked to Hong Kong to get a last glimpse of the
British colony before it reverted to Chinese rule last July,
arrivals fell sharply and steadily through June this year.
	   Occupancy in the first eight months averaged 73 percent,
compared with 78 percent in the same period last year.
	   Hotels have slashed rates by up to 50 percent to attract
tourists to the territory, which has become expensive compared to
other Asian destinations, where local currencies have depreciated
by up to 70 percent.
	   The Hong Kong dollar is the only fully convertible Asian
currency not to have lost value since the Asian financial crisis
unfolded last July.

U.S., Italian defense ministers urge Serbs end violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on Monday
renewed threats of a NATO airstrike unless Serb forces end their
offensive in the embattled province of Kosovo.
	   At a joint news conference with Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta, Cohen said the planning for airstrikes was
completed.
	   Both he and Andreatta urged Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic yet again to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict
with ethnic Albania rebels in Kosovo.
	   Cohen said that ``a very strong, credible threat must be made to
Mr. Milosevic to back away from what he is currently doing, that he
should pull his military back, his police back to
allow...humanitarian missions...and to sit down at the bargaining
table to peacefully resolve the issue of Kosovo.''
	   NATO has set no deadline, but Cohen and Andreatta spoke of the
onset of winter and the hardships it would mean for refugees hiding
out in Kosovo's countryside.
	   Cohen said some 50,000 people ``run the risk of either starving
to death or freezing to death.''
	   ``Winter is coming and we are pressed for time,'' Andreatta
said.
	   Later Monday, the Serb government appeared to set the stage for
bowing to NATO demands. It said the rebels had been defeated and
special police units would return to barracks _ a condition
demanded by the Americans and Europeans to avoid NATO attack.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties plan more talks
Monday aimed at forming a new government after sealing an apparent
victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their intent to
unite.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the opposition Party of the Democratic Left,
acknowledged Sunday after the release of unofficial results touched
off immediate dickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is released
Monday night or Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as
minority leader in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   Officials of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, or HZDS,
denied the 56-year-old premier would quit, and maintained they
still hope to form a majority coalition in Parliament.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties met Sunday and
reiterated their intent to form a governing coalition after results
indicated they won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament. They said
more negotiations are needed to firm it up.
	   The Slovak Democratic Coalition won 26 percent, good for 42
parliament seats, according to the unofficial results. The other
three opposition parties _ the Party of the Democratic Left, the
Hungarian Coalition Party and the Party of Civic Understanding,
reflecting a wide variety of positions _ got another 32 percent to
earn 51 seats.
	   Finishing ahead of all 16 other parties will give Meciar the
first crack at forming a governing coalition. But the HZDS' sharp
decline in support since 1994 elections, coupled with that of its
current coalition partners, leaves it with slim hopes to form a
majority.
	   ``Slovakia has voted for change,'' top opposition leader Mikulas
Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said Sunday.
``The opposition has won a constitutional majority.''
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.
	   Referring to Meciar. the Budapest daily Nepszabadsag said ``the
man who failed in the ... elections has left an ugly legacy for
Slovakia.''
	   ``If `Vlado' remains in power, the semi-democracy and the
unbridled crony-privatization will continue, Slovakia will never
get into NATO and the EU, and will become a pariah just like
Yugoslavia,'' the newspaper said.
	   Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi told the MTI news
agency that the new government will be a step forward for
Slovakia's democratic development and commitment to Western
integration.

Afghanistan's newest refugees are expelled aid workers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Like the refugees they often serve,
foreign aid workers forced to leave Afghanistan are stuck outside
``their'' country wondering when they can return.
	   And like the Afghan refugees crowding into the mud hut camps
around this rough Pakistani border town, the mood among the foreign
volunteers ranges from despair to determination.
	   ``As long as the people _ the individuals _ in Afghanistan have
faith in us, and we have faith in them, we will do everything
possible to return,'' said Ingemar Anderson of the Swedish
Committee for Afghanistan.
	   Other aid workers, however, said morale had hit ``rock bottom''
since the foreigners left Afghanistan two months ago.
	   The hard-line Taliban religious army that controls most of
Afghanistan expelled about 200 aid workers for 38 humanitarian
groups on July 20 after they refused to move into war-damaged
college dormitories.
	   Most others, including U.N. staff, fled after American cruise
missiles slammed into suspected terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan on Aug. 8, bringing a backlash against all foreigners.
Only the Red Cross' foreign staff remained, but it was drastically
reduced.
	   Humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, devastated by 20 years of war,
includes food, fresh water programs, health care, schools, books
and even soccer balls to give children born into war a hint of life
in peacetime.
	   ``For the moment projects are continuing with local staff,''
said Sarah Russell, a worker for UNOCA, a U.N. agency coordinating
aid to Afghanistan.
	   ``It can continue for a while, but we are sort of in a state of
limbo,'' she added.
	   Some organizations fear financing will dry up unless foreign
staffers return to Afghanistan, although for now most donor nations
seem willing to keep helping.
	   ``I think, for the aid community, this is very much a time of
reflection,'' said Charles MacFadden of ACBAR, which also
coordinates aid efforts for Afghanistan. ``People are looking at
what they have been doing in Afghanistan, and what they are going
to do.''
	   The United Nations is discussing the possible return of aid
workers, and many other groups are waiting to follow its lead.
Talks between the United Nations and private groups also seek
better coordination of aid programs.
	   ``The security of national and international staff are the
highest priority,'' said Russell.
	   One U.N, aid worker was killed and another wounded in
Afghanistan last month after the U.S. missile attack, and Afghans
are still angry about the strike.
	   In addition, Iran has massed troops on its border with
Afghanistan in anger over the killing of 10 Iranians by Taliban
militiamen last month, raising fears of an Iranian invasion.
	   So foreign aid workers wait in Peshawar, keeping a low profile
because of intense anti-American sentiment in Pakistan over the
missile attack on Afghanistan. Others languish in Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital. Still others have taken extended leave or have
left for good.
	   Oddvind Forbord of the Norwegian Afghanistan Committee said his
two-year contract expired in May, but so far no replacement has
been named. The walls of his rented house are stripped of pictures,
hinting at his eagerness to pack up and move on.
	   ``I am exhausted,'' Forbord said, saying Afghanistan ``is just
as bad now as it was in 1981.''
	   The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have kept
their expatriate staffers in Afghanistan, sending 60 trucks a week
from Peshawar and flying in supplies in a dlrs 60 million-a-year
aid effort.
	   ``But we decided to sharply reduce the number of expats,'' said
Terry Dessimoz, the Red Cross administrator in Peshawar.
	   CARE International withdrew its six foreign staffers and now
fights starvation among 11,000 war widows and their families in
Kabul through a network of local Afghans.
	   Asef Rahimi, an Afghan working for CARE in Peshawar, is
optimistic conditions will improve soon in Afghanistan and foreign
aid workers will be able to return.
	   ``The general mood in Kabul is that the Taliban will begin to
show more flexibility, mainly because they have control of most of
the country,'' he said. ``They will be under more and more pressure
to take on responsibility as a government.''

Share prices surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong surged Monday on
expectations of a cut in U.S. interest rates.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 244.43 points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 7,946.04. On Friday,
the index had slumped 133.00 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.16 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
661 million), up from Friday's 4.41 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 565 million).
	   Brokers said investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve Open
Market Committee to cut interest rates at its meeting on Tuesday.
	   A cut would ease pressure on Hong Kong interest rates, because
the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency means interest
rates here usually track U.S. rates.
	   A rate cut in Hong Kong will help slow the shrinkage of the
economy, brokers said.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 1.20 Hong Kong dollars to
27.10, and Cheung Kong rose 1.10 dollars to 35.50.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 5.50 dollars to
145.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.60 dollars to 48.80.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 1.75 dollars to 24.80, and
Cathay Pacific rose 70 cents to 7.55.

Pricey vegetable seeds deal puts government in hot water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Ministry of Agriculture poverty
alleviation program has turned into a political battle as the
leading opposition party questioned the government over its costs,
a party spokesman said Monday.
	   Chief spokesman for the New Aspiration Party Suraporn
Danaitangtrakool said his party will demand to know why vegetable
seeds were purchased from Taiwan and Japan at four times the local
prices.
	   ``We will hit the government hard if allegations (of corruption)
are proved true,'' the party's leader Chavalit Yonchaiyudh was
quoted in The Nation newspaper Monday as saying.
	   The 254 million baht (dlrs 6.2 million) project was designed to
help 2 million villagers, many suffering from the economic crisis,
grow their own vegetables from seeds distributed by the government.
	   Deputy Agriculture Minister Wirat Rattanaset told reporters
Monday he was prepared to defend the deal against any charges from
the opposition. He denied any wrongdoing.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has ordered the minister of
agriculture to investigate the allegations, according to The
Nation.
	   The questionable purchases came to public attention after
unsigned leaflets were distributed at the ministry alleging
corruption.
	   The allegation has threatened to become a new scandal for the
government of Chuan, who in the past week witnessed resignations of
the public health minister and his deputy over corruption scandals
at government hospitals.

Austria's Lauda Air plans service to Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's Lauda Air plans three flights a
week next year between Vienna and Hong Kong, the firm announced
Monday. The service will begin next summer.
	   The company said it has not decided whether to use a Boeing 767
or Boeing 777 aircraft for the service. If the former is used, the
flight will stop in Bangkok, Thailand before heading on to the
former British colony.
	   If the firm decides to use the Boeing 777, the flight will be
non-stop between Vienna and Hong Kong with an onward connection to
Manila, Philippines.
	   The company said its founder, former race car driver Niki Lauda,
has long wanted to initiate service to the Philippines.

Prosecutors demand heavy prison terms for former Kia officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors requested a 12-year prison
term Monday for a former head of bankrupt Kia Motors Co. on charges
of embezzling 52.3 billion won (dlrs 37 million) in company funds.
	   Prosecutors also sought prison terms of up to seven years for
four other top Kia officials for alleged involvement in the
bribes-for-loan scandal.
	   Kim Sun-hong, who headed the nation's second largest carmaker
until last October, was accused of embezzling company money to
bribe politicians and government officials to take out bank loans
and keep the financially shaky company afloat.
	   Kim also was accused of illegally arranging for Kia to guarantee
350 billion won (dlrs 250 million) in debt incurred by several of
its financially troubled subsidiaries and illegally to lend 1.1
trillion won (dlrs 814 million) to other units.
	   Kia collapsed under 11 trillion won (dlrs 8 billion) in bad bank
loans in the summer of last year. Its failure eroded foreign
investor confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.
	   ``Heavy punishment is needed as the defendants weakened the
finance of Kia by taking out large loans through forged accounting
books and caused a huge damage to the economy,'' senior prosecutor
Lee Myong-jae said.
	   Prosecutors earlier said South Korea's troubles spun out of
control when the government failed to unload Kia quickly after its
collapse.
	   South Korea was forced to call in the International Monetary
Fund to bail out its battered economy in December.

Shots fired at Israeli students in Hebron, one injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details on shooting, CORRECTS that
injured was a female student, not seminary student &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shots were fired Monday at a group of
Israeli students in downtown Hebron, and one girl was lightly
injured, Jewish settlers and Israeli radio reports said.
	   Settler spokesman Noam Arnon said the students were headed
toward the Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida when shots were fired at
them from the Palestinian-controlled part of town.
	   Israel radio said one female student was shot in the leg.
	   Tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron rose
considerably last month after a settler rabbi was stabbed to death
in his home in Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers in the
heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. The assailant, presumably a
Palestinian militant, was never caught.
	   In response, settlers overturned stalls in outdoor markets and
beat up Palestinian passers-by on several occasions.
	   Hebron is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
In January 1997, Israeli troops handed 80 percent of the city to
Palestinian control, but remained in the downtown area to protect
the settler enclaves.

Cambodian resistance general waits for political settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The leader of Cambodian resistance
forces lodged in the jungles along the Thai-Cambodian border said
Monday his troops will remain patient while talks for a new
government continue.
	   Speaking by telephone from Bangkok, Gen. Nhek Bunchhay said he
met Sunday with opposition party leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and agreed that no new military actions would be instigated by his
heavily outgunned resistance fighters.
	   ``We want to wait and see if there is a political solution,''
said the general. ``We don't want to resort to military means.''
	   Nhek Bunchhay fled the capital of Phnom Penh last year after
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a
violent coup.
	   He formed an armed resistance in northern Cambodia to oppose Hun
Sen's more powerful army.
	   Under a barrage of artillery, his forces managed stubbornly to
cling to a northern border post for eight months. It is unclear how
many troops he still has under his command.
	   Nhek Bunchhay agreed early this year to a cease-fire with the
government, paving the way for Ranariddh's return to Phnom Penh to
participate in July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority in the
July polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a government on
his own.
	   Hun Sen's party will enter negotiations with Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC _ which won 43 of 122 seats in the National Assembly _ on
Tuesday. He hopes to form a bipartite coalition with his former
battlefield foe.
	   Nhek Bunchhay's future was briefly discussed at a Monday meeting
of FUNCINPEC party in Phnom Penh, according to a party spokesman.
	   FUNCINPEC officials reaffirmed their commitment to seek a pardon
for Nhek Bunchhay, said spokesman Noranaridh Ananda Yath.
	   Nhek Bunchhay, along with Ranariddh and fellow resistance
commander Serey Kosal, was convicted in absentia at a show trial
earlier this year on charges of conspiring to overthrow the
government.
	   The prince was given a pardon by his father King Norodom
Sihanouk a few months before the election, but Nhek Bunchhay and
Serey Kosal were not.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties prepared for more
talks Monday in their search for a new government after sealing an
apparent victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their
intent to unite.
	   But the search is likely to run through weeks of political
friction, following results that keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the opposition Party of the Democratic Left,
acknowledged Sunday after the release of unofficial results touched
off immediate bickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained absent from view since voting Friday at the
start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a stunning change
in figures when the official vote count is released Monday night or
Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as minority leader
in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   Officials of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, or HZDS,
said the 56-year-old premier would not quit. They said they still
hope to form a majority coalition in Parliament.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties met Sunday and
reiterated their intent to form a governing coalition after results
indicated they won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament.
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.

in figures when the official vote count is released Monday night or
Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as minority leader
in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   Officials of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, or HZDS,
said the 56-year-old premier would not quit. They said they still
hope to form a majority coalition in Parliament.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties met Sunday and
reiterated their intent to form a governing coalition after results
indicated they won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament.
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.

Germany's future chancellor Schroeder must now form government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's designated new
chancellor, started talks Monday with the environmental Greens
party about joining his Social Democrats in a coalition government
after ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl in sweeping vote for change.
	   The Social Democratic victory marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all the parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   In a stinging humiliation for the West's longest-serving leader,
Kohl and his Christian Democrats won just 35 percent of the vote,
which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it held in the
old parliament.
	   Now it's up to Schroeder _ whose Social Democrats won 41 percent
of the vote _ to make good on pledges to end unemployment, stuck
above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told the national ZDF television network
Monday.
	   The Social Democrats held informal talks overnight with the
Greens, which won 6.7 percent, and were to enter what could be
tough negotiations between two parties with some sharp policy
differences.
	   Though eager for their first shot at entering government, the
Greens warned the Social Democrats not to try to shore up a new
government by bringing in other parties, for example, the liberal
Free Democrats that were Kohl's junior coalition partners. They won
6.2 percent.
	   ``Our signal is clear: according to us there can only be
negotiations with one party,'' said one of the Greens' party
leaders, Heide Ruehle.
	   Schroeder said he would not approach the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism, which won enough votes to stay in parliament.
Many in the west view the party as a troubling remnant of the
former communist East German state.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens coalition would be the most radical in
postwar Germany and a test of the Greens' ability to curb their
sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more mainstream
party.
	   The Greens have proposed reforms that outrage some Germans and
amuse others: tripling gas prices to 5 marks (dlrs 3) per liter
over 10 years and introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) speed limit
on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy, immigration and defense
policy.
	   The Social Democrats' strong showing ruled out, at least for the
moment, sharing power with the Christian Democrats in a so-called
``grand coalition.''
	   The Christian Democrats general secretary, Peter Hintze, said
voters put his party in opposition, and that it could play more
active role as a conservative counterweight to the Social Democrats
center-left leanings.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens have won ``their turn'' at
government, he said. ``We can only hope that a large part of what
they're planning to do will not be achieved. That would be a big
problem for Germany.''
	   Kohl, 68, had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength
of his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and Kohl
conceded the race by announcing he would step down as the leader of
the party he has ruled with an iron fist since 1973.
	   The party said it would elect a new leader in early November.
Hintze declined to speculate on a successor, but Kohl has indicated
a preference for his protege, Wolfgang Schaeuble.
	   The Christian Democrats lost support in all of Germany's 16
states. Kohl even lost to the Social Democrats in his Rhine River
hometown of Ludwigshafen.
	   ``This is a hard evening for me, and for us all,'' Kohl said
Sunday night. ``... I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a
successful time in office.''
	   The new chancellor will be the first of his generation, rooted
in the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder, 54, will lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.

Shots fired at Israeli students in Hebron, one injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shots were fired Monday at a group of
Israeli students in downtown Hebron, and one suffered a gunshot
wound to the leg, Jewish settlers and Israeli radio reports said.
	   Settler spokesman Noam Arnon said the students were heading
toward the Jewish enclave of Tel Romeida when shots were fired at
them from the Palestinian-controlled part of town.
	   Israel radio said one female student was shot in the leg.
	   Tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron rose
considerably last month after a settler rabbi was stabbed to death
in his home in Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers in the
heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. The assailant was not caught.
	   In response, settlers overturned stalls in outdoor markets and
beat up Palestinian passers-by on several occasions.
	   Hebron is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
In January 1997, Israeli troops handed 80 percent of the city to
Palestinian control, but remained in the downtown area to protect
the settler enclaves.

Yeltsin meets with officials to complete Cabinet formation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Primakov saying government has paid debt
to military, details of debt restructuring plan in new three final
grafs. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has paid off its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces, and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday.
	   Since his appointment nearly three weeks ago, Primakov has
stressed that payment of salaries and pensions will be his
government's priority as it grapples with Russia's grave economic
crisis.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant earlier this
month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4 billion)
in back salaries and social payments. Of that sum, 3.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 233 million) was owed to the military.
	   Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin also focused on efforts to wrap
up formation of the new Cabinet _ a painful process that has
stretched into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats remain unfilled.
	   The Kremlin has had difficulty finding willing candidates.
Parliamentary deputy Vladimir Ryzhkov, who was appointed a deputy
premier while on a trip abroad, said he couldn't accept the job
because he lacks the necessary experience.
	   Alexander Shokhin, a centrist who was named to the key post of
deputy prime minister in charge of financial policy, resigned
Friday after just 10 days on the job.
	   He said he was quitting to protest the reappointment of Mikhail
Zadornov as finance minister. Shokhin held Zadornov responsible for
the previous Cabinet's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and
freeze domestic debt _ a controversial move that many blame for
fueling Russia's crisis.
	   Zadornov, a liberal reformer, defended himself over the weekend,
saying the former government had few viable alternatives. He
pledged to improve the terms of the government's debt repayment.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multibillion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the Cabinet for allegedly favoring Russian
banks.
	   No details of the restructuring plan have yet been released
officially. Shokhin said that under the plan, investors would be
able to redeem their defaulted treasury bills in rubles but the
proceeds would be frozen in special accounts for six months.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants left for meetings in
London with his counterparts from the Group of Seven industrialized
countries, who are discussing problems related to Russia's
financial crisis.
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis.
	   _ The amount of private bank deposits fell by 6.5 percent to
about 151 billion rubles (currently dlrs 10 billion) last month as
people scrambled to pull their money out of failing banks.

August trade deficit at five-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's trade deficit in August fell to a
five-year low as demand in Asia fell because of the regional
financial crisis, the government said Monday.
	   The trade deficit in August fell to 700 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 89.7 million), equivalent to 0.6 percent of the
value of imports, it said.
	   The deficit in August last year was 10.3 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.32 billion), or 7.4 percent of the value of
imports.
	   The value of exports fell by 8 percent last month to 119.1
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 15.27 billion) from the same
month last year, while imports decreased by 14.2 percent to 119.9
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 15.37 billion).
	   A partial air cargo ban imposed after the new airport opened
here in early July also exacerbated the trade decline, the
government statement said.
	   Computer and mechanical problems at the cargo terminal
jeopardized air cargo transport, which returned to full speed in
late August.
	   For the first eight months of 1998, exports fell 4.1 percent and
imports fell 8.6 percent, compared with the same period in 1997,
the statement said.
	   The trade deficit for the first eight months this year totaled
71.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 9.22 billion), compared
with last year's 121.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 15.5
billion).

Serb premier says Albanian `terrorism' has been defeated
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned the crackdown will resume if
Albanian separatists resume attacks.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to their barracks _ a condition
demanded by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO
attack.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   He said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo Albanians
who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as long as they have
not committed ``war crimes.''
	   Marjanovic also said the government would appoint a Temporary
Executive Council to ``strengthen civilian structures'' in the
province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the estimated 2
million population.
	   ``The forces that will be decreased by this move will stay ready
in their barracks for a while, just in case that creation of a
terrorist organization in any part of Kosovo is renewed,'' he said.
	   Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is
the nation's top priority _ a move that bolsters the position of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people in the southern province of Kosovo have been
killed and some 275,000 forced to flee their homes since
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians began seven months ago.
	   Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would withdraw to their
barracks and remain there for a while. He gave no timetable but
said the move was in accordance with an agreement Milosevic signed
in June with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``Armed terrorist groups have been defeated,'' Marjanovic told
Serbia's assembly today. ``Conditions have been made ... to
decrease engagement of anti-terrorist forces.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has been insisting since March that
Serbs withdraw special police units and other forces from the
province and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the
majority Albanian province.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against militant separatists
in Kosovo and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic failed to comply.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen added his voice to the
chorus Sunday, warning that Milosevic had only ``a short period of
time'' to comply with international demands to end the conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen said.
``A failure to do so on his part will be met with very strong NATO
action.''
	   There was no immediate comment from Kosovo Albanian leaders on
Marjanovic's statement. His comments appeared to give in to the
international community while at the same time maintaining an image
of defiance.
	   ``Terrorist gangs have been defeated and a great number of
terrorists have been arrested and disarmed and territory of Serbia
has been saved,'' Marjanovic said. ``We have showed decisively that
there is ... no compromise with those who want to create a new
state on Serbia's territory by terror and force.''
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   Serb force launched a new offensive late Saturday 50 kilometers
(30 miles) southwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. Serb
sources in Pristina said Monday that fighting continued overnight.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces
attacked from three directions Sunday near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje. The attack reportedly focused on 11 villages,
and three were on fire. An estimated 15,000 civilians were forced
to flee.
	   Police sources said the rebels recently kidnapped two Serbs,
which prompted the latest retaliation from Serb troops, which are
far stronger militarily than the rebels.

Schroeder to visit France first, amid concern over ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's future chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
said Monday he will make his first foreign trip to France in the
next 10 days to reassure a wary Paris he strongly backs the
Franco-German engine driving European unification.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance,'' Schroeder
said the day after his Social Democrats defeated Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's conservatives. ``And it will remain the most important for
Europe.''
	   France and Germany are each other's biggest trading partners and
are the main forces behind the euro single currency that takes
effect in January among 11 European nations.
	   But as Germany's first leader not to have lived through the
horrors of World War II, some French were concerned whether the
54-year-old Schroeder and the new German capital in Berlin will be
as committed as Kohl in rooting Germany into the European Union to
avoid future wars.
	   ``It's another generation coming to power, less sensitive to the
weight of the horrors of the past, because they didn't live them,''
said a front-page editorial in the conservative daily Le Figaro,
titled ``The Republic of Berlin.''
	   Schroeder insisted to French-based Europe 1 radio that his
personal ties with France were ``much better'' than the French
media think.
	   ``I would like the contacts between Germany and France, which at
the governmental level work very well and will remain very good, to
expand and reach the societies,'' Schroeder said.
	   The Social Democrat said he would respond quickly to an
invitation by President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin to visit Paris ``before the Bundestag election,'' meaning in
10 days ``at the latest.''
	   Schroeder rejected any possibility of renewed German
nationalism. ``There is no contradiction between the Germans and
the Europeans,'' he said. ``We will be very good Europeans, and
that's why we will be good Germans.''
	   The leader said he wanted the euro to be ``a success.'' He also
said he favored greater international financial cooperation as
proposed by U.S., British and French leaders.

Serb premier says Albanian `terrorism' has been defeated

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will restart if there are
new attacks by Albanian separatists.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to barracks _ a condition demanded
by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO attack.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   He said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo Albanians
who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as long as they have
not committed ``war crimes.''
	   Marjanovic also said the government would appoint a Temporary
Executive Council to ``strengthen civilian structures'' in the
province, where Albanians form 90 percent of the estimated 2
million population.
	   ``The forces that will be decreased by this move will stay ready
in their barracks for a while, just in case that creation of a
terrorist organization in any part of Kosovo is renewed,'' he said.
	   Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is
the nation's top priority _ a move that bolsters the position of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Hundreds of people in the southern province of Kosovo have been
killed and some 275,000 forced to flee their homes since
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians began seven months ago.
	   The U.N. Security Council has been insisting since March that
Serbs withdraw special police units and other forces from the
province and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the
majority Albanian province.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against militant separatists
in Kosovo and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic failed to comply.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen added his voice to the
chorus Sunday, warning that Milosevic had only ``a short period of
time'' to comply with international demands to end the conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen said.
``A failure to do so on his part will be met with very strong NATO
action.''
	   There was no immediate comment from Kosovo Albanian leaders on
Marjanovic's statement. His comments appeared to give in to the
international community while at the same time maintaining an image
of defiance.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.

Indonesian trade delegation visits Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Ilhan Habibie, son of Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie, arrived in Taiwan Monday as head of a delegation to
promote trade and investment, Taiwan's official news agency
reported.
	   The visit is sensitive because it risks angering China, which
views Taiwan as a renegade province. Indonesia has extended
diplomatic recognition to Beijing and has no formal ties with
Taiwan.
	   Taiwan's Foreign Ministry declined to provide any details on the
younger Habibie's trip. But the official Central News Agency said
he was to brief government officials on recent economic and
political reforms in Indonesia.
	   The elder Habibie came to power after street riots forced former
President Suharto to step down in May.
	   In Jakarta, an official of Taiwan's representative office said
the Indonesian delegation was scheduled to meet Taiwanese President
Lee Teng-hui and visit the state-run Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. to discuss possible cooperation.
	   Members of the delegation include James Riady, head of the
powerful Lippo Group, and other business executives, officials
said.

Pakistani opposition demands probe into corruption charges against

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistani opposition parties on Monday
demanded Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif be investigated following a
report in a British newspaper which accused him of tax evasion and
siphoning millions of dollars from his country's coffers into
personal bank accounts.
	   ``Sharif is corrupt and should be thrown out of power,'' Munawar
Hasan, general secretary of the opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami
told The Associated Press.
	   ``After this report the prime minister should resign, otherwise
people will throw him out and take back every penny he plundered
from the national wealth,'' he said.
	   The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper, quoted a report
prepared by the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency which said
the Sharif family was involved in tax evasion, loan defaults and
has ``phantom'' bank accounts. It did not say what these accounts
were.
	   Sharif's assets include four apartments in London's exclusive
Mayfair district, worth more than 3 million pounds (dlrs 5.0
million), while accounts and companies controlled by the prime
ministers' family have been found to contain more than dlrs 70
million, The Observer said in its Sept 27 issue.
	   The 200-page report was given to the newspaper by FIA's former
second-in-command, Rehman Malik.
	   Malik was arrested soon after Sharif returned to power, a move
that came as apparent reprisal for his investigations of graft
charges against Sharif during his first term. Malik was later
released and fled to London in June after an assassination attempt.
	   In Islamabad, a government spokesman dismissed the allegations
as ``wild, incorrect and malicious,'' while Sharif's son, Hasan
Nawaz, said the report was baseless. There was no immediate comment
from Sharif.
	   Meanwhile, Naseerullah Babar, former interior minister during
Benazir Bhutto's government told The Associated Press the report
came as no surprise.
	   ``Whatever has come in The Observer is just the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said. ``We had almost completed investigations
against him, but then our government was sacked,'' Babar said.
	   ``There is extensive proof that Sharif siphoned off millions of
dollars from the country to buy property abroad.''
	   There are several corruption cases against Sharif pending in the
courts, he said, adding that Sharif had used his influence to
suppress them.
	   ``A criminal case should be initiated against Sharif on the
basis of this report,'' he said.
	   Former prime minister Bhutto, who is also accused of graft and
abuse of power, has demanded that an opposition senator be
appointed to probe these allegations.
	   The Observer report comes as a blow to a Sharif government
facing an economic breakdown and growing opposition over a proposed
constitutional amendment that would introduce strict Islamic laws.
	   Sharif, scion of a rich business family, first became prime
minister in 1990. But his government was dismissed halfway through
his five-year term in 1993 on charges of corruption.
	   The Sharif family's wealth is built around steel, paper, sugar
and textile mills and his business empire rose astronomically
during 1980s and 1990s when he was in power.

Algerian prime minister pledges more privatizations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria's prime minister said Monday the
government was sticking to privatizations plans, assuring
disgruntled unions that they would be consulted along the way.
	   ``We will continue to implement reforms,'' Ahmed Ouyahia said
after marathon 19-hour talks with Abdelmadjid Sidi-Said, the head
of The General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA).
	   ``We will continue privatizations within the framework of the
law, transparently and with dialogue,'' he added.
	   Unemployment is growing in Algeria and many workers are not
happy about the government's plans to privatize state industries,
which will mean the loss of more jobs.
	   The UGTA, opposed to privatizations, had boycotted a meeting
with government officials on Sept. 9 and had threatened to call a
general strike.
	   It claims some 200,000 people have lost their jobs in three
years.
	   The UGTA, Algeria's only significant union, has worked
hand-in-hand with the government since 1992, so the strike threat
loomed as a rupture.
	   Sidi-Said said Monday he was ``globally satisfied'' with the
talks with the prime minister, but insisted they did not support
privatization. He did not mention the strike threats.
	   Earlier this year, more than 100,000 Algerian metal and steel
workers, mechanics and customs employees went on strike to protest
government plans to cut public jobs.

Former strongman leaves Myanmar for medical check-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Ne Win, who ruled the Southeast Asian
nation now known as Myanmar with an iron fist for nearly three
decades, has left the country for a medical check-up in Singapore,
diplomatic sources said Monday.
	   The country's longest ruling leader in modern times, Ne Win
served as head of state from 1962 to 1981, and as chairman of the
then ruling socialist party from 1981 to 1988.
	   Although still said to be powerful, the reins of military rule
were seized by a group of officers who brutally put down a
student-led uprising in 1988. The nation, formerly called Burma,
then became known as Myanmar.
	   Ne Win, 87, had his last examination a year ago after his visit
to Indonesia as guest of then President Suharto. Although
frequently reported to suffer various ailments, the secretive Ne
Win has proved resilient.
	   He first came to power in a military coup and managed to stay in
power for years despite the country's steady economic deterioration
and political isolation.

Phone company cuts direct line to Israel in bill dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's phone company said Monday it cut
its direct link with a subsidiary of Israel's state-owned Bezek
Telecom Co. because of a financial dispute.
	   Telephone service between the two countries continues, however,
via other carriers.
	   Ali Shukri, chairman of the Jordanian Telecommunications Co.,
said JTC earlier this month stopped the service provided to Bezek
International Ltd., a unit of BTC, because it had not paid a bill
of dlrs 5 million for 1997.
	   ``It has refused to pay the bill,'' Shukri said. He did not
elaborate.
	   Shukri added that Jordan now was routing phone calls to Israel
through a private Israeli firm, Golden Lines.
	   There was no immediate comment from Bezek, which apparently is
using a third country to connect calls to Jordan since it remains
possible to dial between the two countries.
	   The Jordanian Telecommunications Co. had been providing service
to Bezek _ including links not only to the Jewish state but to the
West Bank and Gaza Strip _ since Israel and Jordan signed a peace
treaty in 1994.
	   A phone call to Israel costs dlrs 1 per minute during working
hours, about the same amount as a call to neighboring Gulf states
and North Africa.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Thirty-four Albanian refugees have
forced their way into the Canadian embassy Monday demanding asylum,
the Hungarian state-run radio reported.
	   There are 18 adults and 16 children in the group, Hungarian
police spokesman Mihaly Dezsi told state radio.
	   If the negotiations fail, Hungarian refugee authorities have
indicated readiness to house the Albanians.
	   Embassy officials, engaged in negotiations with the refugees,
were not available for comment.
	   Hungarian police have sealed off the area around the embassy,
which is a fenced-in compound of two larger buildings in the hills
of Buda, a quiet residential part of the city.

Pro-democracy ``Parliament'' to repeal repressive laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A self-styled parliament set up by
Myanmar's pro-democracy opposition party but not recognized by the
ruling military announced Monday it had decided to repeal a number
of repressive laws.
	   A group of opposition figures called the Committee Representing
the Parliament said they had revoked ``repressive laws,'' including
the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act and a 1975 decree ``safeguarding
the state from the dangers of subversionists.''
	   But the military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma, has
denounced the group and is unlikely to pay much attention to any of
its decisions.
	   The government has refused to convene the nation's actual
Parliament, members of which were freely elected in 1990.
	   The 10-member committee, made up of supporters of the National
League for Democracy, met for the second time since it was formed
Sept. 16, according to a party statement.
	   Members include opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, eight senior
officials in her party and a delegate representing the country's
ethnic minorities.
	   At its first meeting, the committee proclaimed that all laws
passed by the military government since it came to power in 1988
were invalid because the violent takeover _ in which soldiers
gunned down thousands _ was illegal.

Cardinals win 7-6 over Expos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire ended his spectacular season as
mightily as he started it, hitting his record 69th and 70th homers
in the St. Louis Cardinals' final game, a 7-6 victory Sunday over
the Montreal Expos.
	   McGwire, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning, then broke a 3-all
tie in the seventh with a three-run shot off Carl Pavano (6-9).
	   McGwire moved four ahead of Sammy Sosa and ended nine in front
of Roger Maris' old record. McGwire also got his 162nd walk, tying
Ted Williams (1947 and '49) for the second-highest total ever
behind Babe Ruth's 170 in 1923.
	   John Frascatore (3-4) was the winner and Juan Acevedo got his
15th save.
 &UR; Astros 4, Cubs 3
	   In Houston, moments after another heartbreaking loss, Chicago
won a reprieve when San Francisco lost at Colorado, forcing a
tiebreaking wild-card playoff between the Cubs and Giants on Monday
night at Wrigley Field.
	   Carl Everett tripled off Rod Beck (3-4) leading off the 11th
when a retreating Sammy Sosa shied away from the ball as he reached
the warning track in right, and Richard Hidalgo hit a sacrifice
fly.
	   Sosa, who didn't homer, singled for his 158th RBI, fourth-best
in NL history. He also struck out, flied out twice and singled in
the eighth, finishing 2-for-5.
	   Scott Elarton (2-1) pitched two perfect innings.
 &UR; Rockies 9, Giants 8
	   In Denver, San Francisco wasted a 7-0 lead, watched Neifi Perez
hit a game-winning homer off Robb Nen (7-7) in the ninth inning
about a minute after the Cubs lost.
	   San Francisco and Chicago are both 89-73 heading into Monday's
tiebreaker.
	   The Giants, who trailed the Cubs by five games with 10 days left
in the season but closed with nine wins in 10 games, led 7-6 in the
seventh before Vinny Castilla hit a two-run homer off Julian
Tavarez. But the Giants came right back in the eighth and tied it
on Jeff Kent's solo homer off Pedro Astacio.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker went 2-for-4 and won his first batting
title with a .363 average, nine points ahead of New York's John
Olerud. Jerry Dipoto (3-4) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.
 &UR; Braves 7, Mets 2
	   In Atlanta, New York, which had a one-game lead in the NL
wild-card race going into their final five games and were still in
a three-way tie with two games to go, fell behind 5-0 and was
eliminated.
	   Contending for their first postseason appearance since 1988, the
Mets lost their final five games, scoring just seven runs in their
last 44 innings.
	   During three days in Atlanta, the Mets stranded 32 runners _ 11
on Sunday _ and left the bases loaded four times.
	   Greg Maddux (18-9) helped Atlanta to its 106 win, the most in
the NL since the Mets had 108 in 1986. Armando Reynosa (7-3) was
pounded for five runs and six hits in 1 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Marlins 6, Phillies 5
 &UR; Phillies 7, Marlins 3
	   In Miami, Ruben Amaro Jr., playing his final major league game
before becoming the Phillies' assistant general manager, singled
home the go-ahead run in the second game. Kevin Sefcik drove in a
career-high four runs for the Phillies in the opener.
	   The Marlins, who swept the Phillies on Saturday, finished at
54-108, the worst record in the majors since 1979, when Oakland
also dropped 108 and Toronto lost 109. The Marlins had the worst
record ever for a defending World Series champion, breaking the
previous low (74-88) set by the 1991 Cincinnati Reds.
	   Brian Meadows (11-13) allowed three runs and seven hits in five
innings in the opener and Antonio Alfonseca got one out for his
eighth save. Tyler Green (6-12) was the loser. Carlton Loewer (7-8)
won the second game and Rafael Medina (2-6) lost.
 &UR; Reds 4, Pirates 1
	   In Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Reds ended their season by putting
together the majors' first all-brother infield _ Barry and Stephen
Larkin, and Bret and Aaron Boone _ and won on Aaron Boone's
three-run homer.
	   Roberto Petagine hit a solo homer and Boone had a three-run shot
off Jose Silva (6-7) as Pittsburgh finished with an eight-game
losing streak.
	   Brett Tomko (13-14) gave up five hits and struck out seven in
his first complete game in 53 career starts.
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Brewers 1
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park (15-9) allowed one run and eight
hits in six innings for his career-high 15th win, and Mark
Grudzielanek drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly off
Bill Pulsipher (3-4). Jeff Shaw got three outs for his 48th save.
 &UR; Padres 3, Diamondbacks 2
	   In Phoenix, Greg Vaughn became the fourth player to hit 50
homers this season and Trevor Hoffman got his major league-leading
53rd save.
	   Vaughn broke a 1-all tie in the eighth with a two-run shot off
Aaron Small (3-1). Before this year, there had never been more than
two 50-homer players in a single season.
	   Hoffman got three straight outs for his 53rd save in 54 chances,
tying the NL saves record set by current teammate Randy Myers, who
did it for the Cubs in 1993. Matt Clement (2-0) got the win in
relief.

With Kohl defeated, concern shifts to new leader's policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Politicians of the left on Monday welcomed Gerhard
Schroeder's election triumph which ended 16 years of conservative
government under Helmut Kohl, claiming the result as fresh evidence
that the political tide was running their way.
	   ``It's a very positive result,'' said Deputy Prime Minister
Walter Veltroni, who said Schroeder was in the same center-left
mold as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   ``With Schroeder, Blair and Jospin, it gets easier ... for the
unemployment issue to enter full force in Europe's political
discussion,'' Veltroni said.
	   ``A new epoch is coming. Many countries have become much more
leftist in nature,'' said Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
	   ``A different Germany is born, but also a different Europe, full
of question marks,'' said the Italian daily newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe agreed on Schroeder's place in
the political spectrum but with a negative spin, calling him ``a
split-the-difference pragmatist'' in the mold of Blair and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``When it comes time to jump off the fence on actual policy
questions, on which side Mr. Schroeder will land is anyone's
guess,'' the Wall Street Journal Europe said in an editorial
Monday.
	   Schroeder declared that one thing wouldn't change: the
partnership between Germany and France as leaders of the European
Union.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance, and it will
remain the most important for Europe,'' said Schroeder, who said he
would make an official visit to France within 10 days.
	   In Australia, the end of 16 years of conservative government in
Germany was hailed by opposition leader Kim Beazley as evidence the
rest of the world was abandoning policies like those pursued by
Australia's conservative Prime Minister John Howard.
	   Beazley, who is campaigning to unseat Howard in an Oct. 3
national election, said Europeans were now looking to parties, like
his own, that were prepared to do something about unemployment.
	   ``Since the mid 1990s the people in Europe have been turning to
interventionist government policies,'' he said in a radio
interview. ``These days we've recognized that there are benefits
from a globalized economy and benefits from the free market, but
there are also casualties.''
	   Kohl, who had governed for 16 years, won warm praises.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Kohl ``has attained
historic achievements, such as the realization of German
unification and promotion of European integration.''
	   The Irish Times of Dublin said the election ``was notable for
the basic agreement on foreign policy matters between the main
parties, which is nonetheless important for that. Dr. Kohl's main
legacy will probably be seen as having successfully anchored German
national interests in such a European framework, making this seem a
normal state of affairs at a time when events could readily have
forged a different outcome.''
	   The Daily Telegraph of London, which has opposed Kohl's drive
for European unification and a single currency, delivered a mixed
verdict.
	   ``His vision of Europe may have been fundamentally flawed,
undemocratic and dangerous... But of his vision of Germany, and his
triumphant enactment of it, history will surely be kind.''

	   Waigel, who has headed the party for 10 years and is Kohl's
finance minister, told a CSU leadership meeting that he will not
run for re-election as party chairman at a convention in January,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, who led the party to a strong
victory in state elections two weeks ago, is considered Waigel's
likely successor.
	   Many thought that the CSU victory would give a boost to Kohl in
Sunday's national election, but instead the conservative camp also
recorded heavy losses in Bavaria, a traditional stronghold.
	   Kohl announced Sunday night he would not run again as party
chairman.

Asian markets close higher on U.S. rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing figures for all markets.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday
on growing expectations for an interest rate cut in the United
States and hopes that Japan is finally prepared to deal with its
banking problems.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index surged 244.43
points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 7,946.04. On Friday, the index
had slumped 133.00 points.
	   Tokyo share prices also rose as investors welcomed news that
Japan's ruling party and opposition had reached an agreement on
banking reform measures.
	   The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 185.53
points, or 1.35 percent, to 13,909.37. On Friday, the Nikkei shed
481.94 points, or 3.39 percent.
	   The compromise deal paves the way for passage next month of
legislation aimed at cleaning up Japan's troubled financial system,
which has been burdened by roughly dlrs 1 trillion in bad loans.
	   Investors in Tokyo shrugged off the failure of Japan Leasing
Corp., a non-bank affiliate of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan.
	   The leasing company, estimated to have debts exceeding 2.44
trillion yen (U.S. dlrs 18.24 billion), applied late Sunday for
court protection in Japan's largest ever corporate bankruptcy.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 135.72 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 1.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo, but below
its late New York level of 136.25 yen Friday.
	   Hong Kong brokers said investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee to cut interest rates at its meeting on
Tuesday.
	   A cut would ease pressure on Hong Kong interest rates, because
the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency means interest
rates in the territory usually track U.S. rates.
	   In Bangkok, share prices closed sharply higher on growing
perception that the Thai market, which had been hovering at 11-year
lows for weeks, has begun to recover.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 6.60 points, or 2.7
percent, to 255.53.
	   The market was closed for a holiday in Malaysia.
	   Elsewhere:
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher as concerns over the
economic impact of Philippine Airlines' closure receded and on
hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates. The 30-share Philippine
Stock Exchange Index rose 15.04 points, or 1.2 percent, to
1,230.50.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower because of continued worries
over last week's bailout of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management
LP in the United States. The market's key Weighted Stock Price
Index fell 69.28 points, or 1 percent, to 6,910.61.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher on
expectation of a cut in U.S. interest rates. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index fell 7.42 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,716.61.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All
Ordinaries Index rose 28.2 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,591.6.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly lower on worries over
Tuesday's planned strike by bank workers. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index slipped 0.57 point to 305.73.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares prices closed mixed, with the key index rising
on wide expectations that the U.S. will make a significant cut in
interest rates. The Straits Times Index rose 6.61 points, or 0.7
percent, to 930.55.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed generally higher, but continued
selling in telecommunication stocks forced the benchmark index to
stay in negative territory. The Composite Index slipped 0.223 point
to 275.001.

Schroeder to visit France first, amid concern over ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Chirac, Jospin, Giscard, other comment, background
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany's future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said
Monday he will make his first foreign trip to France in the next 10
days, to reassure a somewhat wary Paris that he strongly backs the
Franco-German engine driving European unification.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance,'' Schroeder
said the day after his Social Democrats defeated Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's conservatives. ``And it will remain the most important for
Europe.''
	   Schroeder said he would respond quickly to an invitation by
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to visit
Paris in the next 10 days ``at the latest.''
	   France and Germany are each other's biggest trading partners and
are the main forces behind the euro single currency that takes
effect in January among 11 of the 15 European Union nations.
	   But as Germany's first leader not to have experienced World War
II, some French were concerned whether the 54-year-old Schroeder
and the coming new German capital in Berlin will be as committed as
Kohl in rooting Germany into the European Union to avoid future
wars.
	   ``It's another generation coming to power, less sensitive to the
weight of the horrors of the past, because they didn't live them,''
said a front-page editorial in the conservative daily Le Figaro,
titled ``The Republic of Berlin.''
	   On the left, the daily Liberation said that for Schroeder, ``the
war is over, well over, as well as the time of repentance. And if
he says he's European, as he likes to repeat, it's not by moral
obligation but by national interest. An interest that is not
necessarily eternal.''
	   Schroeder insisted to French-based Europe 1 radio that his
personal ties with France were ``much better'' than the French
media think.
	   ``I would like the contacts between Germany and France, which at
the governmental level work very well and will remain very good, to
expand and reach the societies,'' Schroeder said, referring to a
lack of cultural exchange between the two countries.
	   While Paris media raised questions about Schroeder, and noted he
speaks only English and German, French leaders publicly voiced
support for the new leader. Kohl spoke no foreign language, but was
seen as far more Francophile than Schroeder.
	   Both conservative Chirac and Socialist Jospin congratulated
Schroeder, though Chirac also thanked Kohl ``for the immense
contribution to Europe-building for 16 years and said Europe
``still needs him.''
	   Jospin hailed Kohl's ``role in the history of his country,'' and
he said he was ``certain that the new team in Germany will have the
heart to further reinforce, enrich and renew relations with
France.''
	   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing asked whether today's
French and German leaders ``will be capable of elaborating an
important and significant plan to advance the European Union.''
	   Schroeder rejected any possibility of renewed German
nationalism. ``There is no contradiction between the Germans and
the Europeans,'' he said. ``We will be very good Europeans, and
that's why we will be good Germans.''
	   The leader said he wanted the euro to be ``a success.'' He also
said he favored greater international financial cooperation as
proposed by U.S., British and French leaders.

South Korean tuna ship released by Kiribati authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean tuna ship and its 25
crewmen were released Monday after being detained by the central
Pacific island nation of Kiribati for four days, its owner said.
	   The tuna boat, owned by Dongwon Industry Co. of Seoul, was
seized while operating in waters close to Kiribati last Thursday,
Dongwon officials said.
	   A Kiribati patrol boat ordered the ship to stop for questioning.
When the ship continued to sail, the patrol boat opened fire,
killing a Vietnamese crewman, Dongwon officials said.
	   The ship and the rest of the crew have been detained in Canton
since. The ship was operating with official permission from
Kiribati authorities when the incident occurred, Dongwon officials
said.
	   ``A funeral for the dead crewman was held in Canton,'' said Lee
Hwa-shin, a Dongwon official. ``We're not legally responsible for
the incident but are willing to pay some compensation for the dead
sailor's family.''
	   Kiribati straddles the equator between Hawaii and Australia. Its
60,000 people inhabit 33 small atolls and are among the poorest in
the Pacific.

Police holding 15 after house-to-house search
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police were holding 15 people Monday
after some 200 people were picked up in a weekend house-to-house
search, a spokesman said.
	   Bob Ngobi said the 15 picked up in neighborhoods east of the
Ugandan capital would be charged ``with being idle and
disorderly.'' He said no other crime was involved.
	   He did not explain why the extensive search was necessary to
locate idle and disorderly people.
	   Ugandan authorities are now holding between 17 and 20 people in
connection with an alleged plan to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Kampala
as well as Ugandan targets.
	   Simultaneous bombings of the U.S. embassies in neighboring Kenya
and Tanzania Aug. 7 that were allegedly organized and carried out
by people associated with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden killed 248
people in Nairobi and 11 in Dar es Salaam.
	   A report Monday in the Nairobi East African Standard said three
of the 20 had been released, but Ngobi was not able to confirm
this. The report also identified two in the group of 20 as Kenyans
who were said to be organizers of the foiled bombing.
	   Earlier reports had said the group was made up of Ugandans and
Somalis, and that the identities two men arrested at the
Kenyan-Ugandan border two weeks ago were not known.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said Monday one of the
20 being held is an Iranian. He was identified as Asghar Pishdar,
and the report said he was arrested by Ugandan police and FBI
agents as he was boarding a plane at Entebbe International Airport.
	   Iran Air has a weekly flight from Entebbe to Tehran on
Saturdays.
	   Ngobi refused to comment on the report.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's designated new
chancellor, begans talks Monday on building a coalition government
after German voters ousted Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years of
conservative rule. The Social Democratic victory marked the first
time in postwar Germany that voters rejected all the parties from
the previous government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas. Kohl
and his Christian Democrats won just 35 percent of the vote, which
translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it held in the old
parliament. Now it's up to Schroeder _ whose Social Democrats won
41 percent of the vote _ to make good on pledges to end
unemployment, stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax
and economic reforms. (GERMANY-ELECTION)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will restart if there are
new attacks by Albanian separatists. Premier Mirko Marjanovic told
the Serbian parliament that special police units will return to
barracks _ a condition demanded by both American and European
diplomats to avoid a NATO attack. He said the government will grant
amnesty to Kosovo Albanians who surrender weapons within the next
10 days as long as they have not committed ``war crimes.''
Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution declaring
that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is the
nation's top priority _ a move that bolsters the position of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Jewish settler leaders hurried to New York
on Monday to try to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not
to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians on an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. The settlers
threatened to topple Netanyahu if he goes ahead with a deal they
fear will isolate many settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strips. However, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh indicated on
Monday that an agreement between Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat was not near. Speaking after a three-way meeting
between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Arafat and
Netanyahu early Monday, Naveh told Israel radio that the obstacle
remains Palestinian refusal to carry out its commitments,
especially stopping extremists from attacking Israel. Palestinians
say they have done all they can to control extremists.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Pakistani opposition parties on Monday
demanded that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif be investigated following
a newspaper report accusing him of tax evasion and siphoning
millions of dollars from his country's coffers into personal bank
accounts. The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper, quoted a report
prepared by the Pakistani Federal Investigation Agency that said
the Sharif family was involved in tax evasion, loan defaults and
has ``phantom'' bank accounts. It did not say what these accounts
were. In Islamabad, a government spokesman dismissed the
allegations as ``wild, incorrect and malicious,'' while Sharif's
son, Hasan Nawaz, said the report was baseless. Sharif had no
immediate comment. (PAKISTAN-SHARIF-CORRUPTION)
	   PASCAGOULA, Mississippi (AP) _ The U.S. Gulf Coast groaned under
the fury of Hurricane Georges, which moved ashore with 126 mph (203
kph) gusts early Monday as it spewed wind and rain from the Florida
Panhandle to Louisiana. Power outages were reported all along the
coast, airports and interstates closed, curfews were imposed and
flash-flood warnings abounded. Waves as tall as a house clipped off
fishing piers in Alabama and leapt across beachfront roads along
U.S. 90 in Mississippi. More than 1.5 million people were told to
leave the coast, spurring ``probably the largest evacuation we have
ever achieved,'' said Lt. Col. Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana State
Police. No deaths or injuries were directly attributed to Georges
during its odyssey across southern states, in contrast to the more
than 300 deaths reported in the Caribbean. (US-HURRICANE GEORGES)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday
on growing expectations for an interest rate cut in the United
States and hopes that Japan is finally prepared to deal with its
banking problems. In Hong Kong, the blue chip Hang Seng Index
surged 244.43 points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 7,946.04. On
Friday, the index had slumped 133.00 points. Tokyo share prices
also rose as investors welcomed news that Japan's ruling party and
opposition had reached an agreement on banking reform measures.
Elsewhere, shares also closed higher in Thailand, the Philippines,
New Zealand and Australia. Shares were lower in Taiwan and South
Korea. They were mixed in Singapore and Indonesia. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party announced Monday it had
reached a final agreement with the major opposition parties on a
key set of bills to clean up this country's troubled financial
system. The announcement raised hopes that the bills, aimed at
cleaning up about dlrs 1 trillion of bad debt in the banking
sector, would be approved early next month, during the current
session of Parliament. Monday's breakthrough centered on a
compromise over how much power to give a new independent body that
will be charged with regulating the finance sector. The ruling
Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition agreed regulation of
the finance sector would be shared by the ministry and the
independent panel. They also agreed that any bank whose capital
falls precariously while purchasing an ailing bank that has been
nationalized will be eligible for an injection of public funds.
(JAPAN-BANK BILLS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A leasing company saddled with over 2 trillion yen
(dlrs 16 billion) in debt announced Monday it has filed for
protection in Japan's biggest bankruptcy ever. Japan Leasing Corp.,
an affiliate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, filed
for protection from creditors late Sunday, said Hiroaki Okamoto,
the company's president. Okamoto said he did not know how much of
the company's 2.18 trillion yen (dlrs 16 billion) in debts it would
be able to pay back. But instead of sparking more gloom, the
company's collapse was seen by many as elminating a potential
sticking point in government efforts to pass a series of banking
bills to clean up the country's bad-loan mess. (JAPAN-BANKRUPTCY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has paid off its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces, and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday. Since his appointment nearly
three weeks ago, Primakov has stressed that payment of salaries and
pensions will be his government's priority as it grapples with
Russia's grave economic crisis. According to estimates published in
the Kommersant earlier this month, Russia owed a total of 36
billion rubles (dlrs 2.4 billion) in back salaries and social
payments. Of that sum, 3.5 billion rubles (dlrs 233 million) was
owed to the military. Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin also focused
on efforts to wrap up formation of the new Cabinet _ a painful
process that has stretched into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats
remain unfilled. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors requested a 12-year prison
term Monday for a former head of bankrupt Kia Motors Co. on charges
of embezzling 52.3 billion won (dlrs 37 million) in company funds.
Prosecutors also sought prison terms of up to seven years for four
other top Kia officials for alleged involvement in the
bribes-for-loan scandal. Kim Sun-hong, who headed the nation's
second largest carmaker until last October, was accused of
embezzling company money to bribe politicians and government
officials to take out bank loans and keep the financially shaky
company afloat. Kia collapsed under 11 trillion won (dlrs 8
billion) in bad bank loans in the summer of last year. Its failure
eroded foreign investor confidence, fueling a flight of foreign
capital. (SKOREA-KIA TRIAL)

 &UR; Hebron settlers attack Palestinians after shots are fired &QL;

three-way summit at White House; changes byline

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shots were fired Monday at a group of
young Israelis by assailants in the Palestinian-run part of this
divided town, and a female Israeli student was wounded in the leg.
	   In response, Jewish settlers beat several Palestinians passing
by the Jewish enclave of Beit Hadassah, and witnesses said one
Palestinian woman was injured. An Israeli woman was detained.
	   The violence came as the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were to
meet in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday in
hopes of concluding an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback,
said an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Late Sunday, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had met in New York, with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as host. It was their first
face-to-face meeting in nearly a year.
	   Violence in the volatile city of Hebron could cast a shadow on a
three-way summit in Washington.
	   Monday's incident began shortly before noon. A group of visiting
Israeli students was walking from on the road between two Jewish
enclaves, Beit Hadassah and Tel Romeida, when shots were fired at
them from the Palestinian-controlled part of town.
	   A female student was hit in the leg by two or three bullets,
Israel army radio said. A companion fainted. The wounded Israeli,
whose name and age were not immediately available, was taken to a
hospital in Jerusalem.
	   In response, several settlers beat Palestinian passers-by
outside Beit Hadassah.
	   Israeli soldiers closed off the Israeli enclaves, keeping
Israelis from reaching the open-air Palestinian market. In the
past, settlers have responded to attacks by rampaging through the
market, overturning stalls and attacking Palestinians.
	   Tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron rose
considerably last month after a settler rabbi was stabbed to death
in his home in Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers in the
heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. The assailant, presumably a
Palestinian militant, was never caught.
	   Hebron is home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers.
In January 1997, Israeli troops handed 80 percent of the city to
Palestinian control, but remained in the downtown area to protect
the settler enclaves.

Government mobilizes citizens to fight in south

 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has declared a general mobilization
and has called up retired army officers to counter expected
assaults by southern rebel forces, a state-run newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Al-Anba daily said Sudan was under threat from the rebels and
two neighboring states ``aided by the United States.''
	   The government has been warning for several days that it expects
a major battle with the rebels for the provincial capital of Juba
in southern Equatoria state. There also have been reports of
shelling along the Sudanese border with Eritrea.
	   Al-Anba said the Sudanese Cabinet adopted the mobilization
decision in a meeting Sunday night to counter ``Ugandan aggression
against the southern region and an Eritrean offensive in the
east.''
	   In a statement read over state-run Omdurman radio, the army's
spokesman, Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim, accused the United
States of aiding the attackers.
	   ``The two simultaneous attacks are coordinated by the Americans,
who have been providing materiel, political and media support for
the rebels and the Ugandan-Eritrean aggression,'' he said.
	   The government has long accused Uganda of sending troops to
fight with southern Sudanese rebels and Eritrea of aiding
rebel-allied opposition groups intent on overthrowing the Islamic
government of Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir.
	   Both Uganda and Eritrea have repeatedly denied the accusations.
	   The Cabinet statement called on all Sudanese who are able to
carry arms and all senior government officials to ``take part in
the honor of defending the homeland.''
	   It also ordered all retired army officers and non-commissioned
officers to report to the nearest army unit to move to the war
zones.
	   On Saturday, el-Bashir paid a surprise visit to Juba and called
on the nation to be ready for the ``final battle'' to defend the
town, which is 1,200 kilometers (740 miles) south of the capital
Khartoum.
	   The higher education ministry suspended classes at Sudanese
universities for one month to enable the students to take part in
any fighting.
	   El-Bashir had ordered a general mobilization in June after the
rebel Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army captured the garrison town of
Ulu, 455 kilometers (280 miles) southeast of Khartoum.
	   The SPLA has announced advances around Juba in recent weeks.
	   SPLA rebels have been fighting since 1983 for more autonomy for
the south's Christians and animists from the Islamic North.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
accompanying famines. Millions more have been forced to flee their
homes.

With Kohl defeated, concern shifts to new leader's policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Politicians of the left on Monday welcomed Gerhard
Schroeder's election triumph which ended 16 years of conservative
government under Helmut Kohl, claiming the result as fresh evidence
that the political tide was running their way.
	   ``It's a very positive result,'' said Deputy Prime Minister
Walter Veltroni, who said Schroeder was in the same center-left
mold as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   ``With Schroeder, Blair and Jospin, it gets easier ... for the
unemployment issue to enter full force in Europe's political
discussion,'' Veltroni said.
	   ``A new epoch is coming. Many countries have become much more
leftist in nature,'' said Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
	   ``A different Germany is born, but also a different Europe, full
of question marks,'' said the Italian daily newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe agreed on Schroeder's place in
the political spectrum but with a negative spin, calling him ``a
split-the-difference pragmatist'' in the mold of Blair and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``When it comes time to jump off the fence on actual policy
questions, on which side Mr. Schroeder will land is anyone's
guess,'' the Wall Street Journal Europe said in an editorial
Monday.
	   Schroeder declared that one thing wouldn't change: the
partnership between Germany and France as leaders of the European
Union.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance, and it will
remain the most important for Europe,'' said Schroeder, who said he
would make an official visit to France within 10 days.
	   In Australia, the end of 16 years of conservative government in
Germany was hailed by opposition leader Kim Beazley as evidence the
rest of the world was abandoning policies like those pursued by
Australia's conservative Prime Minister John Howard.
	   Beazley, who is campaigning to unseat Howard in an Oct. 3
national election, said Europeans were now looking to parties, like
his own, that were prepared to do something about unemployment.
	   ``Since the mid 1990s the people in Europe have been turning to
interventionist government policies,'' he said in a radio
interview. ``These days we've recognized that there are benefits
from a globalized economy and benefits from the free market, but
there are also casualties.''
	   Kohl, who had governed for 16 years, won warm praises.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said Kohl ``has attained
historic achievements, such as the realization of German
unification and promotion of European integration.''
	   The Irish Times of Dublin said the election ``was notable for
the basic agreement on foreign policy matters between the main
parties, which is nonetheless important for that. Dr. Kohl's main
legacy will probably be seen as having successfully anchored German
national interests in such a European framework, making this seem a
normal state of affairs at a time when events could readily have
forged a different outcome.''
	   The Daily Telegraph of London, which has opposed Kohl's drive
for European unification and a single currency, delivered a mixed
verdict.
	   ``His vision of Europe may have been fundamentally flawed,
undemocratic and dangerous... But of his vision of Germany, and his
triumphant enactment of it, history will surely be kind.''

Leader of Kohl's Bavarian ally party steps down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's election defeat
claimed another victim Monday. The chairman of the conservative
Bavarian party that has been part of Kohl's coalition in Bonn
announced he would step down.
	   Theo Waigel, who also is the outgoing government's finance
minister, has headed the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union for 10
years.
	   He told a party meeting that he will not run for re-election as
party chairman at a January convention, said a party official,
Georg von Waldenfels.
	   Waigel, who was re-elected to parliament in Sunday's election,
told his party peers he wants to concentrate on helping the
conservative camp mount a strong opposition to the new Social
Democrat-led government.
	   Bavarian governor Edmund Stoiber, who led the party to a strong
victory in state elections two weeks ago, is considered Waigel's
likely successor.
	   Many thought the CSU victory would boost Kohl in the national
election, but instead the party recorded significant losses in
Bavaria, a traditional stronghold.
	   Kohl announced Sunday night he would not run again as party
chairman.

Volcano erupts on Kamchatka Peninsula
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A volcano has erupted on Russia's Kamchatka
Peninsula, sending 100-meter (328-foot) columns of ash into the
sky, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   At night, the 1,537-meter (5,043 mile) high Karymsky volcano
sends out a glow from top to bottom, ITAR-Tass said.
	   There are 29 active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula,
located eight time zones east of Moscow along the Pacific Rim's
``ring of fire.'' In the last decade, eight of those volcanoes have
erupted repeatedly, sometimes sending up ash and smoke 12
kilometers (7 miles) high.
	   A Russo-Japanese expedition will travel to a site 3 kilometers
(2 miles) from the Karymsky volcano on Thursday to carry out
seismic research, ITAR-Tass said.

Serb premier says Albanian `terrorism' has been defeated

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned the crackdown will resume if
Albanian separatists stage new attacks.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to their barracks _ a condition
demanded by both American and European governments to avoid a NATO
attack.
	   He said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo Albanians
who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as long as they have
not committed ``war crimes.''
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
been largely routed.
	   ``Armed terrorist groups have been defeated,'' Marjanovic said.
``Conditions have been made ... to decrease engagement of
anti-terrorist forces...The forces that will be decreased by this
move will stay ready in their barracks for a while, just in case
that creation of a terrorist organization in any part of Kosovo is
renewed.''
	   He said the move was in accordance with an agreement Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed in June with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is
the nation's top priority.
	   Hundreds of people in the southern province of Kosovo have been
killed and some 275,000 forced to flee their homes since
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians began seven months ago.
Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Most
of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   The U.N. Security Council has been insisting since March that
Serbs withdraw special police units and other forces from the
province and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the
majority Albanian province.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against militant separatists
in Kosovo and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic failed to comply.
	   There was no immediate comment from Kosovo Albanian leaders on
Marjanovic's statement. His comments appeared to give in to the
international community while at the same time maintaining an image
of defiance.
	   In Kosovo, there was no immediate indication that Serb forces
were withdrawing. But it also appeared that fighting of recent days
was dying down.
	   Paddy Ashdown, leader of Britain's Liberal Democrat party who is
touring Kosovo, told reporters in Suva Reka that he had seen little
active fighting. ``We saw refugees being bumped around from one
place to another,'' he said, indicating Serbs were trying to
prevent large gatherings of refugees which draw international
attention.
	   During the parliamentary session, Gorica Gajevic, the general
secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, called on Kosovo
Albanians to open talks with the government. She denied the
government used excessive force in its clampdown.
	   ``It used as much force as was needed to stifle the evil of
terrorism, in the way other world democratic countries do when
faced with terrorism,'' she said.
	   ``Threatening guns and force is a scenario we have already seen
in the policies and approach of the strongmen who wish to fulfill
their interests by destabilizing the Balkans,'' she said.
	   Another member of Milosevic's party, Dusan Matkovic, said that
if the world wants to help Kosovo, it should invest ``several
hundred million dollars'' in Kosovo's mines and economy.

Germany's future chancellor Schroeder must now form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's designated new
chancellor, approached the environmental Greens party Monday about
joining his Social Democrats in a coalition government after
ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl in sweeping vote for change.
	   The Social Democratic victory marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   In a stinging humiliation for the West's longest-serving leader,
Kohl and his Christian Democrats won just 35 percent of the vote,
which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it held in the
old parliament.
	   Now it is up to Schroeder -- whose Social Democrats won 41
percent of the vote -- to make good on pledges to end unemployment,
stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Monday.
	   The Social Democrats held informal talks overnight with the
Greens, which won 6.7 percent, and were to begin what could be
tough negotiations between two parties with some sharp policy
differences.
	   Though eager for their first shot at entering government, the
Greens warned the Social Democrats not to try to shore up a new
government by bringing in other parties, for example, the liberal
Free Democrats that were Kohl's junior coalition partners. They won
6.2 percent.
	   ``Our signal is clear: according to us there can only be
negotiations with one party,'' said Heide Ruehle, a Greens' party
leader.
	   Already, Schroeder has ruled out including the ex-communist
Party of Democratic Socialism, which won enough votes to stay in
parliament. Many in the west view the party as a troubling remnant
of the former communist East German state.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens alliance would be postwar Germany's
most radical government as well as a test of the Greens' ability to
curb their sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more
mainstream party.
	   The Greens have proposed reforms that outrage some Germans and
amuse others: tripling gas prices to 5 marks (dlrs 3) per liter
over 10 years and introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) speed limit
on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy, immigration and defense
policy.
	   Schroeder will be the first of his generation, rooted in the
1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder, 54, will lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   His party's strong showing ruled out, at least for the moment,
sharing power with the Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand
coalition.''
	   The Christian Democrats general secretary, Peter Hintze, said
voters put his party in opposition, and that it could play more
active role as a conservative counterweight to the Social Democrats
center-left leanings.
	   The Social Democrats and Greens have won ``their turn'' at
government, he said. ``We can only hope that a large part of what
they're planning to do will not be achieved. That would be a big
problem for Germany.''
	   Kohl, 68, had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength
of his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and Kohl
conceded the race by announcing he would step down as the leader of
the party he has ruled with an iron fist since 1973.
	   The Christian Democrats said they would elect a new leader in
early November. Hintze declined to speculate on a successor, but
Kohl has indicated a preference for his protege, Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
	   The party lost support in all of Germany's 16 states _ even
Bavaria, a conservative stronghold ruled by Kohl's allies, the
Christian Social Union.
	   Following Kohl's example, CSU party chief Theo Waigel said
Monday he would step down. Waigel, also Germany's outgoing finance
minister, has led the Christian Social Union for 10 years.

Yeltsin meets with officials to complete Cabinet formation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS context in 2nd graf, UPDATES with more economic
statistics in new three final grafs. Trims throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has paid off its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces, and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday.
	   Since his appointment nearly three weeks ago, Primakov has
stressed that payment of salaries and pensions will be his
government's priority as it grapples with Russia's grave economic
crisis.
	   The stark conditions for soldiers have made the debt to the
military a potent political issue for the government's critics.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant daily earlier
this month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4
billion) in back salaries and social payments. Of that sum, roughly
10 percent was owed to the military.
	   Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin also focused on efforts to wrap
up the formation of the new Cabinet _ a painful process that has
stretched into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats remain unfilled.
	   In a blow to the proponents of market-oriented reform, Boris
Fyodorov, was dismissed from his posts of acting deputy prime
minister and tax chief, Russian news agencies reported. His exit
leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin reappointed to the post of
finance minister on Friday, as the strongest supporter of reform in
the evolving Cabinet.
	   Zadornov is associated with the previous Cabinet's decision on
Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze domestic debt _ a
controversial move that many blame for fueling Russia's crisis.
	   Zadornov defended himself over the weekend, saying the former
government had few viable alternatives. He pledged to improve the
terms of the government's debt repayment.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multibillion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   No details of the restructuring plan have yet been released
officially. Shokhin said that under the plan, investors would be
able to redeem their defaulted treasury bills in rubles but the
proceeds would be frozen in special accounts for six months.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis.
	   _ The amount of private bank deposits fell by 6.5 percent to
about 151 billion rubles (currently dlrs 10 billion) last month as
people scrambled to pull their money out of failing banks.
	   _ Russia's foreign trade turnover shrank by 4.3 percent in the
first eight months of the year, totaling 83.7 billion dollars, said
the State Statistics Committee.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

Anwar's supporters continue protests on national holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new protests; CHANGES byline.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Undaunted by police batons, tear
gas and more than 150 arrests, several thousand supporters of
ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim continued protests
Monday, a national holiday, for the fourth straight day.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's decision to fire and arrest
Anwar, his former heir apparent, has stirred anger on the streets
of downtown Kuala Lumpur, the capital.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from a courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   Several truckloads of riot police arrived at the lush green park
where the marchers had gathered, to quell the demonstrations.
	   Witnesses saw several protesters being grabbed and pushed into
red police buses. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
Police also turned their wrath on reporters and cameramen, shouting
``Go, go, go!''
	   On Sunday, more than 10,000 supporters trudged for several
kilometers (miles) to attend a gathering organized by Malaysia's
opposition Islamic party. Police had blocked cars from entering a
village road leading to the rally.
	   Although authorities have banned all public meetings, police
allowed the meeting at the headquarters of the Parti Islam
Se-Malaysia, or PAS, on condition that it would end by midnight.
	   The rally was held just hours after the cancellation of a
planned launch of a coalition of opposition parties and
non-governmental groups promoting political reform.
	   The organizers of The Coalition for People's Democracy said the
launch had to be called off because the hotel where the event was
to be held was pressured by police not to allow its use.
	   Former deputy leader Anwar and 16 of his associates have been
held under a harsh security law that allows indefinite imprisonment
without trial. Neither Anwar, arrested last Sunday, nor any of his
detained allies have been formally arraigned in a court.
	   Anwar has been accused of crimes that include unlawful sex acts
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they
were politically motivated.
	   His Sept. 20 arrest has drawn strong support from Lim Kit Siang,
his one-time political foe and the opposition leader of Parliament,
who has called for the Parliament to investigate allegations of
corruption leveled against both Anwar and Mahathir.
	   ``What Malaysians want to know are all the full facts about
corruption, cronyism and nepotism _ regardless of whether they
affect Mahathir or Anwar,'' said Lim in a statement.
	   In a home videotape made on the night of his arrest, Anwar
accused his former boss of allowing his commercial interests and
those of his family and cronies to sway his judgment on public
spending and controls.
	   Mahathir, in turn, has said his designated heir didn't know how
to manage the economy.
	   On Saturday, police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon
to disperse a rally of more than 3,000 people. Twenty-nine
Malaysians were arrested for gathering illegally, police said.
	   Even small public gatherings and outdoor assemblies in Malaysia
require police permits.

Ray Harford steps down as QPR manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ray Harford resigned Monday as manager of Queens
Park Rangers after guding the struggling first division club to
just one win in nine games this season.
	   In a statement, the club said Harford felt it was in QPR's
``best interest'' to step down following Saturday's 4-1 defeat at
Oxford United.
	   Harford left West Bromwich Albion in the middle of last season
to join QPR, which lies second from bottom in the first division.
	   The club appointed player/coach Ian Dowie as caretaker manager.
He will be in charge for Tuesday's game at Wolverhampton and
Saturday's home match against Grimsby Town.
	   The QPR board will interview a short list of candidates over the
next two weeks and hopes to have a new manager installed in time
for the Oct. 17 game at Huddersfield Town.
	   The board said it considered appointing player/assistant manager
Vinnie Jones as Harford's replacement but decided to formulate a
short list of candidates instead. The statement said Jones, the
former Wimbledon star, would still be considered for the job.

Britain's chancellor tells party he'll stick with strict policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Brown comments; trims, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ With leftists flexing muscles at the
Labor Party's annual conference, Treasury chief Gordon Brown warned
Monday he will stick by strict economic policies that are angering
many trade unions.
	   Brown wants to keep Britain on track for his target of 2.5
percent inflation _ a goal that prompted him last year to take the
power to set interest rates away from politicians and give it to
the Bank of England.
	   The bank has tightened monetary policy, drawing fierce protests
from British manufacturers and workers who say the resulting high
value of the British pound makes it hard to sell their products
overseas at a time when inflation wasn't much of a threat anyway.
	   But Brown told the Labor delegates that any short-term pains
will be worth the long-term gains of stable growth with few
inflationary pressures.
	   ``It is because of our commitment to long-term stability, even
more essential at a time of world instability, that from this
government there will be no U-turns. No left turns. No right
turns,'' Brown told delegates.
	   ``No return to Tory boom and bust,'' Brown said. ``We have not
come this far as a party, we have not come this far as a country,
to turn back now.''
	   Brown added: ``I tell this conference there is no other way, no
solution, or even comfort, in soft options, no magic wand solution,
no quick-fix alternative to these long-term policies for achieving
the goals we share.''
	   Although applause during Brown's speech was subdued, most of the
delegates gave him a standing ovation at the end.
	   Sunday's opening of the conference brought Prime Minister Tony
Blair his first setback _ albeit largely symbolic in terms of power
_ from within the party since he ended a generation of Conservative
Party rule in May 1997 elections.
	   Leftists won four of the six seats on the party's governing
National Executive Committee that are chosen by the party
rank-and-file. Blair loyalists still command a lopsided majority on
the 32-member body.
	   But he warned the party against returning to the internal
wrangling that helped keep Labor long in opposition.
	   ``We have got to trust each other,'' Blair told the 1,400
delegates gathered in the Winter Gardens conference center in this
north England seaside resort.
	   ``But I make no apology for saying to you that at the same time
as we make our society fairer, we are a party, happy, proud to say
we are pro-enterprise and pro-business,'' he added.
	   Leftists, long sidelined by the centrist ``New Labor'' policies
of Blair, declared they had begun to reassert influence.
	   ``It shows the party members don't care about the smears,'' said
Liz Davies, a candidate elected to the executive committee from the
left-wing's ``Grassroots Alliance'' slate.
	   ``They care about the politics we stood for _ redistribution of
wealth and power from the rich to the poor, and democracy and
diversity in the Labor Party,'' added Ms. Davies.
	   Moderate trade union leaders _ whose organized labor is still a
prime funder of the party _ said they would press for a lowering in
interests rates, now at 7.5 percent. They also urge further boosts
in state spending.

Chinese leaders extol flood-fighting to rally nation

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Combining genuine gratitude with pure politics,
Chinese leaders commended soldiers and officials Monday for
combating summer floods and tried to use their heroics to rally the
nation behind the communist government.
	   In 95 minutes of speechmaking broadcast live nationwide from the
Great Hall of the People, an array of national, provincial and
military figures touted the ``victory'' over the flooding as proof
of the Communist Party's right to rule.
	   Such propaganda displays underscore the leadership's growing
worries about public anger over corruption and the slowing economy.
	   While floods raged this summer, the People's Liberation Army _
the ultimate defender of party rule _ was accused of rampant
smuggling and a former party power-broker was tried in a graft case
that symbolized corruption's spread.
	   Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin, in a
45-minute speech, acknowledged people's doubts about the party and
military but said, ``The great victory in the fight against the
floods is another most telling answer to their question.''
	   ``The extremely hard and bitter struggle against the floods, the
severe test of life and death, and the experience of braving wind
and storm together have strengthened the flesh-and-blood ties
between the party and the masses and the fish-and-water
relationship between the army and the people,'' Jiang said.
	   With party elders and Politburo members seated behind him, Jiang
spoke to a mostly military crowd of 10,000 inside the Great Hall's
main auditorium. Soldiers roared chants that echoed off the
ceiling's electrically lit red star and lent the event a martial
air.
	   Aside from the moment of silence Jiang called to remember the
dead, the meeting glossed over the disaster's human toll. More than
3,000 people were killed and millions made homeless in the worst
flooding in decades.
	   Likewise, Jiang never mentioned the decades of rapacious logging
and only briefly noted other environmentally disastrous policies
that exacerbated the flooding.
	   Instead heroism took center stage. Applause filled the hall when
about 100 soldiers and officials marched in wearing red sashes _
signs of their status as national heroes in the flood-fighting.
	   ``The victory shows that our socialist system has tremendous
advantages,'' Jiang said.
	   Jiang's speech displayed all the flair of the centrist tactics
he has used to stay atop the party hierarchy. He praised ordinary
people who sacrificed family interests for the nation and thanked
the tightly controlled state media for popularizing ``the heroic
deeds.''
	   His most lavish praise went to the army, saying the military
proved it ``deserves the complete trust of the party and the
people.''
	   Jiang cast the flood-fighting as the latest in a series of
victories: the revolution a half-century ago and against Western
bullying after the military quelled democracy demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
	   ``We have a bright future, but the road ahead will not be
smooth,'' Jiang said.

Philippine Airlines union, management reach agreement on rescue
</HEADLINE>
plan

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines may reopen next
week after a decision by its largest union Monday to accept a key
element of a management-proposed recovery plan, President Joseph
Estrada said.
	   ``Everybody's happy, not only me but the whole country,''
Estrada said. ``Finally there is an agreement.''
	   Asia's oldest airline, which owes creditors dlrs 2.1 billion,
closed last Wednesday after failing to convince its ground crew
union to accept the rescue plan. Its closure left much of the
Philippines without air service.
	   After Monday's agreement, PAL chairman Lucio Tan and union
president Alex Barrientos beamed and shook hands. A pleased Estrada
stood behind them.
	   ``I'm very sure that labor and management can achieve very
harmonious cooperation,'' Tan said.
	   Barrientos called the agreement PAL's ``last, last, last
possible hope.''
	   ``If this fails, it's closed,'' he said.
	   The breakthrough came when union leaders agreed to accept a
10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreement in
exchange for continued management recognition of the union and a
guarantee of no cuts in salaries or health benefits.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with its radical
wing saying the 10-year suspension would violate workers' rights
and destroy the union.
	   Hundreds of workers protested the agreement at the union's
office and at the Senate Monday, calling instead for the government
to take over the airline.
	   Estrada said PAL may reopen by next week even though the
agreement must still be formally approved by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   The union will hold a simple signature campaign in which workers
will be asked to sign their names if they support the plan,
Barrientos said.
	   The recovery plan would give workers 20 percent of the company's
stock in exchange for the 10-year suspension of their collective
bargaining agreement.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on the suspension before they will
accept a restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Earlier Monday, Estrada flew to the central Philippines aboard
the inaugural domestic flight by Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways, which he enlisted to help fill the vacuum left by PAL's
closure.
	   Initially, two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be leased to
PNB Holdings, a subsidiary of Philippine National Bank, which is 47
percent owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization and refleeting program, greatly inflating the
amounts of money it must repay to overseas creditors.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly crippled by a 22-day
pilots' strike in June.

Sudanese planes reportedly bomb hospital in southern Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese air force planes have dropped
cluster bombs on a hospital in a rebel-controlled town controlled
in southern Sudan, a humanitarian organization said Monday.
	   A patient was seriously wounded and a ward was damaged in the
bombing of the hospital in Yei, about 120 kilometers (74 miles)
southwest of Juba, said Dan Effie of Norwegian People's Aid, which
runs the hospital.
	   The hospital has been bombed four times since April 1997, Effie
said.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the bombing, but NPA
has in the past provided reliable reports.
	   Juba, a provincial capital about 1,200 kilometers (744
milesJuba) south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, is the largest
town in southern Sudan still under government control.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting since 1983
for autonomy from the Muslim and Arab-dominated north for southern
Sudan where Christians and followers of tradtional religion form
the majority. The rebels have never been able to capture Juba, a
strategic goal in their campaign.
	   Government forces and rebels are fighting 72 kilometers (45
miles) east of Juba. The bombing came a day after Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir paid a surprise visit Saturday to the
provincial capital.
	   El-Bashir warned of ``a final battle'' to keep Juba in
government hands.
	   He said Ugandan troops were fighting alongside the SPLA rebels
and ``have brought the best they have to this battlefield. They
wanted it to be final, and they will have it.''
	   Uganda denies it has troops in southern Sudan, but few believe
the denial.
	   SPLA Nairobi spokesman Justin Arop Yaac denied Monday the SPLA
had launched an offensive, saying recent government bombings of two
smaller rebel-held towns provoked the current fighting.
	   ``They are bombing targets where there are no troops,'' Arop
said. ``It is just wanton destruction of civilian facilities, and
we will not allow it.''
	   He accused the government of escalating the war by reinforcing
Juba.
	   On Saturday, Sudanese education minister Ibrahim Ahmed Omar
suspended classes at Sudanese universities for one month to enable
the students to take part in the fighting. An exception was made
for all-women universities.
	   Early last year, the SPLA launched a major offensive and have
captured most of the territory in southern Sudan in a region the
size of France.
	   Another round of peace talks between the government and rebels,
mediated by the regional Intergovernmental Authority on
Development, is scheduled to begin in Nairobi Oct. 5.
	   Previous rounds have resulted in deadlock.

A Turkish native gets picked in Germany's roster for Turkey game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Mustafa Dogan, a Turkish native with
German citizenship, was named Monday in a 26-man roster for
Germany's upcoming Euro 2000 qualifying match against Turkey.
	   Dogan, a 22-year-old defender, has never played for Germany
although he was on the roster of the German team earlier this month
for the ill-fated trip to Malta.
	   The trip's two games _ a slim 2-1 victory over lowly Malta and a
1-1 draw with Romania _ doomed coach Berti Vogts, who stepped down
under growing public pressure.
	   His successor Erich Ribbeck took over the job of rebuilding a
team badly shaken by its quarterfinal ouster at the World Cup.
	   But the new team looks very much like the old one, with 16
players who had already played under Vogts.
	   Germany is the defending European champion and Ribbeck's first
games as coach will be against Turkey Oct. 10 and Moldova Oct. 14,
both away from home.
	   The Germans regard the game in Turkey as the most important in
their Euro 2000 campaign.
	   Ribbeck's roster, which will be reduced to 20 or 21 men shortly
before the trip, included eight players from Bayern Munich, the
Bundesliga leader which has notched six victories in six league
games this season.
	   They include Lothar Matthaeus, the 37-year-old veteran who
retired after the World Cup only to be summoned again by Ribbeck.
	   The roster included five players with no national team
experience: Dogan, reserve goalkeeper Stefan Klos of Borussia
Dortmund, defender Yves Eigenrauch of Schalke, midfielder Carsten
Ramelow of Bayer Leverkusen and striker Carsten Jancker of Bayern
Munich.
	   Dogan has played in the Bundesliga but is now with Fenerbahce
Istanbul.
	   The squad includes another foreign-born player, Hansa Rostock
forward Oliver Neuville, a former Swiss.
	   Two players return after long absences, midfielders Dariusz Wosz
of Hertha Berlin and Ralf Weber of Eintracht Frankfurt.
	   The two Borussia Dortmund midfielders and national team
veterans, Andreas Moeller and Thomas Haessler, are missing,
however. Moeller retired after the World Cup, only to announce last
week that he was ready to return.
	   But after a conversation between Ribbeck and Moeller, the two
agreed to leave Moeller's comeback for another date. Haessler's
future is uncertain and he is struggling in Dortmund, often being
left on the bench.
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Stefan Klos (Borussia
Dortmund), Jens Lehmann (AC Milan).
	   Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Mustafa Dogan
(Fenerbahce Istanbul), Yves Eigenrauch (Schalke), Lothar Matthaeus
(Bayern Munich), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer
(Hansa Rostock)
	   Midfielders: Mario Basler (Bayern Munich), Stefan Beinlich
(Bayer Leverkusen), Marco Bode (Werder Bremen), Joerg Heinrich
(Fiorentina), Jens Jeremies (Bayern Munich), Christian Nerlinger
(Borussia Dortmund), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen), Lars
Ricken (Borussia Dortmund), Thomas Strunz (Bayern Munich), Michael
Tarnat (Bayern Munich), Ralf Weber (Eintracht Frankfurt), Dariusz
Wosz (Hertha Berlin)
	   Forwards: Oliver Bierhoff (AC Milan), Carsten Jancker (Bayern
Munich), Ulf Kirsten (Bayer Leverkusen), Olaf Marschall (FC
Kaiserslautern), Oliver Neuville (Hansa Rostock).

Auto exports down for fourth straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's auto exports fell 14.1 percent last month
compared to a year ago, with shipments falling to the United
States, Asia and Europe, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association said Monday.
	   Vehicle exports for last month totaled 316,318, marking the
fourth straight month of declines, it said.
	   Exports of cars, trucks and buses to the United States fell by
7.8 percent last month, compared to the same month last year, to
84,465 vehicles, while those to Asia were down 62.2 percent to
19,000.
	   ``The biggest reason was Asia as expected,'' said association
spokesman Hiroki Mochida.
	   Exports were likely to continue to decline for the rest of the
year with the Asian crisis going unabated, he said.
	   Exports to Europe totaled 67,772 vehicles last month, down 10.8
percent, the association said.
	   By automaker, Toyota Motor Corp. suffered a 25.0 percent fall in
exports last month, compared to the same month last year, to 88,952
vehicles. Honda Motor Co. recorded a 35.6 percent decline in
exports to 32,682 vehicles.
	   Bucking the trend was Mazda Motor Corp., partly owned by Ford
Motor Co., where exports edged up 3.4 percent to 40,053, on strong
demand for its models in Europe and Australia.
	   Exports of passenger cars dropped 12.9 percent to 251,829. Truck
exports tumbled 18.3 percent to 61,083.

U.N. conference on water resources opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Middle East must increase efforts to
improve the management of declining water resources, a U.N.
conference was told Monday.
	   The five-day conference is being held at the Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia, a regional U.N. agency based in
Beirut.
	   ``We are pressed to double our efforts toward enhancing the
management of water resources ... to rise to the challenges facing
most of the developing countries,'' said ESCWA's executive
secretary Hazem el-Beblawi in his opening statement.
	   He said this was particularly true for the Middle East, which is
burdened with arid and semi-arid zones.
	   El-Beblawi described water as a ``strategic element in forging
the political environment of the future.''
	   In the Middle East, water figures in disputes _ and peace
negotiations _ between countries.
	   Water rights have been a source of tension between Turkey and
neighboring Syria. Damascus has accused Turkey of taking more than
its fair share of water from the Euphrates River through a series
of new dams.
	   Lebanon has accused Israel of trying to divert rivers in a zone
it occupies in southern Lebanon.
	   In the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, Israel
promised Jordan additional water.
	   States and territories under ESCWA's jurisdiction are Bahrain,
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, the Palestinian
territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates
and Yemen.

	   Changes announced Monday in Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
evolving Cabinet:
	   OUT:
	   Boris Fyodorov, acting deputy prime minister and tax chief,
strongly supported market-oriented reforms and opposed printing
money. He was point man on the government's recent get-tough
campaign against tax evaders.
	   Fyodorov wasn't popular among the country's big industries _
most of which are chronic tax delinquents _ or among those who
feared he'd make good on his repeated pledges to seize assets from
companies that didn't pay their taxes.
	   Viktor Khristenko, acting deputy prime minister in charge of
state finances and macroeconomics, was a proponent of cutting
government spending to ease the financial crisis. Before his
appointment, he had worked in the Finance Ministry, as well as in
Russia's Chelyabinsk region, where he tried to tighten control over
local spending and cut waste.
	   IN:
	   Farit Gazizullin, newly reappointed state property minister, has
long worked in the area of privatizing Russia's state-owned
enterprises. Before his entry into national politics in 1996,
Gazizullin was deputy head of the semi-autonomous Tatarstan
republic and chairman of the republic's privatization committee.

Microsoft signs 6 Chinese vendors to market products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Microsoft has signed six Chinese independent
software vendors to adapt and sell its products in China, the
company announced Monday.
	   Microsoft's China division will offer technical and marketing
assistance to the six Chinese computer companies as they take key
applications _ such as Windows NT Server and Microsoft BackOffice
Suite _ and tailor them to the domestic business market.
	   In return, Microsoft will receive a share of the sales revenue,
according to people familiar with the agreement.
	   Microsoft did not disclose financial details of the agreement.
	   The new Chinese independent software vendors are China National
Computer Software and Technology Service, NEU-Alpine, Founder
Group, Sichuan Top Group, Hangzhou Singlee Electronics and Shenzhen
Kingdee Software.
	   ``The alliances demonstrate Microsoft's complete commitment to
further expanding our partnerships and investments in the China
market,'' said Microsoft Corp. vice president Charles Stevens.
	   The alliance is expected to help boost China's nascent software
industry by giving companies access to Microsoft technology.
	   Zhou Ning, vice president of Beijing-based Founder Group, said
Chinese software sellers ``aim not just meet the demands of the
local market but also to enter the worldwide market.''
	   Microsoft executives have conceded that they are holding off
introducing some products to China because of copyright piracy.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's designated new
chancellor, approached the environmental Greens party Monday about
joining his Social Democrats in a coalition government after
ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a sweeping vote for change.
	   The Social Democratic victory marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   In a stinging humiliation for the West's longest-serving leader,
Kohl and his Christian Democrats won just 35 percent of the vote,
which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it held in the
old parliament.
	   Now it is up to Schroeder -- whose Social Democrats won 41
percent of the vote -- to make good on pledges to end unemployment,
stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Monday.
	   The Social Democrats held informal talks overnight with the
Greens, which won 6.7 percent.
	   A high-ranking Social Democrat, Wolf-Michael Catenhusen, said
Monday the party leadership was expected to start coalition talks
with the Greens on Friday. Negotiations could be tough between two
parties with some sharp policy differences.
	   Though eager, 7th graf pvs.

Customs officers detain Mexican woman after seizure of cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -Customs officers have detained a Mexican woman
following the seizure of 9.2 kilograms (20.2 pounds) of cocaine
from an unclaimed suitcase at Hong Kong airport, officials said
Monday.
	   They said the cocaine, which would have fetched 11 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.4 million), was found Saturday hidden in
boxes labeled as coffee in the suitcase that arrived on a flight
from Japan.
	   The Mexican, whose name was not disclosed, was detained
following a raid on a hotel on Sunday, they said.
	   She was believed to have arrived in Hong Kong from Brazil via
Tokyo, customs officials said.
	   The 33-year-old suspect has been charged with drug-trafficking.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will resume if there are new
attacks by Albanian separatists.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to barracks _ a condition demanded
by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO attack. By
early afternoon Monday, however, there was no visible withdrawal of
the units.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   But the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army issued a statement
Monday, pledging to continue ``the holy war'' against Serbia and
demanding an urgent NATO action in Kosovo. The statement also
criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders ``whose actions are
hindering this holy war.''
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as long as
they have not committed ``war crimes,'' which was another demand to
Serbia by world officials.
	   Marjanovic also said the government would appoint a Temporary
Executive Council _ previously unknown body _ to ``strengthen
civilian structures'' in the province, where Albanians form 90
percent of the estimated 2 million population.

2,000 minks flee farm in Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ About 2,000 minks were set free by
saboteurs from a fur farm in northern Sweden overnight Monday, the
Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   No arrests were immediately made, but suspicion fell on
animal-rights activists. About 1,000 minks were set free earlier
this month from the farm in Sundsvall, 350 kilometers (210 miles)
north of Stockholm, by vandals who scrawled ``DBF'' _ the Swedish
acronym for Animal Liberation Front.
	   Animal-rights groups also this month set free some 8,000 minks
from a farm in Britain and another 4,000 were released from their
cages in Finland.

Estrada may reconsider withdrawal of Philippines as World Expo 2002
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
he would reconsider a decision to withdraw the Philippines as host
of World Expo 2002, if private firms shoulder all the costs.
	   Estrada said he doubts if the government could recover even half
of the 6 billion pesos (dlrs 135 million) needed to host the event,
adding it would be better if the money goes to projects that would
ease poverty.
	   ``I am agreeable provided they spend for everything. The
government will not spend a single cent,'' Estrada told reporters.
	   Estrada said Friday he has decided to withdraw the Philippines
as host of the exposition due to the country's economic
difficulties.
	   Former Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor said withdrawing as host
could damage the image of the Philippines to the international
community and potential investors. Gabor lobbied for the
Philippines to win in June over Australia to host the exposition.
	   Gabor said she and private corporate backers would brief Estrada
soon on the benefits of the project in an effort to convince him to
reverse his decision.
	   She said at least 3.7 million tourists would be expected to
attend the exposition. About 60 countries were expected to
participate.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos also urged Estrada to reconsider
and offered to help raise funds, officials said.
	   Estrada was concerned that the private sector may be unable to
cover half the costs as it reportedly promised because of the
economic downturn.
	   He said he preferred if the money would be used for agriculture,
like building roads and irrigation needed by poor farmers.
	   He said the event may result in what he saw as useless edifices
like costly structures that were put up at a special economic zone
north of Manila for a trade exposition last June.
	   ``It's there lying like a white elephant. I don't like to
experience the same thing. We must learn from that mistake,''
Estrada said.

German markets slightly up after Social Democratic victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Frankfurt stock exchange was trading
higher Monday contrary to expectations that a Social Democratic
victory in Germany's national elections would drive the market
down,
	   The Xetra DAX electronic index was up 53.13 points at midday, or
1.2 percent.
	   However, analysts said the market was reacting primarily to an
agreement on banking reform in Japan, and not to the German
elections.
	   They had predicted that news of a Social Democratic victory,
bringing the likelihood of a government coalition with the liberal
Greens party, would hurt the markets, as well as the German mark
and German bonds.
	   ``The Greens will be particularly worrisome,'' said Karl-Rudolf
Korte, head of a University of Munich political research group.
``For the markets and foreign companies a period of observation
will start now. They will wait to see what kind of policies the new
government will introduce.''

Public offices reopen, many Lesotho troops turn themselves in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MAS101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Thousands of public employees returned to
work Monday as government offices opened for the first time since
last week's South Africa-led intervention to forestall a coup.
	   Meanwhile, about 1,000 members of the Lesotho Defense Force
turned themselves in, as ordered, for review of their roles in
events of recent weeks. Rebels face possible punishment. Others
would be reinstated in the 2,000-member force.
	   Those who did not surrender by the end of the day would be
presumed to be rebels, officials said, and tracked down by the
South Africa and Botswana force of somewhat more than 1,000 troops.
	   ``Under the circumstances, I am very pleased,'' government
secretary Ken Tsekoa said.
	   The capital city of 50,000 was mostly calm for a third day, but
_ because of the widespread devastation caused by arson and looting
_ it won't be ``normal'' for a long time. Possibly years.
	   Hundreds of businesses were burnt down or pillaged. Several
thousand jobs disappeared in a country of 2 million that is one of
the poorest in the world. About eight of every 10 job-holders is a
public employee.
	   The security situation was largely under control, despite
incidents of sniping. Nevertheless, businessmen are uneasy about
reopening undamaged stores. Aid groups haven't restored food
distribution to rural, subsistence farming communities where most
of the people live.
	   The intervention, and political and military unrest in general
in this mountain kingdom that is surrounded by South Africa,
remained a priority for governments in the region.
	   The defense ministers of South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe
were scheduled to meet Monday in Maseru. King Letsie III was
scheduled to travel Tuesday to Cape Town for talks with South
Africa President Nelson Mandela.
	   Political instability in Lesotho underlies almost all the other
problems, analysts said.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, whose Lesotho Congress Party
won 79 of the 80 seats in parliament in elections last May, is
bitterly opposed by parties that garnered 39 percent of the vote _
but just a single seat.
	   They claim, without providing convincing evidence, that the vote
was rigged. The government and international observers say there
was little or no fraud. Balloting was via the first-past-the-post
system rather than proportional representation.
	   The two sides refuse to meet. Mosisili, whose Cabinet ministers
went into hiding following a Lesotho Defense Force insurrection
earlier this month that attempted to topple the high command,
claims the opposition intended to assassinate him.

EBRD to continue lending to Ukraine despite its financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development is determined to continue long-term cooperation with
Ukraine despite the country's shaky financial situation, a senior
bank official said Monday.
	   The EBRD will focus in particular on support for Ukraine's small
and medium businesses and the energy sector, and assistance in
privatization of the country's telecommunications and energy
companies, EBRD Vice President Charles Frank said.
	   Frank said that the situation in Ukraine was ``significantly''
different from that in Russia. Ukraine, unlike Russia, did not
default on its debt payments and has managed to restructure them on
a voluntary basis. Also, Ukraine did not permit an insolvency
crisis in the banking sector, Frank added.
	   Ukraine was badly hit by Russia's turmoil, which caused the
national currency to slide and sparked inflation. However, the
government so far has kept the situation in the financial market
under control and has prevented significant price rises.
	   The EBRD has recently expressed interest in financing the run-up
to privatizing Ukraine's telecommunications monopoly. The bank is
also considering participating in completion of a Black Sea oil
terminal and a pipeline in Ukraine, which could be used to
transport Caspian Sea oil to western Europe.
	   Frank said Ukraine could count on receiving up to dlrs 1 billion
from the EBRD for various projects currently under consideration.
	   Since Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992, the bank has approved 27
projects for the country, which collectively amount to 660 million
ecus (dlrs 725 million).

FA to announce disciplinary sanction against Italian striker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Already suspended by his club and now facing a
long ban by the Football Association, Italian striker Paolo Di
Canio has accused the referee he shoved to the ground of
play-acting.
	   An FA disciplinary panel was expected to announce sanctions
Monday against Di Canio, the Sheffield Wednesday player who pushed
referee Paul Alcock after being sent off during Saturday's 1-0 win
against Arsenal at Hillsborough.
	   Danny Wilson, Sheffield Wednesday's manager, announced an
immediate suspension of Di Canio pending sanctions from the FA.
	   The FA announced a charge of gross misconduct, which could
result in a six-month ban or even in an expulsion from the Premier
League.
	   While Di Canio's act was roundly criticized, the player took the
unusual step of accusing the referee of taking a dive.
	   ``I pushed (the ref) in the stomach,'' said Di Canio, who flew
to Italy on Sunday. ``He took 3-4 steps sideways and fell like a
player'' who dives for a penalty. ``This does not diminish the
gravity of my act, but when the sentence arrives I will raise, with
the best lawyers, the mitigating circumstances in my appeal.''
	   Di Canio claimed the ref would have received a yellow card if he
had been a player because ``it looked like soneone who was
acting.''
	   David Elleray, spokesman for English referees, described Di
Canio's claims as ``extraordinary.''
	   ``I can not imagine any referee doing anything like that,''
Elleray said. ``It is is quite clear that the one thing Paul was
trying not to do was fall down because he wanted to preserve his
dignity. He has no reason to go down because it is a very
undignified thing to happen.''
	   Alcock was pushed to the ground by the 30-year-old Italian after
he was shown a red card for his part in a brawl in the final
minutes of the first half.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   ``I made a mistake, but the responsibility also belongs to
others,'' Di Canio said. ``Everything started when Vieira brought
Jonk down. I ran towards Vieira, with whom I played at Milan, to
say to him, `Why the heck did you do that?' Keown was nearby and he
stopped me with a very painful elbow to the nose. I kicked him and
we came to blows. The referee, instead of calling both of us,
showed me a red card. An atrocious injustice.''
	   Di Canio, a former Lazio, Milan and Juventus forward,
transferred last year from Celtic to Sheffield Wednesday. His
13-year career has been marked by disciplinary problems and
controversy.

Hebron settlers attack Palestinians after shots are fired
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with information about shooting victim, settler
rampage in Palestinian market, Palestinians confirming White House
summit, restores quotes from Israeli negotiator &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Assailants firing shots from the
Palestinian sector of Hebron wounded an Israeli woman Monday, and
in retaliation Jewish settlers beat Palestinian passers-by and
overturned tables in an outdoor Arab market.
	   Several settler women, including Miriam Levinger, one of the
founders of the Jewish enclave in Hebron, sat down on the ground in
the market, refusing to be moved.
	   The violence came as the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were en
route to Washington for a three-way summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House later in the day.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat agreed to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu at the White House even though no progress had been made
toward agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Late Sunday, Arafat and Netanyahu had met for the first time in
nearly a year at the insistence of Clinton, with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright hosting the talks in New York.
	   Monday's incident in Hebron, a divided city of 130,000
Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers, began at about 11:30 a.m.
(0930 gmt) when members of an Israeli family _ in Hebron to
celebrate a bar mitzvah _ walked on the road between two Jewish
enclaves, Beit Hadassah and Tel Romeida. The army said four shots
were fired at the group, and that one bullet hit a 52-year-old
woman in the leg.
	   Israel radio said the woman was from Herzliya, north of Tel
Aviv, but her name was not given. The woman taken to a hospital in
Jerusalem.
	   In response, settlers beat several Palestinians passing by Beit
Hadassah, and witnesses said one Palestinian woman was injured. An
Israeli woman was detained in the confrontations.
	   A group of about 15 settler women and teen-age girls entered the
Palestinian open-air market and overturned several vegetable
stands, throwing cucumbers and tomatoes to the ground. Israeli
security forces initially did not interfere, but then began
ordering the women to leave.
	   Mrs. Levinger and two other settler women sat down on the
ground, refusing to be moved. They held on to each other as police
tried to drag them away. After one woman fainted and was taken away
by ambulance, Mrs. Levinger stood up.
	   Tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron rose
considerably last month after a settler rabbi was stabbed to death
in his home in Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers in the
heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. The assailant, presumably a
Palestinian militant, was never caught.
	   Despite the preparations for a White House summit on Monday,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said they didn't see much of a
chance for a breakthrough.
	   Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said that while Netanyahu
and Arafat discussed the scope of an Israeli pullback on Sunday,
they did not discuss any of the other issues, such as the opening
of a Palestinian airport, an additional Israeli withdrawal and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   ``Until now, there isn't any real progress,'' Erekat said.
	   A similar assessment came from Danny Naveh, the Israeli Cabinet
secretary. Speaking after the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting in New York,
Naveh told Israel radio that the obstacle remains Palestinian
refusal to carry out its commitments, especially stopping
extremists from attacking Israel.
	   ``We are not in the position of being able to say that an
agreement has been reached in these areas,'' he said.

Parish priest resigns after putting up cross at Auschwitz
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A parish priest in northern Poland has
resigned after putting up a cross next to the former Nazi death
camp Auschwitz, defying calls by church leaders for conservative
Catholics to stop the action.
	   Church officials indicated Monday that the decision by the Rev.
Ryszard Krol, from the village parish of Kepice, some 400
kilometers northwest of Warsaw, resulted primarily from his
deteriorating health condition.
	   The cross, which Krol's parishioners put up near Auschwitz, was
not a reason behind his resignation, or perhaps just one of
additional ``small drops,'' according to diocese chancellor, the
Rev. Leszek Wodz.
	   He would not elaborate on Krol's health, but said the priest
showed signs of ``depression'' for some time.
	   On Sept. 14, Krol's cross joined some 200 others planted by
conservative Catholics in support of an eight-meter (26-foot)
wooden cross erected in 1988 by Carmelite nuns on the site where
152 Poles were killed by the Nazis in 1941.
	   The crosses appeared after Jewish groups complained that the big
cross, used in a 1979 Mass celebrated by Polish-born Pope John Paul
II at the camp, disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million Jews
killed at Auschwitz and wanted it removed.
	   Polish bishops and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government
called in late August for conservative Catholics to stop putting up
crosses.
	   Krol, in a letter to his superiors, explained he was ``led by
emotions'' and had ``no intention to do anything against the
bishops,'' Wodz said. He said the cross has been brought back from
Auschwitz.
	   Bishop Marian Golebiowski, of the Koszalin diocese, received a
request of a leave from Krol on Sept. 18, Wodz said.
	   Krol has left his parish and formally is on an unlimited leave
as of Oct. 1.

Serb premier says Albanian `terrorism' has been defeated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes, description from Kosovo;
DELETES outdated material; EDITS to conform and trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will resume if there are new
attacks by Albanian separatists.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to their barracks _ a condition
demanded by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO
attack. By early afternoon Monday, however, there was no visible
withdrawal of the units.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   But the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army issued a statement
Monday, pledging to continue ``the holy war'' against Serbia and
demanding an urgent NATO action in Kosovo. The statement also
criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders ``whose actions are
hindering this holy war.''
	   Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
been largely routed.
	   Marjanovic also said that the government will grant amnesty to
Kosovo Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as
long as they have not committed ``war crimes.''
	   He added that the government would appoint a Temporary Executive
Council _ previously unknown body _ to ``strengthen civilian
structures'' in the province, where Albanians form 90 percent of
the estimated 2 million population.
	   Hundreds of people in the southern province of Kosovo have been
killed and some 275,000 forced to flee their homes since
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians began seven months ago.
Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Most
of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want independence.
	   Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is
the nation's top priority.
	   He said the move was in accordance with an agreement Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic signed in June with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   The U.N. Security Council has been insisting since March that
Serbs withdraw special police units and other forces from the
province and begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the
majority Albanian province.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against militant separatists
in Kosovo and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes if
Milosevic failed to comply.
	   Paddy Ashdown, leader of Britain's Liberal Democrat party who is
touring Kosovo, told reporters in Suva Reka that he had seen little
active fighting. ``We saw refugees being bumped around from one
place to another,'' he said, indicating Serbs were trying to
prevent large gatherings of refugees which draw international
attention.
	   During the parliamentary session, Gorica Gajevic, the general
secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, called on Kosovo
Albanians to open talks with the government. She denied the
government used excessive force in its clampdown.
	   ``It used as much force as was needed to stifle the evil of
terrorism, in the way other world democratic countries do when
faced with terrorism,'' she said.
	   Another member of Milosevic's party, Dusan Matkovic, said that
if the world wants to help Kosovo, it should invest ``several
hundred million dollars'' in Kosovo's mines and economy.

Williams and Walker win first batting titles, Vaughn hits 50th
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bernie Williams, Larry Walker and Greg Vaughn
also managed breakthroughs in a North American baseball season
dominated by Mark McGwire.
	   Williams won his first American League batting title Sunday,
going 2-for-2 in another historic Yankees win. He finished at .339,
two points higher than Boston's Mo Vaughn but the lowest average
for an AL champion since George Brett hit .329 in 1990.
	   ``It feels great, absolutely, when you add your name to a list
of players that have accomplished this feat,'' Williams said.
``Coming into this season, I would have never imagined it with all
the distractions, trying to get my game going, missing six weeks
with an injury. It's just very satisfying.''
	   Walker also won his first batting crown, going 2-for-4 for
Colorado to wind up at .363, nine points ahead of the Mets' John
Olerud.
	   ``I've got the same feeling as I did last year when I won the
MVP,'' said Walker, who stopped Tony Gwynn's streak of four
straight National League titles. ``But I'm not greedy on all this
individual stuff. The bottom line for me is to win a
championship.''
	   McGwire, whose 70 homers shattered Roger Maris' mark of 61, and
Sammy Sosa, who had 66 going into his final regular-season game
Monday, also set other records.
	   Sosa, who will lead the major leagues in RBIs, has 158 for the
Cubs, the highest NL total since the Cubs' Hack Wilson set the
major league record with 190 in 1930. Sosa's 414 total bases are
the most in the majors since Stan Musial had 429 in 1948.
	   McGwire walked 162 times for the Cardinals, tying Ted Williams
(1947, 1949) for the second highest total in major league history
behind Babe Ruth's 170 in 1923. McGwire's .752 slugging percentage
was the highest in the majors since Ruth (.772) in 1927 and the
highest in the NL since Rogers Hornsby (.756) in 1925.
	   Juan Gonzalez of the Rangers had 157 RBIs, the most in the AL
since teammates Ted Williams and Vern Stephens had 159 in 1949.
	   When Greg Vaughn hit his 50th homer for San Diego at Arizona on
Sunday, he made it four 50-homer players in a single season _
double the previous high.
	   McGwire won his first NL home run title after leading AL twice
and topping the majors with 58 last season for Oakland and St.
Louis.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. won his third AL home run title, leading with 56
for the second straight season.
	   With 114 wins, the Yankees set an AL record and finished with
the second most ever, trailing only the 1906 Cubs, who went 116-36.
New York (114-48) had a .704 winning percentage, the highest in the
majors since the 1954 Cleveland Indians went 111-43 (.721).
	   Randy Johnson led the majors in strikeouts for the fifth time,
fanning 329, but didn't win the title in either league. Johnson
fanned 213 for Seattle, then got 116 more for Houston as he went
10-1 after the July 31 trade.
	   Philadelphia's Curt Shilling led the NL with 300 strikeouts, 19
fewer than last year. He became the fifth pitcher to reach 300 in
consecutive seasons, joining J.R. Richard (1978-79), Nolan Ryan
(1972-74, 1976-77), Sandy Koufax (1965-66) and Rube Waddell
(1903-04).
	   Toronto's Roger Clemens fanned 271 to win his fifth AL strikeout
title. Clemens ended the season unbeaten in his final 22 starts
after losing to Cleveland on May 29, the longest streak since
Baltimore's Dave McNally went 26 straight starts without a loss in
1969. Clemens won his final 15 decisions.
	   Clemens finished 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA. Last year, when he won
his fourth Cy Young Award, he went 21-7 with a 2.05 ERA and 292
strikeouts, becoming the first AL pitcher to lead in all three
categories since Detroit's Hal Newhouser in 1945. This year, he led
in ERA and strikeouts and tied Texas' Rick Helling (20-7) and New
York's David Cone (20-7) in wins.
	   Atlanta's Tom Glavine led the NL in wins, going 20-6. Braves
teammate Greg Maddux won his fourth ERA title, finishing at 2.22.
	   Atlanta pitchers had 1,232 strikeouts, tied with last year's
Dodgers for the second most in major league history behind the 1996
Braves (1,245). The Braves had five pitchers with 16 or more wins _
Glavine, Maddux (18-9), John Smoltz (17-3), Kevin Millwood (17-8)
and Denny Neagle (16-11). They joined the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates
as the only teams to accomplish the feat.
	   San Diego's Trevor Hoffman got his 53rd save Sunday night, tying
the NL record set by current teammate Randy Myers, who did it for
the Cubs in 1993. Boston's Tom Gordon led the AL with 45 saves.
	   Oakland's Rickey Henderson won his record 12th stolen base
title, swiping 66 to lead the AL for the first time since 1991.
Tony Womack topped the NL with 58 and became the first Pittsburgh
player to lead the league since Omar Moreno in 1979.

Canadian embassy grounds occupied by Kosovo-Albanian refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with police ready to clear embassy grounds,
refugees identified as Albanians from Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police surrounded the Canadian embassy
Monday after 34 ethnic Albanian refugees pushed their way into the
building and demanded political ayslum.
	   Hungarian police said the group has been identified as ethnic
Albanians from Yugoslavia's war-torn Kosovo province.
	   ``The group entered the embassy grounds a few minutes after 10
a.m. (0800 GMT) and demanded to be granted political asylum,'' said
police spokesman Mihaly Dezsi in a telephone interview.
	   He added that the 18 adults and 16 children had been housed at a
refugee camp in Bicske, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Budapest, since they had escaped to Hungary from Yugoslavia.
	   It was not known what made them decide to go to the Canadian
embassy.
	   Dezsi said the embassy had asked police to be ready to clear the
embassy grounds.
	   Embassy officials, engaged in the negotiations, were not
available for comment.
	   Hungarian police have sealed off the area around the embassy,
which is a fenced-in compound of two larger buildings in the hills
of Buda, a quiet residential part of the city.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The body of a British naval officer, killed in
a Lynx helicopter crash into the South China Sea last week, was
recovered Monday by divers.
	   The body of Lt. Toby Beale, 27, reportedly of Weymouth, England,
was found among the wreckage by Singapore salvage divers and was
being returned to shore by a Singapore naval vessel, the RSS
Valiant.
	   A ceremonial guard from the British frigate HMS Grafton prepared
to perform a parade of honor at the naval berths at Sembawang Wharf
just before midnight, when the Valiant was due to arrive, said a
statement from the Royal Navy.
	   Beale's body will be sent home after medical and legal
documentation is completed, said David Healy, a spokesman for the
Royal Navy. The salvage team will continue operations to recover
the wrecked helicopter, he said, and a Royal Navy Board of Inquiry
is investigating the cause of the Sept. 23 crash.
	   The helicopter pilot, Lt. Cmdr. Andy Hurry, 36, reportedly of
Torquay, England, survived the crash. It occurred in deep waters
about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Singapore.

Anwar's supporters continue protests on national holiday

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police on Monday chased
through the streets of the Malaysian capital thousands of
demonstrators demanding the release of a popular former deputy
prime minister.
	   Witnesses saw police grabbing dozens of protesters and pushing
them into police buses. But police refused to say how many were
detained. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's decision to fire and arrest
Anwar Ibrahim, his former heir apparent, has stirred anger among
those hoping for political reform _ Anwar's main platform until his
arrest last Sunday.
	   Undaunted by police batons, tear gas and nearly 150 arrests,
several thousand Anwar supporters continued protests Monday, a
national holiday, for the fourth straight day.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' they marched from a
courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   Policemen, drumming their shields, advanced and then began to
chase them through the lanes and into the main shopping district
where startled holiday shoppers huddled into corners.
	   Police also turned their wrath on reporters and photographers,
shouting ``Go, go, go!''
	   A local human rights group, SUARAM, said 60 people were
arrested. Among them was Tien Chua, the chairman of the newly
formed Coalition for People's Democracy, an umbrella group of
organizations that back Anwar, SUARAM spokeswoman Elizabeth Wong
said.
	   Anwar and 16 of his associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
Neither Anwar nor any of his detained allies have been arraigned in
a court.
	   Anwar has been accused of crimes that include unlawful
homosexual acts and leaking state secrets. He has denied the
charges, saying they were politically motivated.
	   His arrest has drawn strong support from Lim Kit Siang, his
one-time political foe and the opposition leader of Parliament, who
has called for the Parliament to investigate allegations of
corruption leveled against both Anwar and Mahathir.
	   ``What Malaysians want to know are all the full facts about
corruption, cronyism and nepotism _ regardless of whether they
affect Mahathir or Anwar,'' said Lim in a statement.
	   In a home videotape made on the night of his arrest, Anwar
accused his former boss of allowing his commercial interests and
those of his family and cronies to sway his judgment on public
spending and controls.
	   Mahathir, in turn, has said his designated heir didn't know how
to manage the economy. Malaysia, after years of phenomenal growth,
slipped into a recession this year under the impact of the Asian
economic crisis.
	   Protests, unheard of for nearly a decade, are becoming a regular
feature in Kuala Lumpur.
	   On Sunday, more than 10,000 supporters trudged for several
kilometers (miles) to attend a gathering organized by Malaysia's
opposition Islamic party after police had blocked cars from
entering a village road.
	   A day before, police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon
to disperse a rally of more than 3,000 people. Twenty-nine
Malaysians were arrested.
	   Even small public gatherings and outdoor assemblies in Malaysia
require police permits.

Eds: CORRECTS spelling of last name to ``Agaryov.'' &HT;    ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A high-ranking official
responsible for providing municipal services in St. Petersburg was
killed early Monday in a bombing.

<TEXT>
	   Yevgeny Agaryov, the deputy chairman of the northern city's

300 workers at Chinese paint factory hold protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Three hundred workers at a paint factory in
northern China protested outside government offices on Monday,
calling for unpaid back wages and an investigation into corruption,
a human rights group reported.
	   Workers at the No. 2 Xi'an Paint Factory said management at the
state-owned factory had used it for their personal profit, piling
up losses to the factory until it had to close, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said in a statement.
	   Workers claimed they had not been paid wages for half a year,
the group said.
	   Three hours after the protest began, a government official told
the workers the government would pay part of their wages beginning
Tuesday and would investigate the managers, it said, adding that
the workers then dispersed and there were no arrests.
	   Similar protests have erupted throughout China as struggling
state factories lay off millions of workers. Many have ended
quietly when the government has met at least some of the workers'
demands.

Yad Vashem: Generali insured more than 100,000 Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ At least 100,000 Jews took out life insurance
policies with Italy's largest insurance company before they
perished in the Nazi Holocaust in World War II, the head of
Israel's Holocaust research center said Monday.
	   The estimate by Avner Shalev, chairman of the Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial, is based on information provided by the company
itself, Assicurazioni Generali. The Jerusalem Post daily said this
marked the first time an actual number of policy holders was cited.
	   Generali, which reneged last week on an agreement to pay dlrs
100 million to policyholders and their heirs, has come under
criticism for not making public information on wartime policies.
	   The company provided Yad Vashem about six months ago with
information on some 300,000 World War II policies. Yad Vashem
randomly sampled and cross-referenced that information with its own
data bases to reach its conclusion on the number of Jewish
policyholders, Shalev told The Associated Press.
	   Under the terms of its agreement with Generali, Yad Vashem is
not allowed to publish the information it received from the company
but only to use it for its own research.
	   ``We have reached an understanding with Generali that we should
not provide (publish) the names of individuals unless Generali will
change their minds,'' Shalev said. ``We are doing it for the sake
of research and enriching our lists.''
	   Generali is one of 16 European insurance companies named in a
federal class-action suit filed last year in New York. Another suit
was filed in February in a Los Angeles Superior Court by family
members of five Holocaust victims.

Oil company acknowledges fraud attempt at London office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said Monday
that an attempt to defraud its London-based subsidiary, Kuwait
Petroleum International, had been foiled.
	   KPC did not say in its statement how much money was involved,
but press reports earlier put the amount at 300,000 British pounds
(dlrs 507,000).
	   The statement said that officials at the Kuwait Petroleum
International ``discovered an attempt to steal and forge signatures
on six company checks.'' It did not say when the incident took
place. The company manages Kuwait's refining and marketing
interests abroad.
	   KPC said that four of the checks were blocked before they were
cashed or deposited and that the accounts of the ``culprits where
the other two were deposited were frozen.''
	   It said the matter was under investigation by the company and
that KPI was cooperating with British police. It gave no other
details.
	   On Sunday, the independent Al-Qabas daily said that the incident
involved cleaners who worked at KPI.
	   The newspaper said that the cleaners allegedly took checks,
forged the signatures of KPI officials, cashed the checks and
disappeared.
	   Al-Qabas said they were from an African country, but did not
identify the country by name.

Primakov says Russia has paid off debts to soldiers; students next
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official speaking about plans to nationalize
industries, banks, strengthen currency controls in new grafs
12-13. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has paid off its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces, and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday.
	   Since his appointment nearly three weeks ago, Primakov has
stressed that payment of salaries and pensions will be his
government's priority as it grapples with Russia's grave economic
crisis.
	   The stark conditions for soldiers have made the debt to the
military a potent political issue for the government's critics.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant daily earlier
this month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4
billion) in back salaries and social payments. Of that sum, roughly
10 percent was owed to the military.
	   Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin also focused on efforts to wrap
up the formation of the new Cabinet _ a painful process that has
stretched into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats remain unfilled.
	   In a blow to the proponents of market-oriented reform, Boris
Fyodorov was dismissed from his posts of acting deputy prime
minister and tax chief, Russian news agencies reported. His exit
leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin reappointed to the post of
finance minister on Friday, as the strongest supporter of reform in
the evolving Cabinet.
	   Zadornov is associated with the previous Cabinet's decision on
Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze domestic debt _ a
controversial move that many blame for fueling Russia's crisis.
	   Zadornov defended himself over the weekend, saying the former
government had few viable alternatives. He pledged to improve the
terms of the government's debt repayment.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multibillion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   No details of the restructuring plan have yet been released
officially. Shokhin said that under the plan, investors would be
able to redeem their defaulted treasury bills in rubles but the
proceeds would be frozen in special accounts for six months.
	   Dmitry Vasilyev, the head of the Federal Commission on
Securities and Capital Markets, said he had submitted his
resignation in protest over unfair treatment of investors and what
he described as plans to nationalize industries and banks and
tighten controls over the currency market.
	   ``These are recipes from the old Soviet past,'' he said.
Vasilyev, who spoke at a news conference, claimed that the
government and the Central Bank were planning to take controlling
stakes in bankrupt industrial enterprises and banks. He provided no
specifics.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis.
	   _ The amount of private bank deposits fell by 6.5 percent to
about 151 billion rubles (currently dlrs 10 billion) last month as
people scrambled to pull their money out of failing banks.
	   _ Russia's foreign trade turnover shrank by 4.3 percent in the
first eight months of the year, totaling 83.7 billion dollars, said
the State Statistics Committee.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

Three peacekeepers wounded in mine blast in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Three peacekeepers were wounded on
Monday when their armored vehicle struck a mine in Georgia's
breakaway region of Abkhazia.
	   The blast occurred in the village of Otoboya, in the Gali
district, which is patrolled by peacekeepers from the Commonwealth
of Independent States, a group of former Soviet republics.
	   Georgia lost Abkhazia, a region on the Black Sea, to
secessionist forces in 1993 after 13 months of fighting. Around
250,000 Georgians were forced to flee their homes.
	   Russian peacekeepers, ostensibly a Commonwealth of Independent
States force with the blessing of the United Nations, have kept the
two sides apart since June 1994, enforcing a security zone between
Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia.

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shots fired from the Palestinian sector
of Hebron injured an Israeli woman, and Jewish settlers responded
by beating Palestinian passers-by and overturning tables in an
outdoor Arab market.
	   Several female Jewish settlers, including Miriam Levinger, one
of the founders of the Jewish enclave in Hebron, sat on the ground
in the market, refusing to be moved.
	   The violence came as Israeli and Palestinian leaders scheduled a
meeting in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton later Monday
in hopes of concluding an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in New York late Sunday. It was their first face-to-face
meeting in nearly a year.
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat had agreed to
meet with Netanyahu at the White House even though no progress had
been made toward agreement on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Monday's incident in Hebron, a divided city of 130,000
Palestinians and 450 Jewish settlers, began Monday morning when
members of an Israeli family _ in Hebron to celebrate a bar mitzvah
_ walked on the road between two Jewish enclaves, Beit Hadassah and
Tel Romeida. The army said four shots were fired at the group, and
that one bullet hit a 52-year-old woman in the leg.
	   Israel radio said the woman was from Herzliya, north of Tel
Aviv, but her name was not given. The woman taken to a hospital in
Jerusalem.
	   In response, settlers beat several Palestinians passing by Beit
Hadassah, and witnesses said one Palestinian woman was injured. An
Israeli woman was detained in the confrontations.
	   A group of about 15 settler women and teen-age girls entered the
Palestinian open-air market and overturned several vegetable
stands, throwing cucumbers and tomatoes to the ground. Israeli
security forces initially did not interfere, but then began
ordering the women to leave.
	   Mrs. Levinger and two other settler women sat on the ground,
refusing to be moved. They held on to each other as police tried to
drag them away. After one woman fainted and was taken away by
ambulance, Mrs. Levinger stood up.
	   Tensions between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in Hebron rose
considerably last month after a settler rabbi was stabbed to death
in his home in Tel Romeida, a cluster of several trailers in the
heart of a Palestinian neighborhood. The assailant was never
caught.
	   Despite the preparations for a White House summit on Monday,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said they didn't see much of a
chance for a breakthrough.
	   Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said that while Netanyahu
and Arafat discussed the scope of an Israeli pullback on Sunday,
they did not discuss any of the other issues, such as the opening
of a Palestinian airport, an additional Israeli withdrawal and a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   ``Until now, there isn't any real progress,'' Erekat said.
	   A similar assessment came from Danny Naveh, the Israeli Cabinet
secretary. Speaking after the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting in New York,
Naveh told Israel radio that the obstacle remains Palestinian
refusal to carry out its commitments, especially stopping
extremists from attacking Israel.
	   ``We are not in the position of being able to say that an
agreement has been reached in these areas,'' he said.

Serb premier says Albanian `terrorism' has been defeated
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 10 grafs to restore first reference to Milosevic. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will resume if there are new
attacks by Albanian separatists.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to their barracks _ a condition
demanded by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO
attack. By early afternoon Monday, however, there was no visible
withdrawal of the units.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   But the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army issued a statement
Monday, pledging to continue ``the holy war'' against Serbia and
demanding an urgent NATO action in Kosovo. The statement also
criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders ``whose actions are
hindering this holy war.''
	   Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
been largely routed.
	   Marjanovic also said that the government will grant amnesty to
Kosovo Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days as
long as they have not committed ``war crimes.''
	   He added that the government would appoint a Temporary Executive
Council _ previously unknown body _ to ``strengthen civilian
structures'' in the province, where Albanians form 90 percent of
the estimated 2 million population.
	   Hundreds of people in the southern province of Kosovo have been
killed and some 275,000 forced to flee their homes since Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians began
seven months ago. Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic
in Yugoslavia. Most of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians want
independence.
	   Marjanovic made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo is
the nation's top priority.
	   He said the move was in accordance with an agreement Milosevic
signed in June with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian striker Paolo Di Canio of Sheffield
Wednesday was charged with misconduct Monday by the Football
Association for shoving a referee to the ground _ an act which
could result in a lengthy ban from the English game.
	   The FA gave Di Canio 14 days to respond to the charge and
request a personal hearing over what was described as a ``reported
assault'' on referee Paul Alcock.
	   Di Canio pushed Alcock after being sent off during Saturday's
1-0 win against Arsenal at Hillsborough.
	   Danny Wilson, Sheffield Wednesday's manager, announced an
immediate suspension of Di Canio pending sanctions from the FA.

Russia hopes new German government won't abandon strong ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government said Gerhard Schroeder's
election as German chancellor was an opening for closer ties
between the two countries, while Russian leftists cheered the
victory as ``a sign of our times.''
	   The two countries should ``avoid pauses in Russian-German
cooperation,'' Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir
Rakhmanin said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Rakhmanin said that Russia wants to establish ``direct and
regular contacts'' with Schroeder and the Social Democratic Party,
hoping the new government will ``continue to strengthen relations
of good-neighborliness, partnership, and mutual trust,'' Interfax
reported.
	   Germany is Russia's main trading partner outside the former
Soviet Union, and Russia is eager for German help as it weathers
its worst financial crisis in years.
	   Communist leader and parliament deputy Gennady Zyuganov was more
ebullient, calling the outcome ``a sign of our times'' that
indicates leftist governments are gaining popularity across Europe.
	   ``A new epoch is coming. Many countries have become much more
leftist in nature. It is symptomatic that leftist forces have come
to power in 12 of the 15 major European states, including France,
Italy and Germany,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry paid tribute to former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose friendship with President Boris
Yeltsin is well known in Russia.
	   Germany's outgoing leader ``without a doubt has played an
outstanding role in the history of Germany and the whole of Europe
at one of the most crucial stages of their history,'' Rakhmanin
said, according to Interfax.

Islamic Jihad leader released from Palestinian prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The leader of the Palestinian
militant group Islamic Jihad has been released from a Palestinian
jail after six weeks.
	   Abdallah Shami said Monday he was held for writing an article in
which he criticized Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. The
article appeared in the Gaza City weekly Al Istiqlal.
	   Shami was released Sunday. He said he was treated well in
prison.
	   Islamic Jihad and its larger sister group, Hamas, oppose the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and have claimed responsibility
for attacks that have killed scores of Israelis since the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords in 1993.
	   Israel and the United States have demanded that Arafat crack
down on the militant groups and arrest senior figures. Israel has
complained that Arafat was engaged in a revolving-door policy,
detaining militants for show and then releasing them.

Singapore's prime minister lowers growth forecast again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has predicted
almost no economic growth for Singapore this year, warning that his
people must be prepared for a possible recession next year.
	   ``We have been telling our people to exercise restraint in wage
increase and we are talking about wage freeze now,'' Goh said in a
Sept. 11 interview with Chilean journalists, without elaborating.
	   The government released a transcript of the interview Monday to
coincide with Goh's visit to Chile Wednesday and Thursday.
	   ``This year, the growth will be minimal, at around zero to 1
percent at most, which means we have been affected by about 7
percentage points in growth as a result of the crisis in the
region,'' Goh said.
	   Goh's forecast was the government's third downward revision for
economic growth for this year. The official forecast for the gross
domestic product is between 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.
	   The Singapore economy grew 7.8 percent last year but growth has
since slowed sharply. The economy grew 6.1 percent in the first
quarter but slowed further to register a rise of only 1.6 percent
in the second quarter.
	   ``We are still up there and could be dragged down by those who
fell,'' Goh said of the Asian economic crisis that has seen near
financial collapse in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and South
Korea.
	   ``Indonesia and Malaysia, for example, are our major trading
partners.
shape because their government was not like others in the region,
Goh told the Chileans the government is now preparing the
island-state's 3.2 million people for a letdown.
	   ``We are preparing our people for a possible recession next year
so that if it comes, Singaporeans would not be taken by surprise,''
Goh said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Social Democratic victory marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   The Greens, which won 6.7 percent, get their first shot at
entering government if the talks are successful. Schroeder said his
party would try to assemble a coalition as quickly as possible. But
negotiations could be difficult between two parties with widely
differing policies.
	   Schroeder offered assurances that Germany's foreign policy would
remain constant, addressing anxieties about how the pacifist wing
of the Greens might affect Germany's role in NATO and in
international security.

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
arrived in Morroco on Monday after renewing threats of a NATO
airstrike unless Serb forces end their offensive in Kosovo.
	   Cohen was to meet Monday afternoon with King Hassan II, as well
as the Moroccan prime minister and other senior officials in the
North African kingdom.
	   Earlier Monday in Rome, Cohen and Italian Defense Minister
Beniamino Andreatta said the planning for airstrikes was completed.
	   Both Cohen and Andreatta urged Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic yet again to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict
with ethnic Albanian rebels in the embattled province of Kosovo.
	   Cohen said ``a very strong, credible threat must be made to Mr.
Milosevic to back away from what he is currently doing.''
	   He said Milosevic should pull his military and police forces
back to allow for humanitarian missions, ``and sit down at the
bargaining table to peacefully resolve the issue of Kosovo.''
	   NATO has set no deadline, but Cohen and Andreatta spoke of the
onset of winter and the hardships it would mean for refugees hiding
out in Kosovo's countryside.
	   Cohen said some 50,000 people ``run the risk of either starving
to death or freezing to death.''
	   ``Winter is coming and we are pressed for time,'' Andreatta
said.
	   Later Monday, the Serb government appeared to set the stage for
bowing to NATO demands. It said the rebels had been defeated and
special police units would return to barracks _ a condition
demanded by the Americans and Europeans to avoid NATO attack.
	   Cohen's visit to Morocco was the final stop on a trip that has
taken him to Portugal, Macedonia, Bosnia and Italy. He is scheduled
to returned to Washington on Tuesday.

	   Yevgeny Agaryov, the deputy chairman of the northern city's

	   The Greens have warned the Social Democrats not to try to shore

liberal Free Democrats that were Kohl's junior coalition partners.
They won 6.2 percent.
	   ``Our signal is clear: according to us there can only be
negotiations with one party,'' said Heide Ruehle, a Greens' party
leader.
	   Already, Schroeder has ruled out including the ex-communist
Party of Democratic Socialism, which won enough votes to stay in
parliament. Many in the west view the party as a troubling remnant
of the former communist East German state.
	   Schroeder's announcement of talks indicated he was tapping the

England coach dismisses claims of doping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle has dismissed
suggestions by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson that
England's World Cup players were given potentially dangerous
performance-enhancing substances.
	   ``I'm afraid some people must have their heads in the sand,''
Hoddle said in an interview in Monday's Daily Telegraph. ``To
suggest there is anything wrong or that the players are on drugs is
outrageous. It is so far from the truth.''
	   Hoddle said each member of the England squad had his blood
tested before the World Cup and was given vitamin and mineral
supplements. Two players were prescribed boosters, administered
voluntarily by injection, before the match against Colombia, he
said.
	   Ferguson, whose players made up the bulk of the England team,
has written to the Football Association questioning the practice
and demanding to know details of the pre-game injections.
	   ``You wonder about the long-term effects on players,'' Ferguson
said. ``I have looked into all of this but when you use these
methods you have to also remember there is a side effect.
	   ``There is another aspect when you punish your body with
chemicals and things like that _ you are putting things in the body
that aren't normally there.''
	   Hoddle said all the pills and inections were legal and
prescribed by Dr. Yann Rougier, who worked with Arsenal last
season.
	   ``Dr. Rougier has worked with the best in the world in the last
15 years, with AC Milan and Monaco and individual athletes,''
Hoddle said.
	   Among the products taken by England players was creatine, a
legal muscle-building compound that is widely used by soccer
players and other athletes throughout the world.
	   On another issue, Hoddle said he expects to sign a new two-year
contract as England coach by Friday. He said he is not interested,
for now, in extending his contract for four years through the 2002
World Cup.
	   ``I'm not looking for a new four-year deal, not from this
distance,'' he said. ``If we qualify for the (2000) European
Championship, that might be the time to look further ahead for
myself and the FA.''
	   A large section of the British media has been pushing for Hoddle
to resign or be fired. Newspapers, particularly tabloids, have
attacked Hoddle over his World Cup memoirs and his ties with faith
healer Eileen Drewery.
	   But Hoddle insisted he could cope with the media pressure.
	   ``People will push and push and push on different elements
because they have got to sell papers,'' he said. ``If I have to
take that, I'll take it. Up to a point.''
	   On Friday, Hoddle will name the England squad for the upcoming
Euro 2000 qualifier against Bulgaria. Even though midfielders David
Beckham and Paul Ince are suspended, Hoddle dismissed speculation
that he will bring Middlesbrough's Paul Gascoigne back into the
fold.
	   ``He has got to get ultra-fit and back to his very best form,''
Hoddle said. ``He hasn't had the opportuntiy to do that yet. He has
missed too many games. But we are keeping a close eye on the
situation though.''

Belgian team doctor claims two-thirds of cycling doctors in bad
</HEADLINE>
faith
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Two-thirds of the doctors involved in
cycling are resorting to doping, using increasingly sophisticated
drugs in the quest for financial rewards, the medical chief of the
sport's Belgian federation said Monday.
	   ``I'm afraid we're talking about two out of three. There are too
many people operating in bad faith and they drag down the others,''
Dr. Joost De Maeseneer said.
	   He hopes the Oct. 5 Congress of the International Cycling Union
in Maastricht, the Netherlands, would start cleaning up the sport,
which was hit hard by a drugs scandal at its premier event the Tour
de France over the summer.
	   ``We have to make sure we can start turning things around,'' he
told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   His comments came after the Brussels daily Het Nieuwsblad
reported that the Belgian cycling federation issued a formal
complaint against the Festina team doctor Eric Ryckaert for his
involvement in the Tour scandal.
	   Ryckaert was imprisoned during the Tour after more than 400
doping products, including the endurance enhancing EPO drug, were
found in a Festina team car. The team was expelled from the Tour.
Rumors and accusations involving several other teams have since
cast a shadow over the sport.
	   ``We were in a relatively quiet period until five years ago,''
said De Maeseneer. ``Then came the excesses. The rise of EPO
certainly played its role, and so did the increased pressure of
sponsors.'' Dr. De Maeseneer has been involved in top cycling for
17 years.
	   The discovery of EPO in the Festina car was the first time the
drug could be linked so clearly to cycling.
	   Apart from doctors meddling in illegal drugs in the professional
circuit, De Maeseneer was also alarmed by the increasing use of
doping in cycling's youth divisions. ``We are seeing that certain
people are giving illegal drugs to youngsters now. That cannot
be,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Britain's Princess Anne laid a wreath
Monday at the site of the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. embassy in
which 248 people, 12 of them Americans, lost their lives.
	   Most of the dead were killed when an adjacent building, housing
a teachers' cooperative, collapsed.
	   The British government has pledged 150 million shillings (dlrs
2.5 million) to help replace teaching equipment destroyed in the
blast.
	   Queen Elizabeth's only daughter is in Africa on an 11-day tour
of charity projects she supports in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and
Mauritius.
	   In Kenya, she was scheduled to visit a refugee camp near the
Sudanese border, schools in Nairobi and a women lawyers' center in
the western town of Kisumu.
	   -----
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The capital was tense Monday following
clashes between rival militiamen. Five people were killed and seven
others wounded.
	   In two separate incidents Sunday, militiamen fought street
battles in the northern and southern parts of the city, and the
wife of Abdelaziz Ahmed Mahdi, a well-known businessman and soccer
coach, was kidnapped.
	   At one point, sources said, her abductors held a gun to her head
and told those trying to rescue her they would kill her on the spot
of the shooting did not stop. Elders were then sent to negotiate
with the captors, but the woman was not released.
	   Since the announcement two months ago of a joint administration
for the war-torn capital to allow the reopening of the airport and
port, security has worsened as militiamen marked for demobilization
attempt to exort as much money as possible.
	   -----
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina (AP) _ The main opposition party said it
will boycott presidential elections scheduled for November.
	   Speaking at a party meeting, Joseph Ki Zerbo, head of the Party
for Democracy and Progress, said Sunday, ``The boycott aims at
ensuing a minimum of democracy before it is too late.''
	   The Nov. 15 balloting is the second since President Blaise
Campaore took power in a bloody 1987 coup. He won the 1991
elections as the sole candidate. Other parties boycotted.
	   Opposition members accuse the government of setting up a sham
national electoral commission to oversee this year's vote.
	   Although civic and opposition groups will be represented on the
27-member commission, the top two posts are reserved for appointees
of the government.
	   -----
	   GABORONE, Botswana (AP) _ The stock market that soared 100
percent last year has risen just 0.2 percent in the last three
months. Analysts predict tough times lie ahead.
	   ``We are in for a year of stagnation. There will be little
movement in share prices until the price earnings ratios improve --
and that will take 12 months,'' Botswana Insurance Fund manager
Alan Norrie said on Monday.
	   The chief executive of Stockbrokers Botswana, Rupert McCammon,
said after years of sustained growth, there would be a longer
cooling off period before the situation improved.
	   ``In the short to medium term we are unlikely to see any
increase in prices. In the longer term it will depend on sentiment
towards the emerging markets,'' he was quoted as telling the South
African Press Association.
	   -----
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Former rebel group UNITA staged several
attacks in two rural provinces last week, killing an army officer,
a policeman and injuring four others, news reports said Monday.
	   UNITA troops Saturday attacked and occupied Calandula, in the
central Malanje province, some 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of
Luanda, state weekly Actual Fax quoted an unnamed army officer as
saying.
	   Also in Malanje, an anti-tank mine killed an army officer and
injured four others last week, according to the report. In the
far-eastern province of LundaSul, gunmen staged an ambush last
week, killing a policeman, the army officer told the weekly.
	   General lawlessness in the sprawling southwest African country
have made it difficult for foreign observers to reach outlying
areas and help determine the perpetrators of the attacks.
	   The government has said remnants of UNITA's 70,000-strong
guerilla army are responsible. The former rebels have angrily
rejected the accusations and blame roaming gangs of bandits for the
incidents.
	   UNITA fought a two-decade civil war against the government
before signing a 1994 U.N.-sponsored peace deal in Lusaka, Zambia,
which remains to be fully implemented.
	   -----
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Cheick Mohammed Cherif, one of the
Ivory Coast's most popular jazz musicians, has died, newspapers
reported Monday.
	   Cherif, popularly called Cheick Smith, after American jazz
musician Jimmy Smith, died Friday night in a car accident in the
commercial capital Abidjan, on the way to a concert,
Fraternite-Matin newspaper reported. He was 44.
	   The Guinea-born musician settled in the Ivory Coast at the age
of 16 and became an integral part of the national jazz scene. He
was famous for blending traditional instruments and rhythms with
modern instruments.

Iraqi Kurdish group rejects truce offer by Turkish Kurdish rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An Iraqi Kurdish group turned down a
unilateral cease-fire declared by rival Turkish Kurdish rebels in
northern Iraq, the Iraqi group said Monday.
	   The truce was declared Sunday by the Turkish Kurdish guerrillas
of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, the German-based Kurdish
news agency DEM said.
	   ``We have nothing to talk to them about,'' said Faik Nerweyi, a
spokesman for the Iraqi group, the Kurdistan Democratic Party. ``We
don't want them in northern Iraq at all.''
	   The cease-fire comes two weeks after an agreement was signed
between Democratic Party and its Iraqi Kurdish rival, the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan, for a joint administration of the de facto
autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Iraq.
	   The groups committed themselves to fighting the PKK in a move to
appease Turkey. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy within
Turkey and uses northern Iraq as a base to launch attacks.
	   The cease-fire announcement was apparently a political maneuver
by the PKK to maintain its presence in northern Iraq, where it is
greatly outnumbered by the Iraqi Kurdish forces.
	   The war between Turkish troops and Turkish Kurdish rebels has
killed some 37,000 people since 1984.

Primakov says Russia has paid off debts to soldiers; students next
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf `According to ...,' to include
explanation of source of repayment. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has paid off its debt in back
salaries to the armed forces, and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
President Boris Yeltsin on Monday.
	   Since his appointment nearly three weeks ago, Primakov has
stressed that payment of salaries and pensions will be his
government's priority as it grapples with Russia's grave economic
crisis.
	   The stark conditions for soldiers have made the debt to the
military a potent political issue for the government's critics.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant daily earlier
this month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4
billion) in back salaries and social payments. Of that sum, roughly
10 percent was owed to the military.
	   The government did not say where it got the money to pay the
back wages. There have been no indication that the Central Bank
printed new money for the repayment, so it presumably came from
funds previously allocated to other purposes.
	   Primakov's meeting with Yeltsin also focused on efforts to wrap
up the formation of the new Cabinet _ a painful process that has
stretched into a third week as 10 Cabinet seats remain unfilled.
	   In a blow to the proponents of market-oriented reform, Boris
Fyodorov was dismissed from his posts of acting deputy prime
minister and tax chief, Russian news agencies reported. His exit
leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin reappointed to the post of
finance minister on Friday, as the strongest supporter of reform in
the evolving Cabinet.
	   Zadornov is associated with the previous Cabinet's decision on
Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze domestic debt _ a
controversial move that many blame for fueling Russia's crisis.
	   Zadornov defended himself over the weekend, saying the former
government had few viable alternatives. He pledged to improve the
terms of the government's debt repayment.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multibillion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   No details of the restructuring plan have yet been released
officially. Shokhin said that under the plan, investors would be
able to redeem their defaulted treasury bills in rubles but the
proceeds would be frozen in special accounts for six months.
	   Dmitry Vasilyev, the head of the Federal Commission on
Securities and Capital Markets, said he had submitted his
resignation in protest over unfair treatment of investors and what
he described as plans to nationalize industries and banks and
tighten controls over the currency market.
	   ``These are recipes from the old Soviet past,'' he said.
Vasilyev, who spoke at a news conference, claimed that the
government and the Central Bank were planning to take controlling
stakes in bankrupt industrial enterprises and banks. He provided no
specifics.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis.
	   _ The amount of private bank deposits fell by 6.5 percent to
about 151 billion rubles (currently dlrs 10 billion) last month as
people scrambled to pull their money out of failing banks.
	   _ Russia's foreign trade turnover shrank by 4.3 percent in the
first eight months of the year, totaling 83.7 billion dollars, said
the State Statistics Committee.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

BONN, Germany: for a coalition.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Kohl's defeat was a stinging humiliation for the West's
longest-serving leader. His Christian Democrats won just 35 percent
of the vote, which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it
held in the old parliament.
	   Now Schroeder must make good on pledges to end unemployment,
stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television on Monday.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens alliance would be postwar Germany's
most radical government as well as a test of the Greens' ability to
curb their sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more
mainstream party.
	   The Greens have proposed reforms that outrage some Germans and
amuse others: tripling gas prices to 5 marks (dlrs 3) per liter
over 10 years and introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) speed limit
on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy, immigration and defense
policy.
	   Schroeder will be the first of his generation, rooted in the
1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder, 54, will lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Kohl, 68, had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength
of his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and Kohl
conceded the race by announcing he would step down as the leader of
the party he has ruled with an iron fist since 1973.
	   Following Kohl's example, the leader of the Bavaria-only party
that governed with Kohl in Bonn said Monday he would step down.
Christian Social Union chief Theo Waigel, also Germany's outgoing
finance minister, has led his party for 10 years.

Hezbollah calls on Israeli-allied militiamen to defect
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah on Monday renewed its pledge to
protect Israeli-allied Lebanese militiamen who surrender and
produced a defector to urge his former comrades to do so.
	   The appeal by the Shiite Muslim guerrilla group was aimed at the
2,500-member South Lebanon Army militia, which is armed and paid by
Israel to help patrol the ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect against cross-border
guerrilla raids. It is maintained by the SLA and Israeli troops.
	   Hezbollah's latest offer came at a news conference in a southern
suburb of Beirut at which Abbas Hussein Raslan, 28, told reporters
he defected in February after serving as an SLA intelligence agent
for six years.
	   It was not clear why Hezbollah waited so long to announce the
defection of Raslan, a Shiite Muslim from the border village of
Taibeh.
	   Raslan said he was paid dlrs 600 a month to provide intelligence
from four villages. He described morale in the SLA as ``low'' and
urged militiamen to defect.
	   ``It's a national duty for me and for every Lebanese to join in
the resistance against Israeli occupation,'' he told The Associated
Press after the news conference.
	   The Hezbollah's Sheik Atallah Ibrahim, who introduced Raslan,
read a prepared statement saying that the guerrilla group ``again
calls on the agents to defect before it is too late and return to
their homeland and parents and not to remain cheap tools in the
hands of the Zionists.''
	   He repeated Hezbollah's pledge to ensure the safety of any
defectors.

Sanskrit scholars defend Madonna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Those who have criticized Madonna for
mixing her sexy image with her new interest in Hinduism are giving
the religion a bad name, several scholars say.
	   ``Hinduism is a religion of tolerance,'' Acharya Vageesh
Shastri, one of the most respected scholars in the Hindu holy city
of Varanasi, told The Associated Press Sunday. ``One should have
the vision to look beyond her transparent tops. Her interior is
more appealing than her exterior.''
	   The World Vaishnava Association had issued a statement
condemning Madonna for wearing a holy facial marking along with
``clothes through which her nipples were clearly visible and while
gyrating in a sexually suggestive manner'' during the Sept. 10 MTV
Video Music Awards.
	   B.N. Chaturvedi, another Varanasi scholar, was more interested
in what Madonna sang during the show than what she wore. He praised
her for improving her pronunciation of Sanskrit prayers she had
incorporated into a pop song, and dismissed the World Vaishnava
Association as an ``unknown organization run by people with
doubtful credentials.''
	   Vaishnavas are one of a bewildering array of branches of
Hinduism. Hindus range from fundamentalists to reformers often led
by a guru, or teacher. No central hierarchy has the final word on
doctrine.
	   Revered Hindu guru Pandit Shiv Kumar Upadhaya said the interest
of ``global celebrities'' like Madonna created welcome attention.
	   ``Madonna's newfound passion for Indian culture should be viewed
in the right perspective,'' Upadhaya said.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's future
chancellor, said Monday the center-left Social Democrats will begin
talks Friday on forming a government coalition with the
environmentalist Greens.
	   Schroeder said the coalition was ``the natural result'' of the
Social Democrat's sweeping 41 percent victory in elections Sunday
that ousted Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years of conservative
rule.
	   The Social Democratic triumph marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   The Greens, which won 6.7 percent, get their first shot at
entering government if talks are successful. Schroeder said his
party would try to assemble a coalition as quickly as possible. But
negotiations could be tricky between two parties with some sharp
policy differences.
	   Schroeder was beaming and giddy during his first post-election
press conference, jokingly deferring tough economic questions to
his likely finance minister, party chief Oskar Lafontaine, who was
sitting next to him.
	   He became serious, though, in addressing concerns about what
concessions the Social Democrats might have to make to secure
cooperation with the pacifist wing of the Greens.
	   ``The Greens are going to have to prepare for a clear and tough
round of talks,'' Schroeder said.
	   The future chancellor offered assurances that his government
would maintain Germany's foreign and economic policies. Schroeder
said Germany's role in NATO was not in question, though he deferred
questions on participation in possible NATO intervention in Kosovo,
saying the Kohl government was still in power.
	   ``Germany will not be a worse partner under a new government,''
he said. ``The international community can rely on Germans to
remain good partners.''
	   The Social Democrats will try to reach agreement with the Greens
within 30 days. Germany's consistition gives no deadline for
forming a government, but the new parliament must convene by Oct.
27. The parliament will then elect a chancellor, in this case
Schroeder, who will in turn designate his Cabinet and a coalition.
	   The Kohl government remains as a caretaker until the new
parliament convenes.
	   The Greens have warned the Social Democrats not to try to shore
up a new government by bringing in other parties, for example, the
liberal Free Democrats that were Kohl's junior coalition partners.
They won 6.2 percent.
	   Already, Schroeder has ruled out including the ex-communist
Party of Democratic Socialism, which won enough votes to stay in
parliament. Many in the west view the party as a troubling remnant
of the former communist East German state.
	   Schroeder's announcement of talks indicated he was tapping the
Greens alone for a coalition.
	   Kohl's defeat was a stinging humiliation for the West's
longest-serving leader. His Christian Democrats won just 35 percent
of the vote, which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it
held in the old parliament.
	   Now Schroeder must make good on pledges to end unemployment,
stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television earlier
Monday.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens alliance would be postwar Germany's
most radical government as well as a test of the Greens' ability to
curb their sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more
mainstream party.
	   The Greens have proposed reforms that outrage some Germans and
amuse others: tripling gas prices to 5 marks (dlrs 3) per liter
over 10 years and introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) speed limit
on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy, immigration and defense
policy.
	   Schroeder will be the first of his generation, rooted in the
1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder, 54, will lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Kohl, 68, had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength
of his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and when Kohl
conceded the race he also announced he would step down as the
leader of the Christian Democratic party he has ruled with an iron
fist since 1973.
	   Following Kohl's example, the leader of the Bavaria-only party
that governed with Kohl in Bonn said Monday he would step down.
Christian Social Union chief Theo Waigel, also Germany's outgoing
finance minister, has led his party for 10 years.

Case against journalist referred to Constitutional Court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ An appeals court on Monday passed to a higher
court a constitutional argument raised by lawyers for a Kuwaiti
editor sentenced to prison for publishing a joke deemed insulting
to Islam.
	   The attorneys for Mohammed al-Saqar, editor of the independent
daily Al-Qabas, claim that the 1961 publications law under which he
was convicted contradicts the constitution. They asked that the
question be turned over to the Constitutional Court.
	   That court is expected to offer advice on the constitutional
issue to the Appeals Court, which in turn will uphold or overturn
the June 24 ruling of the Court of First Instance.
	   A-Saqar was taken to court by Kuwait's Information Ministry
after Muslim fundamentalist lawmakers objected to the joke in
Al-Qabas.
	   In the joke, a teacher asks his students: ``Why did God kick
Adam and Eve out of heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they
hadn't paid the rent,''
	   The six months in jail punishment was the first of its kind in
this small oil-rich state that boasts the freest press in a Gulf
Arab country.
	   The publications law stipulates that an editor-in-chief is
responsible for everything published in the newspaper, but the 1992
constitution says individuals cannot be penalized for the
wrongdoings of others.
	   ``We are optimistic that the Constitutional Court will
consecrate the constitutional principles of freedom of opinion and
expression,'' defense lawyer Ali al-Baghli, a leading human rights
activist, told The Associated Press.
	   An Egyptian who contributed the joke to Al-Qabas from Cairo was
also handed a six-month term in absentia.

Court to decide if Yeltsin may run for third term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A parliamentary committee seeking to impeach Boris
Yeltsin resumed hearings on Monday, and Russia's highest court set
a date for deciding whether the president may run for a third term
in 2000.
	   The impeachment campaign by the Communist-led opposition began
long before the current crisis in Russia, but has made little
progress and appears likely to fail, as have several previous
efforts.
	   The impeachment committee's previous session, which was
scheduled for earlier this month, had to be postponed because
several key witnesses failed to show up. Most of the politicians
did not turn up again Monday, but lawmakers decided to go ahead
anyway with their review of Yeltsin's handling of the unsuccessful
war in Chechnya.
	   One of the witnesses who appeared at the hearings _ the former
commander of the North Caucasus Military District, Col. Gen. Alexei
Matyukhin _ said Chechnya's independence bid could have been
resolved without military intervention if the federal government
had been more willing to negotiate with separatist leaders, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   If the committee manages to put an impeachment motion on the
agenda of the parliament's lower house, the State Duma, the motion
would need a two-thirds majority vote to pass. It would then need
to be approved by a two-thirds majority in three other bodies: the
upper house or Federation Council, and both the Constitutional and
Supreme Courts, which include many Yeltsin supporters.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Constitutional Court announced that on Oct.
15 it would look into parliament's inquiry into whether Yeltsin may
run for a third term in the 2000 presidential election.
	   A constitutional limit of two terms would appear to rule out
another bid for Yeltsin. But the president's aides argue that his
first term began during Soviet times _ before the new constitution
was adopted _ and should not count toward the two-term limit.
	   Yeltsin has repeatedly said he does not plan to run. But
parliament still wants the Constitutional Court to formally ban
another bid.
	   Yeltsin representative in the court, Mikhail Mityukov, said
Monday that parliament's position ``does not make any sense,''
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``It is difficult to say what guided the deputies _ maybe
educational motives, or maybe they tried to over-protect,''
Mityukov said.
	   Potential candidates for the 2000 race include former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in the 1996
election, and former national security chief Alexander Lebed.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Canadian diplomats asked police to
negotiate a settlement Monday with 34 ethnic Albanian refugees
occupying the front steps of the embassy and demanding political
asylum, or else use force to clear the grounds.
	   Hungarian police spokesman Mihaly Dezsi said officers hoped to
negotiate a settlement with the refugees. ``We want to avoid any
rough stuff,'' he said.
	   Dozens of police dressed in riot gear surrounded the embassy
compound Monday afternoon.
	   Police said the group occupying the embassy's front steps in a
slight rain had been identified as ethnic Albanians from
Yugoslavia's war-torn Kosovo province.
	   ``The group entered the embassy grounds a few minutes after 10
a.m. (0800 GMT) and demanded to be granted political asylum,''
Mihaly Dezsi said.
	   He added that the 18 adults and 16 children, including one
infant, had been housed at a refugee camp in Bicske, some 40
kilometers (25 miles) west of Budapest, since they had escaped to
Hungary from Yugoslavia. Some had arrived in June.
	   It was not known what made them decide to go to the Canadian
embassy and request asylum.
	   ``We will die here if we have to,'' one refugee yelled from the
embassy steps.
	   Canadian officials broke off talks with the refugees and asked
police to take over negotiations, Dezsi said.
	   The embassy officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Hungarian police sealed off the area around the embassy, which
is a fenced-in compound of two larger buildings in the hills of
Buda, a quiet residential part of the city.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Participants in the dlrs 21 billion international
space station debated on Monday whether to again delay its
construction after Russia failed for the third time to deliver a
key segment.
	   The station, a joint project of Russia, the United States, the
European Space Agency, Canada and Japan, has already been pushed
back a year because the cash-strapped Russian space industry has
missed two previous target dates.
	   Despite repeated pledges, the Russian government has failed to
fund construction of the service module that would serve as living
quarters for the crew.
	   It seems certain that the module won't be completed in time to
meet an April launch date, Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev
said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Mikhail Sinelshchikov, head of Russia's manned space program,
said the module could be launched some time next summer, provided
the government comes up with promised funds.
	   The delay also casts doubt on a plan to launch the station's
first module in less than two months, on Nov. 20. The cargo module,
built by the Russian Khrunichev company under contract with the
U.S. firm Boeing, has already been taken to the launch site at the
Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   NASA was expected to follow with a launch of the second part, a
connecting passageway, on Dec. 3.
	   Because of the probable delay in sending up a crew in the third
stage, the dates for the first two launches may be revised. Some
experts consider it too risky to leave the orbiting modules
unmanned for so long.
	   However, the Russian space agency is pushing for the first two
segments to be launched as previously scheduled, because that would
make it easier to lobby the government for delivery of the promised
funds, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sinelshchikov said other participants in the project are likely
to agree to launch the first module as scheduled, since it's
capable of flying alone for more than 400 days.
	   All the countries involved in the international space station
took part in Monday's meeting. The final decision on the launch
dates is expected on Friday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In an attempt to prevent new costly delays in the project, NASA
intends to ask Congress and the White House for approval to buy
additional goods and services from the Russian Space Agency worth
as much as dlrs 660 million over the next four years, according to
news reports last week.
	   However, Koptev bristled at the proposed bailout, saying the
U.S. aid would effectively deprive Russia of its current status as
a major stockholder in the project and turn it into a
subcontractor.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat postponed
his speech before the General Assembly on Monday to meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the U.S. president in
a hastily called Washington summit.
	   Arafat was scheduled to return later Monday to deliver the
speech, at which he originally pledged to state his intention of
declaring an independent Palestinian state next year whether or not
a final peace agreement with Israel is in place.
	   But U.S. diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Arafat had promised to tone down the speech _ a move which
improved the atmosphere for peacemaking and allowed the Washington
summit to come about.
	   His speech before the General Assembly has particular
significance: Never before has Arafat _ or any other Palestinian _
addressed the audience from the podium during the regular debate.
The Palestinian observer mission was granted that right earlier
this summer.
	   Arafat had been expected to address the morning session, but his
appearance was postponed to allow him to travel to Washington to
meet with Netanyahu and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Arafat and
Netanyahu in New York over the weekend, and has said she hoped
Arafat would not use the occasion of his U.N. speech to again
declare his intention of setting up a Palestinian state.

U.N. says oil-for-food program reducing malnutrition in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The oil-for-food program has begun reducing
malnutrition among children in Iraq, a U.N. official said Monday.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
said that a survey in the north showed that 25.3 percent of
children under the age of 5 were suffering from chronic
malnutrition, down from 33.3 percent.
	   He said U.N. agencies hoped for similar results in surveys to be
undertaken soon in central and southern areas.
	   A study conducted late last year by the U.N. Children's Fund
indicated that nearly one million Iraqi children _ or more than 30
percent under age 5 _ were suffering from chronic malnutrition.
	   ``Following the introduction of the food basket ... malnutrition
appears to be ebbing countrywide,'' Falt told The Associated Press.
	   Iraq began selling oil in December 1996 under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program to raise funds to provide needed food and
medicine to its 22 million people.
	   Oil earnings are used to purchase flour, sugar and other food
from abroad for distribution to the public as a ration each month.
	   The program is an exception to U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has
said the sanctions will not be lifted until Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   In its initial phases, the oil-for-food program allowed Iraq to
sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months. The U.N. raised
the ceiling to dlrs 5.2 billion, but Iraq has said it will be able
to earn just dlrs 3 billion in the current phase.
	   Falt said this will allow Iraq to introduce protein into the
ration.
	   He said the Iraqi government has indicated that full cream milk
will be distributed to all citizens starting in November.
	   The monthly ration currently includes flour, rice, sugar, tea,
lentils, salt, cooking oil, soap and detergent. A special ration of
milk is provided for babies.

Ukraine's central chief pledges to keep national currency under
</HEADLINE>
control &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank remains committed to
keeping the national currency within the declared trading corridor
and will not let its rate float, the country's top banker said
Monday.
	   National Bank chief Viktor Yuschenko said the central bank has
no plans to let the hryvna float freely, despite its continuous
fall over the previous months.
	   ``If we lose control over the hryvna's rate, it will be a heavy
blow to Ukraine and its banking sector,'' Yuschenko was quoted by
the Interfax news agency as saying.
	   Ukraine's hryvna, which had remained practically stable until
mid-August, has slid about 45 percent since Russia's financial
turmoil began.
	   It fell to 3.37 to the U.S. dollar on Friday, dangerously close
to the upper limit of the government-set trading corridor of 2.5 to
3.5 to the dollar, which was introduced this month.
	   However, Yuschenko said he saw no reason for the hryvna's
further devaluation. He said public demand for dollars has
diminished in recent days, while people have mostly stopped
withdrawing their savings from commercial banks.
	   Yuschenko added that the National Bank would refrain from
spending its reserves to support the currency, although demand for
dollars at the currency exchange still exceeds supply.
	   He said the National Bank's reserves currently stand at dlrs
1.08 billion, up from about dlrs 850 million at the beginning of
September. The reserves were replenished largely by the first dlrs
257 million tranche of the dlrs 2.2 billion International Monetary
Fund loan approved to Ukraine this month.

Brtish coach suspended on child pornography charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A leading British amateur swimming coach was
suspended Monday following his arrest on child pornography charges.
	   The action against Steve Davis, head coach at Northampton
Swimming Club, was announced by the Amateur Swimming Association
and the British Swimming Coaches and Teachers Association.
	   The BSCTA said Davis was arrested last Friday ``for allegations
of involvement in child pornography on the Internet.''
	   Police said Davis was charged with possession of indecent
photographs of children with intent to distribute or show. He was
released on bail and ordered to appear in court on Oct. 30.
	   The association said the allegations do not relate to any
involvement with Northampton swimmers.
	   ``However, it wishes to make it clear that it does not condone,
nor support, such behavior or practices. ...
	   ``While Mr. Davis has been a successful coach, and is a highly
respected member of the British coaching fraternity, his admittance
of the allegations leave the BSCTA will no alternative but to take
the action that it has.''

Phone company cuts direct line to Israel in bill dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6-7th grafs to add comment from Bezek. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's phone company said Monday it cut
its direct link with a subsidiary of Israel's state-owned Bezek
Telecom Co. because of a financial dispute.
	   Telephone service between the two countries continues, however,
via other carriers.
	   Ali Shukri, chairman of the Jordanian Telecommunications Co.,
said JTC earlier this month stopped the service provided to Bezek
International Ltd., a unit of BTC, because it had not paid a bill
of dlrs 5 million for 1997.
	   ``It has refused to pay the bill,'' Shukri said. He did not
elaborate.
	   Shukri added that Jordan now was routing phone calls to Israel
through a private Israeli firm, Golden Lines.
	   An official at Bezek denied that the Israeli company owed the
Jordanian company anything and said negotiations were under way to
resolve the dispute. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The official also declined to say if Bezek was routing calls to
Jordan through a third country but acknowledged that this is what
phone companies often do.
	   That appeared to be the case, since it remains possible to dial
between the two countries.

Hurricane relief operation gains steam in Dominican Republic

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES number killed in Haiti to 94 in 11th graf with dead in
Haiti to 94. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Inside a squalid,
overcrowded disaster shelter in Santo Domingo, refugees from
Hurricane Georges seethed over life's latest indignity: the food.
	   Stabbing a fork into a bowl of cold, soggy rice mixed with
tomato sauce, Juanito Montero thrust the foul concoction in a
reporter's face. ``They're not giving us anything!'' shouted the
27-year-old father of two, whose zinc and plywood house was washed
away by floods.
	   Naked children played inside the darkened San Vicente church,
home to 500 storm victims for the past week. Others lay languidly
on the cement floor, not seeming to notice a humanitarian visit
Sunday by a group of U.S. congressmen.
	   ``It's a heartbreaking situation for everyone,'' said Rep. Elton
Gallegly, a California Republican. ``To call it pathetic would be a
gross understatement.''
	   Now, finally, help is on the way. The U.S. relief effort for the
Dominican Republic gained momentum Sunday, ferrying in tons of
bottled water and plastic tarps for thousands of struggling storm
victims.
	   More than 200 people were killed, hundreds are missing and
100,000 were left homeless when Georges struck the Dominican
Republic on Tuesday. Most victims died in flooding or mudslides as
substandard homes proved no match for the hurricane's destructive
power and the rivers it flooded.
	   Over the weekend, the U.S. Agency for International Development
said the hurricane death toll in the Dominican Republic ``is almost
certain to exceed 500.''
	   The United States has shipped dlrs 500,000 worth of supplies,
including enough plastic sheeting to roof 15,000 homes. More aid
was coming, said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster relief for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   At least six U.S. military helicopters were to carry relief
supplies today and help rescuers reach towns cut off by flooding,
downed bridges and debris-choked roads.
	   Helicopter crews hoped to reach San Juan de la Maguana, 120
miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital of Santo Domingo, where
76 bodies were recovered on Thursday. Half the town was under water
or buried in mud, Parmer said.
	   In all, Georges killed more than 300 people throughout the
Caribbean, including at least 94 in Haiti, five in Cuba, three in
St. Kitts and two in Antigua. At least three were killed in Puerto
Rico, where the damage surpassed dlrs 2 billion.
	   In Cuba, President Fidel Castro said the speedy evacuation of
hundreds of thousands of people probably saved many more from dying
during Georges' march across that island on Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The first victory was to reduce the losses,'' Castro said in a
speech broadcast Sunday. He said Cuba now had to help thousands
left homeless and assess agricultural damage.
	   In Santo Domingo, U.S. Peace Corps workers loaded private planes
with bags of food and water to be dropped into villages isolated by
flooding. New York City sent search and rescue teams and Puerto
Rico sent search dogs.
	   At the city's military airport, soldiers used forklifts to
unload flashlights, pinto beans, diapers, graham crackers and chain
saws _ all donated by Houston-based Enron Corp., an investor in the
Dominican electrical power industry.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan and Kuwait. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The deficit in the balance of trade fell by
5.9 percent in the first six months of the year because of
increased exports to new markets worldwide.
	   A Trade Ministry report obtained Monday set the deficit at 763.9
million dinars (dlrs 1.075 billion) between January and June, down
from 812.1 million dinars (dlrs 1.143 billion) in the same period
last year.
	   It said more Jordanian output has found its way to new markets
in United States, Europe and Africa.
	   Imports, however, decreased because of the slackened demand in
the local market resulting from a cash crunch, uncertainty over a
settlement between neighboring Israel and the Palestinians and
sanctions on Iraq, it added.
	   The report said imports slipped by 5.4 percent this year to
1.344 billion dinars (dlrs 1.893 billion) compared with the same
period in 1997.
	   Total exports _ including re-exported goods _ were estimated at
580.8 million dinars (dlrs 818 million) between January and June
this year, it said.
	   ---
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Stock Exchange announced it was
introducing futures trading as of Saturday, the beginning of the
next trading week.
	   Hisham al-Otaibi, the exchange's general manager, told the
Kuwait News Agency on Monday that futures will be traded for half
an hour in the afternoon for an experimental period of six months.
However, the futures option will not be open to all listed
companies during this period, he said.
	   A experiment will be evaluated in order to ``fill any loopholes
that appear'' during that half year, al-Otaibi told KUNA.
	   The exchange which lists 76 companies is considered one of the
most active in Arab companies. But trading is limited to Kuwaitis
and nationals of the other Arab states in the Gulf.

Retired wrestler wants to spread wonders of sumo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TOK116 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Retired Hawaiian-born sumo wrestler Konishiki vowed
Monday to continue to be ``a bridge'' with the world in helping
spread understanding for the traditional Japanese sport.
	   With his unpretentious vivacious personality, Konishiki remains
one of Japan's most loved former athletes, appearing often in TV
ads and talk shows even after his retirement from active wrestling
last November.
	   On Sunday, Konishiki, 34, whose real name is Salevaa Atisanoe,
handed in his resignation to the Japan Sumo Association, the
sport's ruling body, ending his job as an ``oyakata'' coach for
young wrestlers, under the name Sanoyama.
	   ``I have learned so much from the Japan's national sport of
sumo,'' said Konishiki, who weighs more than 260 kilograms (580
pounds). ``For someone who has devoted his entire life to sumo,
this decision was far from easy.''
	   His resignation from the rigidly run association is likely to
give him more leeway in the types of entertainment projects he can
tackle, as well as more time away from a heavy scheduling of tours
and coaching.
	   A talented crooner, Konishiki has said he is thinking about
putting out a CD recording of songs from around the world.
Konishiki also has been a frequent commentator on the TV broadcast
of sumo tournaments aired in Hawaii.
	   At a news conference Monday, he announced he will now work out
of the production company he set up last year called KP, which
stands for Konishiki Power.
	   Konishiki said the main reason for his resignation was that he
wanted more time to visit his sick mother in Hawaii, as well as for
the charity work that he has pursued for many years.
	   ``From now on, I plan to do all I can to spread to the world the
wonders of sumo, which helped me to grow, so that I can be a
bridge,'' he said.
	   Konishiki, who became a Japanese citizen in 1994, has always
spoken of his love for sumo.
	   But he has also acknowledged the hardships he endured trying to
adapt to the rigorous, tradition-bound world of sumo _ a combat
sport in which opponents face off in a dirt ring and slam into each
other, with most bouts lasting a few seconds.
	   Konishiki rose to the second-highest rank of ``ozeki,'' or
champion, but never was promoted to ``yokozuna,'' the top rank.
	   At that time, there was much speculation that he was not
promoted because he was foreign-born.
	   Hawaiian-born Akebono, formerly Chad Rowan, was promoted to
yokozuna, however, and his wedding next month will be carried on
national TV.
	   ``Not only was I able to realize my own dream but I was also
able to carry out the dreams of my family,'' Konishiki said. ``I am
deeply grateful.''

EU nations expect Schroeder to continue pro-unity policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with Germany-Election
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the towering figure of Helmut Kohl
removed from the European scene, Germany's neighbors are watching
how Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will affect the continental
balance of power.
	   For 16 years, Kohl used the economic and political strength of
the EU's largest nation to shape key EU policies _ from the
impending launch of a common currency to a planned expansion into
Eastern Europe.
	   Few expect any sudden, fundamental change in Germany's European
stance.
	   ``You don't change foreign policy as often as you change a
government,'' said Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Pedersen.
``Germany will continue to have strong ties to the European Union,
the the United States, to NATO.''
	   Nevertheless, many wonder if Schroeder, who was born at the end
of World War II, shares Kohl's emotional commitment to a united
Europe which stemmed from childhood memories of a continent
ravished by war.
	   ``The new leadership will feel in a different way this
connection between Germany and Europe,'' said Italian Defense
Minister Beniamino Andreatta. ``But I hope that Mr. Kohl's legacy,
Germany's role toward the West, will not be changed.''
	   Schroeder's victory in Sunday's election means Socialists now
lead the governments of the EU's three biggest powers _ Germany,
France and Britain.
	   ``It's a new era opening up,'' said British Prime Minister Tony
Blair. ``It's a tremendous thing that we now have center-left
governments in the three countries ... I look forward to working
with them very much.''
	   Leaders of the other 14 EU nations are expected to meet
Schroeder Oct. 24 at a special summit in the Austrian lakeside
resort of Poertschach.
	   Many expect the new German leader to draw closer to Blair's
vision of a ``third way'' combining free market economics with a
commitment to social justice, than the more traditional socialist
approach of French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   ``He will look for closer relations with England,'' said Robert
Aspeslagh, senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for
International Relations in The Hague.
	   ``Before, in the EU, there was Germany and France on one side
and then Britain. Now you will see Germany, France and Britain as
equal partners.''
	   However, Britain's decision to stay out of the inner-club of EU
nations that switch to the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1,
means the relationship between Schroeder and Jospin remains
crucial.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance, and it will
remain the most important for Europe,'' said Schroeder after his
election win Sunday.
	   Schroeder once expressed doubts about ditching the Deutsche mark
for the euro, but since he has fallen in line with the single
currency plan.
	   However, Germany's European allies are expecting Schroeder to
follow Kohl's line in demanding pays a smaller share of the cost of
bringing the former-communist nations to the east into the EU fold
some time next decade.
	   ``Whoever is in power will have to do more on the contributions,
because Germany is not the rich country it was,'' said Anne-Marie
Le Gloannec, deputy director of the Paris-based Center for
International Studies and Research.
	   Germany paid almost one-third of the dlrs 86 billion budget this
year and wrangling over how to share the burden is expected to
dominate EU business over the coming months as Germany prepares to
take over the presidency of the Union for the first six months of
1999.
	   Despite the likely entry into the Schroeder government of
ministers from the pacifist Green Party, NATO official said they
expected no weakening of Germany's steadfast support for the
alliance, even if that means German planes going to war in Kosovo.

Russia's women activists seek greater role to fight crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia sinking deeper into economic crisis,
dozens of women's rights activists on Monday discussed ways to
improve the situation of women in Russia and raise their profile in
government.
	   ``Now is a time when the women's voice must be heard in all its
strength,'' said Natalya Berezhnaya, a leader of Equality and Peace
association.
	   ``We make up 53 percent of the country's population, yet we are
still shunted aside from political government, and that's one of
the factors in (the problems) we have in our country,'' she said.
	   Russian women, who suffer discrimination in the job market and
political life while carrying most of the workload at home, have
been badly hit by the economic turmoil.
	   Proposals at the discussion Monday ranged from helping one
another get through the crisis, to sending proposals to male
politicians, to fighting for raising the number of women in
government.
	   ``Men, as the male political club, have discredited
themselves,'' said Nadezhda Shvedova, a political analyst with the
USA and Canada Institute, a leading Russian think-tank.
	   ``We need parity in politics. ... A woman in politics is a new
resource that will allow people to trust the government again,''
Shvedova said.
	   Conference participants also voiced support for Valentina
Matviyenko, deputy prime minister for social affairs and the only
woman in the new Cabinet.
	   Others, however, called for women to rely on their own strength
and help others get through the crisis, without expecting help from
the government.
	   ``I appeal to everyone not to wait for help from the government
that is about to be formed now. ... We think about what we can do
now, today, while distancing ourselves from the various political
groups and factions,'' said Yevgenia Poplavskaya, a leader of the
Mercy and Social Protection Association.
	   ``If we don't unite for small things, we won't be able to
resolve big ones,'' Poplavskaya said.

Swallows beat BayStars 11-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Dwayne Hosey smashed a three-run home run in the
seventh as the Yakult Swallows trounced the Central League's
front-running Yokohama BayStars 11-2 at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium
Monday.
	   Hosey, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, has 13 homers.
	   The BayStars are still five games ahead of the second-place
Chunichi Dragons who were idle Monday.
	   No other Central Leauge games were scheduled Monday.
	   In the Pacific League, Norio Tanabe singled home the winning run
in the bottom of the ninth, giving the front-running Seibu Lions a
4-3 victory over the Kintetsu Buffaloes at Seibu Dome.
	   The Lions have a 1 1/2 game lead over the second place Nippon
Ham Fighters who lost to the Chiba Lotte Marines 3-1 at Chiba.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the towering figure of Helmut Kohl
removed from the European scene, Germany's neighbors are watching
how Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will affect the continental
balance of power.
	   For 16 years, Kohl used the economic and political strength of
the EU's largest nation to shape key EU policies _ from the
impending launch of a common currency to a planned expansion into
Eastern Europe.
	   Few expect any sudden, fundamental change in Germany's European
stance.
	   ``You don't change foreign policy as often as you change a
government,'' Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Pedersen said
Monday. ``Germany will continue to have strong ties to the European
Union, the the United States, to NATO.''

Portugal, Spain, and Austria/Hungary to bid for Euro 2004 finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Portugal, Spain, Austria and Hungary
have officially entered the race to host the finals of the European
soccer championships in 2004, European soccer's governing body UEFA
announced Monday.
	   Austria and Hungary will submit a joint bid, according to a UEFA
press release. Hungary's government voted Thursday to support it
despite initial concerns voiced by ministers about the country's
ability to fund the project, which is expected to cost up to dlrs
85 million.
	   Switzerland had also indicated interest in hosting the finals
but withdrew its bid earlier this year because it didn't fulfil
UEFA requirements, a UEFA spokeswoman said.
	   All the candidates will submit dossiers on their bids to UEFA at
a meeting on Thursday. UEFA is expected to announce the winner in
July next year.
	   Also Monday, UEFA said representatives of an extra six clubs
have been invited to attend the second meeting in Geneva on Friday
of its European Club Football 2000 task force.
	   The special group was set up to study options for reform of
European club competitions in response to plans by Italy's Media
Partners for a breakaway super league.
	   The clubs are Real Madrid and Barcelona of Spain, Lazio of
Italy, Bayer Leverkusen of Germany, Russia's Spartak Moscow and
Rosenborg, of Norway.
	   Six clubs have already taken part in the first meeting of the
task force, among them Ajax of Holland, Juventus of Italy,
England's Liverpool, Bayern Munich of Germany, FC Porto of Portugal
and France's Olympique Lyonnais.

Botched hostage raid has government under siege

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It started with a family taken hostage by
a career criminal making his last stand.
	   Now it's the government being held captive.
	   A succession of calamities _ including a blood-soaked police
raid and the death of the hostage-taker in a prison medical ward _
have officials backed into a corner by critics claiming gross
errors in judgment reaching all the way toward Premier Costas
Simitis.
	   The scandal, which began last week on an unprecedented live
television hook-up with the fugitive, has slapped the 2-year-old
government with its most delicate and embarrassing domestic crisis.
	   ``A madhouse,'' groaned the moderate newspaper Exousia in a
Monday commentary on the government's handling of the affair.
	   ``We have every right to question everything,'' said Aleka
Papariga, the head of the Greek Communist Party.
	   Simitis has been able to ride out labor protests of his painful
economic measures by saying it is vital to keep pace with European
Union partners. There is no such clarity in the web of missteps and
suspicions from the hostage drama and its aftermath.
	   Greek officials are left having to explain actions that,
according to media and government foes, exposed serious weaknesses
in security forces and the political leadership.
	   It does not appear Simitis' government is in danger of falling,
but calls are growing louder for high-level resignations following
the botched raid and the Saturday death of Greek-Romanian convict
Sorin Matei. Autopsy reports concluded Matei, 27, choked to death
on his own vomit while heavily sedated.
	   ``With the sudden death of (Matei), the portrait of political
and state brutality we witnessed is expanded,'' wrote the
conservative newspaper Vradini.
	   Matei, an escapee serving sentences for attempted murder and
armed robberies, had been on the run since July. On Sept. 6, he
managed to escape after taking a police officer hostage with a hand
grenade.
	   On Wednesday, he was again surrounded by police but slipped away
carrying a grenade. He burst into an apartment and took three
hostages. He made demands and rambled on about his drug problem in
calls to the anchorman of a private television station.
	   Police, wrongly concluding the grenade was fake, stormed the
building and were caught in the blast. Twelve people were injured,
including Matei, a hostage and the police chief who later resigned.
	   Police were harshly denounced for the bungled operation. But the
recriminations soon spread to Simitis' cabinet.
	   The criticism was particularly stinging after Greek authorities
insisted they do not need outside help to handle security for the
2004 Olympics in Athens.
	   Then the death of Matei in Athens' maximum-security prison
raised new questions: why he was left sedated with only superficial
injuries and why he was not under special watch?
	   ``It seems special measures were not taken to keep the witness
alive,'' said Costas Papanikolau, a commentator on the Antenna
radio network.
	   Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas insisted that everything
and everybody is being investigated ``from beginning to end.''
	   ``We want truth to shine,'' he told reporters Monday.
	   At Matei's funeral a few hours later, his body was dressed in a
white suit and his casket surrounded by white daisies and orange
and white tiger lillies. His mother, Tzenaka Kapsopoulou, sobbed:
``They shut your mouth so you couldn't talk.''

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's future
chancellor, said Monday the center-left Social Democrats will begin
talks Friday on forming a government coalition with the
environmentalist Greens.
	   Schroeder said the coalition was ``the natural result'' of the
Social Democrat's sweeping 41 percent victory in elections Sunday
that ousted Chancellor Helmut Kohl after 16 years of conservative
rule.
	   The Social Democratic triumph marked the first time in postwar
Germany that voters rejected all parties from the previous
government in favor of fresh faces and new ideas.
	   The Greens, which won 6.7 percent, get their first shot at
governing if talks are successful. Schroeder said his party would
try to assemble a coalition as quickly as possible. But
negotiations could be tricky between two parties with some sharp
policy differences.
	   Schroeder was beaming and giddy during his first post-election
press conference, jokingly deferring tough economic questions to
his likely finance minister, party chief Oskar Lafontaine, who was
sitting next to him.
	   He became serious, though, in addressing concerns about what
concessions the Social Democrats might have to make to secure
cooperation with the pacifist wing of the Greens.
	   ``The Greens are going to have to prepare for a clear and tough
round of talks,'' Schroeder said.
	   The future chancellor offered assurances that his government
would maintain Germany's foreign and economic policies. Schroeder
said Germany's role in NATO was not in question, though he skirted
questions on participation in possible NATO intervention in Kosovo,
saying the Kohl government was still in power.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' he said. ``The international community can rely
on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   Schroeder said the new government is committed to Europe's
single currency, the euro, which starts Jan. 1. Germany also takes
over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union on
that day.
	   The Social Democrats will try to reach agreement with the Greens
within 30 days. Germany's consistition gives no deadline for
forming a government, but the new parliament must convene by Oct.
27. The parliament will then elect a chancellor, in this case
Schroeder, who will in turn designate his Cabinet and a coalition.
	   The Kohl government remains as a caretaker until the new
parliament convenes.
	   Kohl's defeat was a stinging humiliation for the West's
longest-serving leader. His Christian Democrats won just 35 percent
of the vote, which translates to a loss of 49 of the 294 seats it
held in the old parliament.
	   Now Schroeder must make good on pledges to end unemployment,
stuck above 10 percent, and to bring long-awaited tax and economic
reforms.
	   With the Greens, a Social Democratic-led government would
command a 21-seat majority in the new 669-seat parliament. ``I
think 21 seats is enough of a majority to form a stable
government,'' Schroeder told national ZDF television earlier
Monday.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens alliance would be postwar Germany's
most radical government as well as a test of the Greens' ability to
curb their sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more
mainstream party.
	   The Greens have proposed reforms that outrage some Germans and
amuse others: tripling gas prices to 5 marks (dlrs 3) per liter
over 10 years and introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile) speed limit
on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy, immigration and defense
policy.
	   Schroeder, who has governed Lower Saxony state since 1990, will
be the first of a generation rooted in the 1960s leftist movement
to lead Europe's biggest nation.
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder, 54, will lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Kohl, 68, had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength
of his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and when Kohl
conceded the race he also announced he would step down as the
leader of the Christian Democratic party he has ruled with an iron
fist since 1973.
	   Following Kohl's example, the leader of the Bavaria-only party
that governed with Kohl in Bonn said Monday he would step down.
Christian Social Union chief Theo Waigel, also Germany's outgoing
finance minister, has led his party for 10 years.

U.N. says oil-for-food program reducing malnutrition in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The oil-for-food program has begun reducing
malnutrition among children in Iraq, a U.N. official said Monday.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
said that a survey in the north showed that 25.3 percent of
children under the age of 5 were suffering from chronic
malnutrition, down from 33.3 percent.
	   He said U.N. agencies hoped for similar results in surveys to be
undertaken soon in central and southern areas.
	   A study conducted late last year by the U.N. Children's Fund
indicated that nearly one million Iraqi children _ or more than 30
percent under age 5 _ were suffering from chronic malnutrition.
	   ``Following the introduction of the food basket ... malnutrition
appears to be ebbing countrywide,'' Falt told The Associated Press.
	   Iraq began selling oil in December 1996 under the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program to raise funds to provide needed food and
medicine to its 22 million people.
	   Oil earnings are used to purchase flour, sugar and other food
from abroad for distribution to the public as a ration each month.
	   The program is an exception to U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. Security Council has
said the sanctions will not be lifted until Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   In its initial phases, the oil-for-food program allowed Iraq to
sell dlrs 2 billion worth of oil every six months. The U.N. raised
the ceiling to dlrs 5.2 billion, but Iraq has said it will be able
to earn just dlrs 3 billion in the current phase.
	   The monthly ration currently includes flour, rice, sugar, tea,
lentils, salt, cooking oil, soap and detergent. A special ration of
milk is provided for babies.

Media accuse Muslim secret police of dirty deeds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Reports by Bosnia's two
leading independent magazines accused part of the country's Muslim
leadership of using the secret police to organize slayings and
terrorist attacks.
	   Weekend articles published by Slobodna Bosna (Free Bosnia) and
Dani (Days) stirred up public debate over a favorite Sarajevo topic
_ involvement of Muslim leaders in the activities of secret police
units during and after the Bosnian war.
	   Writing in the daily Oslobodjenje on Monday, columnist Sejad
Luckin said the articles showed the leadership ``didn't want to, or
was not capable of'' controlling some parts of the secret police.
	   But Alija Izetbegovic, the leader of Bosnian Muslims and their
representative in the joint three-member presidency, dismissed the
articles' claims.
	   ``It is obvious that there is a synchronized campaign ...
against the AID,'' Izetbegovic told reporters Saturday.
	   The Agency for Investigation and Documentation (AID) is
instrumental in gathering documentation against war crimes
suspects, which is then turned over to the U.N. war crimes
tribunal.
	   Izetbegovic said the articles were ``an unpatriotic act'' aimed
at helping war criminals escape punishment.
	   His response did little to satisfy the public. ``This reply will
not calm already raised dust, nor it will improve the image of the
leadership,'' Luckin wrote.
	   The magazines carried interviews with Edin Garaplija, an AID
member. He claimed some of the Muslim leadership organized killings
and drug trafficking through their secret services.
	   Garaplija spoke from Zenica prison, 50 kilometers (31 miles)
north of Sarajevo, where he is serving a 13-year sentence for the
torture and attempted murder of another secret service agent.
Garaplija claims he was framed.
	   Garaplija said that at the beginning of the war, some Muslim
leaders formed a secret terrorist unit, code-named ``skylarks.''
The unit allegedly committed at least one mass execution of Bosnian
Serbs, Croats and Muslims who opposed the leadership.
	   The skylarks were reportedly behind several other murders and an
attempted assassination of a Bosnian army commander.
	   When AID was formed in late 1995, a group of skylarks was
recruited and became a secret police unit within AID, he said.
	   A key figure behind the group is former Interior Minister Bakir
Alispahic, who financed his actions with drug trafficking,
Garaplija claimed.
	   Alispahic is linked to the president's son, Bakir Izetbegovic,
who has publicly denied involvement with any secret service.
	   In past years, several police sources have made comments to The
Associated Press that corroborate Garaplija's statements. But no
written evidence was ever provided.
	   For years, the West has been pressing Muslim leadership to
include Croat officers in AID.
	   The Dayton peace accord divided Bosnia into two entities _ the
Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat federation _ and prohibited any
ethnically pure institutions.
	   The Muslims have refused to integrate this part of the police
because some top Croats are being investigated for war crimes.

Grand Slam winners missing from Grand Slam Cup

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ The Grand Slam Cup doesn't live up to its
name this year _ at least on the men's side.
	   The lucrative tournament was nominally created to bring together
winners of the four Grand Slam tennis events.
	   But of the four Grand Slam men's champions this year, three have
elected not to come, including the two top players in the world,
Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter.
	   But the women, competing in the dlrs 6.7 million event for the
first time, are here in full force, with only Monica Seles absent.
Seles has refused to play in Germany since her stabbing at a
tournament in Hamburg in 1993.
	   Martina Hingis, the No. 1 in the world and the Australian Open
champion, is joined by No. 2 Lindsay Davenport, who is in hot
pursuit of the top ranking. Davenport beat Hingis for the U.S. Open
title earlier this month.
	   The tournament, which gives out more prize money per head than
any other event, starts Tuesday in Munich's Olympic Hall, with 12
men and eight women in the field.
	   Hingis opens the event against Conchita Martinez, followed by
two men's matches, Tim Henman vs. Jonas Bjorkman and Nicolas Escude
vs. Felix Mantilla.
	   The tournament began in 1990, with the idea of bringing together
players with the best records in the four Grand Slam events of the
year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But this year, only one Grand Slam male champion is here: Petr
Korda, who won the Australian Open. Seeded No. 2 is Marcelo Rios.
	   Wimbledon champion Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and Carlos
Moya, the French Open winner, all declined to show up for the event
that has no bearing on the rankings.
	   So, the organizers turned to wild cards to spice up the
tournament that is likely to be upstaged by the Oktoberfest, not to
mention the Bayern Munich-Manchester United Champions League game
on Wednesday.
	   That's how Andre Agassi got into the field. But efforts to bring
in a crowd-pulling German failed. Semi-retired Boris Becker is
injured, just like Steffi Graf.
	   But if the men's side lacks stars, the women should provide the
fireworks.
	   Hingis and Davenport are joined by Wimbledon champion Jana
Novotna and French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
	   With Rafter absent, Australia is represented by Mark
Philippoussis, whom Rafter beat in the U.S. Open final.
Philippoussis missed Australia's Davis Cup victory over Uzbekistan
over the weekend in a dispute with Rafter and captain John
Newcombe.
	   The men's winner will receive dlrs 1.3 million, the women's
800,000.

Fighting in northern Sri Lanka continues, 237 combatants dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDITORS NOTE _ The following story was submitted to the Sri
Lankan military censor, who made no changes.
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lanka military said Monday
that 237 people have died in recent fighting between government
soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   The fighting began early morning Sunday when Tamil Tiger rebels
attacked soldiers near the military-controlled town of Paranthan,
280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri Lankan
capital.
	   ``Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has confirmed 194 of their
cadres (were) killed,'' according to a statement issued Monday by
the military. Forty-three soldiers also have died and 110 have been
injured in the fighting so far, the statement said.
	   The military on Sunday said only 40 rebels and nine soldiers
were killed but raised the figures Monday, saying the fighting was
on a much larger scale that earlier thought.
	   ``Sporadic confrontations are being reported at present,'' the
statement added.
	   Military-held Paranthan lies along the northernmost stretch of a
70-kilometer (45-mile) highway through rebel-held territory that
the military has been trying to capture for the past year.
	   A sustained campaign from the southern part of the highway has
taken the military two-thirds of the way. Gaining control of the
rest of the rebel-held road would open a supply line to the Jaffna
peninsula, a former rebel stronghold at the northern tip of Sri
Lanka that was captured by the military two years ago.
	   Jaffna's half-million people have had to rely on air and sea
deliveries for food and other supplies.
	   Independent reports of fighting were not available because the
government has barred journalists from battle zones.
	   The government also has imposed censorship on war reporting on
foreign and local reporters in June after fighting to capture the
road escalated.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who control the government
and the military.
	   More than 54,000 people have died in Sri Lanka's civil war since
1983.

	   UMM AL FAHM, Israel (AP) _ In an escalating battle over land,
police fired rubber bullets for a second day Monday to break up
stone-throwing riots by Israeli Arab teen-agers and Arab
legislators called a general strike.
	   The clashes in Umm al Fahm, the largest Arab town in Israel,
were the most violent in recent years. Scenes of teen-agers hurling
stones from slingshots and burning tires were reminiscent of the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The intensity of the anger raised the question of whether the
protests would spread. Israel's 1 million Arab citizens, who make
up 20 percent of the population, have long complained of
discrimination at the hands of successive Israeli governments. The
confiscation of Arab land is an especially sore point.
	   In August, a report prepared by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office recommended treating Israel's Arab citizens as a
strategic threat.
	   A general strike was set for Tuesday in Arab towns and villages
throughout Israel, with schools, businesses and municipal offices
to shut down. A strike was observed in Umm al Fahm on Monday.
	   Legislator Abdel Wahab Darawshe of the Arab Democratic Party
warned that protests would spread unless the government changed its
policies. ``The government has pushed the Arab population against a
wall, so this was the beginning of a larger flare-up,'' he said.
	   The protests began Sunday when Israeli police dismantled a tent
set up to protest the exproriation of a 125-acre olive grove that
is to be used for a military firing range. Israeli authorities said
the land owner was being compensated with about six times as much
land elsewhere.
	   In riots that lasted into the night Sunday, about 50 Umm al-Fahm
residents and 15 police officers were injured.
	   Clashes resumed Monday, with groups of Umm al-Fahm youths
throwing stones at police who responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets. At least five protesters were injured and four arrested.

Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest bankruptcy since WWII

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's wobbly economy and shaky financial system
have claimed its latest victim _ a major leasing firm that declared
bankruptcy with debts totaling more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs 16
billion).
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing Corp. marked the country's biggest
bankruptcy since World War II, but it was just the latest in a
string of high-profile corporate failures.
	   ``Bigger failures are definitely out there somewhere,'' said
Chris Calderwood, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of Jardine
Fleming Securities Co. ``There will be more.''
	   Like many companies which borrowed heavily during an economic
boom in the 1980s, the leasing agent for computers, aircraft and
other equipment was burdened by a crushing load of debts which
soured with the onset of slower growth in the 1990s.
	   With little hope of restructuring itself, the 35-year old
company sought protection from its creditors late Sunday. The
immediate trigger for that decision, however, was the crisis faced
by its parent company, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   Japanese lawmakers had vowed last week to block the credit
bank's attempt to write off bad loans extended to Japan Leasing
Corp. and other affiliates.
	   The move paved the way for a legislative compromise to allow the
government to nationalize ailing lenders such as the LCTB.
	   But it was the death knell for Japan Leasing.
	   Teikoku Data Bank, a Tokyo-based credit research firm generally
regarded as authoritative on bankruptcies, said the failure was the
biggest so far since the end of World War II.
	   Investors appeared to shrug off the news, however. Instead of
starting a market meltdown, stocks rose and analysts said the
failure might actually be good for Japan's troubled banking sector.
	   ``This is a step forward and is very positive in regard to
passing the bank bills,'' said Koyo Ozeki, a bank analyst at
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
	   Tokyo's stock market started higher and continued climbing
throughout the day. The benchmark Nikkei rose 185.53 points to
close at 13,903.37 points, up 1.35 percent.
	   Japan Leasing will be taken over by court-appointed managers
within the next few days, a company lawyer said. Its board of
directors will resign.
	   Hiroaki Okamoto, the president of the failed leasing company,
said he did not know how much of his firm's 2.18 trillion yen (dlrs
16 billion) in debts it would be able to pay back.
	   ``Our efforts to restructure the company proved to be
impossible,'' Okamoto said. ``I deeply apologize to our creditors
and for the effects this will have on the financial system.''
	   The worst previous Japanese bankruptcy was of Crown Leasing, a
lender with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs 8.86 billion) that
went under in April 1997, according to Teikoku Data Bank.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co.
	   Yamaichi announced last November it was throwing in the towel,
leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38 billion) and
8,000 people without work.
	   Earlier this month, Toa Steel Co., an affiliate of leading
Japanese steelmaker NKK Corp., collapsed under a massive debt load.
	   Daido Concrete Co. failed earlier this year, and major food
company Toshoku Ltd. went under late last year as did leading
commercial lender Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared an end Monday to ``anti-terrorist
activities'' in Kosovo but warned they will resume if there are new
attacks by Albanian separatists.
	   Premier Mirko Marjanovic told the Serbian parliament that
special police units will return to barracks _ a condition demanded
by both American and European diplomats to avoid a NATO attack. By
early afternoon Monday, however, there was no visible withdrawal of
the units.
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new terrorist bandit-terrorist activity
appears again,'' Marjanovic said. ``I wish to declare that with
this day ... the armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   But the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army issued a statement
Monday, pledging to continue ``the holy war'' against Serbia and
demanding an urgent NATO action in Kosovo. The statement also
criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders ``whose actions are
hindering this holy war.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, sporadic
fighting was reported in Kosovo also Monday. The Kosovo Information
Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian leadership, reported
Serbian shelling in the region of the Suva Reka village and
Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   The Center also claimed that two ethnic Albanian families,
including 15 members, were ``massacred'' by withdrawing Serb troops
in the central Drenica region on Sunday. The report could not be
independently confirmed.

Yeltsin: Russia will keep financing An-70 contruction in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite the economic crisis, Russia will keep
financing its share of the joint construction of An-70 planes with
Ukraine, President Boris Yeltsin said Monday.
	   In an order to the government signed Monday, Yeltsin said the
project remains a ``priority direction in the development of
(Russia's) aircraft industry,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin also told the government to pay for the testing of the
Antonov An-70 craft that have already been manufactured and to keep
up financing in the future, ITAR-Tass and the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Yeltsin's aide in charge of the project, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov,
met with German and Ukrainian officials in Bonn last week to
discuss possible funding by Germany and other European countries,
Interfax reported.
	   Since the fall of communism, Germany has become Russia's most
important trade partner outside the former Soviet Union, and a key
source of aid and credit.
	   Ukraine has also been trying to enlist Germany and France to
help build a Ukrainian version of the Antonov An-70 military
transport plane.

Catholic Church urges removal of foreign troops from Congo,
</HEADLINE>
Lesotho &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Roman Catholic Church of Zimbabwe
called Monday for the removal of foreign troops from the Congo and
Lesotho.
	   The church's Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace said the
deployment of Angolan, Namibian and Zimbabwean troops in Congo, and
South African and Botswanan troops in Lesotho, came with
``extraordinary haste.''
	   ``The consequences of these military interventions are
far-reaching, costly and devastating for the ordinary people of the
affected countries,'' the commission said in a statement.
	   More could have been done, it added, to find diplomatic and
negotiated solutions in broad consultation with the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity and the United Nations.
	   Zimbabwe has sent nearly 3,000 troops, backed by warplanes and
armored cars, to support Congolese president Laurent Kabila battle
an insurrection.
	   Zimbabwe argues it had to act swiftly to prevent Kinshasa, the
Congolese capital, from falling to the rebels.
	   Last week's intervention in the Lesotho mountain kingdom that is
completely surrounded by South Africa left at least 67 troops from
both sides dead, along with several dozen civilians, and led to
widespread looting and arson.
	   The action aimed to prevent a military mutiny from escalating
into a coup, and to bolster the civilian government elected last
May against bitter opposition by rival political parties.
	   Zimbabwe is estimated to be spending up to dlrs 1 million a day
in Congo. Defense Minister Moven Mahachi declined to specify the
cost, but defended the operation. ``When a friend's house is on
fire, you don't ask where the money is, you just go and help him,''
he said.
	   In South Africa, despite widespread criticism of the
intervention _ directed more to its flawed execution than to its
motives _ president Nelson Mandela repeatedly has noted it came at
the request of the elected government, and was necessary and right.
	   He was scheduled to meet Tuesday in Cape Town with Lesotho's
King Letsie III.

Iran gears up for another war games on Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran stepped up its war rhetoric by sending
more troops along its eastern border with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Some 200,000 troops are to take part in war games, codenamed
Zulfaqar 2, which are to begin within the next few days, the agency
said.
	   It said Iran will use Katyusha rockets for the first in the
maneuvers which are to take place in a 50,000-square kilometer
(20,000 square-mile) area.
	   The Taliban say they have moved 20,000 troops to the border in
response to Iran's war games.
	   The maneuvers come amid rising tensions between Iran and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia over last month's slaying of nine
Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban fighters.
	   The Taliban, which rule about 90 percent of Afghanistan, blame
renegade fighters for the slayings, but have refused Iranian
demands to hand over the killers. They accuse Iran of backing
Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance.
	   During the maneuvers, Iranian ground troops, air force and navy
will hold joint operations and will conduct ``electronic warfare
and operations to foil chemical, biological and nuclear attacks,''
said Brig. Gen. Hassan Barati, spokesman for the war games.
	   ``The war games are designed to exercise large-extent rapid
deployment, familiarize the army commanders with the geographical
specifications of eastern Iran and test the arms newly built or
purchased by the army,'' IRNA quoted Barati as saying.
	   He said the war games will include attacks on mock enemy
positions and long-range weapons will be used against imaginary
targets.
	   Iran conducted similar maneuvers early this month.

Serbia's leader threatens taking hostages in case of NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice
premier threatened Monday to take pro-Western Serbs hostage in case
of NATO air strikes.
	   Vojislav Seselj told Serbia's parliament that if they decide to
strike against Serbia, the U.S. and other Western countries
``should better withdraw'' all Serb ``traitors'' from Yugoslavia
``before we grab them'' and take them ``hostage.''
	   Seselj's list of pro-Western ``traitors'' included journalists
of independent Nasa Borba, Blic and Glas Javnosti dailies and
members of independent human rights, intellectual and peace groups,
such as the Belgrade Circle, Serbia's Helsinki Committee and the
Women in Black.
	   Seselj's address was greeted with loud applause from Serbian
deputies who discussed the Kosovo crisis.
	   Seselj, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Radical Party, who
is allied with Socialists of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
in the Serbian government, also said that Serbia's armed forces
``should use all available means'' to counter eventual NATO strike.
	   On Wednesday, NATO threatened action if Milosevic did not stop
the offensive against Kosovos's separatists and allow for the safe
return of refugees.

Poll: Most Russians say wage payments should be government
</HEADLINE>
priority &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A majority of Russians believe the new government
should concentrate on paying off back wages and pensions, a poll
released Monday indicated. The new government has said that would
be its top priority.
	   Respondents in a poll conducted last week by the independent
All-Russian Public Opinion Center were asked to name the top three
priorities for the government. Paying off wage debts was the top
choice, mentioned by 55 percent of those polled.
	   It was followed by reducing prices, mentioned by 46 percent,
``improving'' the ruble's exchange rate, mentioned by 40 percent,
and establishing price controls, by 37 percent, according to
results carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was appointed three weeks
ago, he has repeatedly stressed that his government's top priority
would be the payment of salaries and pensions.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant daily earlier
this month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4
billion) in back salaries and social payments.
	   Primakov said Monday his government has paid off its debt in
back salaries to the armed forces and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days.
	   Other priorities suggested in the poll included raising wages,
pensions and bank deposits to compensate for price increases (25
percent), fighting corruption and theft of state assets (22
percent), financial support for state-run enterprises (18 percent).
	   Support for private business was the least favorite among the 15
possible choices, mentioned by only 6 percent. In post-Soviet
Russia, private businesses have largely accounted for the creation
of a small middle class, which was expected to become the backbone
of economic and political stability. But many impoverished Russians
resent private business people.
	   Improving tax collection _ which is demanded by the
International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders _ was
advocated by only 9 percent of those polled.
	   The poll of 2,400 people had a margin of error of plus or minus
3 percentage points. The report did not say how the poll was
conducted.

Report clears military authorities of Srebrenica cover ups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An independent inquiry Monday
cleared the Dutch military of trying to cover up its troops'
failings in the 1995 fall of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of
Srebrenica.
	   But the inquiry, ordered last month by Defense Minister Frank de
Grave, did find ``many shortcomings and much carelessness in the
information process'' following one of the worst debacles in Dutch
military history.
	   Charged by the United Nations with protecting the Muslim enclave
of Srebrenica, a group of 300 Dutch soldiers could only look on
helplessly as rebel Serbs overran the area in July 1995.
	   More than 6,000 Muslims are believed to have been massacred in
the immediate aftermath of the takeover.
	   In the face of international criticism at their lack of action,
Dutch top brass insisted the troops were outnumbered and outgunned
and also barred by their U.N. mandate from engaging in combat.
	   But in the three years since the humiliation, Dutch media have
reported a string of embarrassing episodes linked to the Srebrenica
fall.
	   Allegations include Dutch troops driving a tank through a crowd
of fleeing Muslims, killing up to 30, the destruction of rolls of
film said to contain photographs of peacekeepers helping Serbs
separate Muslim men from women for deportation and claims by four
medics that they were ordered not to treat wounded Muslims.
	   Although military authorities knew about all of the incidents,
there was a suspicion that they were not always immediately or
fully reported to the Defense Ministry, prompting Minister De Grave
to order the inquiry.
	   The inquiry's author, senior civil servant Jos van Kemenade, was
charged with investigating whether the lack of information was a
deliberate attempt to hide the truth.
	   He said it was not.
	   ``There is no question of this being swept under the carpet,''
concluded inquiry leader Jos van Kemenade. ``But the gathering,
distribution and use of information about peacekeeping missions
can, in possible future operations, be considerably better than it
was in this case.''

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Thousands of public employees returned to
work Monday, when government offices opened in Lesotho's capital
for the first time since last week's South Africa-led intervention
to forestall a coup.
	   Meanwhile, about 1,000 Lesotho soldiers returned to their bases
Monday in uniform and with their weapons, as ordered, for review of
their roles in events of recent weeks. Rebels face possible
punishment. Others could be reinstated in the 2,000-member Lesotho
Defense Force.
	   It was unclear how many members of the force actually
participated in the rebellion, and how many simply resisted when
foreign troops intervened. Officials said Monday that those who did
not surrender by the end of the day would be presumed to be rebels
and tracked down by the intervention force.
	   Last week, South Africa and neighboring Botswana sent about
1,000 troops into Lesotho, a poor country of 2 million people
surrounded by South Africa, after the government requested help
dealing with an army mutiny and crippling strikes.
	   South Africa's first peacekeeping mission since apartheid got
off to a rocky start when the force arrived last Tuesday without
advance warning. Believing they were being invaded, both loyalist
and mutinous Lesotho soldiers turned their guns on the South
Africans.
	   The political and military unrest in this mountain kingdom
remained a priority for governments in the region.
	   The defense ministers of South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe
were scheduled to meet Monday in Maseru, and King Letsie III was to
travel Tuesday to Cape Town for talks with South Africa President
Nelson Mandela.
	   The capital city of 50,000 was mostly calm for a third day
Monday, but officials have estimated that it could take years to
repair the widespread devastation caused by arson and looting.
	   The security situation was largely under control, despite
occasional sniper attacks. Nevertheless, businessmen were uneasy
about reopening undamaged stores. Aid groups haven't restored food
distribution to rural, subsistence farming communities where most
of the people live.
	   South Africa's involvement has been criticized by opposition
parties in Parliament who condemned the military move as
unnecessary and costly in lives and money.
	   At least 67 troops from both sides died in Tuesday's
intervention, as well as at least 10 South African soldiers.
Thousands of refugees also fled to towns in South Africa seeking
shelter and food.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, whose Lesotho Congress Party
won 79 of the 80 seats in parliament in elections last May, is
bitterly opposed by parties that garnered 39 percent of the vote _
but just a single seat.
	   They claim, without providing convincing evidence, that the vote
was rigged. The government and international observers say there
was little or no fraud.

Serb premier says special police units will be pulled out of

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier told parliament Monday that Kosovo's armed
separatists have been defeated and special police units will be
withdrawn from the province.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, issued a statement Monday pledging to continue what
it called ``the holy war'' against Serbia and demanding NATO
action. The statement also criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian
leaders ``whose actions are hindering this holy war.''
	   Marjanovic said the special police units will return to barracks
_ a condition demanded by both American and European diplomats to
avoid a NATO attack. By early afternoon Monday, however, there was
no visible withdrawal of the units.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Sporadic fighting was reported in Kosovo Monday. The Kosovo
Information Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, reported Serbian shelling in the region of the Suva
Reka village and Urosevac town south of Pristina, the provinicial
capital.
	   The Information Center also reported that two ethnic Albanian
families, including 15 members, were slain by withdrawing Serb
troops in the central Drenica region Sunday. The report could not
be independently confirmed.
	   In the Serb parliament, Marjanovic said the government will
grant amnesty to Kosovo Albanians who surrender weapons within the
next 10 days, as long as they have not committed ``war crimes.''
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new bandit-terrorist activity appears
again,'' he said. ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the
armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   ``Armed terrorist groups have been defeated,'' the Sebian
premier said. ``Conditions have been made ... to decrease
engagement of anti-terrorist forces. ...The forces that will be
decreased by this move will stay ready in their barracks for a
while, just in case that creation of a terrorist organization in
any part of Kosovo is renewed.''
	   He said the move was in accordance with an agreement Milosevic
signed in June with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Marjanovic also said the government would appoint a Temporary
Executive Council to ``strengthen civilian structures'' in the
province.
	   The premier made his remarks as he introduced a resolution
declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian resistance in Kosovo
was Serbia's top priority.
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from Kosovo and
begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the province's future.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against Kosovos's separatists
and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes in the
event that Milosevic failed to comply.
	   During the parliamentary session, Gorica Gajevic, general
secretary of Milosevic's Socialist Party, called on Kosovo
Albanians to open talks with the government. She denied the
government used excessive force in Kosovo.
	   ``It used as much force as was needed to stifle the evil of
terrorism in the way other world democratic countries do when faced
with terrorism,'' she said.
	   Another member of Milosevic's party, Dusan Matkovic, said that
if the world wants to help Kosovo, it should invest ``several
hundred million dollars'' in Kosovo's mines and economy.

Poll: Most Russians say wage payments should be government

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A majority of Russians believe the new government
should concentrate on paying off back wages and pensions, a poll
released Monday indicated. The new government has said that would
be its top priority.
	   Respondents in a poll conducted last week by the independent
All-Russian Public Opinion Center were asked to name the top three
priorities for the government. Paying off wage debts was the top
choice, mentioned by 55 percent of those polled.
	   It was followed by reducing prices, mentioned by 46 percent,
``improving'' the ruble's exchange rate, mentioned by 40 percent,
and establishing price controls, by 37 percent, according to
results carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   Since Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov was appointed three weeks
ago, he has repeatedly stressed that his government's top priority
would be the payment of salaries and pensions.
	   According to estimates published in the Kommersant daily earlier
this month, Russia owed a total of 36 billion rubles (dlrs 2.4
billion) in back salaries and social payments.
	   Primakov said Monday his government has paid off its debt in
back salaries to the armed forces and will be able to pay students
their stipends within days.
	   Other priorities suggested in the poll included raising wages,
pensions and bank deposits to compensate for price increases (25
percent), fighting corruption and theft of state assets (22
percent), financial support for state-run enterprises (18 percent).
	   Support for private business was the least favorite among the 15
possible choices, mentioned by only 6 percent. In post-Soviet
Russia, private businesses have largely accounted for the creation
of a small middle class, which was expected to become the backbone
of economic and political stability. But many impoverished Russians
resent private business people.
	   Improving tax collection _ which is demanded by the
International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders _ was
advocated by only 9 percent of those polled.
	   The poll of 2,400 people had a margin of error of plus or minus
3 percentage points. The pollsters said they conducted door-to-door
interviews in randomly selected cities, towns and villages around
the country.

Ruling Party, opposition reach agreement on bank bills

 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party announced Monday it had
reached a final agreement with the major opposition parties on a
key set of bills to clean up this country's troubled financial
system.
	   The announcement raised hopes that the bills, aimed at cleaning
up about dlrs 1 trillion of bad debt in the banking sector, would
be approved early next month, during the current session of
Parliament.
	   ``We'd like to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as
possible,'' Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, said after a set of marathon talks with
the opposition that went through the weekend.
	   Over the weekend, the ruling party gave into opposition demands
to allow the nationalization of cash-strapped Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan, one of the nation's biggest banks, and to block its
attempt to write off bad loans extended to its affiliates.
	   One of its affiliates, Japan Leasing Corp., collapsed, filing
for court protection late Sunday in the nation's biggest bankruptcy
since World War II.
	   Last week, the LDP and opposition reached a basic accord on the
bills, which incorporated the key parts of the opposition's rival
version of the legislation.
	   But the agreement was vague, and began to unravel almost as soon
as it was announced.
	   The breakthrough Monday, however, centered on a compromise over
how much power to give a new independent body that will be charged
with regulating the finance sector.
	   The opposition, led by the Democratic Party, had demanded the
body be given full authority to chart the course of the financial
sector. But the LDP said that would take too much power away from
the Finance Ministry.
	   The two sides agreed regulation of the finance sector would be
shared by the ministry and the independent panel.
	   They also agreed that any bank whose capital falls precariously
while purchasing an ailing bank that has been nationalized will be
eligible for an injection of public funds.
	   The chief of Keidanren, Japan's main big business lobby, was
encouraged by Monday's breakthrough, but urged swift action in
implementing the legislation.
	   ``Parliament has been in session for 60 days, I hope it won't
take another 60 to get the agreement finalized and passed,'' said
Takashi Imai.
	   Opposition and ruling parties said the session might have to be
extended by a week after its scheduled end on Oct. 7.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley also welcomed Monday's
breakthrough.
	   ``We think it was a very constructive agreement. We were very
glad to hear it,'' Foley said.
	   The United States and other nations have been growing
increasingly impatient with Japan's laggard pace in approving the
bills, which are seen as essential to nursing the economy out of
its recession.
	   On Saturday, the two sides reached a compromise on one of their
main points of contention _ the fate of ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   The ruling party acquiesced to opposition demands that the
government acquire all of LTCB's shares, effectively nationalizing
it. The government would then sell the bank back to the private
sector after disposing of its bad assets.
	   The government has been trying to broker a merger between LTCB
and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. Under this weekend's agreement,
Sumitomo would be able buy LTCB shares from the government, and
turn the bank into a subsidiary.

Philippines calls on wealthy to give poor markets access, aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Philippines urged wealthy nations to
remove export barriers for goods from the developing world and
called for more development aid to bring South Asian economies back
from collapse.
	   The Philippines' foreign affairs secretary, Domingo Siazon, told
the General Assembly's annual debate that the Asian financial
crisis was his country's ``immediate global concern.''
	   ``For in its wake, millions of lives have been afflicted with
untold suffering. For in its path, nations may fall,'' he said.
	   Although badly hobbled by the Asian financial crisis, the
Philippine economy is in better shape than many of its harder-hit
neighbors.
	   Last week the Philippine government and the International
Monetary Fund agreed on a 1.5 percent economic growth target this
year. If the target is achieved, the Philippines would be one of
the few countries in Southeast Asia to avoid an economic
contraction as a result of the region's crisis.
	   For the good of the region, Siazon called on the industrialized
world and the United Nations to fight off protectionism ``which is
a commonplace and desperate response during economic downturns.
	   ``The richer economies, aside from fully implementing their
multilateral commitments ... should act to remove or minimize
market access barriers, especially on export products from
developing countries,'' he said.
	   He also decried the decline in development assistance from donor
countries.
	   ``Now more than ever, social amelioration programs and safety
nets that directly benefit the most vulnerable sectors in many
countries must be enhanced,'' he said.
	   On another matter, Siazon urged more international efforts to
help Cambodia reach a settled and democratic solution to its
political turmoil. Opposition parties have been protesting the
electoral victory of Hun Sen, who staged a violent coup last year.
	   He said efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
the Friends of Cambodia group and the United Nations have not been
in vain.
	   ``They have just not been enough. Much could be done, a lot
should be done. But so much more needs to be done by the Cambodians
themselves to pull their country from the brink.''

Army chief: Israel must be ready for strike against Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The commander of Israel's armed forces said
Monday that Israel has to be ready for a pre-emptive strike against
Iran, should this become necessary.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz was commenting on last week's military
parade in Tehran in which Shahab-3 missiles capable of reaching
Israel were shown.
	   Mofaz told Israel that the missiles, together with the nuclear
warheads which Israel believes Iran is developing, pose ``a
long-term threat to Israel's survival.''
	   Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's
destruction.
	   Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh from the opposition Labor Party said
Sunday that Israel must consider a pre-emptive strike against Iran,
using conventional weapons.
	   Other lawmakers criticized Sneh's statement as irresponsible.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no call for such
declarations.
	   However, Mofaz said Monday that the concept of a pre-emptive
strike against an imminent threat is ``part of the world view'' of
the Israeli armed forces.
	   ``I think ... a pre-emptive strike is something the armed forces
should be ready for, and if it is needed they must be capable of
carrying it out,'' he said.
	   At the start of the 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli air force
destroyed most of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces in
a pre-emptive strike.
	   In 1981, Israeli fighter bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor in
Iraq shortly before it was to become operational. Israel believed
the reactor would be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
	   Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage, will be ready. He said Iran is developing
atomic weapons at the same fast rate.
	   Mofaz did not say how a pre-emptive strike against Iran would be
carried out. The Israeli air force recently took delivery of a new
version of the American F-15 warplane which is capable of reaching
Iran.

Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest bankruptcy since WWII

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's wobbly economy and shaky financial system
have claimed their latest victim _ a major leasing firm that
declared bankruptcy with debts totaling more than 2 trillion yen
(dlrs 16 billion).
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing Corp. marked the country's biggest
bankruptcy since World War II, but it was just the latest in a
string of high-profile corporate failures.
	   ``Bigger failures are definitely out there somewhere,'' said
Chris Calderwood, chief economist at the Tokyo branch of Jardine
Fleming Securities Co. ``There will be more.''
	   Like many companies which borrowed heavily during an economic
boom in the 1980s, the leasing agent for computers, aircraft and
other equipment was burdened by a crushing load of debts which
soured with the onset of slower growth in the 1990s.
	   With little hope of restructuring itself, the 35-year old
company sought protection from its creditors late Sunday. The
immediate trigger for that decision, however, was the crisis faced
by its parent company, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   Japanese lawmakers had vowed last week to block the credit
bank's attempt to write off bad loans extended to Japan Leasing
Corp. and other affiliates.
	   The move paved the way for a legislative compromise to allow the
government to nationalize ailing lenders such as the LCTB.
	   But it was the death knell for Japan Leasing.
	   Teikoku Data Bank, a Tokyo-based credit research firm generally
regarded as authoritative on bankruptcies, said the failure was the
biggest so far since the end of World War II.
	   Investors appeared to shrug off the news, however. Instead of
starting a market meltdown, stocks rose and analysts said the
failure might actually be good for Japan's troubled banking sector.
	   ``This is a step forward and is very positive in regard to
passing the bank bills,'' said Koyo Ozeki, a bank analyst at
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
	   Tokyo's stock market started higher and continued climbing
throughout the day. The benchmark Nikkei rose 185.53 points to
close at 13,903.37 points, up 1.35 percent.
	   Japan Leasing will be taken over by court-appointed managers
within the next few days, a company lawyer said. Its board of
directors will resign.
	   Hiroaki Okamoto, the president of the failed leasing company,
said he did not know how much of his firm's 2.18 trillion yen (dlrs
16 billion) in debts it would be able to pay back.
	   ``Our efforts to restructure the company proved to be
impossible,'' Okamoto said. ``I deeply apologize to our creditors
and for the effects this will have on the financial system.''
	   The worst previous Japanese bankruptcy was of Crown Leasing, a
lender with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs 8.86 billion) that
went under in April 1997, according to Teikoku Data Bank.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co.
	   Yamaichi announced last November it was throwing in the towel,
leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38 billion) and
8,000 people without work.
	   Earlier this month, Toa Steel Co., an affiliate of leading
Japanese steelmaker NKK Corp., collapsed under a massive debt load.
	   Daido Concrete Co. failed earlier this year, and major food
company Toshoku Ltd. went under late last year as did leading
commercial lender Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.

Senior clerics say edict against Rushdie must be upheld
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Islamic edict that calls for British
author Salman Rushdie's death is irrevocable and must be
implemented, two senior Iranian clerics were quoted as saying
Monday.
	   ``I heard that England is under the illusion that the fatwa
(edict) against the apostate Rushdie will be revoked. This fatwa is
irrevocable and cannot be changed at any time. It is obligatory to
carry out the fatwa,'' Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani,
said in a statement published in the hard line Resalat daily.
	   He said the Iranian government should be among the first in the
world to support the edict even if it does not intend to carry it
out.
	   Nouri Hamedani, another Grand Ayatollah, said the fatwa must be
enforced and no high-ranking Muslim scholar can issue a fatwa to
reverse it.
	   The words of the two clerics, who have a big following among
Iranians, carry substantial weight in Iran.
	   The debate over the edict has intensified after Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Thursday distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for Rushdie's death.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   ``The issue of Rushdie will only end with killing him and all
the elements associated with the publishing of the book. The fatwa
of killing Rushdie will be implemented,'' the Resalat daily said in
an editorial.
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain has sought better
ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran, which
have gone to France and other European countries.
	   Iran has been trying to change its foreign policy ever since
Khatami, a moderate cleric, became president in August 1997.
Khatami has underscored the need to replace confrontation with
dialogue in Iran's relations with the West, including the United
States.
	   But powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always
supported the death sentence and are likely to continue to do so.
	   Another senior cleric, Ayatollah Hossein Mazaheri, said the
edict remains valid and could not be changed.
	   ``The execution of the divine death sentence remains a duty for
every Muslim until the day of resurrection,'' the Islamic Republic
News Agency quoted Mazaheri, who is a representative for Iran's
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the central province of
Isfahan, as saying.

Russian Duma speaker calls for union among Russia, Ukraine and
</HEADLINE>
Belarus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Russia's parliamentary speaker called
Monday for creation of a union among Russia, Ukraine and Belarus as
a means of overcoming their common economic and political problems,
a news report said.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, a member of the Communist Party and speaker
of parliament's lower house, the State Duma, said the creation of
such a union would help solve ``a great deal of problems.''
	   ``It would be hailed by our peoples as the most important event
of the 20th century,'' Seleznyov said in comments cited by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Seleznyov brought a State Duma delegation to Kiev on Monday for
two days of talks with Ukraine's leaders.
	   During his meeting with Ukrainian parliament Speaker Oleksandr
Tkachenko, the two men said they shared common views on how Russia
and Ukraine should develop, and pledged to enhance cooperation to
overcome the economic crisis the two countries are enduring.
	   But Seleznyov's meeting with Ukraine's Foreign Minister Borys
Tarasyuk later in the day appeared to show that the two sides
remain at odds over their attitude towards NATO, which has long
been a thorny issue in the two countries' relations.
	   Seleznyov criticized Tarasyuk for his earlier characteristic of
NATO as a ``remarkable organization'' and said that Ukraine and
Russia should pursue a joint policy towards the alliance, according
to Interfax.
	   Tarasyuk, in turn, said integration into European institutions
remains a priority for Ukraine along with close cooperation with
Russia, adding that ``NATO serves to support peace in stability''
in Europe.
	   Ukraine has favored close relations with NATO, eagerly
participating and hosting military maneuvers under the alliance's
Partnership for Peace Program.
	   Such an approach has won sharp disapproval from Russia, with the
State Duma refusing to ratify a Ukrainian-Russian friendship and
cooperation treaty earlier this year because of Ukraine's links
with NATO.
	   Seleznyov said the Duma plans to debate the treaty by the end of
the year, but added that Russian lawmakers remain ``very worried''
over Ukraine's plans to cooperate with NATO.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart
Leonid Kuchma signed the bilateral friendship and cooperation
agreement in May 1997, and Ukraine's legislature overwhelmingly
ratified it last January.

Aziz meets with Annan, UN inspection stalemate looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting under way, no comments going
in. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Monday
with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the
7-week-old stalemate with Baghdad over arms inspections and the
U.N. chief's proposal to break the logjam.
	   The Iraqi delegation made no comment to reporters as they headed
into Annan's office at U.N. headquarters.
	   Aziz was leading a team that included the foreign minister, Said
al-Sahaf, the oil minister Amer Mohammed Rashid, the deputy foreign
minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, and a top adviser to President Saddam
Hussein, Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi.
	   The two sides were expected to discuss Annan's ideas for a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council asked Annan to formulate such a proposal
earlier this month, hoping that Iraq would back down from the
standoff knowing that a comprehensive review could highlight Iraq's
seven years of work to destroy its banned weapons.
	   The council stressed that no such review would take place until
Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Aziz, however, was instructed to insist that the United Nations
take the first step in ending the stalemate, Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, said in a statement carried Friday by the
official al-Iraq newspaper.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq stopped cooperating with inspectors after the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that it had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Monday's meeting comes as chemical weapons experts have been
meeting at U.N. headquarters to discuss the findings of Swiss and
French laboratories testing missile fragments for suspected traces
of the deadly VX gas.
	   Preliminary results from the European labs have been
inconclusive, diplomats have said.
	   A U.S. Army lab reported finding traces of the gas in June but
Baghdad disputed the findings.
	   Butler agreed to send other samples to European labs, though he
has said Saddam Hussein still must answer for the positive U.S.
tests.

President asks lawmakers to review a law on radio, TV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov asked
lawmakers Monday to review a law on radio and TV the opposition
says allows too much government control of the media and ignores
minority rights.
	   Siding with opposition demands, Stoyanov spelled out four points
on which he disagrees with the law sponsored by the government of
his party colleague Premier Ivan Kostov.
	   His move only suspends ultimate passage of the law which
Parliament approved last week. It will take effect if the lawmakers
ignore his remarks. But Premier Ivan Kostov said his party was
ready to discuss a review.
	   Stoyanov called for:
	   _ greater political balance in a 7-member media council that is
to supervise state radio and TV. The opposition fears the council
will reflect government views as four of its members are elected by
Parliament and three by the president;
	   _ nationwide broadcasts on state TV in minority languages,
particularly in Turkish, which the law allows only on regional
channels, while requiring the main programs to be in Bulgarian;
	   _ exemption of people who don't own TV sets from a fee imposed
on virtually all citizens and aimed to fund the state radio and TV;
	   - reversing a ban on commercials in state TV prime time.
	   All three opposition parties _ the Socialists of renamed
Communists, the social-democratic Euroleft and an alliance led by
an ethnic Turk's party _ have most vigorously protested against the
fees and the commercials ban. They have threatened to challenge the
law before the Constitutional Court which is empowered to revoke
legislation.
	   The cabinet wants the fees to gradually phase out government
funding of state media and put them under public control. The
opposition says the fees are unfairly imposed on people who don't
have TV sets or who pay for receiving state TV through cable
operators.
	   The government has said the ban on commercials would encourage
competition on the advertising market where the state TV, currently
the only one with nationwide coverage, holds the lion's share. The
opposition argues that the government wants to free space for loyal
private nationwide broadcasters, which it is to license.
	   It replaces an old one adopted under the previous Socialist
government. The Constitutional Court has invalidated key articles
of that law for imposing too much government control on the media.

Liberian leader Charles Taylor says he's in control after rival
</HEADLINE>
evacuated &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Liberian President Charles Taylor said Monday his
government was fully in control after new clashes with the
followers of his rival Roosevelt Johnson, in a country devastated
by years of civil war.
	   Taylor also said he fully supported the arrangement for
Johnson's airlift evacuation out of the country Friday from the
U.S. Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia, bringing an end to a diplomatic
standoff with Washington.
	   ``There's no fighting in Liberia. There was an attempt to
destabilize the government'' from Friday evening to Saturday
morning, Taylor told reporters after an hour-long meeting with
French President Jacques Chirac.
	   ``My government forces went in, settled the problem and, with a
very respectable arrangement with the United States,'' Johnson was
airlifted out of the country from the U.S. Embassy, he said in the
courtyard of the presidential Elysee Palace.
	   Johnson, taken Friday to Sierra Leone, is to be tried in
absentia for rape, murder, kidnapping and treason, he said.
	   ``The fact that the government forces would surgically move in,
solve this problem,'' Taylor said, ``showed that the government is
capable, that peace has finally come to Liberia, and that the
government is able to do what it was elected to do. That is provide
security and stability.''
	   But Taylor's forces were criticized by Washington after Johnson
fled to the embassy Sept. 19 during gun battles between his
supporters and government forces seeking to arrest him.
	   Taylor has insisted all shooting had occurred on Liberian
territory _ not on the embassy's grounds. While the shooting did
begin just outside the embassy gate, American diplomats have said
the Liberians were on American soil when the attack began.
	   Taylor has also defended his actions against Johnson's
supporters, saying the former warlord had created his own
mini-state in his neighborhood stronghold, largely populated by his
ethnic Krahn followers.
	   Chirac and Taylor, who was on a trip to court aid and trade,
announced no new agreements after their meeting.
	   ``It was not about just asking for assistance,'' Taylor said.
``It's about future bilateral cooperation.''
	   Taylor, on his first trip to Europe since being elected Aug. 1
last year, was on a three-day official visit to France that ends
Wednesday. He was to meet with several Cabinet ministers and visit
the port and wine region of Bordeaux.
	   Liberia's seven-year civil war ended in 1996, leaving an
estimated 200,000 people dead and 600,000 refugees. But fighting
had broken out again in recent months with fighters loyal to
Johnson.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients.

Ukraine, Belarus set up banking consortium to battle financial
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Under pressure from the financial crisis in
neighboring Russia, Ukraine and Belarus agreed Monday to set up a
banking consortium to help settle payments between the two
countries, a news report said.
	   The sides also agreed to invite a Russian bank to join the
consortium, which already includes Ukraine's Prominvestbank, its
largest, and Belarus' Promstroibank, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The agreement was reached during a meeting between Ukrainian
Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and his Belarusian counterpart,
Sergei Ling, who arrived in Kiev on Monday.
	   The formation of the consortium would help stabilize banking
transactions and enliven cooperation between Ukrainian and
Belarusian banks, which was seriously hampered by Russia's turmoil,
Prominvestbank chairman Volodymyr Matvienko said.
	   Ukraine and Belarus, which maintain close trade links with
Russia, were hit hard by the ruble's fall and the following turmoil
on Russia's financial market.
	   The three countries' leaders have communicated intensely over
past weeks, trying to come up with a quick solution to the crisis.
	   Separately, Pustovoitenko and Ling also discussed preparation of
a 10-year bilateral economic cooperation program, which the
Ukrainian and Belarussian presidents are expected to sign by the
end of 1998, according to Interfax.
	   Ukraine's Foreign Trade Minister Serhiy Osyka said
implementation of the program, which is already 70 percent
complete, would boost Ukrainian-Belarussian trade by up to dlrs 700
million next year.
	   Trade between the two countries amounted to dlrs 1.4 billion in
1997, and may fall to dlrs 1.1 billion this year due to the Russian
crisis, Osyka said.

Malaysia warns of global depression
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Malaysia's foreign minister, whose country
is facing an economic and political crisis, warned of a global
depression Monday unless developing countries helped reform the
international financial system.
	   Blaming overseas currency speculators for the economic crisis
that has swept his country and much of Asia, Abdullah Badawi told
world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the turmoil had
given developing countries second thoughts about the benefits of
globalization.
	   Without reforms, ``the threat of a global depression, as
devastating as the one that hit the world in the thirties, could
confront us,'' Badawi said.
	   Malaysia's economic problems, spurred by the Asian financial
crisis, are its worst in more than three decades. The economy
contracted by almost 7 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
pushing it into full-blown recession.
	   The crisis and opposition to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
decision to fire and arrest Anwar Ibrahim, his former deputy and
heir apparent, has sparked a series of protests in Malaysia.
	   Badawi said the international community ``must find consensus to
formulate necessary ground rules to keep in check the rapacious
nature of financial speculators and manipulators whose only
motivation is profit-making and profit-taking.''
	   He said international financial markets lacked transparency, and
called for rules governing the buying and selling of currencies.
	   ``It is now most urgent that the international financial market
be reformed. More than that, significant changes should be made to
the international financial architecture.''
	   He said that globalization and free trade were impossible until
developing countries were given the time to strengthen their
economies.
	   Otherwise, ``it would be a continuing form of exploitation of
the weak and poor nations by those that are powerful and rich.''

EU nations expect Schroeder to continue pro-unity policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ With the towering figure of Helmut Kohl
removed from the European scene, Germany's neighbors are watching
how Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder will affect the continental
balance of power.
	   For 16 years, Kohl used the economic and political strength of
the EU's largest nation to shape key EU policies _ from the
impending launch of a common currency to a planned expansion into
Eastern Europe.
	   Few expect any sudden, fundamental change in Germany's European
stance.
	   ``You don't change foreign policy as often as you change a
government,'' Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Pedersen said
Monday. ``Germany will continue to have strong ties to the European
Union, the United States, to NATO.''
	   Nevertheless, many wonder if Schroeder, who was born at the end
of World War II, shares Kohl's emotional commitment to a united
Europe which stemmed from childhood memories of a continent
ravished by war.
	   ``The new leadership will feel in a different way this
connection between Germany and Europe,'' said Italian Defense
Minister Beniamino Andreatta. ``But I hope that Mr. Kohl's legacy,
Germany's role toward the West, will not be changed.''
	   The victory of Schroeder's Social Democrats in Sunday's election
means Socialists now lead the governments of the EU's three biggest
powers _ Germany, France and Britain.
	   ``It's a new era opening up,'' said British Prime Minister Tony
Blair. ``It's a tremendous thing that we now have center-left
governments in the three countries ... I look forward to working
with them very much.''
	   Leaders of the other 14 EU nations are expected to meet
Schroeder Oct. 24 at a special summit in the Austrian lakeside
resort of Poertschach.
	   Many expect the new German leader to draw closer to Blair's
vision of a ``third way'' combining free market economics with a
commitment to social justice, than the more traditional socialist
approach of French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
	   ``He will look for closer relations with England,'' said Robert
Aspeslagh, senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for
International Relations in The Hague.
	   ``Before, in the EU, there was Germany and France on one side
and then Britain. Now you will see Germany, France and Britain as
equal partners.''
	   However, Britain's decision to stay out of the inner-club of EU
nations that switch to the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1,
means the relationship between Schroeder and Jospin remains
crucial.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance, and it will
remain the most important for Europe,'' said Schroeder after his
election win Sunday.
	   Schroeder once expressed doubts about ditching the Deutsche mark
for the euro, but he has fallen in line with the single currency
plan.
	   However, Germany's European allies are expecting Schroeder to
follow Kohl's line in demanding pays a smaller share of the cost of
bringing the former-communist nations to the east into the EU fold
some time next decade.
	   ``Whoever is in power will have to do more on the contributions,
because Germany is not the rich country it was,'' said Anne-Marie
Le Gloannec, deputy director of the Paris-based Center for
International Studies and Research.
	   Germany paid almost one-third of the dlrs 86 billion budget this
year and wrangling over how to share the burden is expected to
dominate EU business over the coming months as Germany prepares to
take over the presidency of the Union for the first six months of
1999.
	   Despite the likely entry into the Schroeder government of
ministers from the pacifist Green Party, NATO official said they
expected no weakening of Germany's steadfast support for the
alliance, even if that means German planes going to war in Kosovo.

Chechen leader pledges to fight kidnappings, faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new conditions for release of Russian envoy in
3rd graf, edits throughout to strengthen opposition angle.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, under
increasing pressure from opposition leaders to resign, said his
government would publicly execute kidnappers to stop a crime wave
that has swept the breakaway republic, news agencies reported on
Monday.
	   Speaking on national television, Maskhadov claimed foreign
secret services were behind the Chechen gangs responsible for
frequent kidnappings in the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. He did not identify the countries.
	   Meanwhile, the abductors of Russia's presidential envoy to
Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, said Monday they are ready to release
him in exchange for Doku Zavgayev, who headed Chechnya's pro-Moscow
government during the republic's 1994-96 independence war, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Chechnya has seen an increase in kidnappings, theft, and
violence among armed gangs, Muslim sects and ethnic groups since
its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. Maskhadov's attempts to
rein in crime have brought little result.
	   Maskhadov's government faces growing opposition from Chechen
warlords, who plan to gather later this week and demand that he
take a tougher line in relations with Russia and fulfill other
demands, or resign, Interfax reported.
	   The warlords have refused to obey Maskhadov's orders and accuse
him of maintaining too-close relations with the Russian government.
	   Shamil Basayev, who served as Maskhadov's prime minister earlier
this year, has recently joined the others pushing for the
president's ouster.
	   Maskhadov turned down the warlords' demands over the weekend,
saying that he ``rejects the language of ultimatums and doesn't
intend to respond to letters of people who are guilty of breaking
the law,'' the report said.
	   Chechnya claims to be a sovereign nation, but Moscow says it
remains a part of Russia. No country has recognized Chechnya's
independence bid.
	   Despite his fight for independence, Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate and has been willing to negotiate with him.

Iraqi book on Gulf War says Saddam signaled invasion plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S envoy to Iraq during the 1990 Gulf
crisis should have grasped Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's plans
to attack Kuwait from a meeting she had with him a week beforehand,
says a book published by the Iraqi government.
	   The book renews an old argument since President Bush presents a
different picture of then-U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie in excerpts
from his new book on the Gulf war, ``A World Transformed,'' which
began appearing Monday in Arab newspapers.
	   ``The Grand Duel and its Leader,'' the Iraqi government's first
official account of the 1991 Gulf War, states that Saddam did not
explicitly say he was going to invade Kuwait.
	   But it said he clearly indicated that he wanted to punish
Kuwait, which he accused of deliberately trying to bring oil prices
down and harm Iraq's economy by flooding the market.
	   ``It was not difficult for Glaspie to realize the decisive tone
of Saddam Hussein, whom she knew as a man who sees his country
equal to any other nation,'' said the book, a copy of which was
obtained by The Associated Press ahead of its official debut.
	   ``We do not want war because we know what it means, but do not
push us to consider it as the only way for us to live in dignity,''
Saddam is quoted as telling Glaspie.
	   ``I hope this message will reach the president (Bush) and won't
be left in the hands of the State Department,'' Saddam told
Glaspie.
	   ``I clearly understand this message,'' Glaspie is quoted as
answering Saddam.
	   In Bush's book, co-authored with former National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the president defends Glaspie as ``a
trusted veteran diplomat'' and blames Saddam for underestimating
American interests in the Gulf.
	   After the invasion, Glaspie was blamed by some for not making
clear to Saddam that the United States would oppose Iraq's military
steps against Kuwait.
	   Iraqi media published the minutes of Saddam's meeting with
Glaspie a few days after the Aug. 2, 1990, invasion to try to
portray Washington as having endorsed the incursion. Glaspie was
quoted as saying the United States had no position on Iraqi
territorial claims to Kuwait.
	   President Bush, in his book, expresses his worries that the war
did not have a clean end and that Iraq already was claiming it won.
	   The Iraqi book maintains that Iraq essentially was victorious,
noting that it was not Iraq but leaders of the U.S.-led Gulf War
coalition that asked for the cease-fire ending the fighting. It
says Saddam first heard about it on a radio news broadcast.
	   ``The American President George Bush must have realized that his
calculations were wrong, he was trapped and the only way out was to
ask for a cease-fire,'' the book said.
	   ``The Grand Duel and its Leader'' was written by Saddam's press
secretary during the war, Abdel-Jabbar Muhsen, and Hamid Saeed, a
former editor of the ruling Baath Party newspaper Al-Thawra.

Slovak opposition works on forming new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official results to be announced Tuesday morning,
ruling party schedules news conference; trims outdated material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties held private
consultations Monday at forming a new government after sealing an
apparent victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their
intent to unite.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the opposition Party of the Democratic Left,
acknowledged Sunday after the release of unofficial results touched
off immediate dickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Official results are expected Tuesday morning, the Central
Election Commission said.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is released
Monday night or Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as
minority leader in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   The ruling party scheduled a news conference Tuesday at which
Meciar may appear.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties, headed by the
Slovak Democratic Coalition, have reiterated their intent to form a
governing coalition after results indicated they won 93 of the 150
seats in Parliament.
	   Finishing ahead of all 16 other parties will give Meciar the
first crack at forming a governing coalition, but his chances
appear bleak.
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.
	   Referring to Meciar, the Budapest daily Nepszabadsag said ``the
man who failed in the ... elections has left an ugly legacy for
Slovakia.''
	   ``If `Vlado' remains in power, the semi-democracy and the
unbridled crony-privatization will continue, Slovakia will never
get into NATO and the EU, and will become a pariah just like
Yugoslavia,'' the newspaper said.

Report: one dead, three injured in Mexico flooding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains swelled rivers in central Mexico
and triggered a mud slide in Mexico City on Monday, killing one
girl and injuring three people, local media reported.
	   Rainstorms soaked squatter communities perched on the steep
slopes of hillsides south of the city, and television footage
showed a stream of mud roaring down a gully there, with the ruins
of two homes that had been swept away.
	   The television network Televisa reported that a 13-year-old girl
died in the mudslide in Tierra Colorada, a squatter community
perched on the slopes of the Ajusco mountain. Three members of her
family were injured.
	   Some neighborhoods in a low-lying former lakebed to the east of
Mexico City have been flooded for days, and to the west, the Lerma
river overflowed its banks and left some villages inundated in
sewage.
	   Separately, Televisa reported that one child and one adult had
been swept away by swollen rivers in neighboring Puebla state and
were feared drowned Sunday.
	   Elsewhere, rivers overflowed in the southern state of Chiapas,
which was hit by flooding earlier this month that killed 185 people
and left thousands of towns and villages cut off from the outside
world.
	   Two temporary bridges built to replace ones destroyed in that
flooding were washed away again Sunday, local media reported.

Japanese lawmakers pledge swift passage of bank reform measures

 &UR; With BC-Japan-Bank Bills, BOX
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lawmakers ended weeks of wrangling over proposals
to resolve the nation's financial crisis by unveiling on Monday a
road map of sorts for passing key banking reform legislation.
	   Ruling party and opposition lawmakers ironed out the accord
after marathon talks over the weekend, raising hopes that bitter
political debate would give way to speedy passage of the bills.
	   The breakthrough came as a major leasing company affiliated with
a troubled credit bank filed for bankruptcy in the biggest
corporate failure in Japan since the end of World War II.
	   Yukio Hatoyama, deputy secretary-general of the Democratic
Party, the main opposition group, said he hoped the legislation
would pass before the current session of Parliament ends on Oct. 7.
He also signaled a willingness to extend the session.
	   ``We'd like to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as
possible,'' said Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The compromise deal, aimed at cleaning up some dlrs 1 trillion
in bad loans weighing down Japan's banking industry, comes after an
initial agreement struck last week unraveled almost immediately.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party has sought to prevent
any potentially destabilizing bank failures by infusing public
money into banks. But opposition parties have been wary of sticking
taxpayers with the bill for bailouts of badly-managed lenders.
	   The latest accord addresses a trio of controversial issues which
had bogged down passage of the broader banking reform package. It
focuses on the use of public money, the role of the Finance
Ministry and the fate of an ailing major credit bank.
	   The two sides agreed to set up an as yet unspecified framework
for rescuing weakened banks by allowing them to replenish capital
reserves with government funds.
	   They also pledged to transfer some crisis planning and
management authority from the Japanese Finance Ministry to a new
independent oversight committee.
	   Over the weekend, ruling party and opposition lawmakers agreed
to allow the government to nationalize the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. by purchasing shares in the ailing lender.
	   The bank is the parent company of Japan Leasing Corp., which
collapsed late Sunday with debts of more than 2 trillion yen (dlrs
16 billion). It filled for bankruptcy after lawmakers had vowed not
to allow the LTCB to write off soured loans extended to Japan
Leasing and two other debt-burdened affiliates.
	   The chief of Keidanren, Japan's main big business lobby, was
encouraged by the new accord but urged swift action in carrying it
out.
	   ``Parliament has been in session for 60 days, I hope it won't
take another 60 to get the agreement finalized and passed,'' said
Takashi Imai.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley also welcomed Monday's
breakthrough.
	   ``We think it was a very constructive agreement. We were very
glad to hear it,'' Foley said.
	   The United States and other nations have been growing
increasingly impatient with Japan's laggard pace in approving the
bills, which are seen as essential to nursing the economy out of
its recession.

Parma, Betis threatened with quick exit from UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy's Parma and Spain's Betis, two of Europe's
big spenders, are in danger of being eliminated from the lucrative
UEFA Cup. And it's only the first round.
	   And Germany's Stuttgart, thrashed two weeks ago at home 3-1 by
Dutch leaders Feyenoord, is as good as gone entering the second leg
_ one of 31 matches Tuesday across Europe.
	   Parma spent about dlrs 60 million this summer on transfers.
Seville-based Betis spent half that much on one player _ dlrs 35
million for Brazilian Denilson.
	   So far, the investments haven't paid off as both clubs return
home trailing 1-0.
	   Parma, 1995 UEFA champions and '93 Cup Winners Cup titlists, is
in big trouble. The Italians are injury-hit, struggling on offense
and, in Turkey's Fenerbache, face a club that's due to advance.
	   Parma's top striker Enrico Chiesa is out with an ankle injury,
and Croatian winger Mario Stanic is also hurt. Midfielder Dino
Baggio and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended on red cards.
	   History this time is either with _ or against _ Fenerbache. No
Turkish team in 16 tries has eliminated an Italian side from
European competition. Parma's last lost at home in cup play was
five years ago. Since then Parma is 15-1-0 at Tardini Stadium.
	   ``We want to write history by eliminating Parma,'' said
Fenerbache spokesman Ali Yildirim. ``We have the power to do
that.''
	   Fenerbache players are getting a substantial bonus _ reported
earlier at dlrs 18,000 _ for eliminating the Italians.
	   Betis, facing Danish side Vejle, is having what coach Manual
Ruiz de Lopera calls a ``cursed September,'' which includes four
league games without a victory, good for 19th in the 20-team
Spanish league.
	   ``The league (season) is long and there is still time to
recover,'' the coach said. ``But fouling up the UEFA Cup would have
no remedy and serious consequences for Betis.''
	   As for Denilson, he's yet to score in league play and newspapers
are ripping him for his non-team style. To make matters worse,
Betis' other striker _ Spanish international striker Alfonso Perez
_ may miss the game with an injury.
	   If you needed an early favorite, it would be Feyenoord.
	   The Rotterdam side has won all six of its league games and
defends a 3-1 lead against Stuttgart. Brazilian attacker Tininho is
injured, but Argentine striker Julio Cruz and Jon Dahl Tomasson
should provide the scoring.
	   Despite crowd disturbances in the first leg in Germany,
Rotterdam police are not expecting problems. ``We do not think this
is a high-risk match,'' police spokeswoman Laurie 't Hart said.
	   Fellow German side Bayern Leverkusen _ quarterfinalist last year
in the European Champions Cup _ is also in jeopardy of exiting
after a first-leg 1-1 draw at Udinese. The club is coming off a 1-0
league win over Schalke.
	   ``We had a good start at Schalke, so we hope to win against
Udinese,'' said coach Christoph Daum, who will be missing injured
Brazilian midfielder Emerson.
	   Udinese is tied for second in Italy's Serie A and has five goals
from Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso _ the same number he scored
last season.
	   Udinese has never won away in the UEFA Cup.
	   In other key games on a crowded day:
	   _ English Premier League leader Aston Villa takes a 3-2 lead to
Norway's Stromsgodset, with disappointing 7-million-pound (dlrs
11.5 million) transfer Stan Collymore expected to get a last-ditch
start in his bid to stay with the team.
	   _ Atletico Madrid, semifinalists last year in the European
Champions Cup, takes a 2-0 lead to Obilic, Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav
team is owned by Serbia's notorious warlord Zeljko
Raznatovic-Arkan. Players have been banned from talking to
reporters and their cellular phones have been confiscated.
	   _ Italian league leader Fiorentina is up 2-1 in a tough match at
Croatia's Hadjuk Split. Fiorentina, alone in first place for the
first time in 16 years, is rolling with six wins in six league and
cup games. Gabriel Batistuta will have to play without suspended
strike partners Rue Costa and Luis Oliveira. Hajduk has played
three home games with Italian clubs and has won all three by 3-1
scores.
	   _ Red Star Belgrade goes to France's Metz with a 2-1 lead but
will be without top striker Perica Ognjenovic, who is suspended.
	   _ Germany's Schalke, 1997 UEFA champion, takes a 1-0 lead to
Slavia Prague. Slavia has scored only once in its last four
matches.
	   _ Rapid Vienna hosts French league leaders Bordeaux after a 1-1
draw in France with the French needing a precious away goal to
survive.
	   _ Olympique Marseille, playing its first European competition
after a four-year absence, is 2-2 and playing at home to Sigma
Olomouc of the Czech Republic. Marseille, No. 2 in the French
standings, won the European Champions Cup in 1993 but was ousted
from European play in a match-fixing scandal.
	   _ England's Leeds is up 1-0 going to Portugal's Maritimo. It is
likely to be the last match for coach George Graham, who is
reported moving to London club Tottenham.

United States, European Union criticize jail term for Istanbul's
</HEADLINE>
Islamic mayor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The United States and the European Union
criticized the jail sentence given Istanbul's strongly pro-Islamic
mayor, saying Monday that the move heightened doubts about Turkey's
democracy.
	   Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sentenced to 10 months in prison for
reading a strident religious poem at a rally in December. The
sentence, upheld by an appeals court last week, means a lifetime
ban from public office for a man who was seen as a future leader of
Turkey's Islamic movement.
	   On Monday in Istanbul, Erdogan held talks with U.S.
Consul-General Carolyn R. Huggins, who expressed concern about his
sentencing, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia news
agency.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Ankara decried the jailing.
	   ``It is a serious matter when democratically elected leaders are
subject to criminal prosecution by courts for statements they made
as political figures. Such developments weaken confidence in
Turkish democracy,'' a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Adding to the international criticism, the 15-member European
Union expressed ``concern at the implications for democratic
pluralism and freedom of expression, which prosecution of
democratically elected politicians for nonviolent expression of
their views is bound to have.''
	   The EU rejected Turkey's application for membership in December,
saying then it was politically and economically unprepared and
still had serious human rights problems.
	   Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country governed by staunchly
secular laws, which the Islamic movement describes as undemocratic.
	   The courts convicted Erdogan of inciting racial hatred with a
two-line poem: ``Minarets are our bayonets, domes are our helmets,
mosques are our barracks, believers are our soldiers.''
	   On Thursday, 30,000 people gathered in front of Istanbul's city
hall to protest the appeals court's decision.
	   Monday, prosecutors launched an investigation into the mass
protest to determine whether the demonstration incited divisions in
society _ a crime under Turkish law.

Bosnian Serb arrested by NATO to enter pleas Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb arrested by NATO
forces will Wednesday enter pleas to charges that he murdered,
raped and tortured Muslims and Croats in 1992, the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal announced Monday.
	   Stevan Todorovic was snatched over the weekend by troops serving
in the NATO peace stabilization force in Bosnia. He was transferred
Sunday to U.N. cells in The Hague to await trial.
	   Todorovic, 41, is charged with atrocities allegedly committed
after he was appointed police chief of the northern Bosnian town of
Bosanski Samac following a Serb takeover of the area in early 1992.
	   In the year that followed, Bosanski Samac was the scene of a
ruthless campaign of terror and discrimination by Serb forces that
drove all but a handful of non-Serbs from the municipality.
	   Todorovic, the ninth suspect arrested by NATO forces in Bosnia,
is charged with five war crimes, five grave breaches of the Geneva
Conventions and five crimes against humanity. Each charge carries a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   Todorovic's July 1995 indictment alleges that he murdered one
Muslim, beat or tortured six others and forced two unidentified
prisoners to perform sexual acts on each other while other
prisoners and Serb guards watched _ an allegation that warrants a
rape charge under the tribunal's rules.
	   Set up in 1993 to bring to justice those responsible for
atrocities during conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, the tribunal
has indicted 58 suspects and has 26 in custody.

Serb premier says special police units will be pulled out of Kosovo

 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack, the
Serbian premier Monday declared Kosovo's separatists have been
defeated and promised to withdraw special police units from the
province _ a condition demanded by the U.S. and Europe.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks, and his deputy threatened to take
hostage all pro-Western Serbs who work for independent media, peace
and human right groups in case of NATO strikes.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, issued a statement pledging to continue what it
called ``the holy war'' against Serbia and demanding NATO action.
The statement also criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders
``whose actions are hindering this holy war.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days unless they
have committed ``war crimes.''
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new bandit-terrorist activity appears
again,'' he said. ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the
armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   There was no visible withdrawal of the police units Monday.
Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   ``Conditions have been made ... to decrease engagement of
anti-terrorist forces,'' the premier said.
	   But ethnic Albanian officials were unimpressed, and opposition
leader Hydajet Hyseni said Milosevic was ``only trying to buy time
to finish his offensive.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, sporadic
fighting was reported in Kosovo Monday. The Kosovo Information
Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian leadership, reported
Serbian shelling in the region of the Suva Reka village and
Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw thick columns of smoke blurring the horizon of
Suva Reka where open flames consumed at least four villages
sprawling over nearby hills Monday. Police and the Yugoslav army,
backed by tanks and heavy artillery, had surrounded several
villages in the area and denied entry to journalists and foreign
diplomatic observers.
	   ``There are still many KLA,'' said one Serb police officer in
Suva Reka, which sits at the foot of the hills where Sunday's
police offensive devastated several villages.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also claimed that two ethnic
Albanian families, including 15 members, were ``massacred'' by
withdrawing Serb troops in the central Drenica region on Sunday.
The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The premier made his remarks hours before the Serbian parliament
adopted a resolution declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian
resistance in Kosovo was Serbia's top priority.
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from Kosovo and
begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the province's future.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against Kosovos's separatists
and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes in the
event that Milosevic failed to comply.
	   During the parliamentary session, Serbia's ultra-nationalist
vice premier Vojislav Seselj threatened to take pro-Western Serbs
as hostage in case of NATO strikes.
	   Seselj told Serbia's parliament that if they decide to strike
against Serbia, the U.S. and other Western countries ``should
better withdraw'' all Serb ``traitors'' from Yugoslavia ``before we
grab them'' and take them ``hostage.''
	   Seselj's list of pro-Western ``traitors'' included journalists
of Serbia's independent newspapers and members of independent human
rights, intellectual and peace groups.
	   Seselj's address was greeted with loud applause from the
deputies.

Painting by abstract pioneer Piet Mondrian stolen from museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIDDELBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ A small oil painting by abstract
pioneer Piet Mondrian has been stolen from a Dutch museum, a
spokesman said Monday.
	   The painting titled ``The Tree'' was snatched from the Zeeuws
Museum in this southwestern Dutch city sometime between Thursday
night and Saturday morning, said museum director Ineke Spaander.
	   The museum bought ``The Tree'' in 1994 for 260,000 guilders
(dlrs 130,000), said Spaander.
	   She declined to give details surrounding the theft, but said
police have launched an investigation.
	   The 27-by-38-centimeter (10.8-by-15.2 inch) painting was created
by the Dutch master between 1908 and 1909. It was neither signed
nor dated.
	   The painting shows a black apple tree against a dark blue
background. The oil-on-paper was attached to cloth.
	   Spaander said the painting came ahead of Mondrian's modern
masterpieces which showed his signature brightly colored lines and
squares.
	   One such abstract work, ``Victory Boogie Woogie,'' was recently
purchased by the Dutch state for dlrs 40 million.

Rehabilitated Gremio faces Vasco in Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Gremio is slowly returning to its
old, winning form. And that could be bad news for Vasco, which
visits Gremio on Tuesday for a game for Group E of the Mercosur
Cup.
	   Gremio needs to win to maintain a realistic chance of qualifying
for the next round. The team is in third place in Group E with four
points, two behind co-leaders Vasco and River Plate of Argentina.
	   With its final game against powerful River Plate in Buenos
Aires, Gremio has to make the most of its home advantage in Porto
Alegre, in far southern Brazil.
	   A victory on Tuesday would give Gremio at least second place.
And if River loses to Universidad Catolica in Chile, the
``gauchos'' could take sole possession of first place.
	   Gremio, the 1996 Libertadores Cup champion, is gradually
recovering its winning ways after a shaky start in the Mercosur Cup
and the Brazilian national championship.
	   After two quick losses to River and Vasco, Gremio pounded U.
Catolica 5-1 at home and tied the Chileans in Santiago.
	   In the Brazilian championship, Gremio has won its last two games
and is in ninth place among the 32 first-division teams.
	   Vasco, the defending Brazilian and Libertadores Cup champion,
has coasted through the Mercosur Cup using its reserve team.
	   The second-string squad, nicknamed ``the little express,'' added
three ties, including two with River Plate, to the victory over
Gremio.
	   And it's the reserve team that will face Gremio on Tuesday, as
Vasco coach Antonio Lopes saves his starters for the national
championship and for the world inter-club championship against
Spain's Real Madrid in December.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. (0040 GMT Wednesday) in Olimpico
Stadium.

St. Petersburg official killed in explosion

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A high-ranking official
responsible for providing municipal services in St. Petersburg was
killed early Monday in a bombing that was believed to be a contract
hit.
	   Yevgeny Agaryov, 53, the deputy chairman of the northern city's
committee on markets, was killed by a blast that detonated as he
descended the stairs from his sixth-floor apartment, authorities
said. Police believe the bomb was radio-controlled.
	   Neighbors were awakened by the blast. ``It was very loud. I was
getting my girls ready for school. We've been scared by this
happening, of course,'' said Lyuba Seluanova, 40, a metal worker.
	   Police would not confirm that they are treating the incident as
a contract killing, but Irina Alabyeva, a spokesman for the local
Emergency Situations Ministry, said it probably was.
	   One of Agaryov's main areas of responsibility was funerals. The
burial business in St. Petersburg has the reputation of being
mafia-ridden and involving large sums of money.
	   Dozens of St. Petersburg businessmen and government officials
have been killed in recent years, many of them in apparent disputes
over state property. The most notorious case was that of Mikhail
Manevich, the city's privatization chief, who was gunned down on
the city's main street in August 1997
	   The killings are blamed on organized crime and are rarely
solved.

Opposition accuses Romania's president of meddling in judicial
</HEADLINE>
affairs

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's opposition Monday accused
President Emil Constantinescu of unlawfully interfering in the
country's judicial system in his battle against corruption.
	   ``For some time, in the context of the struggle against
organized crime, he (the president) subordinated the state's
institutions,'' former Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila read in
a statement in front of parliament.
	   When Constantinescu came to power in November 1996, he made the
eradication of corruption one of his main priorities. He set up
special committees in each county to deal with corruption cases.
	   But there has been an uproar over these bodies, which answer to
a national board comprised of the president, intelligence and
government officials.
	   Most opposition politicians argue that the Justice and Interior
ministries are the only organizations authorized to deal with
financial crimes.
	   They claim Constantinescu has interfered with the authority of
the Justice and Interior ministries by staffing his anti-corruption
board with employees from these ministries.
	   Despite several anti-corruption campaigns, Constantinescu
acknowledged Friday that the economy has lost 3,500 billion lei
(almost dlrs 389 million) in the past 18 months because of
financial irregularities.
	   Taracila, a prominent member of the leftist Social Democracy
Party serving in parliament's upper chamber, said his party was
studying Constantinescu's possible impeachment for
``unconstitutional acts.''

FA lodges misconduct charge against player for shoving ref
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from sports minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian striker Paolo Di Canio of Sheffield
Wednesday was charged with misconduct Monday by the Football
Association for shoving a referee to the ground _ an act which
could result in a lengthy ban from the English game.
	   The FA gave Di Canio 14 days to respond to the charge and
request a personal hearing over what was described as a ``reported
assault'' on referee Paul Alcock.
	   Di Canio pushed Alcock after being sent off during Saturday's
1-0 win against Arsenal at Hillsborough. He later accused the ref
of play-acting, comparing him to a player diving to win a penalty.
	   Danny Wilson, Sheffield Wednesday's manager, announced an
immediate suspension of Di Canio pending sanctions from the FA.
	   The FA's misconduct charge could result in a six-month ban or
even in an expulsion from the Premier League.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks condemned Di Canio and urged
the FA to ``chuck the book at him.''
	   ``This was an incident too far,'' Banks said. ``All of us
involved in football, whether as supporters or players, have
shouted at the referee as passions run high. But you cannot assault
the referee. There has to be a limit _ the referee stands between
us and chaos, and this was totally unacceptable.
	   ``This is a matter for the FA, and I think they should chuck the
book at him. This is so serious that an example has to be made of
the player.
	   ``To say that the referee `took a dive' is just compounding what
he has done.''

Union leaders sour over tight economic policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with Trade Secretary quote;

 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Trade union leaders on Monday accused
the Labor Party _ which they help bankroll _ of following
unnecessarily stringent economic policies.
	   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, addressing Labor's
annual conference in this northern town, insisted ``there is no
other way.''
	   ``Don't just give us a vision of the promised land, give us a
place in it,'' declared Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Britain's
biggest union, UNISON.
	   Bickerstaffe, whose union represents hundreds of thousands of
low-paid government workers, such as hospital cleaners, was greeted
with thunderous applause by delegates.
	   It underlined a change in atmosphere at this year's convention
compared with a year ago when the conference was largely an
ebullient celebration of Labor's landslide election victory in May
1997, which ended 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   Labor remains well ahead _ some 25 points _ of the
still-battered Conservatives in opinion polls.
	   But the strict economic polices, aimed at holding inflation to
2.5 percent, are angering both trade unions and manufacturers
because the resulting high value of the British pound makes it hard
to sell exports and encourages relatively cheap imports.
	   Brown said any short-term pains will be worth the long-term
gains of stable growth with few inflationary pressures.
	   ``It is because of our commitment to long-term stability, even
more essential at a time of world instability, that from this
government there will be no U-turns. No left turns. No right
turns,'' said Brown.
	   ``I tell this conference there is no other way, no solution, or
even comfort, in soft options, no magic wand solution, no quick-fix
alternative to these long-term policies for achieving the goals we
share.''
	   Although applause during Brown's speech was subdued, most of the
delegates gave him a standing ovation at the end.
	   Ken Jackson, head of the engineering workers' union, a moderate
union that has been a prime supporter of Blair's centrist ``New
Labor'' policies, said he would continue to campaign for the
government to take back control of interest rates.
	   ``We have to reflect the views of our members who see the future
in manufacturing as under threat,'' said Jackson. ``Both sides of
industry are now saying that we are facing problems.''
	   As a key to keeping Britain on track for his inflation target,
Brown last year took the power to set interest rates away from
politicians and gave it to the Bank of England, which has tightened
monetary policy.
	   Blair, who has a huge parliamentary majority and thus enormous
power, argues that the tight policies will end what Labor calls the
``boom and bust'' cycle of the British economy.

Good weekend for man with grafted right hand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A man who received a new forearm and hand in
a rare operation last week is eating and drinking normally, four
days after the 13-hour surgery, the hospital administration said
Monday.
	   The grafted right hand, it added, is ``well colored'' --
apparently a good sign.
	   The five-line statement identified the patient for the first
time by name: Clint Hallam. Hospital personnel said Hallam hails
from New Zealand but lives in Perth, Australia.
	   ``Clint Hallam ... had a very good weekend ..., the statement
said.
	   It added that the dressing was changed and ``he will be able to
get up today.''
	   Neither the press service for the Lyon public hospital system
nor doctors at Edouard Herriot Hospital could confirm whether
Hallam did, indeed, leave his bed.
	   At the hospital, his condition was described simply as
``satisfactory.''
	   Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, co-head of the transplant team, was
not immediately available for comment.
	   Hallam, 48, had his right hand amputated in 1989 after an
accident.
	   In Thursday's painstaking operation to give Hallam the forearm
and hand of an anonymous donor, arteries, veins, nerves, tendons,
muscles and skin were attached after the two bones of the forearm
were set.
	   The surgery represented a breakthrough that was hailed by the
University of Louisville Medical Center, where such a transplant is
planned before the end of the year.
	   ``It gives hope to all those who are victims of domestic or work
accidents, anti-personnel mines, or have congenital deformations,''
Dubernard told French television after Thursday's surgery.
	   Among the risks ahead for Hallam are how well he will accept
anti-rejection drugs that can be potentially fatal. The drugs
suppress the immune system to keep the body from trying to destroy
the foreign tissue. That could also raise the risk of infection,
cancer and even death.
	   Other problems include nerve regeneration to allow sensation. A
transplant patient may never regain feeling of hot and cold in
their new hand.
	   Doctors in Ecuador tried in the 1960s, but the patient's body
rejected the hand after two weeks.

Senior clerics say edict against Rushdie must be upheld
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Islamic edict that calls for British
author Salman Rushdie's death is irrevocable and must be
implemented, two senior Iranian clerics were quoted as saying
Monday.
	   ``I heard that England is under the illusion that the fatwa
(edict) against the apostate Rushdie will be revoked. This fatwa is
irrevocable and cannot be changed at any time. It is obligatory to
carry out the fatwa,'' Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani,
said in a statement published in the hard-line Resalat daily.
	   He said the Iranian government should be among the first in the
world to support the edict even if it does not intend to carry it
out.
	   Nouri Hamedani, another Grand Ayatollah, said the fatwa must be
enforced and no high-ranking Muslim scholar can reverse it.
	   The words of the two clerics, who have a big following among
Iranians, carry substantial weight in Iran.
	   The debate over the edict has intensified after Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi on Thursday distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5
million reward for Rushdie's death. He did not, however, say that
the government was rescinding the edict.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   ``The issue of Rushdie will only end with killing him and all
the elements associated with the publishing of the book. The fatwa
of killing Rushdie will be implemented,'' the Resalat daily said in
an editorial.
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain also has sought
better ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran,
which have gone to France and other European countries.

San Marino seeks to promote human rights in short speech
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The republic of San Marino highlighted its
efforts to strengthen human rights in a speech to the General
Assembly, which is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the U.N.
Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
	   Gabriele Gatti, the foreign minister of San Marino, noted that
his tiny country paid for a project to translate the declaration
into 250 languages.
	   ``The principles contained in the declaration represent today,
more than ever before, the essence of a civilized way of living
together in a modern society,'' Gatti said.
	   He called for the abolition _ or at least limitation of _ the
death penalty, which he said was abolished in San Marino in 1865.
	   ``The government and the people of San Marino deeply believe
that death imposed by law cannot represent a valid protection for
society nor a deterrent for crime,'' he said.
	   San Marino, a mountainous, 23-square-mile (60-square-kilometer)
landlocked republic, is situated in northeast Italy, 150 miles (240
kilometers) south of Venice. It depends on tourism, postage stamps
and financial services for income.
	   Founded in the year 301, San Marino calls itself the world's
oldest republic, with an unbroken line of elected government
officials since at least the year 1244.

Iran gears up for another war games on Afghan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran stepped up its war rhetoric by sending
more troops along its eastern border with Afghanistan, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   Some 200,000 troops are to take part in war games, codenamed
Zulfaqar 2, which are to begin within the next few days, the agency
said.
	   It said Iran will use Katyusha rockets for the first in the
maneuvers which are to take place in a 50,000-square kilometer
(20,000 square-mile) area.
	   The Taliban religious army, which rules about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, says it has moved 20,000 troops to the border in
response to Iran's war games.
	   The maneuvers come amid rising tensions between Iran and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia over last month's slaying of nine
Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban fighters.
	   The Taliban blame renegade fighters for the slayings but have
refused Iranian demands to hand over the killers. They accuse Iran
of backing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition alliance.
	   During the maneuvers, Iranian ground troops, air force and navy
will hold joint operations and will conduct ``electronic warfare
and operations to foil chemical, biological and nuclear attacks,''
said Brig. Gen. Hassan Barati, spokesman for the war games.
	   ``The war games are designed to exercise large-extent rapid
deployment, familiarize the army commanders with the geographical
specifications of eastern Iran and test the arms newly built or
purchased by the army,'' IRNA quoted Barati as saying.
	   He said the war games will include attacks on mock enemy
positions and long-range weapons will be used against imaginary
targets.
	   Iran conducted similar maneuvers early this month.

Parma, Betis threatened with quick exit from UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Fenerbahce &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italy's Parma and Spain's Betis, two of Europe's
big spenders, are in danger of being eliminated from the lucrative
UEFA Cup. And it's only the first round.
	   And Germany's Stuttgart, thrashed two weeks ago at home 3-1 by
Dutch leaders Feyenoord, is as good as gone entering the second leg
_ one of 31 matches Tuesday across Europe.
	   Parma spent about dlrs 60 million this summer on transfers.
Seville-based Betis spent half that much on one player _ dlrs 35
million for Brazilian Denilson.
	   So far, the investments haven't paid off as both clubs return
home trailing 1-0.
	   Parma, 1995 UEFA champions and '93 Cup Winners Cup titlists, is
in big trouble. The Italians are injury-hit, struggling on offense
and, in Turkey's Fenerbahce, face a club that's due to advance.
	   Parma's top striker Enrico Chiesa is out with an ankle injury,
and Croatian winger Mario Stanic is also hurt. Midfielder Dino
Baggio and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended on red cards.
	   History this time is either with _ or against _ Fenerbahce. No
Turkish team in 16 tries has eliminated an Italian side from
European competition. Parma's last lost at home in cup play was
five years ago. Since then Parma is 15-1-0 at Tardini Stadium.
	   ``We want to write history by eliminating Parma,'' said
Fenerbahce spokesman Ali Yildirim. ``We have the power to do
that.''
	   Fenerbahce players are getting a substantial bonus _ reported
earlier at dlrs 18,000 _ for eliminating the Italians.
	   Betis, facing Danish side Vejle, is having what coach Manual
Ruiz de Lopera calls a ``cursed September,'' which includes four
league games without a victory, good for 19th in the 20-team
Spanish league.
	   ``The league (season) is long and there is still time to
recover,'' the coach said. ``But fouling up the UEFA Cup would have
no remedy and serious consequences for Betis.''
	   As for Denilson, he's yet to score in league play and newspapers
are ripping him for his non-team style. To make matters worse,
Betis' other striker _ Spanish international striker Alfonso Perez
_ may miss the game with an injury.
	   If you needed an early favorite, it would be Feyenoord.
	   The Rotterdam side has won all six of its league games and
defends a 3-1 lead against Stuttgart. Brazilian attacker Tininho is
injured, but Argentine striker Julio Cruz and Jon Dahl Tomasson
should provide the scoring.
	   Despite crowd disturbances in the first leg in Germany,
Rotterdam police are not expecting problems. ``We do not think this
is a high-risk match,'' police spokeswoman Laurie 't Hart said.
	   Fellow German side Bayern Leverkusen _ quarterfinalist last year
in the European Champions Cup _ is also in jeopardy of exiting
after a first-leg 1-1 draw at Udinese. The club is coming off a 1-0
league win over Schalke.
	   ``We had a good start at Schalke, so we hope to win against
Udinese,'' said coach Christoph Daum, who will be missing injured
Brazilian midfielder Emerson.
	   Udinese is tied for second in Italy's Serie A and has five goals
from Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso _ the same number he scored
last season.
	   Udinese has never won away in the UEFA Cup.
	   In other key games on a crowded day:
	   _ English Premier League leader Aston Villa takes a 3-2 lead to
Norway's Stromsgodset, with disappointing 7-million-pound (dlrs
11.5 million) transfer Stan Collymore expected to get a last-ditch
start in his bid to stay with the team.
	   _ Atletico Madrid, semifinalists last year in the European
Champions Cup, takes a 2-0 lead to Obilic, Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav
team is owned by Serbia's notorious warlord Zeljko
Raznatovic-Arkan. Players have been banned from talking to
reporters and their cellular phones have been confiscated.
	   _ Italian league leader Fiorentina is up 2-1 in a tough match at
Croatia's Hadjuk Split. Fiorentina, alone in first place for the
first time in 16 years, is rolling with six wins in six league and
cup games. Gabriel Batistuta will have to play without suspended
strike partners Rue Costa and Luis Oliveira. Hajduk has played
three home games with Italian clubs and has won all three by 3-1
scores.
	   _ Red Star Belgrade goes to France's Metz with a 2-1 lead but
will be without top striker Perica Ognjenovic, who is suspended.
	   _ Germany's Schalke, 1997 UEFA champion, takes a 1-0 lead to
Slavia Prague. Slavia has scored only once in its last four
matches.
	   _ Rapid Vienna hosts French league leaders Bordeaux after a 1-1
draw in France with the French needing a precious away goal to
survive.
	   _ Olympique Marseille, playing its first European competition
after a four-year absence, is 2-2 and playing at home to Sigma
Olomouc of the Czech Republic. Marseille, No. 2 in the French
standings, won the European Champions Cup in 1993 but was ousted
from European play in a match-fixing scandal.
	   _ England's Leeds is up 1-0 going to Portugal's Maritimo. It is
likely to be the last match for coach George Graham, who is
reported moving to London club Tottenham.

Commuter plane crashes in Cape Verde islands; 1 killed, 19 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A commuter plane with 20 people on board
crash-landed Monday in the Cape Verde islands off West Africa,
killing one passenger and injuring the others, including the
country's Prime Minister Carlos Veiga, according to news reports.
	   Veiga was under observation at Agostinho Neto Hospital in Praia,
the capital of the island group 480 kilometers (300 miles) off the
coast of Senegal, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. He
suffered bruises but his life was not in danger.
	   One of Veiga's bodyguards was killed in the crash and two other
members of his staff had ``worrying'' injuries, Lusa quoted a
government source as saying.
	   Others on board the plane suffered slight injuries, the report
said, but gave no details.
	   The names of the injured were not immediately available.
	   The Twin Otter two-engine plane, belonging to the state-owned
Cape Verde Air Transport company, crashed as it landed at Praia
airport during a storm.
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, according to
Lusa. The airline declined to comment.
	   The plane was on a regularly scheduled flight between two of the
former Portuguese colony's 10 islands, Lusa said.
	   Veiga has been prime minister of Cape Verde since its first
democratic elections, held in 1991. He was reelected in 1996.
	   Cape Verde gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

Justice minister: Russian prisons spend less than half-cent per
</HEADLINE>
inmate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia spends just 70 kopeks a day _ the
equivalent of less than half a U.S. cent _ for each prisoner in its
vast prison system, the justice minister said Monday.
	   Pavel Krasheninnikov said the amount was enough to buy 300 grams
(10 ounces) of bread for each prisoner, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Russia has the world's highest incarceration rate, and a long
history of brutal prisons and labor camps that date to czarist
times but were expanded under the Soviet regime.
	   The prison system holds over 1 million prisoners in 13 prisons
and hundreds of other facilities, according to government
statistics released last year.
	   In July, President Boris Yeltsin transferred authority over
prisons from the Interior Ministry to the Justice Ministry, saying
the prison system badly needed reform.
	   Krasheninnikov said the situation might be improved by
increasing the number of prisoners released in one of the
government's periodic amnesties.

Turkey protests Kurdish meeting in Rome's parliament building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey protested a planned meeting of the
Kurdish parliament-in-exile in Rome, saying Monday it was
especially galling that the meeting would be in Italy's own
parliament building.
	   A group of Italian lawmakers invited the self-proclaimed Kurdish
parliament, whose earlier meetings in Russia, the Netherlands,
Norway, Austria and Denmark also triggered protests from Turkey.
	   Its Rome meeting is set for Tuesday. Turkey objected in a note
to Italy's Foreign Ministry.
	   ``We informed them of our displeasure and expressed our
expectations that the meeting should not be held in Rome,
especially not in the parliament's building,'' said Haldun Otman, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
	   The Italian Embassy in Ankara said it was a personal invitation
from the Italian lawmakers.
	   The Kurdish group includes some former Kurdish members of
Turkey's parliament, who fled the country when their party was shut
down in 1994 for ties with Kurdish rebels.
	   The rebels are fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurds;
the 14-year-old war has killed more than 37,000 people.
	   The first meeting of the parliament-in-exile caused a diplomatic
clash between the Netherlands and Turkey, which recalled its
ambassador for two months and suspended arms purchases from the
Dutch.

Turkmenistan to electrify rails with EU backing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Union is sponsoring a dlrs 300
million project to electrify Turkmenistan's railways, a news agency
reported Monday.
	   The four-year program is intended to electrify 335 kilometers
(208 miles) of railways in the former Soviet republic in Central
Asia, saving it a little more than dlrs 3 million a year, Interfax
said.
	   According to the report, the project is run by the European
Union's program for technical assistance to members of the

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Monday
with Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the
7-week-old stalemate with Baghdad over arms inspections and the
U.N. chief's proposal to break the logjam.
	   The Iraqi delegation made no comment to reporters as they headed
into Annan's office at U.N. headquarters.
	   The two sides were expected to discuss Annan's ideas for a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
demanding it destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council asked Annan to formulate such a proposal
earlier this month, hoping that Iraq would back down from the
standoff knowing that a comprehensive review could highlight Iraq's
seven years of work to destroy its banned weapons.
	   The council stressed that no such review would take place until
Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors.
	   Aziz, however, was instructed to insist that the United Nations
take the first step in ending the stalemate, Iraq's vice president,
Taha Yassin Ramadan, said in a statement carried Friday by the
official al-Iraq newspaper.
	   Aziz was expected to meet with various members of the council
during his stay in New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq stopped cooperating with inspectors after the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that it had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Monday's meeting comes as chemical weapons experts have been
meeting at U.N. headquarters to discuss the findings of Swiss and
French laboratories testing missile fragments for suspected traces
of the deadly VX gas.
	   Preliminary results from the European labs have been
inconclusive, diplomats have said.
	   A U.S. Army lab reported finding traces of the gas in June but
Baghdad disputed the findings.
	   Butler agreed to send other samples to European labs, though he
has said Saddam Hussein still must answer for the positive U.S.
tests.
	   In a related matter, Annan appointed a German official with the
U.N. Development Program, Hans von Sponeck, as the new humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq. He will take over the distribution network of
the U.N. oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods,
Eckhard said.

Greece, Turkey both to take part in NATO exercises for fist time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ For the first time in 13 years, Greece and
Turkey will jointly take part in a NATO exercise in the Aegean Sea.
	   An announcement issued by the general defense staff said Greece
will take part in the annual ``Dynamic Mix,'' a large 21-day air,
land and sea exercise held in the region.
	   More than 17,000 troops and forces from Britain, Canada, France,
Greece, Germany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the
United States will take part in the exercise. It will include 62
ships and 170 aircraft.
	   In April, Greece did not participate in NATO's ``Distant
Thunder'' maneuvers because of its longstanding disputes with
Turkey over the Aegean Sea.
	   Last year, Athens took part in ``Dynamic Mix,'' but Ankara
boycotted the maneuvers because NATO forces based in Turkey were
not included in the exercise's Aegean Sea part.
	   Greece's participation in ``Dynamic Mix'' last year was its
first in 13 years.
	   NATO allies Greece and Turkey have nearly gone to war twice in
the past 11 years over disputes on air, sea and seabed mineral
rights in the Aegean.

EU welcomes Iranian government decision in Rushdie case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union on Monday welcomed a
move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic
edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two
senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
	   In a statement issued here, the EU said the Iranian decision
opens the way for closer cooperation between Europe and the Tehran
government.
	   The statement was issued here because Austria holds the rotating
EU presidency.
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain also has sought
better ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran,
which have gone to France and other European countries.
	   On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced
his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
He did not, however, say that the government was rescinding the
edict.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989,
claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   In Tehran, however, two influential clerics -- Grand Ayatollah
Mohammad Fazel Lankarani and Grand Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani -- were
quoted as saying the edict, or fatwa, must be enforced and no one
can reverse it.

Two reformers fired from cabinet, new economic package to appear in
</HEADLINE>
10 days &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to market-oriented economic reforms, the
country's tough-talking tax chief was fired Monday, the last step
in a purge that leaves only one of the previous cabinet's young
reformers remaining in the government.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who strongly supported economic reform and
opposed printing money, had promised to get tough on tax deadbeats
in an effort to fill the country's empty coffers. Also dumped was
acting deputy prime minister Viktor Khristenko, who advocated
tightening control over government spending and cutting down waste.
	   The firings were announced during a meeting between Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and President Boris Yeltsin aimed at
completing a new cabinet, a process that has already taken three
weeks, and is still not finished.
	   Fyodorov's dismissal leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin
reappointed to the post of finance minister on Friday, as the most
outspoken proponent of reform. But he is linked with the previous
Cabinet's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze
domestic debt _ a controversial move that many blame for fueling
Russia's crisis.
	   Primakov also announced at the meeting that the government had
paid off back wages to the military, and was planning to pay off
debts for student stipends, though he didn't say where the money
had come from. It is unclear exactly how much of the wages were
paid off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   In an effort to quell impatience at the absence of a detailed
crisis plan, the government will unveil the complete program in 10
days, First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Government officials repeated Monday that the plan would include
greater state control, and would be ``aimed at protection of the
domestic producer, reforming of the tax system so that producers
feel an easing of the tax burden,'' Economics Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Central Bank also has approved regulations to control
securities markets and limit the flow of cash abroad, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Dmitry Vasilyev, the head of the Federal Commission on
Securities and Capital Markets, who resigned last week in protest
of the government's unfair treatment of foreign investors, warned
that the tighter controls, as well as rumored plans to nationalize
some banks and industrial enterprises, are ``recipes from the old
Soviet past.''
	   But Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko countered these
claims, calling a return to a more nationalized banking system the
``the wrong way to go,'' Interfax said.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multi-billion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Russia's Oneximbank has filed suit against Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc., accusing the group of not fulfilling its obligations
to the bank. Oneximbank did not specify what the obligations were.
Last week, Lehman Brothers froze Oneximbank's assets in the United
Kingdom in punishment for defaulting on some debts.
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis. And the stock market closed lower in very light trading
Monday, down 1.8 percent to 46.24 points.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

Iraqi book on Gulf War says Saddam signaled invasion plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The U.S. envoy to Iraq during the 1990 Gulf
crisis should have grasped Saddam Hussein's plans to attack Kuwait
from a meeting she had with him a week beforehand, says a book
published by the Iraqi government.
	   After the invasion, then-U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie was
blamed by some for not making clear to Saddam that the United
States would oppose Iraq's military steps against Kuwait.
	   ``The Grand Duel and its Leader,'' the Iraqi government's first
official account of the 1991 Gulf War, states that Saddam did not
explicitly say he was going to invade Kuwait.
	   But it said he clearly indicated that he wanted to punish
Kuwait, which he accused of deliberately trying to bring oil prices
down and harm Iraq's economy by flooding the market.
	   ``It was not difficult for Glaspie to realize the decisive tone
of Saddam Hussein, whom she knew as a man who sees his country
equal to any other nation,'' said the book, a copy of which was
obtained by The Associated Press ahead of its official release.
	   The Iraqi book renews an old argument since President George
Bush presents a different picture of Glaspie in excerpts from his
new book on the Gulf war, ``A World Transformed,'' which began
appearing Monday in Arab newspapers.
	   In Bush's book, co-authored with former National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, the president defends Glaspie as ``a
trusted veteran diplomat'' and blames Saddam for underestimating
American interests in the Gulf.
	   Iraqi media published the minutes of Saddam's meeting with
Glaspie a few days after the Aug. 2, 1990, invasion to try to
portray Washington as having endorsed the incursion. Glaspie was
quoted as saying the United States had no position on Iraqi
territorial claims to Kuwait.
	   ``We do not want war because we know what it means, but do not
push us to consider it as the only way for us to live in dignity,''
Saddam is quoted as telling Glaspie.
	   ``I hope this message will reach the president (Bush) and won't
be left in the hands of the State Department,'' Saddam told
Glaspie.
	   ``I clearly understand this message,'' Glaspie is quoted as
answering Saddam.
	   In his book, Bush worries that the war did not have a clean end
and that Iraq already was claiming victory.
	   The Iraqi book maintains that Iraq essentially won, noting that
leaders of the U.S.-led Gulf War coalition asked for a cease-fire.
It says Saddam first heard about it on a radio news broadcast.
	   ``The American President George Bush must have realized that his
calculations were wrong, he was trapped and the only way out was to
ask for a cease-fire,'' the book said.
	   ``The Grand Duel and its Leader'' was written by Saddam's press
secretary during the war, Abdel-Jabbar Muhsen, and Hamid Saeed, a
former editor of the ruling Baath Party newspaper Al-Thawra.

	   Aziz said his meeting with Annan was professional, cordial and
constructive, and he thanked the U.N. chief for trying to put
together a comprehensive review.
	   Another meeting with Annan was planned before the week was out,
Aziz said, adding that he would be meeting with Security Council
members as well.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq stopped cooperating with inspectors after the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that it had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Monday's meeting comes as chemical weapons experts have been
meeting at U.N. headquarters to discuss the findings of Swiss and
French laboratories testing missile fragments for suspected traces
of the deadly VX gas.
	   Preliminary results from the European labs have been
inconclusive, diplomats have said.
	   A U.S. Army lab reported finding traces of the gas in June but
Baghdad disputed the findings.
	   Butler agreed to send other samples to European labs, though he
has said Saddam Hussein still must answer for the positive U.S.
tests.
	   In a related matter, Annan appointed a German official with the
U.N. Development Program, Hans von Sponeck, as the new humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq. He will take over the distribution network of
the U.N. oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.

	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Davis Cup players will split 1.2 billion

U.N. agency's Beirut office at heart of corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Already beset by financial burdens, the
U.N. agency that cares for 3.5 million Palestinian refugees faces a
new problem _ corruption allegations.
	   Wolfgang Plasa, Beirut director of the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency, was dismissed earlier this month as allegations of
wrongdoing at the agency's Lebanon offices became public.
	   Sources close to Plasa told the leading Beirut daily An-Nahar
Saturday that the former director was on the offensive to clear his
name.
	   An Amman-based UNRWA liaison officer said Plasa was trying to
uncover ``issues relating to building some schools.''
	   ``So far, such allegations were not proved,'' the liaison
officer, Maher Nasser, told The Associated Press in Amman. He did
not elaborate.
	   An-Nahar quoted sources as saying Plasa may have been dismissed
when he began to investigate wrongdoings or that he blew the
whistle after UNRWA did not renew his contract, which expires Oct.
14.
	   One source said that Plasa ``found problems'' in UNRWA's work in
Lebanon and started a probe, ``discovering what could form a good
basis for a large investigation.'' The source did not elaborate.
	   ``There is a problem and money spent, but we don't know exactly
whether it was stolen or not,'' the source told An-Nahar.
	   Nasser said the corruption allegations were ``briefly
discussed'' in Amman on Monday by UNRWA's 10-member Advisory
Commission, which reviewed the agency's overall performance.
	   He said UNRWA's Commissioner-General Peter Hansen had dispatched
officials to Lebanon to ``investigate the allegations.''
	   ``If it is proven that there was embezzlement or corruption in
UNRWA, whether in Lebanon or elsewhere, we will pursue the policy
of hitting with an iron hand those who touch money allocated for
the 3.5 million refugees we serve,'' Nasser said.
	   UNRWA, which is headquartered in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, has
been facing financial difficulties because of limited funding from
donor countries.
	   For the past 18 months, UNRWA's management has repeatedly warned
that its growing budget shortfall was forcing it to implement
austerity cuts. Hansen said in March that donor nations had given
the agency dlrs 237 million to meet a budget of dlrs 314 million
this year.
	   Earlier this month, thousands of UNRWA employees staged a
one-day strike, closing schools and clinics across the Middle East.
The workers were demanding pay raises and other benefits that had
been delayed for years by the agency's tight finances.
	   The agency, which has a staff of 22,000, provides education,
health and relief services to refugees. It was set up in 1948 after
the creation of the state of Israel.
	   Some 3.5 million refugees in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are now registered with UNRWA, and that
population is growing at around 4 percent annually.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to market-oriented economic reforms, the
country's tough-talking tax chief was fired Monday, the last step
in a purge that leaves only one of the previous cabinet's young
reformers remaining in the government.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who strongly supported economic reform and
opposed printing money, had promised to get tough on tax deadbeats
in an effort to fill the country's empty coffers. Also dumped was
acting deputy prime minister Viktor Khristenko, who advocated
tightening control over government spending and cutting down waste.
	   The firings were announced during a meeting between Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and President Boris Yeltsin aimed at
completing a new cabinet, a process that has already taken three
weeks, and is still not finished.
	   Fyodorov's dismissal leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin
reappointed to the post of finance minister on Friday, as the most
outspoken proponent of reform. But he is linked with the previous
Cabinet's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze
domestic debt _ a controversial move that many blame for fueling
Russia's crisis.
	   Primakov also announced at the meeting that the government had
paid off back wages to the military, and was planning to pay off
debts for student stipends, though he didn't say where the money
had come from. It is unclear exactly how much of the wages were
paid off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   In an effort to quell impatience at the absence of a detailed
crisis plan, the government will unveil the complete program in 10
days, First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Government officials repeated Monday that the plan would include
greater state control, and would be ``aimed at protection of the
domestic producer, reforming of the tax system so that producers
feel an easing of the tax burden,'' Economics Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Central Bank also has approved regulations to control
securities markets and limit the flow of cash abroad, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Dmitry Vasilyev, the head of the Federal Commission on
Securities and Capital Markets, who resigned last week in protest
of the government's unfair treatment of foreign investors, warned
that the tighter controls, as well as rumored plans to nationalize
some banks and industrial enterprises, are ``recipes from the old
Soviet past.''
	   But Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko countered these
claims, calling a return to a more nationalized banking system the
``the wrong way to go,'' Interfax said.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multi-billion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Russia's Oneximbank has filed suit against Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc., accusing the group of not fulfilling its obligations
to the bank. Oneximbank did not specify what the obligations were.
Last week, Lehman Brothers froze Oneximbank's assets in the United
Kingdom in punishment for defaulting on some debts.
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis. And the stock market closed lower in very light trading
Monday, down 1.8 percent to 46.24 points.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

Commuter plane crashes in Cape Verde islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A commuter plane crashed Monday in the
Cape Verde islands off West Africa, killing one passenger and
injuring the other 19 people on board, including the country's
prime minister, according to news reports.
	   Prime Minister Carlos Veiga was under observation at Agostinho
Neto Hospital in Praia, the capital of the island group 480
kilometers (300 miles) off the coast of Senegal, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported. He suffered bruises, but his injuries
were not life threatening.
	   One of Veiga's bodyguards died in the crash, Lusa quoted a
government source as saying. Others on board the plane suffered
slight injuries, the report said, but no details were available.
	   The names of those injured were not immediately available.
	   The Twin Otter two-engine plane, belonging to the state-owned
Cape Verde Air Transport company, crashed as it landed at Praia
airport during a storm.
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, according to
Lusa. The airline declined to comment.
	   The plane was on a regularly scheduled flight between two of the
former Portuguese colony's 10 islands, Lusa said.
	   Veiga has been prime minister of Cape Verde since its first
democratic elections, held in 1991. He was re-elected in 1996.
	   Cape Verde gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

 &UR; Four Macedonian Albanians arrested, two sentenced in Serbia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Two ethnic Albanians were sentenced in
Serbia Monday, and police in neighboring Macedonia said four more
suspected bombers were arrested.
	   The Belgrade-based state news agency Tanjug said two Kosovo
Albanians were sentenced to eight years in jail each for
``terrorist activities'' in Serbia's embattled Kosovo province.
	   Over 1,000 Kosovo Albanians, of whom over 500 have been
arrested, are suspected of an armed uprising in order to secede the
Kosovo province from Serbia.
	   In Macedonia, which has its own restive ethnic Albanian
minority, four people were arrested over the past weekend on
suspicion of belonging to a group which planted bombs that went off
in six different Macedonian towns in the last 10 months.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 per cent of the 2-million Macedonian
population.
	   Four other alleged group members were arrested earlier this
month, and one was killed in a police raid.
	   Responsibility for two of the explosions was claimed by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, a militant organization fighting for
Kosovo's independence.
	   Police said Monday they discovered ``large quantities of
automatic and other firearms smuggled from Albania, as well as
ammunition and explosive devices ... intended for terrorist
actions.''
	   Three suspects escaped the raids, while terrorism charges will
be brought against the eight arrested, the report said.
	   The bombings attributed to the suspects injured none but caused
major damage: targets were courts, police stations, army barracks
and railroad stations.

Slovak opposition works on forming new government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Merciar holding coalition talks; ADDS byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties held private
consultations Monday at forming a new government after sealing an
apparent victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their
intent to unite.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, began sounding out
several opposition groups Monday to see if they were interested in
joining a new government.
	   Only one -- the far-rightwing Slovak National Party -- showed
any interest. Party Chairman Jan Slota, who was in the previous
government, said he was interested in any coalition which did not
include the minority Hungarians.
	   Two other groups sounded out by Meciar's movement -- the Party
of Civic Understanding and the Party of the Democratic Left --
ruled out any coalition with him.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, acknowledged Sunday
after the release of unofficial results touched off immediate
dickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Official results are expected Tuesday morning, the Central
Election Commission said.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is released
Monday night or Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as
minority leader in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties, headed by the
Slovak Democratic Coalition, have reiterated their intent to form a
governing coalition after results indicated they won 93 of the 150
seats in Parliament.
	   Finishing ahead of all 16 other parties will give Meciar the
first crack at forming a governing coalition, but his chances
appear bleak.
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.
	   Referring to Meciar, the Budapest daily Nepszabadsag said ``the
man who failed in the ... elections has left an ugly legacy for
Slovakia.''
	   ``If `Vlado' remains in power, the semi-democracy and the
unbridled crony-privatization will continue, Slovakia will never
get into NATO and the EU, and will become a pariah just like
Yugoslavia,'' the newspaper said.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) - Tempers flared in this divided West
Bank city on Monday when an Israeli woman was shot, apparently by
Palestinian assailants, and Jewish settlers beat Arab neighbors in
retaliation.
	   The violence came as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu headed into a meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington to try to end months
of impasse in Israeli-Palestinian peace making.
	   Monday morning a 52-year-old Israeli woman, in Hebron with her
family to celebrate her son's bar mitzvah, was shot once in the leg
while touring the city's Jewish settlement.
	   The bullet that hit her was one of four fired by assailants from
a Palestinian-controlled area of the city that surrounds the
settlement's trailer homes. The army sealed the area and searched
for suspects but made no arrests.
	   Shortly afterwards, angry settlers from the 450-strong Jewish
community took to the city's dusty streets and beat Palestinian
passersby, injuring one.
	   And in the city's Arab-run vegetable market, some 15 settlers
including one founder of the Hebron settlement, Miriam Levinger,
overturned tomato and cucumber stands, spitted toward Palestinian
merchants and shouted ``dogs,'' at them.
	   The women, dressed in long skirts and head scarves and clutching
their children, planted themselves in the center of the busy
Palestinian shopping area until soldiers forcibly dragged them,
some of through garbage and barbed wire, to extract them from the
area.
	   Two policemen were hurt in the incident, spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin said. One woman settler was arrested in the confrontation
and one Palestinian man wa detained for beating a Jewish girl,
Menuhin said.
	   Yasser Arafat's authority gained control of 80 percent of the
Hebron, where the majority of the city's 130,000 Palestinians live,
as part of a 1997 peace deal. Israel still controls the tense
downtown area, home to the settlers and 15,000 Palestinians.
	   A few hours later the blood stains from the wounded Israeli
woman still smeared the white limestone walk near the settler home,
The woman, from the Tel Aviv suburb of Herziliya, remained in a
Jerusalem hospital being treated for a bullet wound to the knee.
	   Col. Yigal Sharon, the commander of the Israeli army's forces in
Hebron, said Monday's shooting represented a further escalation in
tensions in the city since a rabbi was murdered there last month.
	   Israel has insisted that the Palestinians do more to counter
violence against Jews and rein in militant groups. No peace deal
between the sides to end an 18-month stalemate in negotiations
would be possible with Palestinian security guarantees, Netanyahu
said.
	   At the end of Monday's three-way summit in Washington, Clinton
said work remained to be completed before an agreement was reached
and invited Netanyahu and Arafat back to the White House in
October.
	   Meanwhile, some 2,500 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas, which opposes the peace talks, rallied against Israel in the
West Bank city of Nablus on Monday.
	   The demonstrators burned Israeli flags in protest of the killing
earlier this month by Israeli soldiers of two Hamas leaders.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraqi's deputy prime minister said Monday
that Baghdad won't make concessions to end the standoff over arms
inspections, saying his country had complied fully with U.N.
resolutions demanding that it destroy its banned weapons.
	   The Security Council should make the first move and conduct a
comprehensive review of sanctions and Iraq's efforts over seven
years to disarm itself, Tariq Aziz said, adding that the council
was legally and morally bound by its own resolutions to do so.
	   ``The idea that Iraq should do this or that concession before
the comprehensive review takes place is not legal,'' Aziz said.
	   Aziz spoke to reporters after meeting with Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on the standoff and the U.N. chief's proposal of a
``comprehensive review'' to break the logjam.
	   The Security Council asked Annan to formulate such a proposal
earlier this month, hoping that Iraq would back down from the
standoff knowing that a comprehensive review could highlight Iraq's
work to destroy its banned weapons.
	   The council stressed that no such review would take place until
Iraq rescinds its Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with U.N.
inspectors.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq stopped cooperating with inspectors after the chief U.N.
weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that it had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Aziz was instructed to insist that the United Nations take the
first step in ending the stalemate, Iraq's vice president, Taha
Yassin Ramadan, said in a statement carried Friday by the official
al-Iraq newspaper.
	   Aziz told reporters: ``I would like to say that the idea of a
comprehensive review is not a reward to be given to Iraq and then
Iraq has to make concessions before such a review takes place. The
review is an obligation _ a legal and moral obligation by the
Security Council itself.''
	   Aziz said his meeting with Annan was professional, cordial and
constructive, and that he thanked the U.N. chief for trying to put
together a comprehensive review.
	   Another meeting with Annan was planned before the week was out,
Aziz said, adding that he would be meeting with Security Council
members as well.
	   Monday's meeting comes as chemical weapons experts have been
meeting at U.N. headquarters to discuss the findings of Swiss and
French laboratories testing missile fragments for suspected traces
of the deadly VX gas.
	   Preliminary results from the European labs have been
inconclusive, diplomats have said.
	   A U.S. Army lab reported finding traces of the gas in June but
Baghdad disputed the findings.
	   Butler agreed to send other samples to European labs, though he
has said Saddam Hussein still must answer for the positive U.S.
tests.
	   In a related matter, Annan appointed a German official with the
U.N. Development Program, Hans von Sponeck, as the new humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq.
	   He replaces Dennis J. Halliday, who bowed out after criticizing
U.N. sanctions against Iraq and pushing to get more aid for Iraqis.
	   Von Sponeck will take over the distribution network of the U.N.
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of
oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.

Germany's new government takes form: Schroeder taps the Greens

	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- After ousting Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
national elections, a beaming Gerhard Schroeder declared Monday he
will try to forge a coalition with the Social Democrats he led to
power and a small environmentalist party that has never before been
in government.
	   While Germans voted for sweeping political change after 16 years
of conservative rule, pairing the pragmatic Social Democrats with
the sometimes pacifist Greens presents unique challenges for
Europe's largest nation.
	   At his first post-election news conference, Schroeder kept his
message broad, offering reassurances to his country and the world
that his government would continue the stability Kohl, the West's
longest-serving leader, secured during his four terms.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said. ``The international community can
rely on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   Commitment to NATO was not in question, Schroeder said,
addressing concerns that the Greens' anti-militaristic tendencies
might jeopardize Germany's role in European security. More radical
Greens call for the dissolution of the security alliance.
	   One of the first tests of the new government could be German
participation in proposed NATO strikes to quell bloodshed in the
Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Schroeder skirted that issue
by saying Kohl technically was still in power.
	   With party chief Oskar Lafontaine at his side on the dais,
Schroeder grinned and cracked jokes while fielding questions about
his plans. Tensions from months of tough campaigning clearly melted
away with the Social Democrat's sweeping 41 percent victory.
	   The future chancellor avoided committing his government to
specific plans before opening negotiations Friday with his
potential partners. The Social Democrats and Greens have some sharp
policy differences in key areas such as defense and energy
policies.
	   On one point Schroeder was emphatic: Drawing the Greens into
government would not compromise any of the Social Democrats'
center-left policies and campaign pledges. ``The Greens are going
to have to prepare for a clear and tough round of talks,'' he said.
	   Eager to enter government for the first time, the Greens
emphasized ideas the parties share: combating unemployment,
scrapping nuclear energy and giving long-time foreign residents of
Germany dual nationality.
	   Party leaders, new to the center stage of national politics,
appeared amused and bewildered by the throngs of international
journalists pelting them with questions Monday and blinding them
with TV lights.
	   Joining government would be a test of whether the Greens can
curb some of its idealism to cooperate with a more mainstream
party. A Social Democrat-Greens alliance would be postwar Germany's
most radical government, drawing in a party whose environmentalist
zeal has alienated and drawn ridicule from some Germans.
	   The standard Greens platform calls for raising the price of gas
to 5 marks (dlrs 3) a liter and setting a 100 kilometer (60 mile)
an hour speed limit on the autobahn. Greens even oppose Germany's
new high-speed magnetic levitation train scheduled to open in 2005,
on the principle that it will harm animals along the route.
	   Proposals such as these are completely out of the question,
Schroeder's party made clear even during the campaign. It is up to
the Greens to work out their internal problems, Schroeder said
Monday, emphasizing that his party will call the shots. The Social
Democrats have 298 seats in the 669-seat parliament; the Greens
have 47.
	   Even when the parties agree in principle, on issues such as
nuclear power, the Social Democrats are far more pragmatic.
Recognizing Germany's energy needs, they commit themselves vaguely
to shutting down nuclear plants ``as soon as possible.'' The Greens
say right away.
	   The Social Democrats will try to reach agreement with the Greens
within 30 days. Germany's constitution gives no deadline for
forming a government, but the new parliament must convene by Oct.
27. The parliament will then elect a chancellor, in this case
Schroeder, who will in turn designate his Cabinet and a coalition.
	   The Kohl government remains as a caretaker until the new
parliament convenes.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties held private
consultations Monday at forming a new government after sealing an
apparent victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their
intent to unite.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia began sounding out
several opposition groups Monday to see if they were interested in
joining a new government.
	   Only one -- the far-rightwing Slovak National Party -- showed
any interest. Party Chairman Jan Slota, who was in the previous
government, said he was interested in any coalition which did not
include the minority Hungarians.
	   Two other groups -- the Party of Civic Understanding and the
Party of the Democratic Left -- ruled out any coalition with him.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, acknowledged Sunday
after the release of unofficial results touched off immediate
dickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Official results are expected Tuesday morning, the Central
Election Commission said.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is
released, his likeliest options are to become minority leader in
Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties held talks Monday
aimed at forming a new government after sealing an apparent victory
in Slovak national elections by declaring their intent to unite.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia began sounding out
several opposition groups Monday to see if they were interested in
joining a new government.
	   Only one _ the ultranationalist Slovak National Party _ showed
any interest. Party Chairman Jan Slota, who was in the previous
government, said he was interested in any coalition that did not
include the minority Hungarians.
	   Two other groups consulted by Meciar's movement _ the Party of
Civic Understanding and the Party of the Democratic Left _ ruled
out any coalition with him.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left, acknowledged Sunday
after the release of unofficial results touched off immediate
dickering over the composition of the new government.
	   Official results were expected Tuesday morning, the Central
Election Commission said.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is
released, his likeliest options now are to serve as minority leader
in Parliament or resign.
	   His spokesman, Marian Kardos, said Monday that Meciar was at a
spa outside Bratislava for a back problem that required intravenous
treatment. He did not elaborate.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties, headed by the
Slovak Democratic Coalition, have reiterated their intent to form a
governing coalition after results indicated they won 93 of the 150
seats in Parliament.
	   Finishing ahead of all 16 other parties will give Meciar the
first crack at forming a governing coalition, but his chances
appear bleak.
	   The country's neighbors in Central Europe were happy with the
result _ particularly Hungary, which has complained of
discrimination against Slovakia's 550,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.
	   Referring to Meciar, the Budapest daily Nepszabadsag said ``the
man who failed in the ... elections has left an ugly legacy for
Slovakia.''
	   ``If `Vlado' remains in power, the semi-democracy and the
unbridled crony-privatization will continue, Slovakia will never
get into NATO and the EU, and will become a pariah just like
Yugoslavia,'' the newspaper said.

Portugal, Spain, and Austria/Hungary to bid for Euro 2004 finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Portugal, Spain, Austria and Hungary
have officially entered the race to host the finals of the European
soccer championships in 2004, European soccer's governing body,
UEFA, announced Monday.
	   Austria and Hungary will submit a joint bid, according to a UEFA
press release. Hungary's government voted Thursday to support it
despite initial concerns voiced by ministers about the country's
ability to fund the project, which is expected to cost up to dlrs
85 million.
	   Switzerland had also indicated interest in hosting the finals
but withdrew its bid earlier this year because it didn't fulfil
UEFA requirements, a UEFA spokeswoman said.
	   All the candidates will submit dossiers on their bids to UEFA at
a meeting on Thursday. UEFA is expected to announce the winner in
July next year.
	   Also Monday, UEFA said representatives of an extra six clubs
have been invited to attend the second meeting in Geneva on Friday
of its European Club Football 2000 task force.
	   The special group was set up to study options for reform of
European club competitions in response to plans by Italy's Media
Partners for a breakaway super league.
	   The clubs are Real Madrid and Barcelona of Spain, Lazio of
Italy, Bayer Leverkusen of Germany, Russia's Spartak Moscow and
Norway's Rosenborg.
	   Six clubs have already taken part in the first meeting of the
task force: Ajax of Holland, Juventus of Italy, England's
Liverpool, Bayern Munich of Germany, FC Porto of Portugal and
France's Olympique Lyonnais.

Five soldiers, two civilians killed in rebel ambush

	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Separatist rebels armed with automatic
weapons ambushed government troops passing through a thick forest
in Eastern India Thursday, killing five soldiers and wounding seven
others, police said.
	   Two civilians were caught in the shooting and died on the spot.
The five soldiers died as they were being rushed to the hospital.
	   The attack occurred Monday morning near the town of Goalpara,
1,350 kilometers (800 miles) east of the Indian capital, New Delhi,
police said.
	   The rebels belonged to the United Liberation Front of Assam, an
outlawed group fighting for an independent homeland for the ethnic
Assamese people in India's northeast. A spokesman for the group
called newspaper offices and claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   Troops have been deployed in strength in large parts of Assam
state to prevent possible rebel strikes against civilians during a
five-day festival that began Sunday.
	   Already 100 people have been killed in the last three weeks in
fresh fighting between rival ethnic groups in Assam where
separatist insurgency and tribal clashes have claimed hundreds of
lives.

German industry wary of left's election victory

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German industry leaders voiced concern
Monday that the left's election victory threatened the economy, but
the stock market welcomed the prospect of a stable government under
future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, said Monday he would seek a
coalition with the environmentalist Greens as junior partner _ a
shock for organized industry, which strongly backed defeated
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   ``I believe, as I always have, that the Greens are an
anti-industry party,'' said Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German
Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
	   The Frankfurt Stock Exchange took a more favorable view, though,
ending the day 2 percent higher.
	   ``At the end of the day, even investors abroad understood that
Schroeder isn't a threat or someone who wants to convert everything
into public-sector entities,'' said a trader at M.M. Warburg.
	   With unemployment stuck above 10 percent, Schroeder has called
for talks between government, labor and industry on solving the
jobs crisis.
	   He stressed Monday that his goal was ``economic stability.''
	   But industry leaders warned the Social Democrats against pumping
up social welfare programs that industry fears will push up
Germany's already high labor costs.
	   Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the German Federation of Industry,
rejected one of the Social Democrats' campaign planks _ scrapping
cuts in sick pay and easing firing rules pushed through by Kohl's
government.
	   ``I will do everything in my power to prevent these rollbacks in
the reforms,'' said Dieter Hundt, head of the German Employers'
Association.
	   While the lobbyists talked tough, individual companies were more
relaxed about the new government.
	   German chemical giant BASF sees ``no reason to panic'' after the
election, company spokesman Frank Halder said.
	   And Hermann Franzen, head of a retailer lobby, voiced hope that
tax reforms will help merchants by putting more money in consumers'
pockets.
	   Henkel was among the first to congratulate Schroeder at the
Social Democrats' victory bash in Bonn Sunday night.
	   He and other industry leaders left the door open for round-table
talks on fighting unemployment and suggested the Social Democrats'
promises to rescind the modest social welfare cuts be included in
the bargaining.
	   ``There are campaign promises, and then there's reality,'' he
told a Berlin radio station.
	   Industry wants the talks to yield tax cuts and reforms of
Germany's increasingly stretched social security system, Henkel
said.

Teenager kills cousin and burns his body
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Police arrested a 16-year-old Kuwaiti for brutally
killing his younger cousin over a ``strong personal dispute,'' the
Interior Ministry said Monday.
	   The burned body of a 13-year-old boy was found last week on the
roof of a building in al-Mangaf, south of Kuwait City.
	   The 16-year-old, who was not identified, told police that he had
asked his cousin to meet him on the roof of a residential building
so they could steal bicycles, a ministry statement said.
	   When his cousin showed up on the roof, he repeatedly stabbed
him, and when he fell to the ground, he slit his throat and burned
the body using kerosene.
	   The ministry statement did not elaborate on the dispute, or
provide any names.

Report clears Dutch military of Bosnia cover-up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An independent inquiry Monday
cleared the Dutch military of trying to cover up its troops'
failings in the 1995 fall of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of
Srebrenica.
	   But the inquiry, ordered last month by Defense Minister Frank de
Grave, did find ``many shortcomings and much carelessness in the
information process'' following one of the worst debacles in Dutch
military history.
	   Charged by the United Nations with protecting the Muslim enclave
of Srebrenica, a group of 300 Dutch soldiers could only look on
helplessly as rebel Serbs overran the area in July 1995.
	   More than 6,000 Muslims are believed to have been massacred in
the aftermath of the takeover.
	   In the face of international criticism at their lack of action,
Dutch top brass insisted the troops were outnumbered and outgunned
and also barred by their U.N. mandate from engaging in combat.
	   But in the three years since the humiliation, Dutch media have
reported a string of embarrassing allegations linked to the
Srebrenica fall.
	   In addition to the destruction of film said to show peacekeepers
helping Serbs separate Muslim men from women for deportation, Dutch
troops are alleged to have driven a tank through a crowd of fleeing
Muslims, killing up to 30. Four medics also claim that they were
ordered not to treat wounded Muslims.
	   Although military authorities knew about all of the alleged
incidents, there was a suspicion that they were not always
immediately or fully reported to the Defense Ministry, prompting
Minister De Grave to order the inquiry.
	   The inquiry's author, senior civil servant Jos van Kemenade, was
charged with investigating whether the lack of information was a
deliberate attempt to hide the truth.
	   He said it was not.
	   ``There is no question of this being swept under the carpet,''
concluded inquiry leader Jos van Kemenade. ``But the gathering,
distribution and use of information about peacekeeping missions
can, in possible future operations, be considerably better than it
was in this case.''

IMF: Russia program hinges on actions, not personalities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will decide
whether to loan more money to Russia on the basis of programs, not
personalities, the fund's Moscow representative was quoted as
saying Monday.
	   ``We will work with anyone whom the Russian government names ...
and the results will depend on the fulfillment by the Russian side
of the obligations that it takes on,'' the IMF's Martin Gilman
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   ``In Russia, there is a tendency to run relations with the IMF
at a personal level,'' he added.
	   Last week, Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin, who was in charge of
the government's relations with the IMF, resigned after a 10-day
tenure at the post. Before Shokhin, Russia's talks with the IMF
were coordinated by Anatoly Chubais, who was fired from the post
during the latest government reshuffle.
	   The IMF's lending program to Russia has been on hold since
August, when the government defaulted on its domestic debt and
imposed a moratorium on commercial foreign debt.
	   Last week, a mission from the fund left Moscow without a word
about any further loan installments.
	   The most serious problem in the Russian economy is the budget
deficit, Gilman said.
	   ``This has been going on for so long that at the moment Russia
isn't able to borrow, which has led to the payments crisis,''
Gilman said.
	   The fund's work is hampered by the government's lack of a
consistent economic program, Gilman added.
	   Yevgeny Primakov has faced an uphill struggle to form his
government, and infighting between Cabinet members over economic
policy already led to Shokhin's resignation last week.

Last of the Flying Finns dead at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Viljo Akseli Heino, the last of the
track stars called the ``Flying Finns,'' has died at age 84, the
International Amateur Atheltic Federation said Monday.
	   Heino died Sept. 15 in Tampere, Finland's third-largest city,
according to an IAAF statement. The cause of death was not given.
	   Although Heino was not as well known as others known by the
nickname, such as Paavo Nurmi and Viljam Ritola, he thrilled many
by setting world records even after suffering a leg injury in
Finland's 1939 war against the Soviet Union.
	   In 1944, Heino set the world record for 10,000 meters of 28:38.6
at a race in Helsinki. He was also given credit in the same race
for setting a world 6-mile record.
	   ``Had Heino's athletics career not been compromised by the ...
war, who knows what he might have achieved?''' the IAAF said in its
statement.
	   There was no immediate information on funeral arrangements or
survivors.

Rival militiamen in standoff after Sunday fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Rival militiamen in the war-torn
Somali capital faced each other Monday in an armed standoff that
threatened to erupt again into violence following clashes that
killed seven people.
	   In two separate incidents Sunday, militiamen fought street
battles in central and southern parts of the city in which five
people were killed and seven were wounded.
	   In a third battle, militiamen loyal to faction leader Hassan
Osman Ali, known by the nickname Atto, attacked a World Food
Programme convoy as it returned from delivering food aid to south
central Somalia. Two rival militamen guarding the convoy were
killed.
	   The convoy was guarded by fighters loyal to warlord Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, who controls most of south Mogadishu, and who has
worked out an agreement with Ali Mahdi Mohamed, warlord in the
northern sector, for a joint administration to run the seaside
capital.
	   Atto's militamen have not been included in the agreement that
would allow the international airport and port to open after being
closed for nearly four years, and violence has increased as they
attempt to block the implementation.
	   In one of the battles Sunday in the central Bermuda neighborhood
in which two people were killed, the wife of well-known businessman
and soccer coach Abdelaziz Ahmed Mahdi was kidnapped. Elders failed
again Monday to secure her release.
	   On Monday, several dozen militiamen loyal to Aidid and Atto
aimed heavy machine guns and mortars at each other across an empty
300-meter (yard) stretch of road in the southern Medina
neighborhood where fighting Sunday killed three people and wounded
three others, two of them children.
	   Last December in Cairo, most of the Somali warlords agreed to an
Egyptian-brokered peace deal that established an interim government
and called for an international reconciliation conference.
	   But the conference has been postponed several times, reportedly
for lack of funds.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 when Ali
Mahdi and Aidid's late father, Mohamed Farah Aidid, joined forces
to oust longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, then turned on each
other and plunged the country into a civil war and famine.

Egypt pardons 2,300 prisoners for October War celebrations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak has pardoned 2,300
prisoners to mark the 25th anniversary of the 1973 Arab-Israeli
war, police officials said Monday.
	   The amnesty does not cover prisoners convicted for terrorism and
vice, said the officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   On Oct. 6, 1973, the Egyptian army took Israeli forces by
surprise and crossed the Suez Canal, which Israel had held since
capturing Egypt's Sinai peninsula in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
	   The Egyptians were later pushed back, but Arabs feel the initial
victory erased the shame of the 1967 defeat and allowed Egypt to
move toward peace.
	   It became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in a
1979 treaty.

Union leaders sour over tight economic policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Graf 12 adds Tony Blair's first name &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Trade union leaders on Monday accused
the Labor Party _ which they help bankroll _ of following
unnecessarily stringent economic policies.
	   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, addressing Labor's
annual conference in this northern town, insisted ``there is no
other way.''
	   ``Don't just give us a vision of the promised land, give us a
place in it,'' declared Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of Britain's
biggest union, UNISON.
	   Bickerstaffe, whose union represents hundreds of thousands of
low-paid government workers, such as hospital cleaners, was greeted
with thunderous applause by delegates.
	   It underlined a change in atmosphere at this year's convention
compared with a year ago when the conference was largely an
ebullient celebration of Labor's landslide election victory in May
1997, which ended 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   Labor remains well ahead _ some 25 points _ of the
still-battered Conservatives in opinion polls.
	   But the strict economic polices, aimed at holding inflation to
2.5 percent, are angering both trade unions and manufacturers
because the resulting high value of the British pound makes it hard
to sell exports and encourages relatively cheap imports.
	   Brown said any short-term pains will be worth the long-term
gains of stable growth with few inflationary pressures.
	   ``It is because of our commitment to long-term stability, even
more essential at a time of world instability, that from this
government there will be no U-turns. No left turns. No right
turns,'' said Brown.
	   ``I tell this conference there is no other way, no solution, or
even comfort, in soft options, no magic wand solution, no quick-fix
alternative to these long-term policies for achieving the goals we
share.''
	   Although applause during Brown's speech was subdued, most of the
delegates gave him a standing ovation at the end.
	   Ken Jackson, head of the engineering workers' union, a moderate
union that has been a prime supporter of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's centrist ``New Labor'' policies, said he would continue to
campaign for the government to take back control of interest rates.
	   ``We have to reflect the views of our members who see the future
in manufacturing as under threat,'' said Jackson. ``Both sides of
industry are now saying that we are facing problems.''
	   As a key to keeping Britain on track for his inflation target,
Brown last year took the power to set interest rates away from
politicians and gave it to the Bank of England, which has tightened
monetary policy.
	   Blair, who has a huge parliamentary majority and thus enormous
power, argues that the tight policies will end what Labor calls the
``boom and bust'' cycle of the British economy.

EU ambassadors urge compliance with Dayton agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The European Union said
Monday it will not tolerate any attempts by ethnic groups or people
to jeopardize the sovereignty of Bosnia, the Bosnian news agency
Onasa reported.
	   The ambassadors of Britain, Austria and Germany _ forming the
so-called EU troika _ said they hoped that leaders newly elected in
nationwide balloting earlier this months would cooperate with the
international community and assist in the development of pluralism
and democracy in the country.
	   The diplomats reportedly singled out ultranationalist Nikola
Poplasen, who beat Biljana Plavsic for president of the Bosnian
Serb republic.
	   Valentin Inzko, the ambassador of Austria, which currently holds
the rotating EU presidency, said assistance from the international
community would hinge on implementation of the Dayton agreement.
	   He said special efforts would be made to ensure the functioning
of Bosnia and its entities, economic reforms, improvement of human
rights and the return of refugees and displaced persons.

U.N. experts head to Iran to consult on drug control efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A high-level U.N. delegation headed for
Iran on Monday on a weeklong mission to consult with the government
on its efforts to stop illegal drug trafficking from Afghanistan.
	   The delegation from the U.N. Drug Control Program will also
review the Iranian government's efforts to combat drug abuse, said
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   Iran lies on a route used by smugglers to get drugs from
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.
	   Last week, thousands of clerics summoned by Afghanistan's
Taliban ruler issued a resolution condemning the production of
narcotics, saying it was against Islam and that the Taliban should
work to eradicate drugs.
	   The U.N. delegation includes senior diplomats from Germany and
Belgium, high-ranking officials from drug-control organizations in
France and Spain and the U.N. Drug Control Program. It is headed by
Renzo Imbeni, vice president of the European Parliament.

Opposition resumes cooperation with Tajik government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The Tajik opposition agreed Monday
to resume cooperation with the Tajik government and participation
in reconciliation efforts, the government's press secretary said.
	   The leader of the Unified Tajik Opposition, Said Abdullo Nuri,
signed an agreement with President Emomali Rakhmonov designed to
speed up the peace process in this poor, mountainous country that
has been torn by civil strife since breaking away from the Soviet
Union seven years ago.
	   Opposition members will resume its work in the National
Reconciliation Commission and the cabinet on Tuesday, Press
Secretary Zafar Saidov said.
	   The opposition halted cooperation after the killing of Otakhon
Latifi, who had returned to Tajikistan a year ago following peace
accords that ended the five-year civil war between the hard-line
government and the opposition.
	   They protested what they saw as a lack of protection for
opposition leaders, and were also angry at government statements
accusing several opposition field commanders of violating terms of
the peace treaty.
	   The new program signed by both sides calls for, among other
things, the protection of opposition workers in the government, the
creation of a commission to investigate Latifi's death, and
organizing a joint unit to combat crime, the Interfax news agency
said.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The prime minister of the Cape Verde
islands was injured when the plane he was in made a crash landing
during a storm Monday, killing one of his bodyguards, according to
news reports.
	   Prime Minister Carlos Veiga was under observation at Agostinho
Neto Hospital in Praia, the capital of the island group 480
kilometers (300 miles) off the coast of Senegal, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa reported. He suffered bruises, but his injuries
were not life threatening.

Serb premier says special police units will be pulled out of Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with unofficial NATO reaction, Serbs saying action
near Suva Reka over; inserts new ethnic Albanian reaction
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack, the
Serbian premier Monday declared Kosovo's separatists have been
defeated and promised to withdraw special police units from the
province _ a condition demanded by the United States and Europe.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks, and his deputy threatened to take
hostage all pro-Western Serbs who work for independent media, peace
and human right groups in case of NATO strikes.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, issued a statement pledging to continue what it
called ``the holy war'' against Serbia and demanding NATO action.
The statement also criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders
``whose actions are hindering this holy war.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days unless they
have committed ``war crimes.''
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new bandit-terrorist activity appears
again,'' he said. ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the
armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, repeated the alliance's official position that Milosevic
has to fulfill all the conditions laid down in the U.N. resolution
last Wednesday which called for an immediate cease-fire.
	   ``Words are nifty, but we want to see action,'' he said.
	   There was no visible withdrawal of the police units Monday.
Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   ``Conditions have been made ... to decrease engagement of
anti-terrorist forces,'' the premier said.
	   But the leading ethnic Albanian Democratic League of Kosovo
party stated the premier's claims were a ``manipulation of the
world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and called for an
``immediate NATO action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, sporadic
fighting was reported in Kosovo Monday. The Kosovo Information
Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian leadership, reported
Serbian shelling in the region of the Suva Reka village and
Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw thick columns of smoke blurring the horizon of
Suva Reka where open flames consumed at least four villages
sprawling over nearby hills Monday. Police and the Yugoslav army,
backed by tanks and heavy artillery, had surrounded several
villages in the area and denied entry to journalists and foreign
diplomatic observers.
	   ``There are still many KLA,'' said one Serb police officer in
Suva Reka, which sits at the foot of the hills where Sunday's
police offensive devastated several villages.
	   The state Tanjug news agency later said that ``all strongholds
of terrorists'' in the region of Suva Reka were ``destroyed''
Monday, and that dozens of ``terrorists'' were killed and hundreds
were arrested.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Tempers flared in this divided West
Bank city on Monday when an Israeli woman was shot, apparently by
Palestinian assailants, and Jewish settlers beat Arab neighbors in
retaliation.
	   The violence came as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu headed into a meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington to try to end months
of impasse in Israeli-Palestinian peace making.
	   Monday morning, a 52-year-old Israeli woman, in Hebron with her
family to celebrate her son's bar mitzvah, was shot once in the leg
while touring the city's Jewish settlement.
	   The bullet that hit her was one of four fired by assailants from
a Palestinian-controlled area of the city that surrounds the
settlement's trailer homes. The army sealed the area and searched
for suspects but made no arrests.
	   Shortly afterward, angry settlers from the 450-strong Jewish
community took to the city's dusty streets and beat Palestinian
passersby, injuring one.
	   And in the city's Arab-run vegetable market, some 15 settlers
including one founder of the Hebron settlement, Miriam Levinger,
overturned tomato and cucumber stands, spitted toward Palestinian
merchants and shouted ``dogs,'' at them.
	   The women, dressed in long skirts and head scarves and clutching
their children, planted themselves in the center of the busy
Palestinian shopping area until soldiers forcibly dragged them,
some of through garbage and barbed wire, to extract them from the
area.
	   Two policemen were hurt in the incident, spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin said. One woman settler was arrested in the confrontation
and one Palestinian man was detained for beating a Jewish girl,
Menuhin said.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority gained control of 80
percent of the Hebron, where the majority of the city's 130,000
Palestinians live, as part of a 1997 peace deal. Israel still
controls the tense downtown area, home to the settlers and 15,000
Palestinians.
	   A few hours later the blood stains from the wounded Israeli
woman still smeared the white limestone walk near the settler home,
The woman, from the Tel Aviv suburb of Herziliya, remained in a
Jerusalem hospital being treated for a bullet wound to the knee.
	   Col. Yigal Sharon, the commander of the Israeli army's forces in
Hebron, said Monday's shooting represented a further escalation in
tensions in the city since a rabbi was murdered there last month.
	   Israel has insisted that the Palestinians do more to counter
violence against Jews and rein in militant groups. No peace deal
between the sides to end an 18-month stalemate in negotiations
would be possible with Palestinian security guarantees, Netanyahu
said.
	   At the end of Monday's three-way summit in Washington, Clinton
said work remained to be completed before an agreement was reached
and invited Netanyahu and Arafat back to the White House in
October.
	   Meanwhile, some 2,500 members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas, which opposes the peace talks, rallied against Israel in the
West Bank city of Nablus on Monday.
	   The demonstrators burned Israeli flags in protest of the killing
earlier this month by Israeli soldiers of two Hamas leaders.

Technique might quickly screen cow brains for mad-cow proteins

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have developed a lab technique that
might allow rapid screening of slaughtered cows for the rogue
proteins that cause mad cow disease and a similar human illness.
	   A rapid test could ease consumer fears about eating beef or
other cattle products. Such products are blamed for some rare cases
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people.
	   Right now, the test for finding the proteins, or prions,
requires too much labor for large-scale use on cattle, said
researcher Dr. Fred Cohen. Further work will be needed to produce a
workable screening kit, he said Monday.
	   The test-tube technique, used on hamsters so far, would be
applied to cow brain tissue. It gives an answer in eight hours, vs.
the months needed for the standard means of detecting low levels of
prions in tissue, Cohen said. The standard technique involves
injecting tissue into the brains of lab animals and waiting to see
if disease appears.
	   The work was reported in the October issue of the journal Nature
Medicine by researchers at the University of California at San
Francisco, including Cohen, Dr. Jiri Safar and Dr. Stanley
Prusiner. Prusiner won a Nobel Prize last year for discovering
prions.
	   The test involves treating a tissue sample with substances that
unfold the prions. That exposes a section that proteins called
antibodies can grab onto, allowing the prions to be detected.

Promise for those who can't take Viagra

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers are turning anti-impotence pills
and injected medicines into rub-on creams and gels _ part of a
broader effort to make many drugs safer and easier to use by
literally dissolving them through the skin.
	   Early testing shows the impotence cream Topiglan is a leading
candidate in this effort to give patients targeted relief for many
ailments, with fewer side effects.
	   ``It's a no-brainer,'' said Dr. Irwin Goldstein of Boston
University, a urologist leading studies of the impotence cream who
expects many of today's medicines eventually to be applied to the
skin. ``It has a lot of use in lots of drugs.''
	   Topiglan needs more studies, Goldstein cautions, and is not for
sale. But it might become a good alternative for men who can't take
the popular impotence pill Viagra _ which sometimes causes
dangerous side effects in men with heart disease, Goldstein said.
Or, severely impotent men could use both treatments together.
	   Topiglan is made from a longtime impotence drug called
alprostadil that works very well, but has a problem: It must either
be injected into the penis or inserted as a suppository, both
painful.
	   MacroChem Corp. invented a ``skin enhancer,'' a chemical that
lets potent drugs seep through the skin by opening a temporary
window in skin's normally impenetrable barriers. That means
patients can get much-higher drug doses delivered straight to the
site of disease _ with fewer side effects.
	   By adding its skin enhancer, MacroChem created a cream that
patients can rub onto the end of the penis.
	   Goldstein gave 114 moderately impotent men either a dummy cream,
a low dose of Topiglan or a high dose. Inside a doctor's office,
they used the creams and then watched an adult movie or used a
stimulator. The excitement alone helped 20 percent of placebo
patients get an erection adequate for intercourse, but high-dose
Topiglan helped 69 percent.
	   The only side effect was a warm sensation on the penis.
	   MacroChem is now talking with 10 major drug manufacturers
bidding for rights to sell Topiglan, said chief executive Alvin
Karloff.
	   But MacroChem hopes to treat more than impotence. Furthest along
in testing:
	   _Ibuprofen gel. Ibuprofen is the painkiller that helps millions
battle arthritis and other aches. But regular use and high doses
also can cause ulcers because ibuprofen first travels through the
stomach before ever reaching a sore joint. Combining ibuprofen with
the skin enhancer created a gel that penetrates straight into the
ache, proving 80 percent effective in one study, without any ulcer
risk because it never hits the stomach.
	   _Anti-fungus toenail polish. Patients with toenail fungus
infections spend months swallowing medicines that can harm their
livers before ever reaching their toes. Adding the skin enhancer
let MacroChem turn fungicides into a polish that penetrates just
the spot that needs treating.
	   Earlier attempts at skin-enhanced topical drugs largely failed,
said Food and Drug Administration pharmacologist Tom McGinnis. They
were greasy, and controlling the dosage was difficult.
	   Then companies successfully tried patches, which trap enough
heat onto one spot that skin's lipids become wet and let drugs slip
inside. Today, patients get hormone treatment and fight motion
sickness with patches. ``It doesn't run all over the place, it
doesn't get on your clothing,'' McGinnis said.
	   But patches also can irritate the skin, cost more to make than
the actual drug and aren't powerful enough for many medicines,
Karloff said. MacroChem's skin enhancer is a hydrocarbon that
creates a temporary chemical reaction with the lipids, briefly
liquifying skin cells so drugs can penetrate. Once it dries, the
skin's seal returns intact.

Algerian prime minister pledges to continue privatization program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with background on privatization plan; shows
policeman reported killed in new violence &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria's prime minister said Monday the
government would stick to its massive program of privatization,
assuring that the nation's disgruntled main union would be
consulted along the way.
	   ``We will continue to implement reforms,'' Ahmed Ouyahia said
after marathon 19-hour talks with Abdelmadjid Sidi-Said, head of
the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA), Algeria's largest
union.
	   ``We will continue privatization within the framework of the
law, transparently and with dialogue,'' he added.
	   Unemployment is already around 30 percent of the active
population, and the government's program of privatizing state
industries, under the pressure of the International Monetary Fund,
is translating into further job losses.
	   The UGTA, opposed to the program, had boycotted a meeting with
government officials on Sept. 9 and threatened to call a general
strike.
	   The union claims some 200,000 people have lost their jobs in
three years.
	   The UGTA has worked hand-in-hand with the military-backed
government since 1992, when this North African nation began a
spiral into violence following an army decision to cancel
legislative elections a Muslim fundamentalist party was winning.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in the violence that
took the life of an Algiers policeman on Sunday, the daily
newspaper Liberte reported Monday. Authorities blame such attacks
on Islamic extremists fighting to topple the government.
	   Discord between authorities and the UGTA loomed as another
rupture.
	   But Sidi-Said said he was ``globally satisfied'' with the talks
with the prime minister, while insisting the union ``neither
supports nor adheres to privatization.'' He did not mention the
earlier strike threat.
	   Earlier this year, more than 100,000 Algerian metal and steel
workers, mechanics and customs employees went on strike to protest
government plans to cut public jobs.

Secondhand smoke may raise fetus' risk of childhood cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT). &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pregnant women who are exposed to other people's
cigarette smoke might be raising their fetuses' risk of developing
cancer in childhood.
	   A study found that babies born to exposed mothers showed higher
rates of a kind of genetic mutation in blood cells. This kind of
mutation is caused by a particular enzyme, and it is often found in
childhood leukemia and lymphoma.
	   Experts said it is the first time scientists have linked
secondhand smoke to genetic mutations in a fetus. Prior research
found elevated mutation rates in fetuses from women who themselves
smoked during pregnancy.
	   The study doesn't show a direct link to cancer. In fact, the
specific gene mutations it monitored are harmless because they
occurred in a gene unrelated to cancer.
	   The findings only suggest that if a pregnant woman is exposed to
cigarette smoke, the mutation-making enzyme might become more
active in her fetus, raising the risk of hazardous mutations in
cancer-related genes.
	   The study couldn't define how big a risk secondhand smoke might
pose, but it's rare for children to get leukemia or lymphoma at
all. Only about 3,000 new cases, mostly leukemia, are expected in
the United States this year in children up to age 14.
	   The work was presented in the October issue of the journal
Nature Medicine by Dr. Barry Finette, Dr. Richard Albertini and
colleagues at the University of Vermont in Burlington.
	   It's an important finding that requires follow-up study, said
Frederica Perera, director of Columbia University's Center for
Children's Environmental Health. A fetus is ``exquisitely
sensitive'' to exposure to many toxins, including those in tobacco
smoke, because the defense systems present in adults are still
developing, she said.
	   The study involved 24 newborns from nonsmoking mothers. Half
were born to women who said they had been exposed to other people's
smoke at home, at work or in both places. The other half were born
to women who reported no such exposure.
	   The researchers inspected white cells in blood from the
placenta. They looked for mutations in a gene called HPRT. This
gene has nothing to do with cancer, but researchers used it as an
indicator of how often particular kinds of mutations had occurred
generally in the newborn.
	   The key finding pertained to a kind of genetic splicing carried
out by an enzyme called V(D)J recombinase. Normally, the enzyme
helps the immune system prepare to fight a variety of germs. But
when the enzyme makes a mistake, it can set the stage for cancer.
	   The study found that HPRT mutations produced by the enzyme
appeared at a higher rate in the smoke-exposed group, at 34 percent
of all mutations counted vs. 20 percent. When researchers counted
only mutations that deleted large chunks of genetic material, the
difference was 67 percent vs. 30 percent.
	   Finette said he suspects substances in cigarette smoke make
fetal DNA more vulnerable to mutations by the enzyme.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarian riot police cleared the
grounds of the Canadian Embassy Monday after 34 ethnic Albanian
refugees invaded the compound and demanded political asylum.
	   No one was injured but some of the men had to be strong-armed in
the brief scuffle after about 100 riot police entered the compound
at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) and hustled the refugees to a waiting bus.
	   Police waited for hours, hoping to persuade the 10 men and 8
women who had 16 children with them to leave quietly.
	   Canadian diplomats asked police to negotiate a settlement and
authorized a forcible eviction if the talks failed.
	   Police said the group occupying the embassy's front steps in a
slight rain had been identified as ethnic Albanians from
Yugoslavia's war-torn Kosovo province.
	   ``The group entered the embassy grounds a few minutes after 10
a.m. (0800 GMT) and demanded to be granted political asylum,''
police spokesman Mihaly Dezsi said.
	   He said the Albanians had been housed at a refugee camp in
Bicske, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Budapest, since they
entered Hungary illegally.
	   They 34 people were returned to Bicske Monday evening.
	   ``Some members of the group had applied to emigrate to Canada,
but grew impatient and wanted to bring pressure on the Canadian
authorities,'' Dezsi said, explaining the motive behind the
occupation.
	   ``We will die here if we have to,'' one refugee yelled from the
embassy steps in the afternoon.
	   Offers of food were refused, and their spokesman explained they
brought plenty of supplies.
	   Embassy officials were not available for comment.
	   Hungarian police had sealed off the area around the embassy,
which is a fenced-in compound of two larger buildings in the hills
of Buda, a quiet residential part of the city.

Hybrid poplar trees suck up heavy metals and solvents

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Cleaning up polluted industrial sites may not
require billion-dollar government programs. Instead, scientists
suggest, plant a poplar tree.
	   Laboratory-designed hybrids of the fast-growing poplar tree have
been found to act like 100-foot (30-meter) straws that suck
contamination from soil and groundwater.
	   In a process known as phytoremediation, the tree either safely
stores the chemicals in its tissues or metabolizes them into
apparently less volatile compounds. Then the tree releases these
byproducts through its leaves as vapor into the atmosphere.
	   This natural cleanup takes several years to complete. But tests
show the method is inexpensive and might work at least as well as
high-tech soil roasting and groundwater filtering, while keeping
the site green and attractive.
	   Researchers say phytoremediation eventually may transform the
way industry and government agencies treat long-term pollution
problems, which are estimated to top dlrs 200 billion in the United
States.
	   Still unknown, however, is whether the chemical byproducts
generated by the poplars really are less harmful, or if diluting
them in the atmosphere only creates another hazard.
	   ``We may soon be using trees to heal the hurt inflicted on the
Earth,'' said David E. Salt, an environmental chemist at Northern
Arizona University in Flagstaff. ``But would we simply be
exchanging soil pollution for air pollution?''
	   In one study, published in the October issue of the journal
Nature Biotechnology, researchers at the University of Georgia took
a gene from a strain of bacteria that enables it tolerate high
levels of ionic mercury, a highly toxic version of the heavy metal.
	   They modified the merA gene and inserted it into the genetic
code of the yellow poplar. Laboratory tests showed the genetically
engineered poplar had a tenfold increase in mercury resistance and
also its ability to transport it through its roots and tissues,
reduce it to a less volatile form and release it into the air. The
genetic hybrid has not yet been planted in field tests.
	   The yellow poplar, also known as the tulip poplar, is one of the
largest and most commercially valuable hardwood trees. It grows
primarily east of the Mississippi River.
	   Environmental scientists favor it for phytoremediation for the
same reasons that make the tree popular with commercial foresters,
plywood manufacturers and neighborhood landscapers.
	   It grows up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) per year and absorbs 25
gallons (95 liters) of water a day. Its broad green leaves measure
6 inches square (39 centimeters square), providing plenty of leaf
surface to release processed contaminants. It has an extensive root
system. And it's resistant to everything from gypsy moths to toxic
wastes.
	   In a study published in the October issue of the Journal of
Environmental Engineering, scientists at the University of
Missouri-Rolla and the University of Iowa report that more
conventional poplar trees effectively reduce high soil levels of
atrazine, a farm fertilizer.
	   Other remediation technologies strip the soil of vital nutrients
and microorganisms, so nothing can grow on the site even if it has
been decontaminated, they said.
	   ``Phytoremediation simultaneously restores soil health and
revegeates during the cleansing process,'' said co-author Joel G.
Burken of the University of Missouri-Rolla.
	   One of the United States' largest phytoremediation experiments
is being conducted in Oregon. In 1984, a tanker truck skidded on
icy Interstate 5 near Central Point, spilling hundreds of gallons
(liters) of the solvent TCE.
	   Conventional cleanup efforts spanning 13 years failed to remove
the solvent, a suspected carcinogen, from the surrounding soil and
groundwater. In 1997, University of Washington scientists planted
800 hybrid poplars.
	   The results will not be available for several years. But in
laboratory simulations, the Washington team said, poplars reduced
TCE concentrations by 97 percent.

Study says women now do as well as men after heart surgery
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ Surgical procedures to restore blood flow to the
heart are no riskier for women than for men, according to a new
study that contradicts previous research.
	   Men and women who undergo bypass surgery or angioplasty, in
which a tiny balloon is used to clear clogged arteries, had similar
rates of in-hospital deaths and five-year survival.
	   ``The message is if women are in need of one of these
procedures, we can recommend them with enthusiasm and anticipation
of a good acute and long-term result,'' said Dr. Alice K. Jacobs of
Boston Medical Center.
	   Her study was published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
	   Many earlier studies concluded that women undergoing heart
bypass surgery were more than twice as likely to die. The death
rates were higher for women after angioplasty, as well. However,
the women in some of these studies tended to be older and sicker
than the men.
	   In this study, the men and women were far closer in health and
in age. However, Jacobs said the similar results for men and women
this time may have been due instead to advances in technique and
technology.
	   For example, she said, doctors now can use smaller catheters in
angioplasty that may be better for women's smaller blood vessels.
	   Doctors are also getting better at taking into account the fact
that women are older and sicker by the time they have surgery, and
they are adapting their techniques accordingly, Jacobs said.
	   Heart disease is the leading killer of U.S. women, but it
typically strikes women 10 years later than men, when they are more
likely to be weaker and have other ailments associated with aging,
such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
	   Jacobs' study involved 1,829 patients undergoing either bypass
surgery or angioplasty. Twenty-seven percent of the participants
were women. The women as a group were older by three years, and
almost half were over 65.
	   Of the women who had bypass surgery, 1.3 percent died in the
hospital, compared with 1.4 percent of the men. After angioplasty,
less than 1 percent of the women vs. 1.2 percent of the men died.
	   The death rates five years after the procedures also were
similar. Eighty-seven percent of the women were still alive, as
were 88 percent of the men. Seventy-five percent of the women
survived five years without another heart attack, as did 77 percent
of the men.
	   Dr. Timothy Gardner, chairman of the surgical council for the
American Heart Association, said the study is good news for women
with heart disease.
	   ``I think the importance of this study is that women who are
diagnosed ought not to think they're in a worse situation than
males,'' Gardner said.

Sponsor Peugeot pulls out of French Open after 15 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Organizers of the French Open golf tournament lost
their main sponsor Monday when car manufacturer Peugeot announced
that it would no longer support the 92-year-old event.
	   In a statement, Peugeot, which has sponsored the dlrs 800,000
competition for 15 years, said that it would concentrate its future
golf sponsorship in France on the amateur game.
	   ``After 15 years of support for professional golf, we feel we
have achieved our objectives in France,'' the statement said.
	   The French company said that it will continue to sponsor the
Spanish Open.
	   Launched in 1906, the French Open is Europe's second oldest open
golf tournament, but its prize money has not enabled it to maintain
a place among the top echelons of the European circuit.
	   The Lancome Trophy, also held in France, offers prize money of
dlrs 1.32 million.
	   The inability of the French Golf Federation to boost the money
on offer has resulted in the Open losing its late-June slot in next
year's European calendar.
	   It is tentatively re-scheduled for the second week of May.

Belgian team doctor claims two-thirds of cycling doctors in bad
</HEADLINE>
faith
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Two-thirds of the doctors involved in
cycling are giving athletes performance-enhancing drugs, the
medical chief of the sport's Belgian federation said Monday.
	   ``I'm afraid we're talking about two out of three. There are too
many people operating in bad faith and they drag down the others,''
Dr. Joost De Maeseneer said.
	   He hopes the Oct. 5 Congress of the International Cycling Union
in Maastricht, the Netherlands, would start cleaning up the sport,
which was hit hard by a drugs scandal at its premier event, the
Tour de France, over the summer.
	   ``We have to make sure we can start turning things around,'' he
told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   His comments came after the Brussels daily Het Nieuwsblad
reported that the Belgian cycling federation issued a formal
complaint against Festina team doctor Eric Ryckaert for his
involvement in the Tour scandal.
	   Ryckaert was imprisoned during the Tour after more than 400
doping products, including the endurance enhancing drug EPO, were
found in a Festina team car. The team was expelled from the Tour.
Rumors and accusations involving several other teams have since
cast a shadow over the sport.
	   ``We were in a relatively quiet period until five years ago,''
said De Maeseneer. ``Then came the excesses. The rise of EPO
certainly played its role, and so did the increased pressure of
sponsors.''
	   The discovery of EPO in the Festina car was the first time the
drug could be linked so clearly to cycling.
	   Apart from doctors handing out illegal drugs on the professional
circuit, De Maeseneer was also alarmed by the increasing use of
doping in cycling's youth divisions. ``We are seeing that certain
people are giving illegal drugs to youngsters now,'' he said.
	   De Maeseneer has been involved in cycling for 17 years.

Israeli health insurer sues tobacco companies for dlrs 2 billion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's largest health insurer filed a dlrs
two billion lawsuit Monday against American and Israeli tobacco
manufacturers, claiming compensation for the costs to treat smokers
who were misled about the effects of cigarettes.
	   The lawsuit, filed in Jerusalem's District Court, also seeks
punitive damages and unspecified future damages.
	   Those named in the suit include Phillip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
Brown &AMP; Williamson, Liggett &AMP; Meyers, and Lorillard. Israel's only
cigarette manufacturer, Dubek, its former chief executive officer
and its sister company were also named in the suit.
	   The 28-page complaint accuses the companies of withholding
evidence of the harmful effects of smoking, target advertising of
minors, deceptive advertising and altering nicotine levels to
encourage addiction.
	   The plaintiff, the Kupat Holim Klalit health fund, insures about
70 percent of Israel's citizens, said Amos Hausner, one of two
attorneys behind the lawsuit.
	   In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks injunctions to
halt the alleged false advertising and the removal of harmful
substances from cigarettes.
	   The Dubek cigarette manufacturer is currently fighting two other
suits in Israeli courts. One was filed by a similar health provider
for dlrs 486 million, and another suit was on behalf of 15 Israelis
allegedly sickened or killed from smoking.
	   Hausner, a legal adviser for the Israeli Forum for the
Prevention of Smoking, said the other suits would not affect the
filed Monday. Spokesmen for Dubek were not immediately available
for comment.
	   Last year Liggett executives broke ranks from the tobacco
industry by acknowledging that nicotine is addictive, that tobacco
causes cancer and that cigarette companies targeted children.
Liggett agreed to turn over documents that contained more than 30
years of industry secrets.
	   Israel's health ministry says 28 percent of thr country's 5.9
million citizens smoke and 5,000 die from smoking-related diseases
every year.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack,
Serbia's premier declared that Kosovo's separatists have been
defeated and promised Monday to withdraw special police units from
the province _ as demanded by the United States and Europe.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks, and his deputy threatened to take
hostage all Serbs who work for independent media, peace and human
rights groups in case of NATO strikes.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, pledged to continue what it called ``the holy war''
against Serbia and demanded NATO action. The statement also
criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders ``whose actions are
hindering this holy war.''
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up the vast majority
of the 2 million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days unless they
have committed ``war crimes.''
	   ``With this day, anti-terrorist activities have finished and can
be renewed only if some new bandit-terrorist activity appears
again,'' he said. ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the
armed terrorist groups have been defeated.''
	   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, repeated the alliance's official position that Milosevic
has to fulfill all the conditions laid down in Wednesday's U.N.
resolution that called for an immediate cease-fire.
	   ``Words are nifty, but we want to see action,'' he said.
	   There was no visible withdrawal Monday of the police units.
Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   ``Conditions have been made ... to decrease engagement of
anti-terrorist forces,'' the premier said.
	   But the leading ethnic Albanian Democratic League of Kosovo
party stated the premier's claims were a ``manipulation of the
world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and urged ``immediate NATO
action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, sporadic
fighting was reported Monday in Kosovo. The Kosovo Information
Center, which is close to the ethnic Albanian leadership, reported
Serbian shelling in the region of the Suva Reka village and
Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw thick columns of smoke blurring the horizon of
Suva Reka where open flames consumed at least four villages
sprawling over nearby hills Monday. Police and the Yugoslav army,
backed by tanks and heavy artillery, had surrounded several
villages in the area and denied entry to journalists and foreign
diplomatic observers.
	   ``There are still many KLA,'' said one Serb police officer in
Suva Reka, which sits at the foot of the hills where Sunday's
police offensive devastated several villages.
	   The state Tanjug news agency later said that ``all strongholds
of terrorists'' in the region of Suva Reka were ``destroyed''
Monday, and that dozens of ``terrorists'' were killed and hundreds
were arrested.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also claimed that two ethnic
Albanian families, including 15 members, were ``massacred'' by
withdrawing Serb troops in the central Drenica region on Sunday.
The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from Kosovo and
begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the province's future.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against Kosovo's separatists
and allow the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes in the
event that Milosevic failed to comply.
	   The premier made his remarks hours before the Serbian parliament
adopted a resolution declaring that stamping out ethnic Albanian
resistance in Kosovo was Serbia's top priority.
	   During the session, vice premier Vojislav Seselj threatened to
take pro-Western Serbs as hostage in case of NATO strikes. His list
of ``traitors'' included independent journalists, and members of
human rights, intellectual and peace groups.

Israeli health insurer sues tobacco companies for dlrs 2 billion

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's largest health insurer filed a dlrs
two billion lawsuit Monday against American and Israeli tobacco
manufacturers, claiming compensation for the costs to treat smokers
who were misled about the effects of cigarettes.
	   The lawsuit, filed in Jerusalem's District Court, also seeks
punitive damages and unspecified future damages.
	   Those named in the suit include Phillip Morris, R.J. Reynolds,
Brown &AMP; Williamson, Liggett &AMP; Meyers, and Lorillard. Israel's only
cigarette manufacturer, Dubek, its former chief executive officer
and its sister company were also named in the suit.
	   The 28-page complaint accuses the companies of withholding
evidence of the harmful effects of smoking, target advertising of
minors, deceptive advertising and altering nicotine levels to
encourage addiction.
	   The plaintiff, the Kupat Holim Klalit health fund, insures about
70 percent of Israel's citizens, said Amos Hausner, one of two
attorneys behind the lawsuit.
	   In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks injunctions to
halt the alleged false advertising and the removal of harmful
substances from cigarettes.
	   The Dubek cigarette manufacturer is currently fighting two other
suits in Israeli courts. One was filed by a similar health provider
for dlrs 486 million, and another suit was on behalf of 15 Israelis
allegedly sickened or killed from smoking.
	   Hausner, a legal adviser for the Israeli Forum for the
Prevention of Smoking, said the other suits would not affect the
filed Monday. Spokesmen for Dubek were not immediately available
for comment.
	   Last year Liggett executives broke ranks from the tobacco
industry by acknowledging that nicotine is addictive, that tobacco
causes cancer and that cigarette companies targeted children.
Liggett agreed to turn over documents that contained more than 30
years of industry secrets.
	   Israel's health ministry says 28 percent of thr country's 5.9
million citizens smoke and 5,000 die from smoking-related diseases
every year.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Mario Pescante resigned Monday as president of the
Italian National Olympic Committee amid a scandal over testing for
banned performance-enhancing substances.
	   Pescante announced his resignation in the face of growing
criticism from sports and government officials over Italian media
reports that some doping tests were not conducted as required.
	   ``I've made this decision to restore calm to the atmosphere and
not because I believe I have responsibility'' for any lax testing,
he said.
	   Pescante has served as president since June 1993. His
resignation is to become official after an Oct. 13 meeting of
sports officials.
	   Allegations about supposedly rapid muscle growth among Italian
soccer players sparked a series of investigations into the use of
growth enhancing substances among the nation's players.
	   One, for the Italian Olympic Committee's antidoping commission,
ended in August without finding evidence of illegal drug use, but
did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is widespread.

Iraq says U.S. holding up 28 oil spare part contracts

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States is holding up 28
contracts for the purchase of spare part needed to revamp Iraq's
oil industry, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Monday.
	   He said out of the dlrs 300 million earmarked to repair Iraqi
oil installations, only dlrs 21.1 million have so far been
released.
	   The delay in the approval of the contracts has prevented Iraq
from exporting enough oil needed to raise its revenues, Saleh said
at a news conference.
	   Iraq says it will only be able to sell dlrs 3 billion worth of
crude during the current, six-month phase of the U.N. oil-for-food
program, or about dlrs 1 billion below target.
	   This will give Iraq dlrs 2 billion for food and other
humanitarian goods. The balance will go to war reparations and the
cost of the U.N. weapons monitoring program.
	   The United Nations agreed to increase the oil-for-food program
to dlrs 5.2 billion from the previous dlrs 2 billion every six
months. The program, an exception from U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows Iraq to sell oil to
buy food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Iraq had said it could not meet the dlrs 5.2 billion total and
had set a target of dlrs 4 billion for the current six month
period. But even that ceiling is not attainable now.
	   Saleh said of the dlrs 2 billion that will be available to Iraq
under the fourth oil phase, contracts worth dlrs 1.1 billion have
so far been approved by the United Nations.
	   He said money from the oil program was not enough and was not
improving the condition of the Iraqi people.
	   But a U.N. official in Baghdad said Monday that the deal was
reducing malnutrition among Iraqi children.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
said a survey in the north of the country showed that 25.3 percent
of children under the age of 5 were suffering from chronic
malnutrition, down from 33.3 percent.
	   He said U.N. agencies hoped for similar results in surveys to be
undertaken soon in central and southern parts of the country.
	   Meanwhile, Saleh said his ministry was negotiating with Saudi
businessmen and firms and deals worth more than dlrs 100 million
have been signed with them under the oil program.

Three dead in Mexico mudslides, flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with death toll increased, details
of mudslides. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains swelled rivers in central Mexico
and triggered mudslides Monday in Mexico City which killed three
people and injured five others, a local official reported.
	   Rainstorms soaked squatter communities perched on the steep
slopes of hillsides south of the city, and television footage
showed a stream of mud roaring down a gully over the ruins of two
homes that had been swept away.
	   It was a disaster city officials had been predicting for months,
as they launched a campaign to relocate shanty towns that ring the
city's hillsides.
	   Officials had warned the squatters that their houses _ often
perched on hillsides so steep that the dwellings are supported only
by sandbags _ were in danger during Mexico's rainy season.
	   ``It's very difficult to convince them, they don't want to leave
their houses,'' said Aurelio Garcia, spokesman for the Magdalena
Contreras precinct where the deaths occured.
	   The first death came when a house was swept away by a mudslide,
killing a 13-year-old girl and injuring her two brothers and
mother. One of the injured boys was evacuated by helicopter to a
hospital in the city's center, after he was nearly choked by the
mud.
	   Another family of four in a nearby neighborhood was buried in
their home when mud came streaming down on top of it. Two
teen-agers were pulled from the house alive by local police, but
their parents died, apparently of suffocation.
	   Two other people were killed when a muddy hillside collapsed on
top of a containment wall, crushing their house, local media
reported. However, Garcia said his office could confirm only three
deaths.
	   Garcia said a shelter had been established at a local gymnasium
to house 700 residents threatened by mudslides, but that no one had
yet gone there.
	   Some neighborhoods in a low-lying former lake bed to the east of
Mexico City have been flooded for days, and to the west, the Lerma
river overflowed its banks and left some villages inundated in
sewage.
	   Mexico City's main highway to the western part of the country
was also blocked Monday by a mudslide. Rains are expected to
continue here, the National Meteorological service predicted.
	   The television network Televisa reported that one child and one
adult had been swept away by swollen rivers in neighboring Puebla
state and were feared drowned Sunday. State officials were
unavailable to comment on that report.
	   Elsewhere in the country, the rains caused rivers to overflow in
the southern state of Chiapas, hit by flooding earlier this month
that killed 185 people and left thousands of towns and villages cut
off from the outside world.
	   Two temporary bridges built to replace ones destroyed in that
flooding were washed away again Sunday, local media reported.

	   ROME (AP) _ Mario Pescante resigned Monday as president of the
Italian National Olympic Committee amid a scandal over testing for
banned, performance-enhancing substances.
	   Pescante had come under growing criticism from sports and
government officials after news reports that some required doping
tests were not being conducted properly.
	   ``I've made this decision to restore calm to the atmosphere and
not because I believe I have responsibility,'' Pescante said in
announcing his resignation.
	   The committee oversees all sports _ amateur and professional _
in Italy. As head of the committee, Pescante became a target for
blame when Italian media reported that sports authorities were
failing to run all the required doping tests on pro soccer league
players.
	   Pescante has served as president of the committee since June
1993. His resignation is to become official after an Oct. 13
meeting of sports officials.
	   This year has seen a series of investigations into alleged
doping by Italian athletes. The probes were prompted by comments
from AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman, who said he was amazed by the
quick muscular development of some players.
	   One investigation, for the Italian Olympic Committee's doping
commission, ended in August without finding evidence of illegal
drug use, but did find that the use of legal muscle-builders is
widespread.

Bin Laden suspect arrested in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A suspected member of Osama bin Laden's terrorist
organization was arrested in London on an extradition warrant from
the United States and appeared in court Monday.
	   The police extradition squad arrested Khalid al Fawwaz, 36, at
his north London home late Sunday afternoon, Scotland Yard police
headquarters said. His nationality was not given.
	   The warrant alleges that al Fawwaz conspired with bin Laden to
murder citizens of the United States between Jan. 1, 1993 and Sept.
27, 1998 in the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court in New
York.
	   No further details of the allegations were available.
	   Al Fawwaz made a five-minute appearance Monday at Bow Street
Magistrates Court, under increased security.
	   Throughout the hearing, the black bearded, stockily built al
Fawwaz sat in the dock showing no emotion.
	   He was ordered to appear again Oct. 5 at the Belmarsh
Magistrates Court in south London for further extradition
proceedings.
	   Police said he was an influential figure in Al Qaeda, the
organization of bin Laden, the Saudi exile wanted by U.S.
authorities for allegedly coordinating simultaneous attacks on
American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The Aug. 7 blasts killed 259 people, including 12 Americans, and
wounded thousands.
	   A grand jury in New York has been investigating bin Laden in
other terrorist plots or attacks, including the World Trade Center
bombing Feb. 26, 1993, which killed six people and injured more
than 1,000 others.
	   A grand jury was convened after 19 U.S. service personnel were
killed when a bomb exploded in June 1996 at a military apartment
complex in Saudi Arabia. There were suspicions that bin Laden was
tied to it.

Baylor fired as Rockies manager
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Don Baylor, the only manager the Colorado Rockies
have had since they began play in 1993, was fired Monday in the
start of an offseason shakeup following a disappointing 77-85 year.
	   ``After a long, thorough and very difficult evaluation, we feel
a change in chemistry is necessary on the field and in the
clubhouse,'' team owner Jerry McMorris said.
	   Baylor was offered a front-office job, but he did not
immediately decide to accept it.
	   Both Baylor and Bob Gebhard, the general manager since the
Rockies began, have been criticized all year following an
eight-game losing streak in early April that dropped the team out
of contention.
	   While Baylor will not return to the dugout, Gebhard will be back
in the front office. McMorris said the team would create another
vice president's post with broad player personnel responsibilities.
	   After the Rockies came from behind to defeat San Francisco 9-8
on Sunday, Baylor sounded as if he expected to be fired. ``I think
it's probably 50-50,'' he said. ``I'll just have to sit back and
wait to see what they do.
	   ``I can live with what I've done here in six years. This was a
tough year, but everybody has always played hard for me. They could
have packed it in after the first two weeks of the season, but they
didn't. They never showed me that the effort wasn't there,'' he
said.
	   Among those reportedly being considered to replace Baylor are
Jim Leyland of the Florida Marlins and Felipe Alou of Montreal. In
addition, Art Howe may lose his job with the Oakland Athletics and
become a candidate in Colorado.
	   After their final game of the season, Rockies players supported
their manager.
	   Larry Walker, who won the National League batting title, said,
``Don Baylor is a great individual. He's made some mistakes, but
everybody sees how managers make mistakes. I enjoy playing for him.
I'd play for him any day. I went out there and played hard for him,
and there have been other managers that maybe I haven't played as
hard for.''

Protests by Israeli Arabs widen in scope

	   UMM AL FAHM, Israel (AP) _ In an escalating battle over land,
Israeli police fired rubber bullets for a second day Monday to
break up stone-throwing riots by Israeli Arab teen-agers and Arab
legislators called a general strike.
	   The clashes in Umm al Fahm, the largest Arab town in Israel,
were the most violent in recent years. Scenes of teen-agers hurling
stones from slingshots and burning tires were reminiscent of the
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   The intensity of the anger raised the question of whether the
protests would spread. Israel's 1 million Arab citizens, who make
up 20 percent of the population, have long complained of
discrimination at the hands of successive Israeli governments. The
confiscation of Arab land is an especially sore point.
	   In August, a report prepared by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office recommended treating Israel's Arab citizens as a
strategic threat.
	   A general strike was set for Tuesday in Arab towns and villages
throughout Israel, with schools, businesses and municipal offices
to shut down. A strike was observed Monday in Umm al Fahm.
	   Legislator Abdel Wahab Darawshe of the Arab Democratic Party
warned that protests would spread unless the government changed its
policies. ``The government has pushed the Arab population against a
wall, so this was the beginning of a larger flare-up,'' he said.
	   The protests began Sunday when Israeli police dismantled a tent
set up to protest the exproriation of a 125-acre (50-hectare) olive
grove that is to be used for a military firing range. Israeli
authorities said the land owner was being compensated with about
six times as much land elsewhere.
	   In riots that lasted into the night Sunday, about 50 Umm al-Fahm
residents and 15 police officers were injured.
	   Clashes resumed Monday, with groups of Umm al-Fahm youths
throwing stones at police who responded with tear gas and rubber
bullets. At least five protesters were injured and four arrested.

Le Pen begins appeal against political ban

Verdict in November; FIXES to show Versailles west of Paris &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VERSAILLES, Paris (AP) _ Far-right National Front leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen on Monday began his appeal against a two-year
political ban for physically attacking a Socialist politician,
claiming the incident was a setup.
	   Addressing the court, Le Pen denied attacking anyone at the May
30, 1997, election rally in the working class town of
Mantes-La-Jolie west of Paris.
	   A court has convicted the 70-year-old leader of attacking
Annette Peulvast-Bergeal, a parliamentary candidate running against
Le Pen's daughter, Marie-Caroline. Le Pen was on hand to support
his daughter's candidacy.
	   ``There was no pushing against Madame Peulvast-Bergeal,'' Le Pen
told the court. Instead, he said, he and National Front members are
``harrassed endlessly.''
	   ``They didn't want Jean-Marie Le Pen to shake hands. They came
looking for a confrontation,'' he said of the crowd.
	   The hearing at the appeals court in Versailles, west of Paris,
was expected to last two days with the verdict due Nov. 17. Dozens
of supporters, some holding banners saying ``Justice for Le Pen,''
and ``Le Pen targeted, the French hit,'' stood outside the
courtroom.
	   Le Pen's lawyer, Georges Wagner, alleged that Peulvast-Bergeal
had hurt her leg two weeks earlier and ``hid'' that from the court
at the time.
	   She ``tried to blame her injuries on Jean-Marie Le Pen,'' the
attorney said, adding that he is filing a complaint against her for
``fraud in judgment.''
	   On Wednesday, the court is to view television footage of the
scuffle.
	   A court stripped Le Pen of his civil rights for two years, in
effect banning him from holding office, running for office, or
voting in that time. He was also fined 20,000 francs (dlrs 3,333).
	   If upheld, the conviction would make Le Pen ineligible to run in
the June 1999 European Parliament elections. He has said that in
that case his wife, Jany, would run in his place.
	   The National Front, which has won about 15 percent in recent
elections, blames immigrants, particularly from North Africa, for
high unemployment and rising urban violence. It has also been
accused of anti-Semitism.
	   On Sunday, it suffered a setback, losing its only remaining
parliamentary seat in a by-election in the southern port city of
Toulon. But it remains a powerful force at regional level.
	   Le Pen holds a seat in the European Parliament and is a regional
counselor in the Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur region of southern
France.

Battered Brazil hopes for relief at IMF meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Battered by a never-ending Asian
crisis, Brazil is looking for some good news this week at the
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington
D.C.
	   The government's economic team heads to Washington on Tuesday
amid rumors that a major loan package is in the works to avert a
possibly disastrous devaluation of the Brazilian real.
	   One estimate puts the loan package for Brazil at dlrs 30
billion. Another says dlrs 50 billion will be earmarked for all of
Latin America.
	   But after a costly bailout for Russia, it's not clear how much
the IMF can come up with, or whether the Group of Seven
industrialized countries will pitch in.
	   Also uncertain is what terms Brazil will accept to get the
money, and how much more belt-tightening it can exact with a
stagnant economy, record unemployment, and national elections days
away.
	   As much as the cash itself, Brazil needs the credibility that
would come with a mega-loan.
	   With the world's ninth-largest economy, Brazil is in trouble
mainly because of its huge budget deficit: nearly dlrs 60 billion,
more than 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
	   As the Asian market turmoil sent investors scurrying to safer
havens, it looked harder for Brazil to get financing for its
deficit. An estimated dlrs 25 billion left the country in two
months. Cash reserves, which reached a record dlrs 74 billion in
April, had shrunk to dlrs 49 billion by mid-September.
	   It got so bad that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is
up for re-election on Sunday, went on television to give a speech
that was a candidate's nightmare.
	   The government will cut spending to the bone, he said. If that's
not enough, it may raise taxes.
	   The speech got high marks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin. IMF chief Michel Camdessus said the Fund was prepared to
help, if Brazil presents a ``strong and credible'' program.
	   Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development
Bank, said Cardoso's speech ``opens the door for contingency lines
of credit ... if the government asks for them.''
	   That seems unlikely, especially before elections.
	   The IMF is believed to have between dlrs 5 billion and dlrs 9
billion in normal capital plus about dlrs 15 billion in the special
credit line known as General Arrangements to Borrow. More might be
needed from private lenders or even the Federal Reserve.
	   Some analysts think even money alone won't be enough without a
devaluation of the real, which would boost exports and allow the
government to reduce interest rates, now a scorching 49.75 percent.
	   But Brazil may be too important to go under. U.S. banks have an
estimated dlrs 27 billion in this country, more than quadruple
their exposure in Russia. And a tumble by Latin America's biggest
domino would almost surely take much of the region with it.

 &UR; New study traces arrival of first Chinese &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Modern humans, then a relatively new species
from Africa just beginning to explore the world, moved into south
China some 60,000 years ago and later into northern Asia, according
to new genetic studies.
	   The research supports the idea that modern humans evolved in
Africa and then moved from that continent to Europe, Asia and
eventually to the Americas. A report on the study appears Friday in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
	   ``Our work shows that modern humans first came to southeast Asia
and then moved later to northern China,'' said Li Jin, a population
geneticist at the University of Texas, Houston. ``This supports the
idea that modern humans originated in Africa.''
	   Jin said the study is based on the analysis of the gene pattern
from 43 different ethnic groups in China and Asia. This technique
enables the researchers to trace the migration of related groups.
He said it gives an indication of how peoples moved and mixed over
thousands of generations.
	   The migration clues are carried in genetic patterns, called
microsatellites, that change rapidly over time. By analyzing these
changes and linking them to earlier genetic patterns, researchers
are able to plot the migration of ancient humans.
	   Based on the research, Jin said it appears that modern humans
first moved from central Asia, following the Indian Ocean coastline
across India, to southeast Asia. Later, they moved to south China.
Descendants of these original Chinese then migrated north and
northwest, populating northern China, Siberia, and, eventually, the
Americas.
	   ``This is important research because it supports the
out-of-Africa theory about the origin of modern humans,'' said
Ranjan Deka, a population genetics researcher at the University of
Cinncinnati.
	   Deka said the results of the study weakens an alternate theory
that modern human arose independently on different continents at
about the same time. If this were true, he said, there was be
little or no genetic continuity among the various populations of
the world.
	   Instead, said Deka, the findings by Jin and his colleagues show
there was genetic continuity in China, even though that vast
country has dozens of different ethnic populations and more than
200 different languages.
	   Jin said that he believes modern humans arrived in China about
60,000 years ago. He said the migration into Asia was probably
affected by the glaciers that invaded much of the northern parts of
the world during an ice age that lasted thousands of years.
	   He said it may have been only after the glaciers retreated, more
than 15,000 years ago, that modern humans were able to migrate to
far northern Asia and across the Bering Strait to the Americas.

U.S. designer Betsey Johnson in London Fashion Week debut

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ To pounding rap and swirling Latino rhythms, New
York designer Betsey Johnson made her London Fashion Week debut
Monday with a colorful collection whose exotic touches drew gasps
from her audience.
	   Johnson's designs for the spring and summer of 1999 mixed Latino
influences with New York attitude: tulle skirts in hot yellow,
lilac and green, pink and blue baby doll minidresses with stretch
cotton black bandeaus.
	   Some of the large contingent of photographers drawn by Johnson's
reputation for daring jeered as three male models sporting skimpy
pants with revealing cutouts on the buttocks sashayed down the
catwalk.
	   British model Erin O'Connor was stunning in a gothic outfit from
Johnson's Morticia Line (named for the mother in the Addams Family)
_ skin tight red trousers and bra scattered with black spiders.
	   The grand finale was a black Spanish wedding outfit with a long
inky gauze veil that flowed to the floor from a traditional Spanish
headdress.
	   To end of the show, Johnson danced down the ramp in a bright
pink tutu, before executing her trademark cartwheel.
	   Married to a Briton, she opened her first store outside the
United States in London's tony Chelsea neighborhood earlier this
year.
	   She is one of more than 50 designers who are holding catwalk
shows during the five days of London Fashion Week, which made an
upbeat start Friday with news that the government plans a
conference in November to boost British designers' earning power.
	   In contrast to 1993, when just 15 exhibitors showed their
accessories, some 140 others are showing shoes, bags, scarves and
other fashion items at the Natural History Museum, headquarters of
Fashion Week.
	   Also Monday, British designer Bella Freud showed tailored suits
reminiscent of the 1980s, but with a sharp modern edge.
	   Ms. Freud, who is known for her sexy silhouettes, said she drew
her inspiration from the feline beauty of model and singer Grave
Jones and the kind of pants suits favored by model turned activist
Bianca Jagger.
	   Dresses featured geometric stripes and the ruffles seen at many
of this season's shows; three-quarter length trousers were teamed
with strappy mules.
	   Model Jodie Kidd provided the high point, wearing a sheer body
sheath splashed with irregular patches of color _ a tribute to the
work of the painter Matisse, Ms. Freud said.
	   Newcomer Andrew Groves, whose fabrics have included surgical
latex and who once introduced a swarm of wasps to a show, will show
his work Tuesday, the final day of London Fashion Week.
	   The first British Fashion Designer Conference will be held in
London on Nov. 25. Sponsored by the Labor Party government and the
British Fashion Council, it will look at designers' access to
finance, their relationship with manufacturers and how they can
develop new products.
	   The British Fashion Council says the country's fashion industry
is now worth more than 16 billion pounds (dlrs 27 billion) a year
and employs some 350,000 people.

Two reformers fired from cabinet, new economic package due in 10

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to market-oriented economic reforms, the
country's tough-talking tax chief was fired Monday, the last step
in a purge that leaves only one of the previous cabinet's young
reformers remaining in the government.
	   Boris Fyodorov, who strongly supported economic reform and
opposed printing money, had promised to get tough on tax deadbeats
in an effort to fill the country's empty coffers. Also dumped was
acting deputy prime minister Viktor Khristenko, who advocated
tightening control over government spending and cutting down waste.
	   The firings were announced during a meeting between Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and President Boris Yeltsin aimed at
completing a new cabinet, a process that has already taken three
weeks.
	   Late Monday, First Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov said the
formation of the government was complete with the appointment of
Ramazan Abdulatipov as nationalities minister. It's not clear
whether either of the fired ministers would be replaced.
	   Fyodorov's dismissal leaves Mikhail Zadornov, whom Yeltsin
reappointed to the post of finance minister on Friday, as the most
outspoken proponent of reform. But he is linked with the previous
Cabinet's decision on Aug. 17 to devalue the ruble and freeze
domestic debt _ a controversial move that many blame for fueling
Russia's crisis.
	   Primakov also announced at the meeting that the government had
paid off back wages to the military, and was planning to pay off
debts for student stipends, though he didn't say where the money
had come from. It is unclear exactly how much of the wages were
paid off.
	   Primakov has made the payment of back wages one of the key goals
of his program to fight the country's punishing financial crisis.
	   In an effort to quell impatience at the absence of a detailed
crisis plan, the government will unveil the complete program in 10
days, Gustov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Government officials repeated Monday that the plan would include
greater state control, and would be ``aimed at protection of the
domestic producer, reforming of the tax system so that producers
feel an easing of the tax burden,'' Economics Minister Andrei
Shapovalyants said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Central Bank also has approved regulations to control
securities markets and limit the flow of cash abroad, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Dmitry Vasilyev, the head of the Federal Commission on
Securities and Capital Markets, who resigned last week in protest
of the government's unfair treatment of foreign investors, warned
that the tighter controls, as well as rumored plans to nationalize
some banks and industrial enterprises, are ``recipes from the old
Soviet past.''
	   But Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko countered these
claims, calling a return to a more nationalized banking system the
``the wrong way to go,'' Interfax said.
	   A government team is to meet Tuesday with representatives of
Russian and foreign banks that suffered multi-billion dollar losses
when the old Cabinet defaulted on its debt on treasury bills.
	   Several previous meetings have brought no result, and foreign
investors have assailed the government for favoring Russian banks.
	   In other economic news:
	   _ Russia's Oneximbank has filed suit against Lehman Brothers
Holding Inc., accusing the group of not fulfilling its obligations
to the bank. Oneximbank did not specify what the obligations were.
Last week, Lehman Brothers froze Oneximbank's assets in the United
Kingdom in punishment for defaulting on some debts.
	   _ The Russian ruble on Monday remained stable, with banks
trading it at around 16 to the dollar _ the same level as last
week. The Russian currency stood at around 6 rubles a dollar before
the crisis. And the stock market closed lower in very light trading
Monday, down 1.8 percent to 46.24 points.
	   _ Revenues from privatization amounted to 1.3 billion rubles
(dlrs 87 million) in January-August, only 16 percent of the 8.12
billion rubles (dlrs 541 million) planned for this year.

Yemeni troops conduct maneuvers near Saudi border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen on Monday completed a week of military
maneuvers near the Saudi border, state television said.
	   Air force squadrons, artillery and infantry units participated
in the war games, code named Victory-2, in Saywun, in the
southeastern Hadramawt province, about 300 kilometers (187 miles)
south of the Saudi border.
	   Troops made simulated air attacks on imaginary enemy targets,
the television broadcast said.
	   It said the maneuvers began early last week.
	   Fighting has occasionally erupted along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier between Yemen and Saudi Arabia over a
decades-old border dispute.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields. The two nations have yet to demarcate a mountainous border
in the east.
	   In 1995, Saudi Arabia sent 20,000 troops and hundreds of tanks
across the border before Syrian mediation secured a cease-fire and
an eventual withdrawal.
	   The maneuvers are Yemen's second such exercises this year.

Renowned solo violinist to play Beethoven concert in Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Devoting a one-year, round-the-world tour to the
works of just one composer doesn't get boring, renowned solo
violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter said Monday _ if that composer is
Beethoven.
	   The German-born musician takes her Beethoven's sonatas tour to
Milan's Teatro alla Scala on Oct. 8.
	   ``Beethoven's sonatas are so diverse and stretch over such a
long period; it gives you a panoramic view,'' Mutter said Monday at
a news conference on her tour.
	   Compared to standard tours featuring a few works by several
composers, ``This has emancipated the violin,'' she said.
	   The concert in Milan will feature three sonatas spanning 15
years, reflecting Mutter's intentions of showing the changes in
Beethoven's methods and moods over his life.
	   Mutter is performing with pianist Lambert Orkis.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Socialist Premier Fatos Nano
resigned Monday, some two weeks after rioting in the wake of a

	   Nano's resignation was announced after a meeting of the

	   A statement said that Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old

	   The resignation came two days after former Albanian President
Sali Berisha promised thousands of supporters that street protests
would continue until the government steps down.
	   Speaking in the capital before a crowd of about 3,000 people,
Berisha called Nano a ``killer,'' and blamed him for the current
political turmoil.
	   The unrest in Europe's poorest country erupted after a popular
opposition leader was killed outside Berisha's Democratic Party
headquarters on September 12. Berisha blamed his political rival
Nano for the killing and demanded his resignation.

211-year-old Marylebone Cricket Clubs votes to admit women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After 211 years of keeping them out, the world's
oldest cricket club voted Monday to admit women.
	   The Marylebone Cricket Club, whose membership includes former
British prime minister John Major and the Rolling Stone's Mick
Jagger, voted 69.8 percent in favor of the move, meeting the
required two-thirds majority.
	   Earlier this year a majority _ 55.7 percent _ voted to admit
women, falling short of the required two-thirds.
	   The vote was 9,394 in favor and 4,072 against.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' said MCC President Colin
Ingleby-Mackenzie. ``It is great news for cricket and the club.''
	   ``From a personal point of view it gives my presidency a lift
two days before I stand down from office.''
	   The moves also opens the way for the club at Lord's in West
London to receive funds from Britain's national lottery, which some
observers suggested was a reason for the historic change in a
highly tradition-bound sport.
	   Of the 17,250 members, 13,482 voted with 16 ballots declared
void.
	   ``I'm highly delighted,'' said Barbara Daniels, vice-captain of
the England women's team. ``I am very pleased that the MCC has
taken this step and we all now carry on, now that this is over, and

Aziz says Baghdad won't make concessions over arms stalemate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes, council appearing to
reject any review without Iraqi compliance, UN spokesman saying
Aziz showed a less hard-line side during meeting. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Insisting that Baghdad will not make
concessions to end the standoff over U.N. arms inspections, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Monday that the U.N. Security
Council should make the first move.
	   Aziz responded positively to Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
proposal for a comprehensive review of sanctions and Iraq's efforts
over seven years to disarm itself. But he balked at the council's
insistence that no such review take place until Iraq rescinds its
Aug. 5 decision to stop cooperating with U.N. inspectors.
	   ``The idea that Iraq should do this or that concession before
the comprehensive review takes place is not legal,'' Aziz said.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Iraq claims it has fully
disarmed.
	   Aziz said even after its Aug. 5 decision, Iraq was cooperating
with inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, who
are conducting long-term, less intrusive monitoring of already
searched sites.
	   ``What we are not allowing them to do is just provocations,'' he
said.
	   Aziz spoke to reporters after an hourlong meeting with Annan on
the standoff and the U.N. chief's proposal of a ``comprehensive
review'' to break the logjam. He welcomed the U.N. chief's
proposal, calling the session professional, cordial and
constructive.
	   A U.N. spokesman said, however, that Annan told Aziz that Iraq
must make the first move and reverse the Aug. 5 decision to freeze
cooperation with weapons inspectors before a comprehensive review
can get under way.
	   ``The position of the council is clear and the secretary-general
cannot go above what the council has decided,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He made that point clearly to
Mr. Aziz.''
	   The U.N. spokesman said Aziz showed a less hard-line side during
the meeting with Annan.
	   ``Aziz didn't give a clear sign of whether Iraq would let UNSCOM
resume its inspections prior to such a review,'' he said.
	   Pressed by reporters afterwards on this question, Aziz refused
to say yes or no.
	   The Iraqi minister insisted that his country has already
complied fully with U.N. resolutions demanding that it destroy its
banned weapons. And he said the council has ``a legal and moral
obligation'' to carry out a comprehensive review.
	   ``I would like to say that the idea of a comprehensive review is
not a reward to be given to Iraq and then Iraq has to make
concessions before such a review takes place,'' Aziz told
reporters.
	   He said the focus should shift to the wider issue of what Iraq
has done over the past 7 1/2 years to comply ``and what the
Security Council has to do in the course of lifting sanctions.''
	   But council members appeared adamant that there would be no
review without Iraqi compliance with the weapons inspectors.
	   ``We hope that the Iraqi side realizes that it's very important
to resume cooperation with UNSCOM,'' said Shen Guofang, China's
deputy ambassador.
	   China, France and Russia are Baghdad's strongest allies on the
council while the United States and Britain typically take a harder
line.
	   Hans Dahlgren, Sweden's ambassador and the current council
president, said: ``I believe it's both legal and logical to ask
Iraq to cooperate first and then to take the comprehensive
review.''
	   Aziz said he would to meet with council members during the
course of the week, apparently testing their willingness to give
some indication of when sanctions would be lifted. He also planned
another meeting with Annan.

	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital city. But it was
not clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of his archrival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Nano stepped down Monday after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas.
	   He did not manage to restructure the government because he
failed to reach agreement with all coalition parties on the makeup
of the new government, sources said.
	   More importantly, Nano has failed to institute key economic
reforms, attract foreign investors and instill in Albanians hope
for a better future.
	   What also stymied his government was the worsening enmity
between his Socialists and Berisha's Democrats who kept calling for
his resignation and boycotted parliament most of the time.
	   Political tensions reached fever pitch with the assassination by
unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate on
Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office and other government buildings. Several people were
killed in pitched battled with police.

Security Council discusses resolution on Sudan bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council held preliminary
discussions Monday on an Arab-sponsored draft resolution demanding
a U.N. investigation into U.S. claims that a Sudanese factory it
bombed last month was making chemical weapons.
	   Council president Hans Dahlgren of Sweden said he had received a
letter from Lebanese Ambassador Samir Moubarak, the current head of
the informal group of Arab states, known as the Arab Group, with a
copy of the draft resolution in it.
	   ``But the conclusion of today's discussion was that
consultations will continue among members,'' Dahlgren said.
	   The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary
because U.S. intelligence showed the plant produced chemical
weapons. U.S. officials have cited a soil sample taken from the
grounds of the complex that they say contained Empta, a precursor
chemical for the deadly nerve agent VX.
	   Washington says the El Shifa plant was also linked to Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials suspect in last
month's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa. Sudan says the plant
produced medicines and veterinary drugs.
	   Sudan requested an investigation into the U.S. claims
immediately after the Aug. 20 attack, but the council shelved the
matter after initial discussions.
	   Arab ambassadors launched the resolution earlier this month
after the Arab League condemned the bombing as an ``act of
aggression against Sudan, a dangerous violation of its sovereignty
and territory, and a violation of international law.''
	   Since the Aug. 20 attack, U.S. officials have been briefing
Security Council members about the evidence they say they had to
justify the bombing.

	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ An illiterate mother of three who
mobilized hundreds of women to improve roads, drains, quality of
drinking water and education in her southern Indian village has won
this year's ``Race against Poverty'' award, the United Nations
announced Monday.
	   Fatima Bi, who wears the all enveloping Islamic veil or burqa,
will go to New York to receive the award Oct. 17 from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on International Poverty Eradication
Day. The U.N. Development Program, which gives the award, made the
announcement Monday.
	   	   Fatima Bi was chosen from among a nominees in South Asia where
the UNDP funds small-scale health, education and building programs
to help eradicate poverty at the village level, said Brende Gael
McSweeney, the program's resident representative in India.
	   Overcoming illiteracy and restricted roles for women, Fatima Bi
and her villagers raised rupees two million (dlrs 47,600) for small
loans to let villagers improve their economic situation. Part of
the money came from the savings of 300 village women, the rest from
the UNDP, a bank and a private non-government organization.
	   ``This is a great honor not only for me but for the entire
village,'' she said. ``Whatever development we have in this
village, it is because of the united efforts of all the women in
the village.''
	   Fatima Bi, who uses the term of respect ``Bi'' instead of her
last name, was elected head of Kalva village, 1500 kilometers (900
miles) south of the Indian capital, New Delhi, in 1995. She
benefited from an Indian law that reserves a third of seats in
local governments for women.
	   The UNDP did not say if the award carries extra funding for the
winner's project.

United after third straight title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With its two league titles and a CONCACAF
Champions Cup already in its trophy case, D.C United is the
acknowledged class of U.S. Major League Soccer.
	   Yet in a 3-year-old league where inconsistency regularly marks
games, upsets _ especially in the playoffs _ wouldn't be shocking.
	   Last year, Colorado struggled, losing six of its last seven,
qualified last in the Western Conference, then won four straight in
the playoffs to make the MLS Cup title game.
	   With the playoffs starting Wednesday night, and only three of
the eight teams entering with winning records, many wonder who will
be this year's Colorado.
	   ``D.C. United, when it's all said done, are still the
favorites,'' said Bob Bradley, coach of the Chicago Fire (20-12),
who open their Western Conference semifinal series against Colorado
(16-16) in Soldier Field on Thursday. ``They set the standard. I
think Los Angeles had a tremendous year. And there are a number of
other teams. They all had stretches to show they can play very good
soccer.
	   ``I think D.C. and L.A. are two teams you put a little higher
than the rest. But Colorado is a perfect example. They actually
struggled last year to make playoffs. But they got a result, some
confidence, a run starts. It's a perfect example of what can happen
in the game of soccer.''
	   Both expansion clubs qualified for the playoffs in their first
season, albeit via different roads.
	   Bradley righted his team from a 2-5 start and led it to the
third-best record in the league.
	   Miami (15-17), conversely, needed a coaching change midway
through the season. After Ivo Wortmann replaced Cacho Cordoba on
July 24, the Fusion more than doubled their goal production over
the final 13 games, finished 7-6 and even split the season series
with United.
	   The Fusion will open their best-of-3 series Wednesday night at
Washington.
	   Columbus (15-17) is home to New York-New Jersey (15-17) in the
other game Wednesday night. Los Angeles (24-8) takes on Dallas
(15-17) in the Rose Bowl to start the final Western Conference
series Thursday night.
	   Despite its 24-8 season, the United did not have an easy time
with Miami, even losing their last meeting 3-1 in RFK Stadium.
	   ``They put their whole team back behind the ball,'' Arena said.
``They defend on a full-time basis. They win by breaking the
passing lanes and counter-attacking.''
	   For an attack-minded team like D.C., it can be frustrating.
	   ``Maybe it was a good thing, losing to Miami,'' United
midfielder John Harkes said. ``It's a little kick in the butt,
makes us focus.''
	   Columbus first-year forward Stern John of Trinidad won the
league scoring title with 26 goals in 27 games. But the Crew have
lost their last five, and perhaps their only saving grace is that
the MetroStars (15-17) are playing even worse.
	   The Metros lost six straight before Saturday's shootout victory
over lowly New England (and that after a 0-0 draw).
	   New York-New Jersey is pinning its hopes on Bora Milutinovic,
soccer's itinerant coach who was hired last week to work his latest
``miracle.''
	   Los Angeles and Chicago dominated the West and managed to get a
grudge rivalry going thanks to Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano's
comments early in the season that the Fire were a defense-only
team.
	   The Galaxy won Sunday's finale over the Fire 1-0 on an
87th-minute goal by Cobi Jones in the Rose Bowl, the site of the
MLS Cup championship on Oct. 25.
	   Los Angeles won the season series with Dallas 3-1, as did the
Fire over Colorado.
	   ``We're hoping they take us lightly,'' Colorado captain Marcelo
Balboa said. ``It's a crapshoot. If Chicago comes out slow, we come
out fast, it could be like last year.''

expire on May 4, ``and our people demand of us to shoulder our
responsibilities and they await the establishment of their

	   ``This independent Palestinian state must be established as an

	   Arafat was delivering the speech after returning from
Washington, where he held a last-minute summit with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.

211-year-old Marylebone Cricket Club votes to admit women
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes; opposition quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ After 211 years of keeping them out, the world's
oldest cricket club voted Monday to admit women.
	   The Marylebone Cricket Club, whose membership includes former
British prime minister John Major and the Rolling Stone's Mick
Jagger, voted 69.8 percent in favor of the move, meeting the
required two-thirds majority.
	   Earlier this year a majority _ 55.7 percent _ voted to admit
women, falling short of the required two-thirds.
	   The vote was 9,394 in favor and 4,072 against.
	   ``I am absolutely delighted,'' said MCC President Colin
Ingleby-Mackenzie. ``It is great news for cricket and the club.''
	   ``From a personal point of view it gives my presidency a lift
two days before I stand down from office.''
	   The moves also opens the way for the club at Lord's in West
London to receive funds from Britain's national lottery, which some
observers suggested was a reason for the historic change in a
highly tradition-bound sport.
	   Of the 17,250 members, 13,482 voted with 16 ballots declared
void.
	   ``I'm highly delighted,'' said Barbara Daniels, vice-captain of
the England women's team. ``I am very pleased that the MCC has
taken this step and we all now carry on, now that this is over, and
get on with promoting the game.''
	   There was, however, hard-core opposition. One member, Robert
Titchener-Barratt, said the proposition was shoved down the club's
throat.
	   ``The committee have acted with arrogance and self-importance
saying `we're going to push this through whether you members like
it or not','' he said. ``The president has set his heart on making
this the crowning glory of his time in office.''
	   Other speakers at Monday's meeting, where the vote was
announced, said the move was pushed through like ``propagandists in
a communist state.''

Report clears Dutch military of Bosnia cover-up

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ An independent inquiry Monday
cleared the Dutch military of trying to cover up its troops'
failings in the 1995 fall of the Bosnian Muslim enclave of
Srebrenica.
	   But the inquiry, ordered last month by Defense Minister Frank de
Grave, did find ``many shortcomings and much carelessness in the
information process'' following one of the worst debacles in Dutch
military history.
	   Charged by the United Nations with protecting Srebrenica, a
group of 300 Dutch soldiers could only look on helplessly as rebel
Serbs overran the area in July 1995.
	   More than 6,000 Muslims are believed to have been massacred in
the aftermath of the takeover.
	   In the face of international criticism, Dutch top brass insisted
the troops were outnumbered, outgunned and barred by their U.N.
mandate from engaging in combat. They also claimed that NATO
airstrikes _ requested by the Dutch but not deployed at Srebrenica
_ could have saved the enclave.
	   Many Dutch peacekeepers were forced at gunpoint to hand over
their weapons to rebel Serbs. A Dutch current affairs show recently
claimed that Serb forces in Kosovo were using a Dutch tank stolen
from Srebrenica.
	   In the three years since the humiliation, Dutch media have
reported a string of other embarrassing incidents linked to the
Srebrenica fall.
	   In addition to the destruction of film said to show peacekeepers
helping Serbs separate Muslim men from women for deportation, Dutch
troops drove a tank through a crowd of fleeing Muslims, killing up
to 30. Four medics also say they were ordered not to treat wounded
Muslims.
	   Former peacekeepers themselves reported the incidents, and went
to the media because they believed military authorities were doing
nothing with their testimony.
	   Military prosecutors who did investigate said they saw no reason
to file criminal charges.
	   The peacekeepers' concerns and a growing public feeling that the
whole truth about Srebrenica was being withheld by authorities
prompted Defense Minister Frank de Grave to order the inquiry who
results were published Monday.
	   The inquiry's author, senior civil servant Jos van Kemenade, was
charged with investigating whether the lack of information was a
deliberate attempt to hide the truth.
	   After speaking to troops, former defense minister Joris
Voorhoeve, and other officials linked to the affair, Van Kemenade
said it was not.
	   ``There is no question of this being swept under the carpet,''
concluded Van Kemenade. ``But the gathering, distribution and use
of information about peacekeeping missions can, in possible future
operations, be considerably better than it was in this case.''
	   Defense Minister De Grave said he would study the report's
findings and make changes if necessary.
	   ``A minister can only work well if communication (within the
ministry) is good,'' he said. The now-retired general in charge of
the Dutch Army at the time of Srebrenica had no immediate comment.
	   The respected State Institute for War Documentation is also
compiling a definitive report on the fall of Srebrenica, based on
all available evidence. No date has been set for publication of its
report.

	   Arafat had said previously that he would use the General
Assembly speech to restate his intention to declare an independent
Palestinian state next year whether or not a final peace agreement
with Israel is in place.
	   Palestinian aides had said Arafat wanted to seek support of U.N.
member states, many of whom traditionally back the Palestinian
cause over Israeli interests.
	   Over the weekend, however, diplomatic sources said that Arafat
would tone the speech down in the wake of apparent movement in the
peace process with Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
	   But the prepared speech appeared to conform with Arafat's
original plans.
	   ``We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as has
always been the case in the decisive moments of the history, the
present and the future of our people,'' Arafat said in the text.
	   ``Help us to achieve the national goal of our people.''
	   Arafat's speech before the General Assembly has particular
significance: Never before has Arafat _ or any other Palestinian _
addressed the audience from the podium during the regular debate.
The Palestinian observer mission was granted that right earlier
this summer.
	   Arafat had been expected to address the morning session, but his
appearance was postponed to allow him to travel to Washington to
meet with Netanyahu and Clinton.

U.S. official spells out conditions for military aid to Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The U.S. is willing to give military aid
to Nigeria if the country's ruling army brass follows through on
promises to step down, hand over power to elected civilians and
crack down on drugs and corruption, a top Pentagon official said
Monday.
	   U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Franklin Kramer said in a
speech at Nigeria's National War College in the capital that
Washington is prepared to give ``training, education and other
cooperation on other particular military problems.''
	   However, military rulers in this oil-rich West African country
must first keep promises to allow free elections, and also
cooperate with the U.S. on ``meaningful'' measures against the
narcotics trade and government graft, Kramer said.
	   Military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has promised national
elections in February and a handover of power to the civilian
winners by the end of May.
	   ``Before we can initiate a new bilateral military relationship,
Nigeria must first complete the important tasks lying before it,''
Kramer said.
	   Details of the Nigerian military assistance package have not
been hashed out, Kramer said, adding that Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, will visit Nigeria next
week to begin several months of ``intensive dialogue'' with
military counterparts.
	   ``It is very important that the process go forward and democracy
in fact comes out of it. Then we will be very pleased to work with
the Nigerian military,'' Kramer said.
	   Kramer said the Pentagon was prepared to establish a new African
Center for African Security Studies next year to train African
military officers and promote better civilian-army relations.
	   Talks between Abubakar and U.S. officials on Monday had touched
on Nigeria possibly providing instructors and students for the
school, Kramer said.
	   Since taking power in June following the death of his
predecessor, the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Abubakar has
released dozens of political prisoners and announced government
reforms intended to reduce crime and steer the country towards
democracy.
	   ``We now see a timetable for elections, an independent electoral
commission, the formation of political parties and the release of
detainees,'' Kramer said. ``We can now visualize a future in which
Nigeria completes its transition to democracy, ensures basic human
rights and takes more concrete efforts to combat corruption and the
drug trade,'' Kramer said.
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been ruled by
military regimes for all but 10 years since independence from
Britain in 1960.
	   The country is a key drug transit point in Africa, and official
corruption under Abacha and earlier leaders has all but destroyed
the economic infrastructure and social services despite massive
petroleum sector earnings.
	   Kramer, who was accompanied by about eight other U.S. officials
on his arrival in Abuja on Sunday, was expected to return home on
Tuesday. He is the first ranking U.S. official to visit Nigeria
since Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering came in early
August.

Embattled Albanian premier resigns

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Socialist Premier Fatos Nano
resigned Monday, some two weeks after rioting over a politician's
assassination pushed the Balkan nation to the brink of anarchy.
	   Nano's resignation was announced Monday after a meeting of the
Socialist Party leadership in the Albanian capital, Tirana.
	   A statement said that Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old
general-secretary of the Socialist Party, would be the party's
candidate for prime minister.
	   The resignation came two days after former Albanian President
Sali Berisha promised thousands of supporters that street protests
would continue until the government steps down.
	   Speaking in the capital before a crowd of about 3,000 people,
Berisha called Nano a ``killer,'' and blamed him for the current
political turmoil.
	   The unrest in Europe's poorest country erupted after a popular
opposition leader was killed outside Berisha's Democratic Party
headquarters on September 12. Berisha blamed his political rival
Nano for the killing and demanded his resignation.
	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital. But it was not
clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of rival Berisha.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their entire savings.
	   Nano stepped down Monday after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas.
	   More important, Nano has failed to institute key economic
reforms, attract foreign investors and instill in Albanians hope
for a better future.
	   There is enmity between Nano's Socialists and Berisha's
Democrats who kept calling for his resignation and boycotted
parliament most of the time.
	   Political tensions reached fever pitch with the Sept. 12
assassination by unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close
Berisha associate.
	   The next day, angry protesters burned the first floor of the
building housing Nano's office as well as seven government cars
parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office and other government buildings. Several people were
killed in a battle with police.

Foreman vs. Holmes: a fight for the aged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ George Foreman has his 50th birthday party
planned: It will be at the Astrodome, Larry Holmes is invited and
there's going to be a fight.
	   The two heavyweight champions of yesteryear _ both grandfathers
_ met at the Dome on Monday to announce their Jan. 23 bout, billed
as the ``Birthday Bash.''
	   Foreman, fighting in his hometown, hits 50 on Jan. 10. Holmes
turns 49 on Nov. 3.
	   ``Usually, the doctors check a fighter's heart, but with Larry
and me, they're just going to see if we have a pulse,'' Foreman
said.
	   It will be the first fight in the Astrodome since November 1982
when Holmes defeated Randall ``Tex'' Cobb in a one-sided bout that
disgusted the late sportscaster Howard Cosell _ the last pro fight
he called.
	   Holmes (66-6) expects a better fight this time.
	   ``This will be a classic, it's history,'' he said. ``It's two
men who over the decades, never fought. Two men with lots of pride.
Two men will give it all and only one will win. I'm sure that it
will be me and George thinks it will be him.''
	   Foreman (76-5) ended 10 years of retirement in 1987 and became
the WBA champion Nov. 5, 1994 with a 10th-round knockout of Michael
Moorer.
	   Foreman was champion in 1973-74 before he lost his title to
Muhammad Ali Oct. 30, 1974. Holmes' championship career lasted from
1978-1985.
	   ``Larry Holmes was a second-rate fighter sparring for (Muhammad)
Ali when I had my original career,'' Foreman said. ``This is the
only time this fight could be made. This is the only time it is
important. It's going to be a good fight, a mental matchup.''
	   Holmes said he was glad to finally get in the ring with Foreman,
even if it meant coming to Foreman's hometown.
	   ``I said before that I'd fight in George's back yard if they'd
pay me enough money,'' Holmes said. ``Well, I guess the money is
enough because I am definitely in his backyard.''
	   Foreman reportedly will receive dlrs 10 million and Holmes dlrs
4 million.
	   At 99, the combined age of the fighters is believed to be the
highest in boxing history. Joe Bugner and former champion James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith totaled 93 years when Bugner, 48, won their
July 4 fight.
	   ``I don't care if we're 900 years old,'' Holmes said. ``You got
two old guys almost the same age that are going to fight. We might
not fight like young guys today, but are going to fight.''
	   Both fighters have been more active in private business than in
the ring, though each fights from time to time. Foreman's
blossoming career as a pitchman includes commercials for the
``George Foreman mean fat-reducing grilling machine.''
	   ``If they don't want to take it seriously, that's up to them,''
Holmes said. ``I'm taking it seriously. George is taking it
seriously. George doesn't want to stop doing hamburger
commercials.''

Critics wonder why music and soap operas played as hurricane hit

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Critics are wondering
why radio stations played music and TV ran soap operas while
Hurricane Georges pounded the Dominican Republic with deadly 110
mph (175 kph) winds.
	   Dominican officials are being blamed for discounting clear
information from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, and for
opening shelters only after the storm arrived.
	   ``When the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond,''
said Hugh Parmer, who is coordinating the Dominican relief effort
for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   The Dominican Republic is one of the Caribbean's poorest
countries, and the government's underfunded disaster relief agency
is ill-equipped. With more than 200 people killed and 100,000
homeless, the country hasn't seen a natural disaster of this
magnitude since Hurricane David in 1979.
	   Elsewhere in the Caribbean, storm victims took issue with the
responses of their governments to the disaster.
	   In Haiti, farmers in the central Artibonite Valley said
officials' failure to clear silt-clogged irrigation canals, despite
repeated warnings, contributed to deadly flooding. At least 94
Haitians were killed.
	   In Puerto Rico, where the hurricane killed three people and
caused more than dlrs 2 billion in damage, opposition leader Anibal
Acevedo accused the government of neglecting disaster relief in the
island's interior.
	   In all, Georges killed more than 300 people in its march across
the Caribbean.
	   In the Dominican Republic, newspaper editorials said both the
newly appointed civil defense chief, Elpidio Baez, and the head of
the National Meteorological Office, Felix Abreu, failed to issue
warnings under the pretext of not wanting to alarm the population.
	   Officials insist they thought the storm would hit farther north
than it did on Sept. 22, and that they believed evacuations would
only be necessary in the northeastern region of Samana.
	   ``This is a natural phenomenon, and unfortunately every time
these things happen, some people want to look for a guilty party,''
said the armed forces chief, Adm. Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
	   A specialist in the meteorological office, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said he warned his
bosses of Georges' potential for devastation 72 hours before it
hit.
	   One forecaster at the office defied his bosses' orders and
broadcast a warning the day before the storm, but the message
failed to reach most Dominicans.
	   Most Dominican victims died in flooding or mudslides;
substandard homes proved no match for the hurricane's destructive
power and the raging rivers it flooded.
	   Relief efforts continued throughout the Caribbean on Monday. The
United States sent tons of bottled water and thousands of plastic
tarps to provide roofs for 20,000 Dominican homes. Washington also
gave the Dominican Republic 20,000 pounds of food and medicine.
	   Peace Corps volunteers used rented aircraft to drop food in
areas inaccessible by road. The New York City Fire Department sent
63 search and rescue experts with four dog teams.
	   Nineteen U.S. disaster relief experts arrived in Santo Domingo
from Puerto Rico, which was struggling to clean up its own mess
Monday.
	   U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to arrive in Puerto
Rico on Tuesday to survey Georges' damage and visit one of the 232
shelters housing more than 17,000 people left homeless by the
hurricane.

Two Israeli youths convicted in killing of Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli youths were convicted Monday of
killing a Palestinian pedestrian by striking him across the back of
the head with a stick as they rode past in a van.
	   One of them was convicted of manslaughter, the other of causing
death by negligence.
	   On June 16, as the two were being driven home to the West Bank
Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai, one of the two boys leaned out of
the window and struck a Palestinian farmer, Mahmoud Majid
Abu-Turki, on the back of the head.
	   Abu-Turki, 52, who was married and had nine children, died
shortly afterwards at a hospital in Hebron.
	   The youths cannot be identified under Israeli law because they
are minors. The teen-ager who actually struck the blow was 16 at
the time of the offense and he faces a maximum sentence of 20
years, although the penalty imposed for manslaughter is usually
much less.
	   The other youth, who supplied the stick from a carpentry shop
where he was employed, was also charged with manslaughter. However
the Jerusalem District Court convicted him on the lesser count of
causing death by negligence.
	   The adult driver of the van, William Ohana, was acquitted of any
wrong doing.
	   Sentencing will be scheduled for a later date.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains swelled rivers in central Mexico
and triggered mud slides in Mexico City on Monday that killed five
people and injured four others, officials said.
	   The rain soaked squatter communities perched on the steep slopes
of hillsides south of the city. Television footage showed a stream
of mud roaring down gullies and the ruins of two homes that had
been swept away.
	   City officials had predicted the rainy season could bring
disaster to the shanty towns that ring the city's hillsides, but
most people refused to relocate.
	   ``It's very difficult to convince them. They don't want to leave
their houses,'' said Aurelio Garcia, a spokesman for the Magdalena
Contreras precinct, where the deaths occurred.
	   A house made of metal sheeting was swept away, killing a
13-year-old girl. Two boys who suffered head injuries in the
collapse were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in the city's
center.
	   ``I heard a loud rumble and I went outside and saw my neighbors
buried there,'' said Pedro Ramirez, 55.
	   Another family was buried in their home when mud came streaming
down on top of it earlier in the day. Two teen-agers were pulled
from the house alive by local police, but both their parents died.
	   Two other people were killed when a muddy hillside collapsed on
top of a containment wall, crushing their house. In all, half a
dozen houses were destroyed in slides.
	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas declared a state of alert, government
news agency Notimex reported. City officials warned people living
near a dam in the western part of the city that's on the verge of
overflowing to prepare to evacuate.
	   Cardenas said the government will not force squatters from their
homes.
	   Some neighborhoods in a low-lying area east of Mexico City have
been flooded for days, and to the west, the Lerma River overflowed
its banks and left some villages inundated in sewage.
	   Mexico City's main highway to the western part of the country
was also blocked by a mudslide Monday. Rains are expected to
continue, the National Meteorological service said.
	   Rains also caused rivers to overflow in the southern state of
Chiapas, hit by flooding earlier this month that killed 185 people
and left many towns and villages cut off from the outside world.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yasser Arafat asked world leaders Monday
to support Palestinian statehood next May, saying it was the will
of his people.
	   ``I would like to call upon all of you ... to stand by our
people,'' Arafat told the General Assembly. The Oslo peace accords
will expire on May 4, ``and our people demand of us to shoulder our
responsibilities and they await the establishment of their
independent state,'' he said.
	   ``This independent Palestinian state must be established as an
embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination,'' he
said.
	   Arafat delivered the speech after returning from Washington,
where he held a last-minute summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an Israeli troop
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Arafat had previously said he would use the General Assembly
speech to restate his intention of unilaterally declaring an
independent Palestinian state next year _ even if there is no final
peace agreement with Israel.
	   Palestinian aides had said Arafat wanted to seek support of U.N.
member states, many of whom traditionally back the Palestinian
cause over Israeli interests.
	   Over the weekend, however, diplomatic sources had said Arafat
would tone the speech down in the wake of apparent movement in the
peace process in consultations with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, and later Clinton.
	   But the speech Arafat gave appeared to conform with his original
intention.
	   ``We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as has
always been the case in the decisive moments of the history, the
present and the future of our people,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Help us to achieve the national goal of our people.''
	   Arafat's speech before the General Assembly has particular
significance: Never before has Arafat _ or any other Palestinian _
addressed the audience from the podium during the regular debate.
The Palestinian observer mission was granted that right earlier
this summer.
	   Arafat noted the occasion in his opening statement, thanking the
assembly for giving the Palestinians the enhanced status ``which we
consider to be an essential step towards full membership.''
	   Arafat had been expected to address the morning session, but his
appearance was postponed to allow him to travel to Washington to
meet with Netanyahu and Clinton.

Iranian papers banned for insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (A) _ A Tehran press court on Monday banned two
Iranian publications for insulting the late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iranian television reported.
	   The court revoked the publishing licenses of the daily Tous and
the monthly Jameah-e Salem. The owner of the monthly was given a
five-year suspended jail sentence for ``publishing lies, insulting
the state authorities, and distorting the utterances'' of Khomeini,
who died in 1989, the TV said. It gave no further details.
	   The case against the daily Zan, on charges of ``publishing lies,
defaming public figures and causing public concern,'' was adjourned
to allow further investigations, said the TV, monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Zan, or Woman, is owned by Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
	   The TV said Ms. Hashemi admitted to the charges of lies. It did
not elaborate.
	   Authorities had already shut down Tous temporarily for allegedly
publishing articles ``detrimental to national interests.'' Three of
its senior staffers have also been arrested since the paper closed
on Sept. 16.
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The newspaper
has called for a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes
in the conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide.
	   The deputy director and an editor of Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency were also arrested earlier this month but
later released.
	   They were detained after a hard-line official filed a complaint
with a Tehran court.
	   Khamenei, also a hard-liner, has called on the judiciary to deal
with what he calls ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.

Opposition candidates warn of economic chaos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The two leading opposition presidential
candidates in Brazil's Oct. 4 elections on Monday warned of
impending economic chaos in Latin America's largest country.
	   Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Worker's Party and Ciro
Gomes of the left-of-center Popular Socialist Party made their
remarks at a joint press conference held to complain of what they
said was the ``slanted press coverage'' of their campaigns.
	   Gomes, a former finance minister, said Brazil's current economic
stabilization policy would ``at best result in a severe recession
in 1999 and at worst, a complete economic breakdown.''
	   Lula said Brazil had become excessively dependent on speculative
capital ``to the extent that we are now at the mercy of the good
will of the U.S. government and the International Monetary Fund,
which has lost all of its credibility.''
	   He said that Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Russia ``recently
submitted themselves to IMF-imposed austerity measures, and all
have gone bankrupt.''
	   ``And Brazil is headed in the same direction,'' he added.
	   The two candidates said President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
is expected to win his bid for reelection, was preparing a
post-election package of austerity measures that would ``stifle
economic growth.''
	   Like other emerging markets, Brazil has been buffeted by the
turmoil in world financial markets with a loss of investor
confidence and a strong outflow of capital.
	   To prevent a collapse of Brazil's currency, the real, and stem
capital flight, the government on Sept. 10 raised interest rates
from 30 percent to 50 percent.
	   Last week, Cardoso tried to reassure international investors and
prepare Brazilians for belt-tightening economic measures that
heightened fears of recession and unemployment.
	   He hinted strongly that taxes would be increased in an effort to
tackle a budget deficit of more than 7 percent of gross domestic
product.
	   Before the interest rate hike, Brazil's needed 63 billion reals
(dlrs 53 billion) to finance its internal debt, Gomes said.
	   ``Now it needs 80 billion reals (dlrs 68 billion), bringing us
dangerously close to 8 percent of GDP. This spells economic
chaos,'' he said.
	   Recent polls give Cardoso about 47 percent of the vote, compared
to 24 percent for his nearest rival, Lula. Gomes trails in third
place with about 10 percent.

Two Israeli youths convicted for killing Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israeli youths were convicted Monday of
killing a Palestinian pedestrian by striking him across the back of
the head with a stick as they rode past in a van.
	   One of them was convicted of manslaughter, the other of causing
death by negligence.
	   On June 16, as the two were being driven home to the West Bank
Jewish settlement of Beit Hagai, one of the two boys leaned out of
the window and struck a Palestinian farmer, Mahmoud Majid
Abu-Turki, on the back of the head.
	   Abu-Turki, 52, who was married and had nine children, died
shortly afterwards at a hospital in Hebron.
	   The youths cannot be identified under Israeli law because they
are minors. The teen-ager who actually struck the blow was 16 at
the time of the offense and he faces a maximum sentence of 20
years, although the penalty imposed for manslaughter is usually
much less.
	   The other youth, who supplied the stick from a carpentry shop
where he was employed, was also charged with manslaughter. However
the Jerusalem District Court convicted him on the lesser count of
causing death by negligence.
	   The adult driver of the van, William Ohana, was acquitted of any
wrongdoing.
	   Sentencing will be scheduled for a later date.

Court of appeals authorizes 10-year-old rape victim to have
</HEADLINE>
abortion &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The court of appeals in a Brazilian
state on Monday upheld the right of a pregnant 10-year-old rape
victim to have an abortion.
	   The girl _ who is 4-months pregnant _ was repeatedly raped over
the past three years by two neighbors in Israelandia, a small rural
town about 900 kilometers (560 miles) northwest of Sao Paulo in the
central state of Goias.
	   Judge Goncalo Teixeira e Silva said by phone that he turned down
an appeal to prevent the abortion ``because the law clearly states
that such procedures can take place in cases of rape or if
childbirth threatens the mother's life.''
	   A local judge, Joao Geraldo Machado, said the two men have been
arrested and face jail sentences of up to 10 years.
	   The two men ``offered food, candy and crackers to the girl to
lure her into a house where they raped her,'' Machado said, citing
the testimony of an 11-year-old girl forced to guard the house.
	   State attorney Reuder Cavalvante Motta had contested Machado's
initial authorization of the abortion Sept.16.
	   ``I am normally opposed to abortion,'' Machado said last week.
``But in this case I am in favor of it. The law allows it and I
think the girl's welfare depends on it.''
	   Motta disagreed, saying ``the constitution guarantees the right
to life, including intrauterine life. And I don't think the girl's
health or welfare will be affected if she gives birth.''
	   Appellate Court Judge Teixeira e Silva said the abortion has not
been scheduled and that doctors would first have to determine if
the girl's life would be imperiled by the procedure.
	   Meanwhile, local church officials have offered food, clothing
and other support to persuade the girl and her parents to keep the
child.
	   The girl's father, Manoel Batista de Souza was quoted by a local
newspaper as saying he favored the abortion ``because I fear for my
daughter's life.''
	   ``I fear the wrath of God, but we'll go through with the
abortion if the court says we can, '' he said last week.

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Critics are wondering
why radio stations played music and TV ran soap operas while
Hurricane Georges pounded the Dominican Republic with deadly 110
mph (175 kph) winds.
	   Dominican officials are being blamed for discounting clear
information from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, and for
opening shelters only after the storm arrived.
	   ``When the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond,''
said Hugh Parmer, who is coordinating the Dominican relief effort
for the U.S. Agency for International Development.
	   The Dominican Republic is one of the Caribbean's poorest
countries, and the government's underfunded disaster relief agency
is ill-equipped. With more than 200 people killed and 100,000
homeless, the country hasn't seen a natural disaster of this
magnitude since Hurricane David in 1979.
	   Elsewhere in the Caribbean, storm victims took issue with the
responses of their governments to the disaster.
	   In Haiti, farmers in the central Artibonite Valley said
officials' failure to clear silt-clogged irrigation canals, despite
repeated warnings, contributed to deadly flooding. At least 94
Haitians were killed.
	   In Puerto Rico, where the hurricane killed three people and
caused more than dlrs 2 billion in damage, opposition leader Anibal
Acevedo accused the government of neglecting disaster relief in the
island's interior.
	   In all, Georges killed more than 300 people in its march across
the Caribbean.
	   In the Dominican Republic, newspaper editorials said both the
newly appointed civil defense chief, Elpidio Baez, and the head of
the National Meteorological Office, Felix Abreu, failed to issue
warnings under the pretext of not wanting to alarm the population.
	   Officials insist they thought the storm would hit farther north
than it did on Sept. 22, and that they believed evacuations would
only be necessary in the northeastern region of Samana.
	   ``This is a natural phenomenon, and unfortunately every time
these things happen, some people want to look for a guilty party,''
said the armed forces chief, Adm. Ruben Paulino Alvarez.
	   A specialist in the meteorological office, who spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said he warned his
bosses of Georges' potential for devastation 72 hours before it
hit.
	   One forecaster at the office defied his bosses' orders and
broadcast a warning the day before the storm, but the message
failed to reach most Dominicans.
	   Most Dominican victims died in flooding or mudslides;
substandard homes proved no match for the hurricane's destructive
power and the raging rivers it flooded.
	   Relief efforts continued throughout the Caribbean on Monday. The
United States sent tons of bottled water and thousands of plastic
tarps to provide roofs for 20,000 Dominican homes. Washington also
gave the Dominican Republic 20,000 pounds of food and medicine.
	   Peace Corps volunteers used rented aircraft to drop food in
areas inaccessible by road. The New York City Fire Department sent
63 search and rescue experts with four dog teams.
	   Nineteen U.S. disaster relief experts arrived in Santo Domingo
from Puerto Rico, which was struggling to clean up its own mess
Monday.
	   U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to arrive in Puerto
Rico on Tuesday to survey Georges' damage and visit one of the 232
shelters housing more than 17,000 people left homeless by the
hurricane.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In a historic speech to the General
Assembly, Yasser Arafat asked world leaders Monday to support
Palestinian statehood next May, saying this was the will of the
Palestinian people.
	   ``I would like to call upon all of you ... to stand by our
people,'' Arafat told the leaders gathered at the assembly's annual
debate. ``This independent Palestinian state must be established as
an embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination.''
	   Arafat had said previously that he would use the General
Assembly speech to restate his intention of unilaterally declaring
an independent Palestinian state next year _ even if there is no
final peace agreement with Israel.
	   The Oslo peace accords expire on May 4, ``and our people demand
of us to shoulder our responsibilities and they await the
establishment of their independent state.''
	   The Palestinian leader delivered the speech after returning from
Washington, where he held a last-minute summit with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.
	   Palestinian aides had said Arafat wanted to seek support of
United Nations member states, many of whom traditionally back the

you once more when Palestine has taken its natural place in the
community of nations as an independent state ...''
	   Arafat had been expected to address the morning session, but his
appearance was postponed to allow him to travel to Washington to
meet with Netanyahu and Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said he and Arafat had achieved a breakthrough on a
long-elusive deal over West Bank territory. Clinton set up a
compressed schedule for concluding the accord.
	   ``I believe that we all agreed that we have made progress on the
path to peace,'' Clinton said after the three leaders met.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Peru's President Alberto Fujimori and
Ecuadorian counterpart Jamil Mahuad have agreed to remove land
mines on disputed parts of their border, Mahuad said Monday.
	   After two days of talks here, Fujimori said the presidents
continued to be ``optimistic'' that a definitive peace deal could
be made over the territory this year.
	   Peru and Ecuador have fought a series of wars dating back to
1942 over the disputed territory. Most recently, in 1995, conflict
was over 49 miles (78 kms) of unmarked border.
	   In August, the countries agreed to create a demilitarized zone
to be patrolled by international peacekeepers.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican police have arrested an executive
accused of helping banking magnate Angel Rodriguez bilk a financial
firm out of dlrs 50 million, authorities said Monday.
	   Agustin Marquez Carrillo was arrested Sunday on charges of
violating the country's banking laws by helping Rodriguez make a
series of questionable loans in 1994 that left his Banpais bank in
ruins.
	   The arrest comes amid a campaign by President Ernesto Zedillo to
clamp down on white-collar crimes in the wake of the country's 1995
banking crisis, which saddled taxpayers with dlrs 55 billion in bad
debts left by private banks.
	   Marquez Carrillo was arraigned at a Mexico City penitentiary on
the charges. Rodriguez is currently free on bail.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A conference of first ladies from around
the Americas opened in the Chilean capital on Monday, with
participants set to discuss sex education, the plight of rural
women and other regional issues.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei opened the Eighth Conference of
Wives of Chiefs of State and Government of the Americas by calling
for improved education, saying it is ``the most efficient tool to
give dignity to the poor'' and improve their living conditions.
	   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to arrive
Wednesday and address the conference in a speech about the
political and economic advancement of women. The conference closes
Wednesday.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico will not allow U.S. anti-drug agents
to carry guns here, and officials said they will no longer discuss
the issue and consider it a ``closed case,'' Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green said.
	   Describing her talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during recent U.N. sessions in New York, Green said Sunday
that Mexico will not yield to pressure from the U.S. congress to
change its policy.
	   ``For us, this is a closed case ... the most closed case we
have,'' Green said, according to a press statement.
	   Green said Mexico's position would not be affected by a
Congressional proposal to condition U.S. anti-drug aid to Mexico on
the country's willingness to let armed U.S. agents operate here.
	   ``Mexico ... has never accepted conditions on aid,'' Green said.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A leading Mexican journalist said in an
interview Monday that media here were censored by the government in
the days after the Oct. 2, 1968 massacre of hundreds of student
demonstrators by soldiers.
	   Former news anchor Jacobo Zabludovsky told daily La Jornada he
received a phone call from then-president Gustavo Diaz Ordaz
scolding him for wearing a black tie on air the day after the
massacre.
	   Foreign media reported after the shootings _ known as the
`Massacre of Tlatelolco'' after the plaza where they occurred _
that as many as 300 people died. Most Mexican media published army
reports that only 27 people were killed.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo's administration has refused requests
by an opposition-led Congress to release government records of the
massacre.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Socialist Premier Fatos Nano
resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting in the wake of a
politician's assassination pushed the impoverished nation to the
brink of anarchy.
	   Nano's resignation was announced after a meeting of the
Socialist Party leadership in the Albanian capital.
	   A statement said that Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general
secretary of the Socialist Party, would be the party's candidate
for prime minister.
	   Nano's resignation was a main demand by the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha.
	   Only hours before Nano resigned, Interior Minister Perikli Teta,
a member of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting
pressure for apparent failure to improve public security.
	   The departure of the two top government leaders apparently
prompted police to increase patrols after nightfall in a show of
regained authority after the recent chaos.
	   At least three convoys of police cars were driving through
Tirana's streets. An armored personnel carrier was also in
evidence.
	   Majko's nomination to head a new government was seen as a
significant move to gradually part with officials who had been
associated the former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46
years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his
moderate stance, is not a former communist but took part in student
demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the communists from
power.
	   Immediately after word of Nano's resignation spread in Tirana,
gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital city. But it was
not clear whether it was just celebratory shooting by his political
foes _ supporters of his archrival, former President Sali Berisha.
	   Later a loud explosion could be heard, but there was no
immediate official word on the nature of the blast.
	   Nano became prime minister last year after his Socialist Party
of former communists defeated Berisha's Democratic Party in
parliamentary elections.
	   That internationally supervised ballot followed widespread
lawlessness and chaos that erupted with the collapse of phony
pyramid schemes in which many Albanians lost their life savings.
	   Nano stepped down Monday after he told President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together a new Cabinet according to
his own wishes and ideas.
	   He did not manage to restructure the government because he
failed to reach agreement with all coalition parties on the makeup
of the new government, sources said.
	   More importantly, Nano has failed to institute key economic
reforms, attract foreign investors and instill in Albanians hope
for a better future. He was also unsuccessful in fighting
corruption and widespread weapons smuggling across the
Albanian-Yugoslav border.
	   What also stymied his government was the worsening enmity
between his Socialists and Berisha's Democrats who kept calling for
his resignation and boycotted parliament most of the time.
	   Political tensions reached fever pitch with the assassination by
unidentified gunmen of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate on
Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office, parliament and other government buildings. At least
three people were killed in pitched battled with police and scores
were injured.

Security Council: Croatian police better but ethnic incidents up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The performance of local police in Croatia
has improved but violent ethnic incidents are increasing and the
judicial system isn't following them up, the U.N. Security Council
said Monday.
	   The council also noted ``a lack of progress'' in the
implementation of Croatia's program for national reconciliation.
	   Hans Dahlgren, Sweden's ambassador and the current council
president, said the council believes its July 2 statement
expressing grave concern about the number of Serbs who have fled
Croatia because of intimidation and evictions ``was still valid.''
	   After a closed-door meeting, he said the 15-member council
believes U.N. civilian police had greatly contributed to the
improved performance of local police. The council also supported
the handover of police monitoring in Croatia in mid-October from
the United Nations to the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
	   ``Council members also noted that there are a number of serious
outstanding issues to be addressed by the authorities of Croatia
including an increase in the number of violent ethnic incidents, a
poor judicial follow-up to reported incidents, and also lack of
progress in the implementation of the program for national
reconciliation,'' Dahlgren said.
	   Large numbers of Serbs continue to emigrate because of
ethnically-related intimidation, a ``dire'' economic situation,
bureaucratic obstacles, discriminatory legislation and the stalled
refugee program, the council said.
	   The council has repeatedly expressed concern about Croatia's
commitment to granting full rights and protections to ethnic Serbs
in the eastern Slavonia region, which was seized by Serb rebels
during the ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The region
returned to Croatian control Jan. 15 after two years under U.N.
administration.

Serb premier says special police units will be pulled out of Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

that 300 were arrested in past several days; EDITS. &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack, the
Serbian premier Monday declared Kosovo's separatists have been
defeated and promised to withdraw special police units from the
province _ a condition demanded by the United States and Europe.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks, and his deputy threatened to take
hostage all pro-Western Serbs who work for independent media, peace
and human right groups in case of NATO strikes.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, issued a statement pledging to continue what it
called ``the holy war'' against Serbia and demanding NATO action.
The statement also criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders
``whose actions are hindering this holy war.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, more fighting
was reported in Kosovo Monday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serbian shelling in the region of the
Suva Reka village and Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw thick columns of smoke blurring the horizon of
Suva Reka where open flames consumed at least four villages
sprawling over nearby hills Monday. Police and the Yugoslav army,
backed by tanks and heavy artillery, had surrounded several
villages in the area and denied entry to journalists and foreign
diplomatic observers.
	   ``There are still many KLA,'' said one Serb police officer in
Suva Reka, which sits at the foot of the hills where Sunday's
police offensive devastated several villages.
	   The state Tanjug news agency later said that ``all (remaining)
strongholds of terrorists'' in the region of Suva Reka were
``destroyed'' Monday, and that dozens of ``terrorists'' were killed
and hundreds were arrested, a reference to a mopping-up operation
during the last several days.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also claimed that two ethnic
Albanian families, including 15 members, were ``massacred'' by
withdrawing Serb troops in the central Drenica region on Sunday.
The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up 90 percent of the 2
million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days unless they
have committed ``war crimes.''
	   He also said that by MOnday ``anti-terrorist activities'' had
been completed but could resume if the rebels strike again.
	   ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the armed terrorist
groups have been defeated,'' Marjanovic asserted.
	   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, repeated the alliance's official position that Milosevic
has to fulfill all the conditions laid down in the U.N. resolution
last Wednesday which called for an immediate cease-fire.
	   There was no visible withdrawal of the police units Monday.
Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   The leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, stated the premier's claims were a ``manipulation of the
world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and called for an
``immediate NATO action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from Kosovo and
begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the province's future.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against Kosovos's separatists
and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes in the
event that Milosevic failed to comply.
	   During the parliamentary session, Serbia's ultra-nationalist
vice premier Vojislav Seselj threatened to take pro-Western Serbs
as hostages in case of NATO strikes.
	   Seselj told Serbia's parliament that if they decide to strike
against Serbia, the U.S. and other Western countries ``should
better withdraw'' all Serb ``traitors'' from Yugoslavia ``before we
grab them'' and take them ``hostage.''
	   Seselj's list of pro-Western ``traitors'' included journalists
of Serbia's independent newspapers and members of independent human
rights, intellectual and peace groups.
	   Seselj's address was greeted with loud applause from the
deputies.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanian Socialist Premier Fatos Nano
resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting over a politician's
assassination pushed the Balkan nation to the brink of anarchy.
	   Nano's resignation was announced after a meeting of the
Socialist Party leadership in the Albanian capital, Tirana.
	   A statement said that Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old general
secretary of the Socialist Party, would be the party's candidate
for prime minister.
	   Nano's resignation was a main demand by the opposition
Democratic Party of former President Sali Berisha.
	   Majko's nomination was seen as a further distancing from
officials who associated with the former Communist party that ruled
Albania for 46 years.
	   Unlike Nano, Majko, a trained engineer respected for his

member of the small Democratic Alliance, also quit under mounting
pressure for apparent failure to improve public security.

Extent of hurricane damage to Cuba's sugar crop remains unclear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The extent of harm done by Hurricane Georges to
Cuba's crucial sugar crop _ and the rest of the island's
agriculture _ was unknown Monday as authorities continued to assess
the damages.
	   Government media have steered away from the subject of sugar,
focusing instead on damage done to banana and coffee plantations by
the hurricane's march across the island on Thursday and Friday.
	   Specific damage figures for those crops have not been provided,
either.
	   Sugar still accounts for nearly half of the nation's export
revenue. Tourism recently took over as the country's No. 1 source
of income.
	   Even before the hurricane, Cuba was expecting perhaps its worst
sugar crop in half a century. Production had been expected to fall
to 3.5 million metric tons (3.9 million US tons), down from 4.6
million metric tons (5 million US tons) in 1997.

211-year-old Marylebone Cricket Club votes to admit women
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: A version moved on sports wires &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's oldest cricket club, a bastion of male
exclusivity for 211 years, voted Monday to admit women.
	   The Marylebone Cricket Club, whose membership includes former
British Prime Minister John Major and the Rolling Stones' Mick
Jagger, was founded in 1787 and until 30 years ago was the
governing body for the sport.
	   Not only were women barred from membership, but with the
exception of Queen Elizabeth II, women also were not allowed to
enter the club's pavilion during play at the Lord's cricket ground,
in west London, where it is based.
	   ``I'm highly delighted,'' Barbara Daniels, vice-captain of the
England Women's Cricket Team, said after news of Monday's decision.
	   After several years of struggle within MCC to overcome the
``neanderthal'' image of its membership rules, nearly 70 percent of
the 13,482 members who voted approved the change.
	   This overturned the result of a ballot taken in February, when
55.7 percent voted to admit women, falling short of the required
two-thirds.
	   The government criticized the February failure, and the club's
governing committee warned members, whose average age is 57, that
continuing the ban would disqualify the MCC from receiving National
Lottery money for its development.
	   The England and Wales Cricket Board, which now runs the game,
has tried to extend cricket's popularity among women.
	   Most female applicants will have to join the waiting list - now
about 18 years long _ along with the men. But a few honorary
members could be expected quite soon.
	   There was hard-core opposition. One member, Robert
Titchener-Barratt, said the proposition was shoved down the club's
throat.
	   ``The committee have acted with arrogance and self-importance
saying `we're going to push this through whether you members like
it or not','' he said.
	   Rachel Heyhoe Flint, a former captain of the English women's
team who has been trying to join since 1991, said Monday night, ``I
reckon that over the last two or three years the club has been
looked on in a very poor light but now its image is brilliant.''
	   Sir Tim Rice, the lyricist and collaborator of Sir Andrew Lloyd
Webber, was one of the first to attempt to win membership for women
seven years ago.
	   ``I think it is important that the MCC for its own sake has got
rid of this albatross, because it got an unfair Neanderthal
image,'' Rice said Monday night.
	   ``Unfortunately people like my daughter Eva, who is very keen on
cricket, will have to go to the back of the queue like everyone
else and it may well be 15 or 20 years before she can join.''

	   In his letter of resignation, Nano acknowledged his
responsibility ``for everything this government has not done,
because of its defects or the pressure coming from every
direction.'' He also said that ``the chances of coming out of the
crisis are little.''
	   Nano also admitted that the communication with the international
community had become very difficult since ... (it) look at his and
Berisha as ``a couple that has become an obstacle for Albania's
progress.''

Arafat says will of Palestinians is statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RECAST lede, say Arafat refrained from a
unilateral declaration, UPDATE with Israeli UN ambassador
expressing satisfaction with Arafat's speech. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In a historic speech to the General
Assembly, Yasser Arafat asked world leaders Monday to support
Palestinian statehood but refrained from threatening to
unilaterally declare a state next May.
	   Arafat apparently heeded U.S. pleas to tone down his first
speech to the assembly's general debate _ a move welcomed by
Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold.
	   ``Clearly he has preferred the option of negotiations over the
option of a unilateral act,'' Gold told reporters. ``And in that
sense, we have something we can express our satisfaction with.''
	   But Arafat said repeatedly in his speech that statehood was not
a debatable issue and concluded by announcing that he looked
forward to speaking to the assembly once more ``when Palestine has
taken its natural place in the community of nations as an
independent state.''
	   Arafat urged the leaders to ``stand by our people,'' and
stressed that the Oslo peace accords expire on May 4. ``Our people
demand of us to shoulder our responsibilities and they await the
establishment of their independent state.''
	   ``This independent Palestinian state must be established as an
embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination,'' he
said.
	   Arafat delivered the speech after returning from Washington,
where he held a last-minute summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an Israeli troop
pullback from the West Bank.
	   Arafat had said previously that he would use the General
Assembly speech to restate his intention of declaring an
independent Palestinian state next year whether or not a final
peace agreement with Israel is in place.
	   Palestinian aides had said Arafat wanted to seek support of U.N.
member states, many of whom traditionally back the Palestinian
cause over Israeli interests.
	   Over the weekend, however, diplomatic sources had said that
Arafat would tone the speech down in the wake of apparent movement
in the peace process in consultations with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, and later Clinton.
	   The speech didn't rule out his original intention, though there
was no explicit threat that he would unilaterally declare an
independent state May 4.
	   ``We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as has
always been the case in the decisive moments of the history, the
present and the future of our people,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Help us to achieve the national goal of our people in the
establishment of the state,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat's speech before the General Assembly has particular
significance: Never before has Arafat _ or any other Palestinian _
addressed the audience from the podium during the regular debate.
The Palestinian observer mission was granted that right earlier
this summer.
	   Arafat noted the occasion in his opening statement, thanking the
assembly for giving the Palestinians the enhanced status ``which we
consider to be an essential step towards full membership.''
	   Arafat had been expected to address the morning session, but his
appearance was postponed to allow him to travel to Washington to
meet with Netanyahu and Clinton.
	   Netanyahu said he and Arafat had achieved a breakthrough on a
long-elusive deal over West Bank territory. Clinton set up a
compressed schedule for concluding the accord.
	   ``I believe that we all agreed that we have made progress on the
path to peace,'' Clinton said after the three leaders met.

U.S. Air Force reaches deal with Turkish union to end base strikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ U.S. Air Force officials reached an
agreement Monday with a Turkish labor union to end a two-month
strike at NATO bases in Turkey, just days before a scheduled
exercise.
	   Some 1,800 Turkish workers walked off their jobs on July 23
demanding higher salaries and fringe benefits at Incirlik Air Base
_ the hub of operations for U.S. and British patrol flights over
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq _ and at two other bases in Ankara
and Aegean port city of Izmir.
	   Mustafa Acet, an official of the Harb-Is, the Union of Defense
Industry and Allied Workers that organized the strike, said that
the workers will return to work Wednesday after ratifying a Tuesday
accord with the U.S. Air Force.
	   ``We will sign the contract at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) Tuesday,''
Acet told The Associated Press by telephone from the southern city
of Adana, where the Incirlik Air Base is located.
	   A breakthrough came only three days before a planned NATO
exercise in Turkey, Greece and Italy, scheduled to run through Oct.
21. The U.S. Air Force agreed to lay off no strikers.
	   The strikes have shut down the commissary, gas station, dining
halls and other facilities at Incirlik, where 1,446 of the workers
were employed. The other bases were similarly affected.
	   ``They were really fed up,'' Acet said of the military
personnel. ``They even could not play bowling during the strike.''
	   U.S. officials were not available for comment.
	   Acet said the U.S. officials agreed on a one-time payment of
dlrs 800 to compensate for losses during the strike, to raise
salaries by 50 percent, followed by monthly increases in line with
inflation.
	   With the increases, the workers will make more than 900 dollars
per month, nearly nine times the minimum wage of 110 per month.
	   Inflation currently runs at around 70 percent a year.
	   Since the Gulf War, U.S. and British planes monitor Iraq's
treatment of the Kurds in northern Iraq from Incirlik, some 10
kilometers (6 miles) northeast of Adana.

Rodal fires coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ After ten years close cooperation, 800-meter
runner Vebjorn Rodal fired his coach Kjell Arve Husby on Monday.
	   ``We have received information that is very hard to relate to.
Because of personal reasons, I cannot say what this information is
about,'' Rodal told Norwegian news agency NTB.
	   Husby has followed Rodal to many successes on the field: second
in the European Athletics Championship in 1994, third in the World
Championship in 1995 and gold in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
	   ``We have had no problems in our relationship, but the new
information has made it problematic. This is a tough day, but
hopefully also the end of a difficult time,'' said Rodal who
informed Husby personally Monday.
	   Still, Rodal still considers Husby a friend.
	   ``What we said is between me and him. He has been a creative and
skilled coach to me, also on the interpersonal level,'' Rodal said,
but he would not comment on a possible new cooperation between them
in the future.
	   Husby himself did not comment, but his lawyer, Morten Kjensli,
said that Husby was disappointed that Rodal did not wait a couple
of days to get the complete picture.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains swelled rivers in central Mexico
and triggered mudslides in Mexico City which killed five people and
injured four others Monday.
	   A stream of mud roared down gullies and swept away three homes
in a squatter community perched on the steep hillsides south of the
capital.
	   The slide buried a 13-year-old girl, Lourdes Barrera Orozco, who
was found still clutching her school notebook. All that remained of
the homes were a muddy pile of appliances and clothing flung
against a row of trees.
	   The girl's 6-year-old brother and a 9-year-old relative also
were caught in the slide and suffered head injuries. They were
flown by helicopter to a downtown hospital.
	   ``I heard a loud rumble and I went outside and saw my neighbors
buried there,'' one neighbor, 55-year-old Pedro Ramirez, said.
	   In a nearby neighborhood, another slide buried a family inside
their home, killing the mother and father. Two teen-age children
were pulled out alive by police. Two other people died when a muddy
hillside collapsed on top of a containment wall, crushing their
house.
	   In all, half a dozen houses were destroyed in slides and
avalanches.
	   It was a disaster city officials had predicted months earlier,
when they began urging residents to leave the shanty towns. They
had warned the squatters that the houses _ many supported only by
sandbags _ would be in danger during Mexico's rainy season.
	   But many residents refused to leave even after seeing their
neighbors' wood-and-scrap-metal homes wash down the hillside
Monday.
	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas declared a state of alert due to the
flooding and mudslides. City officials warned people living near an
almost-overflowing dam in the western part of the city to prepare
to evacuate.
	   Cardenas said squatters would be encouraged to leave endangered
communities, but noted ``it would have to be voluntary.''
	   A local gymnasium was turned into a shelter capable of housing
up to 700 people, but it remained empty Monday afternoon, Garcia
said.
	   Mexico's National Meteorological Service predicted more rain.
	   Some neighborhoods in a low-lying former lake bed east of Mexico
City have been flooded for days, and to the west, the Lerma River
overflowed its banks and left some villages inundated in sewage.
	   A mudslide blocked Mexico City's main highway to the western
part of the country Monday.
	   Officials in neighboring Puebla state said a child drowned in
the swollen Atoyac River on Sunday.
	   Elsewhere, rains caused rivers to overflow in the southern state
of Chiapas, where severe flooding earlier this month killed 185
people and left hundreds of towns and villages cut off from the
outside world.
	   Two temporary bridges built to replace ones destroyed in that
flooding were washed away again Sunday, local media reported.

Slovakia edges Argentina 3-2 to reach Davis Cup world group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Slovakia advanced to the 1999
Davis Cup world group, squeaking past Argentina 3-2 on a final,
four-set victory Monday by Dominik Hrbaty over Hernan Gumy.
	   Hrbaty downed Gumy 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the decisive three-hour
match, which was at the Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club with 3,500
fans in attendance.
	   The outcome spelled a bitter disappointment for Argentina, which
has been bidding for the past six years to advance beyond Group One
of the American Zone competition.
	   Singles play kicked off the series Friday and Argentina led 2-1
after the weekend doubles. But Slovakia's Karol Kucera tied it 2-2
by defeating Franco Squillari 6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4 earlier
on Monday.
	   The Kucera-Squillari match was resumed after being postponed
late Sunday for lack of light.

New gene therapy for lactose intolerance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ An international research team has developed a
possible genetic cure for lactose intolerance, an inability to
digest dairy products that afflicts half the world's population.
	   Lactose intolerance is a largely adult condition that can cause
chronic nausea, bloating and diarrhea as well as calcium
deficiencies.
	   It stems from a genetic deficiency that prevents the body from
metabolizing lactose, or milk sugar. It is the most common genetic
disorder in the world.
	   However, researchers in the United States and New Zealand said
that injecting a gene involved in the breakdown of milk sugar into
the digestive tract of lactose-intolerant rats allowed the animals
to handle lactose.
	   The findings were published in Tuesday's issue of the journal
Nature Medicine.
	   Lactose intolerance affects more than 50 percent of the
population, including 100 percent of some Asian ethnic groups. In
the United States, 50 million people are lactose intolerant,
including up to 75 percent of blacks and American Indians.
	   But whether anyone will ever get a new gene to cure their
lactose intolerance is debatable.
	   People with the condition can avoid any effects by staying away
from dairy products. Also, low-lactose milk is widely available in
supermarkets, as are over-the-counter tablets that aid in milk
digestion.
	   ``It makes it rather unlikely that gene therapy will be widely
used for treating lactose intolerance,'' said Eric W.F.W. Alton of
England's National Heart and Lung Institute.
	   Gene researchers said the study makes new strides in gene
therapy research that could prove useful in treating other diseases
and developing DNA-based vaccines.
	   In the study, researchers in the United States and New Zealand
took a gene that directs the production of an enzyme that breaks
down milk sugars and attached it to a group of viruses that easily
infect cells in the digestive system. The gene was then introduced
into rats directly through a tube into their digestive tracts.
	   Rats with the new gene could tolerate lactose-rich food.
	   Gene therapy thus far has been impractical in treating a variety
of gene-based illnesses. But the relative ease with which the
lactose gene started working in the rats' digestive tract was
encouraging to researchers.

Serb premier says special police units will be pulled out of Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Trying to avert a NATO attack, the
Serbian premier Monday declared Kosovo's separatists have been
defeated and promised to withdraw special police units from the
ethnic Albanian province _ a condition demanded by the United
States and Europe.
	   But Premier Mirko Marjanovic said the Serb crackdown will resume
if the rebels stage new attacks, and his deputy threatened to take
hostage all pro-Western Serbs who work for independent media, peace
and human right groups in case of NATO strikes.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, issued a statement pledging to continue what it
called ``the holy war'' against Serbia and demanding NATO action.
The statement also criticized pacifist Kosovo Albanian leaders
``whose actions are hindering this holy war.''
	   Despite word of special forces' imminent pullout, more fighting
was reported in Kosovo Monday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership, reported Serbian shelling in the region of the
Suva Reka village and Urosevac town south of Pristina.
	   Reporters saw thick columns of smoke blurring the horizon of
Suva Reka where open flames consumed at least four villages
sprawling over nearby hills Monday. Police and the Yugoslav army,
backed by tanks and heavy artillery, had surrounded several
villages in the area and denied entry to journalists and foreign
diplomatic observers.
	   ``There are still many KLA,'' said one Serb police officer in
Suva Reka, which sits at the foot of the hills where Sunday's
police offensive devastated several villages.
	   The state Tanjug news agency later said that ``all (remaining)
strongholds of terrorists'' in the region of Suva Reka were
``destroyed'' Monday, and that dozens of ``terrorists'' were killed
and hundreds were arrested, a reference to a mopping-up operation
during the last several days.
	   The Kosovo Information Center also claimed that two ethnic
Albanian families, including 15 members, were ``massacred'' by
withdrawing Serb troops in the central Drenica region on Sunday.
The report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and about 275,000 have fled
their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
began cracking down on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February.
	   Kosovo is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians _ who make up the vast majority
of the 2 million inhabitants _ favor independence.
	   Marjanovic said the government will grant amnesty to Kosovo
Albanians who surrender weapons within the next 10 days unless they
have committed ``war crimes.''
	   He also said that by Monday ``anti-terrorist activities'' had
been completed but could resume if the rebels strike again.
	   ``I wish to declare that with this day ... the armed terrorist
groups have been defeated,'' Marjanovic asserted.
	   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, repeated the alliance's official position that Milosevic
has to fulfill all the conditions laid down in the U.N. resolution
last Wednesday that called for an immediate cease-fire.
	   There was no visible withdrawal of the police units Monday.
Marjanovic said Serb and Yugoslav forces would remain in their
barracks for an unspecified period to guard against any resumption
of attacks by the KLA, which has been largely routed.
	   The leading ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic League of
Kosovo, stated the premier's claims were a ``manipulation of the
world public by the Belgrade regime,'' and called for an
``immediate NATO action in Kosovo to stop the humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   The U.N. Security Council has insisted since March that Serbs
withdraw special police units and other forces from Kosovo and
begin talks with ethnic Albanians on the province's future.
	   On Wednesday, the council threatened additional action if
Milosevic did not stop the offensive against Kosovos's separatists
and allow for the safe return of refugees.
	   NATO defense chiefs then stepped up plans for airstrikes in the
event that Milosevic failed to comply.
	   During the parliamentary session, Serbia's ultranationalist vice
premier Vojislav Seselj threatened to take pro-Western Serbs as
hostages in case of NATO strikes. Seselj's list of pro-Western
``traitors'' included journalists of Serbia's independent
newspapers and members of independent human rights, intellectual
and peace groups.
	   Seselj's address was greeted with loud applause from the
deputies.

Caracas stock market jumps by 7.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Caracas stock market jumped by 7.2
percent Monday, the biggest gain among major Latin American stock
markets.
	   Stock brokers said the the market was rallying because of the
stability of the currency, the bolivar, which entered its third
week of strengthening, and by a recovery in slumping oil prices.
	   Since Sept. 15, the bolivar has gained 2.2 percent against the
U.S. dollar. It closed Monday at 576 bolivars per U.S. dollar.
	   The stock market has jumped by 25 percent since Sept. 21. It had
fallen sharply since June when prices for Venezuelan oil hit a
12-year low.

Manufacturers question test for golf clubs

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASKING RIDGE, New Jersey (AP) _ Some of the heaviest hitters in
the golf equipment industry insist there is no need for a new test
that could render illegal the next generation of clubs.
	   At a public forum Monday on a test to measure the spring-like
effect in new drivers, club manufacturers said their products _
designed by rocket scientists using complex computer models _ have
not altered the game.
	   They said the test, which the United States Golf Association
proposed two months ago, was technically flawed and would stifle
innovation.
	   And they left little doubt that unless the USGA withdraws the
proposal, it could face a lawsuit that challenges its authority to
make rules in this country.
	   ``Why try to fix something that is not broken,'' said John A.
Solheim, president of Karsten Manufacturing Corp., maker of Ping
golf clubs. ``Innovation is one of the important traditions of
golf.''
	   USGA president F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor Jr. declined to
speculate on the fate of the test, which could be decided when the
executive committee meets at the end of October.
	   Earlier this year, Taylor shook up the industry that does dlrs
1.7 billion in wholesale business of clubs when he suggested it was
time to rein in advancing technology, saying the skill factor was
eroding and that historic venues were becoming obsolete because of
how much farther players were hitting the ball.
	   But the USGA backed off at a news conference on the eve of the
U.S. Open in June. After saying that virtually every driver met
specifications, it proposed a test to measure the spring-like
effect when the ball is struck.
	   The proposed test was also to clarify its 1984 rule on the
spring-like effect, a tricky task because the USGA conceded that
all clubfaces deflect, or bend in, to some degree when striking the
ball.
	   Clubs that do not conform to ``The Rules of Golf,'' published by
the USGA and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, cannot
be used in sanctioned tournaments. The PGA Tour adheres to USGA
policy.
	   Lightweight materials, such as titanium heads and graphite
shafts, let golfers swing a longer club without added weight.
Longer clubs develop greater head speed when swung with the same
force, giving the potential for greater distance.
	   Manufacturers such as Callaway, Titleist and Ping maintain that
golf remains challenging despite the hoopla surrounding big hitters
like Tiger Woods and John Daly, and that the new clubs have allowed
less gifted players to enjoy the game.
	   Wally Uihlein, president and CEO of Acushnet Co., maker of
Titleist, Cobra and FootJoy brands, urged the USGA to withdraw the
test and form a joint committee of technical personnel from the
association and manufacturers.
	   Acushnet engineer Steve Aoyama said he dissected the USGA test
and found it difficult for others to replicate because it was
vague. He also said the method _ shooting a ball out of cannon
against a flat titanium plate _ failed to account for the loft of
clubs.
	   Callaway Golf, whose line of Big Bertha metal woods resulted in
dlrs 800 million in sales last year, was not at the hearing. In
written comments sent to the USGA, Callaway said the ``USGA has
failed to carry its burden of showing a threat to the game of golf
that would justify a ban on new technology.''
	   All other speakers, such as Daiwa, agreed. The exception was
George Montgomery, CEO of Taylor Made. He said five years of
research by his engineers identified a spring-like effect in
various designs and that the ``fundamentally sound'' USGA test
would not limit innovation.
	   Montgomery suggested limiting how much spin a clubface could
impart on a ball.

Last of the Flying Finns dead at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Viljo Akseli Heino, the last of the
track stars called the ``Flying Finns,'' has died at age 84, the
International Amateur Atheltic Federation said Monday.
	   Heino died Sept. 15 in Tampere. The cause of death was not
given.
	   Although Heino was not as well known as others known by the
nickname, such as Paavo Nurmi and Viljam Ritola, he set world
records even after suffering a leg injury in Finland's 1939 war
against the Soviet Union.
	   In 1944, Heino set the world record for 10,000 meters of 28:38.6
at a race in Helsinki. He was also given credit in the same race
for setting a world 6-mile record.
	   ``Had Heino's athletics career not been compromised by the ...
war, who knows what he might have achieved?''' the IAAF said in its
statement.
	   There was no information about a funeral or survivors.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Embattled Albanian Prime Minister Fatos
Nano resigned Monday, two weeks after rioting that pushed his
impoverished nation to the brink of anarchy.
	   Nano's resignation was announced after a meeting of the
Socialist Party leadership in the Albanian capital.
	   A statement said that Pandeli Majko, the 31-year-old
general-secretary of the Socialist Party, will be the party's
candidate for prime minister.
	   Interior Minister Perikli Teta, a member of the small Democratic
Alliance party, also quit under mounting pressure for his apparent
failure to improve public security.
	   Gunfire erupted in several parts of the capital when word of
Nano's resignation spread. It was not clear whether it was just
celebratory shooting by supporters of Nano's rival, former
President Sali Berisha.
	   Later a loud explosion could be heard, but there was no
immediate official word on the nature of the blast.
	   Police increased patrols after nightfall in a show of regained
authority after the recent chaos. At least three convoys of police
cars drove through Tirana's streets.
	   Nano stepped down Monday after telling President Rexhep Meidani
that he had been unable to put together the Cabinet he wanted
because of disagreement among the parties that make up the
coalition government, sources said.
	   In his letter of resignation, Nano acknowledged his
responsibility ``for everything this government has not done,
because of its defects or the pressure coming from every
direction.'' He also said that ``the chances of coming out of the
crisis are little.''
	   Nano's government was stymied by the worsening enmity between
his Socialists and Berisha's Democrats, who kept calling for his
resignation and repeatedly boycotted parliament.
	   Political tensions have soared in recent weeks with the
assassination of Azem Hajdari, a close Berisha associate, by
unidentified gunmen on Sept. 12.
	   Rioting began a day later with angry protesters burning the
first floor of the government building housing Nano's office as
well as seven government cars parked outside.
	   On Sept. 14, the day of Hajdari's funeral, rioters rampaged
through Tirana, taking control of state television and ravaging
Nano's office and other government buildings. Several people were
killed in pitched battled with police.
	   On Saturday, Berisha promised thousands of supporters that
street protests would continue until the government stepped down.
	   Majko's nomination on Monday to head a new government was seen
as a significant move to part with officials associated with the
former Communist party that ruled Albania for 46 years.
	   Majko, a trained engineer respected for his moderate stance,
took part in student demonstrations in 1990 that helped topple the
Communists from power.
	   Nano was prime minister in the first post-communist government
in 1991 headed by Berisha and his Democratic Party. Berisha pulled
out of the coalition a year later, forcing elections he won to gain
full power.
	   Nano was sentenced in 1993 to 12 years in prison on charges of
falsifying documents and misappropriating funds. International
groups condemned the charges as being politically motivated.
	   When pyramid investment schemes collapsed last year, wiping out
the life savings of many Albanians, nationwide rioting forced
Berisha to resign. A mob freed Nano from prison, and his Socialists
won the ensuing election with Berisha leading the opposition.
	   The potential for unrest remains high in this country where an
estimated 1 million weapons were stolen from armories, police
stations and other places during last year's unrest.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Politicians of the left on Monday welcomed Gerhard
Schroeder's election triumph which ended 16 years of conservative
government under Helmut Kohl, claiming the result as fresh evidence
that the political tide was running their way.
	   ``It's a very positive result,'' said Deputy Prime Minister
Walter Veltroni, who said Schroeder was in the same center-left
mold as British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
	   ``With Schroeder, Blair and Jospin, it gets easier ... for the
unemployment issue to enter full force in Europe's political
discussion,'' Veltroni said.
	   ``A new epoch is coming. Many countries have become much more
leftist in nature,'' said Russian Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
	   ``A different Germany is born, but also a different Europe, full
of question marks,'' said the Italian daily newspaper Corriere
della Sera.
	   The Wall Street Journal Europe agreed on Schroeder's place in
the political spectrum but with a negative spin, calling him ``a
split-the-difference pragmatist'' in the mold of Blair and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   ``When it comes time to jump off the fence on actual policy
questions, on which side Mr. Schroeder will land is anyone's
guess,'' the Wall Street Journal Europe said in an editorial
Monday.
	   Schroeder declared that one thing wouldn't change: the
partnership between Germany and France as leaders of the European
Union.
	   ``The Franco-German axis has historic importance, and it will
remain the most important for Europe,'' said Schroeder, who said he
would make an official visit to France within 10 days.
	   French President Jacques Chirac, a conservative working with a
Socialist prime minister, spoke Monday in favor of a ``renovation''
of French-German relations and said he would present proposals to
Schroeder for such changes.
	   In an interview to be published jointly Tuesday by Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung and Le Figaro, Chirac said the French-German
axis must ``function like a force ... of attraction for the benefit
of all of Europe.''
	   The time has come ``to go beyond reconciliation,'' Chirac said.
A ``new spirit ... of fraternity and initiative'' is needed.
	   Former U.S. President George Bush congratulated Schroeder and
said Kohl should be saluted for his accomplishments.
	   ``Historians will look back favorably on his 16 years in office,
but he will be especially remembered for his greatest feat, the
peaceful reunification of Germany. He has been a strong and
respected leader, and a great friend of the United States.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Win or lose, it's going to be a tough day for
the Stottlemyres for the opener of the U.S. Major League Baseball
playoffs.
	   Todd Stottlemyre will pitch the first-round American League
playoff opener for the Texas Rangers on Tuesday night. The
opponent? The New York Yankees, whose pitching coach is his father,
Mel.
	   ``I get chill bumps even thinking about it,'' Texas manager
Johnny Oates said Monday during a workout at Yankee Stadium. ``We
always want to do well for our dads. I thought about sitting there,
rooting against your son. I don't know if you can do that.''
	   Two other series start Tuesday, both featuring attractive
pitching matchups.
	   In the National League, Randy Johnson will start for Houston
against Kevin Brown of the San Diego Padres at the Astrodome. In
the AL, Pedro Martinez will pitch for the Boston Red Sox against
Jaret Wright at Cleveland.
	   The other best-of-5 NL series is still not set. The winner of
Monday night's wild-card tiebreaker between the Chicago Cubs and
San Francisco Giants will advance to play at Atlanta against the
Braves on Wednesday.
	   David Wells will pitch for the opener for the Yankees, who set
an AL record with 114 wins. The Rangers' only other playoff
appearance came in 1996, when New York eliminated them in the first
round.
	   Todd Stottlemyre, traded from St. Louis to Texas on July 31, won
at Yankee Stadium in mid-August. The game marked the first time Mel
had watched from a major league dugout when his son pitched.
	   ``He probably knows me as well or better than anybody,'' the
pitcher said of his dad. ``From an emotional standpoint, he
understands me better than anybody. There are no secrets.''
	   When Todd pitched at New York last month, his mother, Jean _
Mel's wife _ felt so uncomfortable that she abandoned her usual
seat in the Yankees' family section so she could cheer for her son.
	   ``I'm hiding my feelings,'' Mel said. ``I'm keeping them to
myself. I'm keeping my family and my feelings out of this.''
	   At Houston, the Astros are thinking this might be the year they
reach the World Series for the first time. A lot of that confidence
is because of Johnson, who went 10-1 after being acquired from
Seattle.
	   The Padres had trouble in September, even though they had no
problem clinching the NL West. In Brown, they have a pitcher who
helped the Florida Marlins win the World Series last year.
	   ``Well, there is no question you never want to struggle coming
into the playoffs. Then again, there have been teams playing great
going into the playoffs and lost four straight or not fared well,''
Brown said. ``And vice versa, a team can come in struggling and
turn it around in a series. You can't read too much into it.''
	   At Jacobs Field, two teams will try to erase the memories of
painful postseasons.
	   The Red Sox have lost 13 straight postseason games since winning
Game 5 of the 1986 World Series. The Indians have not won the World
Series since 1948, coming within a double play grounder of the
title last October at Miami.

NBA offer shows movement; union mulls counterproposal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The latest collective bargaining offer from
National Basketball Association owners includes some movement on
their proposals for maximum and minimum salaries, and a response
from the union should come later this week.
	   After having the new offer in its hands for three days, the
union was preparing Monday to make its next move as the likelihood
increased with each passing day that the regular season will not
start on time Nov. 3.
	   If the union decides to present a counterproposal, it could lead
to a resumption of face-to-face talks that would give the sides
about two weeks to strike a deal allowing for a full 82-game
schedule to be played. The NBA has never lost a game because of a
labor impasse.
	   The pace of negotiations _ and the quality of the proposals _
could increase in the next couple of weeks after John Feerick, dean
of Fordham University Law School, rules on the union's grievance
over whether players with guaranteed contracts for the upcoming
season should be paid during the lockout.
	   Feerick's decision could come at any time prior to Oct. 19.
	   According to sources close to the bargaining, the owners made
some movement in their most recent offer sent to union headquarters
last Friday.
	   In its proposals, the league has offered two different fiscal
operating systems designed to slow the growth of player salaries:
	   _ One system would include all the facets of the expired
agreement _ including maintaining the Larry Bird exception in its
present form _ but would mandate a scaling back of the percentage
of basketball-related income (BRI) devoted to player salaries from
57 percent last year to 54 percent in 1998-99, 52 percent in
1999-2000, 50 percent in 2000-2001 and 48 percent in 2001-2002. If
those thresholds were exceeded, the money would be returned to the
owners.
	   The union says that amounts to a ``hard'' salary cap, which it
will not accept.
	   _ Another system would eliminate the Bird exception (which
allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain their own free
agents) after a three-year phaseout, eliminate the dlrs 1 million
salary cap exception available to teams every other year and reduce
the maximum raise from 20 percent to 5 percent for all but a
handful of players. Players who previously would have qualified for
the Bird exception would be limited to raises of 7.5 percent. Under
the old deal, there was no limit.
	   Both systems would include a maximum salary rule, a lengthened
rookie salary scale and small increases in the minimum salary for
veterans.
	   The owners offered some movement on two of those provisions:
	   _ On maximum salaries, they went from asking that no new
contract include an average salary that exceeds 30 percent of the
cap (about dlrs 9.4 million in 1998-99) to asking that the
30-percent rule only cover the first year of the new contract, with
raises thereafter of either 5 percent or 7.5 percent.
	   In practical terms, that would mean a player who would have been
able to get a five-year, dlrs 47 million contract could now get a
five-year, dlrs 52 million contract.
	   _ Under their old proposal, the minimum salary for 10-year
veterans would be dlrs 575,000. Under the new offer, the minimum
would be dlrs 750,000.

A quarter of the way home, things are as they should be
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Despite all the quarterback injuries, things are
more or less as they're supposed to be one month into the National
Football League season.
	   Green Bay, San Francisco and Denver are unbeaten, the Packers
for the first time since 1966, when Vince Lombardi was in charge.
So are Jacksonville, Miami, Minnesota and New Orleans.
	   New Orleans? Well the Saints' three victories have come over
teams with a combined record of 1-10.
	   Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf are struggling the way all young
quarterbacks must. Manning threw the interception Sunday that led
to New Orleans' 19-13 overtime win over Indianapolis. Leaf was
lifted after throwing four interceptions in a 34-16 loss to the
Giants.
	   A look at the NFL season thus far:
	    &UR; AFC &QC; 
	   Is there any reason why Denver can't repeat?
	   The Broncos (4-0) have won their last two with Bubby Brister
doing most of the work for John Elway (sore hamstring), and have
outscored opponents 141-77.
	   Still, the AFC is by far the deeper conference, which means if
Elway is gone much longer or if Terrell Davis is hurt, there
Broncos might have problems with Jacksonville, Kansas City,
Pittsburgh, New England, Miami and maybe even Seattle.
	   The Chiefs (3-1) have been winning despite injuries. The
Seahawks lost for the first time in Pittsburgh on Sunday, although
the 13-10 defeat was no disgrace after three wins by a combined
95-28 against three bad NFC East teams.
	   Jacksonville (4-0) is solid in the Central and it's a given that
the Steelers (3-1) will finish somewhere between 12-4 and 10-6.
Kordell Stewart still misses Chan Gailey, who left as offensive
coordinator and became head coach in Dallas, but he's slowly
adjusting to Ray Sherman, Gailey's replacement.
	   In the East, New England (2-1) seems to have found Curtis
Martin's replacement in Robert Edwards, although Edwards' injury
history is a little scary.
	   Miami? Jimmy Johnson's team is 3-0 with his running game and
defense working, but the Dolphins have been 3-0 in three of the
last four years and usually finished around 9-7. The Jets (1-2)
will also contend for a playoff spot.
	   But right now, the AFC means Denver, which seems to have no
post-Super Bowl letdown. Mike Shanahan won't let that happen.
	   Still, Denver was the frontrunner at this time last year, and
the Broncos ended up taking the wild-card route to the Super Bowl.
	   It's a long season.
	    &UR; NFC &QC; 
	   This is Green Bay, San Francisco and maybe Minnesota, just as it
was last season.
	   Despite New Orleans' 3-0 start, it's San Francisco all the way
in the West. The 49ers (3-0) took care of one upstart, Atlanta, on
Sunday, rolling up their third 500-yard game and finally getting
some pressure on a quarterback.
	   The score was 31-20, but it wasn't that close.
	   ``I said this was going to be a measuring stick to see where we
were,'' Dan Reeves said of his Falcons, who came in 2-0. ``As you
can see, we aren't there yet.''
	   Nor are the Saints or anyone else in the division.
	   ``Fortunately, they don't put parentheses with `pretty,' around
wins,'' Saints QB Danny Wuerffel said after completing a 44-yard
pass on fourth-and-17 to set up the tying TD with 41 seconds left
in regulation. Then he beat the Colts with a TD pass in overtime.
	   Minnesota (4-0) has been having trouble with weak teams on the
road, which doesn't bode well for its trip to Green Bay next Monday
night.
	   But the Packers have problems with their running game. Brett
Favre had a Brett Favre (early in his career) type of game Sunday
against Carolina: five TDs, three interceptions, 388 yards. And
Carolina, down 37-30, actually got a final pass into the end zone
that was tipped and almost caught.
	   ``I think this is the first time he's ever thrown more than 35
times in a game and we've won,'' coach Mike Holmgren said.
	   The East?
	   Someone might win there at 9-7 or 8-8.
	   The Giants and Cowboys (who lead the division with the Cards at
2-2) are the two best bets. But the Giants, who finally got some
turnovers against Ryan Leaf and the Chargers on Sunday, have a
tough schedule and need more of a running game.
	   The dark horse is Arizona, although the Cards haven't been
overly impressive in their two wins.

Relief arrives in Dominican town cut off by hurricane for six days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JARED KOTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN DE LA MAGUANA, Dominican Republic _ Hurricane victims
stranded by fallen bridges and washed-out roads waded into
subsiding waters Monday to guide the first relief trucks into this
western Dominican town.
	   Seventy-six people died in San Juan de la Maguana, a farm town
of about 20,000 people 75 miles (125 kilometers) west of Santo
Domingo, the Red Cross said. Local hospital officials said they had
documented 19 dead, but suspected that many more have been buried
by relatives.
	   In a small cemetery outside town, the graves of eight people
were marked by a two-foot-high (60-centimeter-high) mound covered
with red and purple flowers and crosses made of sticks. Nine other
storm victims were buried nearby.
	   San Juan de la Maguana had been incommunicado since Sept. 22,
when Hurricane Georges' rains caused floodwaters to crash through
the town, swallowing up shantytowns along the San Juan River.
	   Flooding was aggravated when workers at a dam upstream opened
floodgates to relieve pressure on the dam.
	   Residents said they had some warning but were unprepared for the
disaster.
	   ``They told us before it happened, but I didn't think it would
be this bad,'' said Alejandro Mateo, 68, who fled his yellow
clapboard house in the Monte de Oca neighborhood as the water rose.
The house now is filled with mud.
	   Until Monday, downed trees and bridges and raging streams
prevented rescuers from reaching the town by land or landing by
helicopter. Both the U.S. Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for
International Development had said getting to San Juan was a top
priority.
	   Children dashed across a field Monday to collect packets of
disaster supplies dropped by a small airplane buzzing the town.
Doctors waited anxiously for medical supplies to vaccinate
residents against diseases and prepared for a surge in dengue and
malaria, both carried by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.
	   Patients also were being vaccinated to prevent tetanus and
diphtheria, said hospital physician Idana Castillo.
	   Two flatbed trailers carrying 110-pound (50-kilogram) bags of
rice donated by Australia arrived Monday afternoon, and workers
prepared the trucks for a push across a flooded roadway leading to
town.
	   A barefoot boy squatted in the shade beneath one of the trucks,
collecting falling grains of rice in a tattered red baseball cap.
	   U.S. helicopters were expected to fly more supplies into the
area on Tuesday.
	   Georges killed more than 200 people in the Dominican Republic
and at least 94 in nearby Haiti as it spun westward through the
Caribbean last week.

Latest poll shows conservatives just ahead in Australian vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Just days ahead of Australia's Oct. 3
national election, Prime Minister John Howard's government has
nosed ahead of the opposition Labor Party in the latest opinion
poll released Tuesday.
	   But the race is so close that the government may not win the
election if the poll result is repeated on election day.
	   The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper shows
Howard's conservative coalition ahead of Labor with a primary vote
of 43 percent, compared to Labor's 42 percent. That marks a
reversal of the previous Newspoll survey a week earlier, which had
Labor at 43 percent and the coalition at 42 percent.
	   Newspoll surveyed 1,729 people on Sept. 26 and Sept. 27. No
margin of error was published, but it is generally between two and
three percent.
	   The poll also shows, however, that Labor continues to lead the
government on a two-party preferred basis, garnering 51 percent
support, while the government attracts 49 percent.
	   That would give Labor a narrow victory after the distribution of
preference votes from minor parties.
	   Under Australia's preferential voting system, if no candidate in
an electorate gains 50 percent of votes, the one with the fewest
votes is excluded.
	   That candidate's votes are transferred to the other candidates
according to the preferences shown on voting cards. The process
continues until one candidate has more than 50 percent of the votes
and is declared elected.
	   The Australian said the distribution of right-wing populist One
Nation party preferences would be vital to the outcome of the
election.
	   Another poll published this week put Labor one point ahead of
the coalition with 50.5 percent of the primary vote against 49.5
percent for the coalition.
	   Labor needs a swing to it of about 4 percent nationally to win
the 27 electorates which would deliver the party government.
	   Labor's most senior strategist Gary Gray on Monday said Labor
would have to pull off the biggest political comeback in Australian
history to win Saturday's election.
	   No party had won more than eight seats after one term in
opposition, he said.

Iranian papers banned for insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A Tehran press court on Monday banned two
Iranian publications for insulting the late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iranian television reported.
	   The court revoked the publishing licenses of the daily Tous and
the monthly Jameah-e Salem. The owner of the monthly was given a
five-year suspended jail sentence for ``publishing lies, insulting
the state authorities, and distorting the utterances'' of Khomeini,
who died in 1989, the station said. It gave no further details.
	   The case against the daily Zan, on charges of ``publishing lies,
defaming public figures and causing public concern,'' was adjourned
to allow further investigations, said the TV, monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Zan, or Woman, is owned by Faezeh Hashemi, daughter of former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
	   Authorities had already shut down Tous temporarily for allegedly
publishing articles ``detrimental to national interests.'' Three of
its senior staffers have also been arrested since the paper closed
on Sept. 16.
	   Tous angered hard-liners with its anti-war stance. The newspaper
has called for a diplomatic solution rather than military strikes
in the conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
	   The newspaper also angered hard-liners by questioning the
authority of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual guide.
	   The deputy director and an editor of Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency were also arrested earlier this month but
later released.
	   They were detained after a hard-line official filed a complaint
with a Tehran court.
	   Khamenei, also a hard-liner, has called on the judiciary to deal
with what he calls ``the abuse of press freedom'' by the media.

Mexican stocks end higher; peso strengthens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Expectations that the Federal Reserve will
cut U.S. interests rates this week helped Mexican stocks withstand
a late bout of selling and close higher, along with the peso.
	   The market's key IPC index closed up 0.4 percent, or 13.49
points, to 3,717.18 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood at
5,229.35.
	   The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is expected to lower
interest rates when it meets Tuesday, which would favor emerging
markets, traders said.
	   In Mexico City on 48-hour spot dollar markets, banking leader
Banamex quoted the peso closing at a midrate of 10.11 per dollar,
weaker from its open of 10.075 per dollar but stronger from
Friday's 10.12 close.
	   Spreads at the close were 10.1 to 10.12 compared with 10.105 to
10.135 on Friday.
	   In Mexican peso futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, December contracts ended at 10.8021 after closing Friday
at 10.7585.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Flavio Conceicao and Elber are
back. Ronaldo isn't, yet.
	   There were a few surprises on the Brazilian soccer team
announced Monday by Coach Wanderley Luxemburgo for an exhibition
game with Ecuador Oct. 14 in Washington, D.C.
	   Striker Elber of Bayern Munich and midfielder Flavio Conceicao
of Spain's Deportivo La Coruna will return to the team after an
absence of many months.
	   Defenders Anderson of Santos and Cesar of Portugesa were named
for the first time, part of Luxemburgo's campaign to renew and
rejuvenate the team.
	   Ronaldo was not called. The two-time player of the year
reportedly has knee pains and has not played for his club, Inter of
Milan.
	   Most of the 22 players were on Luxemburgo's first team, which
tied 1-1 with Yugoslavia this month.
	   Player and clubs:
	   Goalies: Andre (Internacional) and Rogerio (Sao Paulo)
	   Defenders: Cafu (Roma), Felipe (Vasco), Serginho (Sao Paulo),
Cris (Corinthians), Antonio Carlos (Roma), Cesar (Portuguesa),
Odvan (Vasco), Anderson (Santos)
	   Midfielders: Alex (Palmeiras), Rogerio (Palmeiras), Vampeta
(Corinthians), Marcos Assumpcao (Flamengo), Jackson (Sport), Flavio
Conceicao (Deportivo La Coruna), Marcelinho (Corinthians) and
Rivaldo (Barcelona)
	   Forwards: Elber (Bayern Munich), Fabio Junior (Cruzeiro),
Christian (Internacional), Denilson (Betis),

Foreigners demand TVs at Panamanian prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Twenty foreigners imprisoned in Panama began
a hunger strike Monday to demand that legal proceedings against
them be speeded up and for permission to keep televisions and
radios in their cells.
	   The prisoners, who include Colombians, one Israeli and one Costa
Rican, called on their Panamanian counterparts to join the strike
but the Panamanians declined, the Government and Justice Ministry
said in a statement.
	   Authorities said security restrictions do not allow electronic
equipment in jail cells.
	   The inmates on strike at the La Joyita prison, 40 kilometers (25
miles) east of the capital, mostly are jailed on drug-trafficking
charges, radio reports said.
	   Some 80 percent of the 1,300 inmates are awaiting trial, local
newspapers reported.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks gave up sharp early gains and turned
mixed Monday in advance of a meeting of Federal Reserve
policy-makers that is expected to lower interest rates in a bid to
revive the global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average, which
rose 133.11 points last week, added as much as 131.56 in the early
going before giving up some of its gains. It closed up 80.07, or by
1 percent, at a one-month high of 8,108.84. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
expressing alarm about a deteriorating world economy, Fed
policy-makers are expected to cut interest rates for the first time
in nearly three years on Tuesday. While they don't believe the
outcome of the Fed's meeting is in doubt, private economists said
Monday that the big question is how much success the world's most
powerful central bank will have in containing a currency crisis
that so far has proven unstoppable. Emphasizing the sense or
urgency, international monetary authorities were busy working
behind the scenes on a rescue package for Brazil. The largest
economy in South America is being hit by the same panicked rush to
the exits by foreign investors that has already flattened a number
of Asian countries and Russia. (US-FINANCIAL CRISIS)
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Battered by a never-ending Asian
crisis, Brazil is looking for some good news this week at the
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington
D.C. The government's economic team heads to Washington on Tuesday
amid rumors that a major loan package is in the works to avert a
possibly disastrous devaluation of the Brazilian real. One estimate
puts the loan package for Brazil at dlrs 30 billion. Another says
dlrs 50 billion will be earmarked for all of Latin America. But
after a costly bailout for Russia, it's not clear how much the IMF
can come up with, or whether the Group of Seven industrialized
countries will pitch in. (BRAZIL-IMF)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In a blow to market-oriented economic reforms, the
country's tough-talking tax chief was fired Monday, the last step
in a purge that leaves only one of the previous Cabinet's young
reformers remaining in the government. Boris Fyodorov, who strongly
supported economic reform and opposed printing new money, had
promised to get tough on tax deadbeats in an effort to fill the
country's empty coffers. Also dumped was acting Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko, who advocated tightening control over
government spending and cutting down waste. The firings were
announced during a meeting between Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and President Boris Yeltsin aimed at completing a new Cabinet, a
process that has already taken three weeks, and is still not
finished. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German industry leaders voiced concern
Monday that the left's election victory threatened the economy, but
the stock market welcomed the prospect of a stable government under
future chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Schroeder, a Social Democrat,
said Monday he would seek a coalition with the environmentalist
Greens as junior partner _ a shock for organized industry, which
strongly backed defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl. ``I believe, as I
always have, that the Greens are an anti-industry party,'' said
Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German Chamber of Industry and
Commerce. The Frankfurt Stock Exchange took a more favorable view,
though, ending the day 2 percent higher. (GERMANY-ELECTION
INDUSTRY)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria's prime minister said Monday the
government would stick to its massive program of privatization,
assuring that the nation's disgruntled main union would be
consulted along the way. ``We will continue to implement reforms,''
Ahmed Ouyahia said after marathon 19-hour talks with Abdelmadjid
Sidi-Said, head of the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA),
Algeria's largest union. ``We will continue privatization within
the framework of the law, transparently and with dialogue,'' he
added. Unemployment is already around 30 percent of the active
population, and the government's program of privatizing state
industries, under the pressure of the International Monetary Fund,
is translating into further job losses. (ALGERIA-ECONOMY)

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sharon Stone is only playing a mom in a new
movie. The actress is denying published reports she's pregnant.
	   Citing friends of the actress, the New York Post reported Monday
that Stone, married less than a year, is in her first trimester.
	   Stone begged to differ.
	   ``Not only am I not pregnant, but it is the exterior of my body
that is my public image and therefore available to the press,'' she
said Monday. ``This place in my heart and my body is my own. I
suggest the press back up to a dignified and respectful place.''
	   Stone, 40, who became a star after her steamy role in ``Basic
Instinct'', plays the mother of a young, handicapped genius in the
upcoming movie ``The Mighty.''
	   The actress married San Francisco Examiner executive editor Phil
Bronstein in February.
	   ``I'm ready for motherhood because I've found the perfect
partner,'' Stone told a British magazine in May. ``So we make love
every single moment that we get a chance.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A Tommy Hilfiger ad campaign that included a
picture of a model sitting on a desk in a fake Oval Office will be
changed to remove any future reference to the White House.
	   In a letter to the designer, the White House legal office asked
that the ads be changed because of a longstanding policy that the
White House not be used for advertising purposes.
	   The request was not prompted by the controversy surrounding
President Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, White
House spokeswoman Amy Weiss said Monday.
	   The ads, previewing the designer's fashion fall line, began
appearing in the September issues of some magazines, including
Vanity Fair, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar, GQ and Forbes.
	   Ruth Pachman, a spokeswoman for the Tommy Hilfiger company, said
the campaign was not intended to be a political statement.
	   ``It was designed to capture the positive spirit of American
democracy,'' she said. ``It was meant to be a tribute.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hindus who criticized Madonna for her
revealing clothing were not looking deeply enough, some Hindu
scholars say.
	   ``Hinduism is a religion of tolerance,'' Acharya Vageesh
Shastri, one of the most respected scholars in the Hindu holy city
of Varanasi, said Sunday. ``One should have the vision to look
beyond her transparent tops. Her interior is more appealing than
her exterior.''
	   The World Vaishnava Association had issued a statement
condemning Madonna for wearing a holy facial marking along with
``clothes through which her nipples were clearly visible and while
gyrating in a sexually suggestive manner'' during the Sept. 10 MTV
Video Music Awards.
	   B.N. Chaturvedi, another Varanasi scholar who praised Madonna
for her pronunciation of Sanskrit prayers she wove into a pop song,
dismissed her critics as an ``unknown organization run by people
with doubtful credentials.''
	   Hindus range from fundamentalists to reformers. No central
hierarchy has the final word on doctrine.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SANTA MONICA, California (AP) _ Elizabeth Taylor was greeted
with shouts of ``We love you, Liz!'' when she arrived on the arm of
Magic Johnson for an AIDS fund-raising gala Saturday night.
	   ``Now is the time for guts and God'' in beating the AIDS virus,
Miss Taylor told the crowd.
	   Johnson, who was at the height of his basketball career with the
National Basketball Association's Los Angeles Lakers in 1991 when
he announced he had contracted the AIDS virus, introduced Miss
Taylor as ``the queen.'' Supermodel Christy Turlington called her a
woman ``who has taught the world a lesson in compassion.''
	   The Oscar-winning actress, who has long been involved with AIDS
charities, last year gave dlrs 100,000 to an AIDS organization,
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ About 2,000 minks were set free by
saboteurs from a fur farm in northern Sweden overnight Monday, the
Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   No arrests were immediately made, but suspicion fell on
animal-rights activists. About 1,000 minks were set free earlier
this month from the farm in Sundsvall, 350 kilometers (210 miles)
north of Stockholm, by vandals who scrawled ``DBF'' _ the Swedish
acronym for Animal Liberation Front.
	   Animal-rights groups also this month set free some 8,000 minks
from a farm in Britain and another 4,000 were released from their
cages in Finland.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Israel Lopez, the Grammy winner credited with
creating the mambo, is the newest member of the Latin Jazz Hall of
Fame.
	   Lopez, 81, who goes by the stage name ``Cachao,'' joins drummer
Mongo Santamaria, who was the hall of fame's first inductee last
year.
	   Lopez was inducted at the 2nd Annual Los Angeles Latin Jazz
Festival, Con Ritmo y Sabor ceremony Saturday night at the
Universal Ampitheatre. The event was sponsored by the Latin Jazz
Institute and hosted by actor Andy Garcia, said publicist Regina
Chaney.
	   The Latin Jazz Institute started the festival in response to the
growing popularity of Latin Jazz among Los Angeles residents.
	   Lopez was born in Havana in 1918 and began playing the bass at
age 9. He entered the Havana Philharmonic Orchestra when he was 12.
In 1938, Lopez and his brother created the mambo, according to
Chaney.

Booming ethnic supermarkets offer best of both worlds

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Eddie Fung strolls through the aisles of the
99 Ranch Market, a jar of hot Korean bean paste and preserved duck
eggs in shrink wrap tucked in beside a bag of Lay's potato chips
and a six-pack of Coca-Cola.
	   ``You see these,'' Fung said, pulling a jar of pickled radishes
from the basket. ``Before, I could only get these in Taiwan. Now I
just drive five minutes and I can buy as much as I want.''
	   Sprawling ethnic supermarkets like 99 Ranch have sprung up
across Southern California and elsewhere around the country,
catering not only to immigrants who miss the taste of home, but
also to other Americans whose tastes grow ever more adventurous.
	   A far cry from the old ethnic market on the corner, these
mammoth markets carry a full line of traditional groceries, the
Haagen-Dazs ice cream sitting beside frozen Chinese dumplings.
	   Retail sales of ethnic foods in the United States have steadily
increased from dlrs 208.9 million in 1992 to dlrs 272.2 million in
1996 and could reach dlrs 383 million by 2001, according to the New
York-based market research firm Packaged Facts.
	   With that much money at stake, conventional U.S. grocery chains
are jumping into the fray, turning over more shelf space to Asian
and Hispanic specialties.
	   ``Supermarkets are recognizing the people they service now are
different from 10 years ago,'' said Todd Turner, director of urban
affairs and diversity programs for the Food Marketing Institute,
based in Washington.
	   ``They have to offer products and services to meet those needs.
It's happening all over the country. They've recognized the
spending power of Asians, blacks and other minorities,'' Turner
said.
	   The Buena Park, California-based 99 Ranch, which carries the
cuisine of a variety of Asian cultures, has 25 stores in
California, Hawaii, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, and does some dlrs
200 million in annual sales. The stores are mostly situated in
areas with a large Asian immigrant population, but they draw a wide
range of customers.
	   ``I see 10 years from now the merchandise mix between Western
and Asian goods will level out to reflect the changing society,''
said Roger Chen, president and founder of 99 Ranch chain. ``It will
really be a healthy competition.''
	   In 1984, a year after Chen immigrated from Taiwan, he found
himself longing for foods from home. He figured there were plenty
of people just like himself so he opened his first market, stocking
a variety of Asian items as well as traditional American fare.
	   Chen credits the immigration boom in Southern California during
the 1980s for much of his stores' success.
	   ``Before, the traditional markets didn't pay much attention to
Asian products,'' Chen said. ``But since we've been growing pretty
smoothly the last ten years they are now paying a little more
attention and they try to carry some in their stores.''
	   It's happening at Vons, one of the largest traditional
supermarket chains in Southern California, which now stocks ethnic
goods like Japanese yakisoba noodles, Korean kim chee, tofu and
Chinese dumpling wrappers.
	   ``Our trends indicate a growth in ethnic products and we're
responding to that,'' said Brian Dowling, a spokesman for Vons.
``We'd be foolish not to.''
	   Shoppers agree.
	   ``It's good to have a variety of foods,'' said Janice Faney,
eyeing some Japanese udon noodles at a Vons in suburban South
Pasadena. ``It's not uncommon now to see an assortment of foods
from different cultures at the market. People like to try new
things.''

Stock market volatility will slow merger frenzy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERIC R. QUINONES &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ After the bull market drove mergers to dizzying
heights, the stock market's summer swoon will likely force
dealmakers to the sidelines.
	   Wall Street's plunge since mid-July has erased all of this
year's gains and undercut the lofty stock prices that have paid for
1998's record-high mergers. As investors struggle to determine
whether turmoil in Asia and Russia will infect the American
economy, the blistering pace of mergers is expected to cool.
	   ``As long as the market stays very volatile, I think deal
activity generally is going to slow down a lot,'' said Rob Kindler,
a takeover partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore.
	   Merger professionals and analysts say it is too soon to judge
whether dealmaking has slowed in response to the market's recent
decline, since August is normally a slow month for mergers with so
many people taking vacations.
	   But the mergers that did occur last month showed a sharp rise in
cash deals, which is expected to become a rising trend if stocks
slide further.
	   Of the U.S. mergers announced in August, 47.6 percent were cash
deals, up from 41.7 for the first seven months of the year,
according to Mergerstat, a division of Los Angeles investment bank
Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin.
	   ``If the market continues to go down and interest rates continue
to go down, which has been the case, I don't think there's any
question that we'll find a lot of cash deals at the end of this
year and early next year,'' Kindler said.
	   The risks associated with stock swaps, which had seemed minimal
during the market's meteoric rise over the past few years, are
highlighted by the billions of dollars in value slashed from many
of this year's megamergers.
	   Most notably, the Travelers-Citicorp deal was worth dlrs 70
billion _ the richest deal ever _ when announced in April, but has
plunged to dlrs 44.3 billion and dropped to fourth on the all-time
list. The current No. 1 deal, SBC Communications' merger with
Ameritech, itself has dropped from dlrs 62 billion when announced
in May to about dlrs 56 billion.
	   If stocks fall far enough, deals may have to be revalued or
scrapped altogether.
	   In another megadeal from this year, Wells Fargo agreed in June
to a dlrs 34 billion merger with rival bank Norwest that is now
worth dlrs less than 25 billion because Norwest's shares have
skidded. But Norwest spokesman Larry Haeg said the deal had no
provisions to adjust the terms if Norwest stock declined and the
merger is proceeding as planned.
	   The stock market closed up 80.07 points at 8,108.84 on Monday,
still down 1,229 points, or 13.2 percent, from its July 17 peak of
9,337.97.

Chile's privatized pension funds system has advise for others,
</HEADLINE>
self &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Seventeen years after privatizing its
pension funds system, Chile may have some advise for other nations
adopting or planning a similar change.
	   But the Chilean experience, while generally considered
successful, also needs corrections, including cutting management
costs, experts say.
	   Since the private system was established in 1981 by the former
military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, it has accumulated dlrs
31 billion _ in a country with a GNP of dlrs 83 billion _ from
deposits by workers and interest earnings.
	   The old state-owned and -managed system was abandoned because
over the years it became broke. Critics say it was too dependent on
the condition of the nation's finances, especially on the fiscal
deficit which in the '70s was large in most Latin American
countries. It was also seriously affected by galloping inflation,
which reached more than 600 percent annually in Chile in the
mid-70s.
	   In the new privatized system, the funds are managed by 12
private companies known as Administrators of Pension Funds, or
AFPs, and workers may freely pick which one they want to send up to
13 percent of their monthly salaries to feed their retirement
funds.
	   The AFPs invest in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments
at home and abroad, under regulation of a government agency called
Superintendency of AFPs.
	   Returns to the investments boomed to 12 percent a year until
five years ago, but since then they have dropped consistently and
posted a 1.7 percent loss during the first half of this year.
	   Superintendent of AFPs Julio Bustamante attributed the decline
to a slower pace of the Chilean economy which is expected to grow
by around 5 percent in 1998, compared to over 7 percent annually in
recent years.
	   Experts point out that the law that created the system took into
account the volatility of markets and set rules to prevent excess
risks. Among them is a provision that requires that a large portion
of the money be invested in ``fixed income instruments,'' with
yields guaranteed by the state after a certain time and immune to
markets' fluctuations.
	   Pedro Corona, who heads an association of AFPs, called the
system ``the engine that has fueled Chile's development and one of
the biggest social reforms ever made'' in the country.
	   Bustamante and others agree that corrections are needed in a
system that has been or is being implemented in other Latin
American nations, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru,
Mexico, and El Salvador.
	   Reducing management costs, increasing investments abroad and
finding a wider variety of investments at home are needed to
perfect the system, said Bustamante's deputy, Andres Cuneo. Also
pressing is adopting special safeguards for the funds of workers in
the final years of their work life.
	   Workers have freedom to move from one AFP to another, which
creates competition among the AFPs to attract them. Some were known
to offer bicycles and other presents to lure customers.
	   But the practice, Cuneo told The Associated Press, has led the
AFPs to spend much money for marketing, thus making their
administration costs to skyrocket.
	   ``An estimated 3 percent of the money deposited by workers is
actually a fee they pay to the AFP for administering their money,''
he said, and the competition for clients is mostly responsible for
that.
	   The Superintendency recently took steps to reduce administrative
spending by the AFPs, especially by making switching from one AFP
to another more difficult, ``but not prohibiting it, as the basis
of the system is freedom of choice,'' Cuneo said.
	   At retirement age _ 65 for men and 60 for women _ workers can
use their accumulated funds to calculate a monthly pension, or
leave the income linked to the performance of those funds in the
market.
	   Most workers choose the first option, and monthly pensions in
the private system equal up to 80 percent of the workers' average
monthly salary in the last three years prior to retirement. This is
almost twice as much as it was in the old state-run system.
	   Despite the obvious results, Jorge Millan, a leader of the
Central Workers Federation, said one criticism of the system
remains: Workers should have a bigger say in the way their funds
are invested.

Howard endorses view that big Aboriginal land councils are
</HEADLINE>
`bloodsuckers' &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Racial politics, never far below the
surface in Australia, erupted into the national campaign Tuesday
when Prime Minister John Howard endorsed his deputy's attack on
large Aboriginal agencies as ``bureaucratic bloodsucking''
organizations.
	   On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called the Alice
Springs-based Central Land Council and the Darwin-based Northern
Land Council ``giant bureaucratic bloodsucking land councils which
take away from smaller communities resources and flexible
infrastructure and leadership.''
	   Aboriginal land councils advise the government on the allocation
of grants and resources for Aboriginal health, welfare, and other
projects.
	   Howard on Tuesday backed the thrust of Fischer's attack, saying:
``I haven't seen what Tim said but he's right when he wants the
resources available for indigenous people to go to them rather than
to bureaucracies.''
	   The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC),
which represents the interests of Aborigines on a national level,
demanded an apology from Fischer.
	   ``Mr. Howard can't talk about reconciliation one day and excuse
this type of language from his deputy the next.
	   ``His remarks do nothing for race relations in this country.
They demean the office of deputy prime minister,'' ATSIC chairman
Gatjil Djerrkura said.
	   Opposition leader Kim Beazley said he was sorry Fischer had
resorted to such language in the final days of the campaign for
Saturday's election.
	   ``I think Mr. Fischer faces terrible struggles on many fronts
but he does not need to break away and make an intemperate
statement,'' Beazley said.
	   The 350,000 or so Aborigines among Australia's 18 million people
are collectively the poorest and least healthy minority in the
country, with the highest rates of unemployment, high infant
mortality and much shorter life spans.
	   Two new polls on Tuesday show Howard's governing conservatives
and the Labor Party opposition in a dead heat before Saturday's
election, with a hung Parliament a possibility.
	   The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed
Howard's conservative coalition edging ahead of Beazley's Labor
Party by 43-42 percent, but with a margin of error of 2.3 percent.
	   Meanwhile, The Bulletin news magazine poll put the conservatives
at 40 percent and Labor at 39 percent, with a 2 percent margin of
error.
	   But with the right-wing populist One Nation party polling at 7
percent, the Australian Democrats at 8 percent in both polls, there
is a possibility that neither the conservatives nor Labor will win
a majority in the House of Representatives, where government is
formed.
	   To win government, Labor would have to take 27 House seats away
from Howard's ruling conservative coalition.
	   On Monday, the Labor party's most senior strategist said Labor
would have to pull off the biggest political comeback in Australian
history to win Saturday's election.
	   Labor national secretary Gary Gray said no party had won more
than eight seats back after one term in opposition.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Swiss VX tests negative, French tests incomplete, sources say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Swiss tests of Iraqi missile warheads
suspected of containing the deadly nerve agent VX have turned up
negative, diplomatic sources said Monday.
	   Similar tests in France aren't complete, but may contradict
results of a U.S. army laboratory which disclosed in June that
scientists had determined missile fragments contained traces of the
gas.
	   The Swiss results are a blow to the United Nations and in
particular the United States, which had held the U.S. results as
clear evidence that Iraq had been untruthful about its chemical
weapons program.
	   Iraq, which has had to endure seven years of intrusive U.N.
weapons inspections, has admitted it tried to make VX but has
denied it was ever able to make enough of it or stabilize it
sufficiently to load into weapons.
	   A few drops of the nerve agent can be fatal.
	   The Swiss tests were conducted on fragments taken from the same
location as the parts tested in the U.S. laboratory and turned up
negative, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector has said that even if the
European tests are negative, Iraq still has to answer for the U.S.
tests, which were conducted at the Aberdeen Proving ground in
Maryland.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify Iraq has destroyed its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range missiles to
deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift crippling
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The test results are contained in a report given to Butler by a
team of experts who gathered at U.N. headquarters late last week to
review the data from the laboratories.
	   Butler was considering whether to release the report to the
Security Council or wait to include it in a six-month report on the
status of inspections that he is set to prepare next week, U.N.
officials said.

	   SAPPORO, Japan (AP) _ Torao Kano thought he had enough money put
aside for a comfortable retirement, without having to depend on his
children for support.
	   But when Hokkaido Takushoku Bank failed in November, the economy
began a slow meltdown. Companies that depended on the bank for
loans went under when it ran out of money. Kano, who is 72, had
invested dlrs 37,000 in one of those companies.
	   ``It was money I was saving in case I got sick,'' he said. ``Now
I don't know what I'll do. I have a daughter, but she has her own
life. That money was everything to me.''
	   Possibly nowhere has Japan's financial crisis been felt more
sharply than on Hokkaido, a northern Japanese island where the
economy has always been particularly vulnerable to downward slides.
	   Sapporo, Hokkaido's biggest city, is one of Japan's most
inviting. With wide streets and a flower-filled promenade running
through its center, the city is a refreshing change from crowded
Tokyo.
	   The demise last November of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank devastated
the regional economy. Hundreds of companies have failed, and tens
of thousands have lost their jobs.
	   ``The collapse of the bank cut the main artery of the Hokkaido
economy,'' said Kazuo Toda, chairman of Hokkaido Economic
Federation. ``It may take 10 years to recover.''
	   It could also be an omen for the rest of Japan.
	   Around the world, financial markets are watching to see how
Tokyo will clean up its banking crisis. On Monday, Japan's ruling
party announced it had reached a final agreement with the major
opposition parties on a key set of bills to clean up about dlrs 1
trillion of bad debt in the banking sector.
	   The two sides agreed that any bank whose capital falls while
purchasing an ailing bank that has been nationalized will be
eligible for public funds.
	   At the center of the political debate in Tokyo is whether banks
foundering under bad loans should be allowed to collapse, a process
advocates say will, in the long-run, weed out weak institutions and
thus strengthen the banking sector.
	   Opponents say that is too harsh and that the government should
help prop up the banks. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and his ruling
party, conscious of the immediate impact on voters when banks fail,
tend to support the latter approach.
	   Hokkaido is an example of the kind of impact they fear.
	   Since the Takushoku Bank failed, the unemployment rate on
Hokkaido has hit a postwar high of 4.7 percent, compared to 4.2
percent nationally.
	   At the government-run employment center in Sapporo, there are
four job seekers for every job offer _ twice as many as a year ago.
	   ``It may not look so bad by international standards, but in
Japan we've never experienced unemployment like this before,'' said
Hirokatsu Sato, an employment agency official. ``It has been very
difficult.''
	   Of nearly 700 bankruptcies this year on Hokkaido, the Takushoku
Bank failure was a major factor in 40 percent, said Toshihiko
Yamazaki, director of Tokyo Shoko Research, Ltd.
	   ``It has become impossible for many of the companies that
borrowed money to find new lenders,'' he said. ``The credit crunch
has been very severe.''
	   That the collapse of one bank could trigger a series of failures
highlights the delicate dilemma Japan's leaders face in repairing a
financial system teetering under as much as dlrs 1 trillion in bad
loans.
	   Before its demise, the Takushoku Bank was Hokkaido's largest and
most prestigious lender.
	   To be a client was a sign a company had made it. In Japan's
business world, such relationships are often more important than
collateral or profits.
	   When their main lender went bust, many companies on Hokkaido
were left with nothing.
	   The government has ordered Sapporo-based North Pacific Bank to
take over Takushoku's healthy clients. But it has been reluctant to
welcome the weaker ones.
	   Even smaller companies that had no ties to the bank were hurt.
	   ``Sales started falling almost immediately after (Takushoku
Bank) said it would close,'' said 63-year-old Motohiro Ito, a
clothing store owner in downtown Sapporo. ``Almost everyone knows
of someone who could lose their job or has a friend whose son has
been looking for work.''

	   _HOW IT STARTED: Banks financed speculative real estate projects
in the late 1980s that have fallen in value by as much as 80
percent. Economists worry that moving to clean up bad loans could
drive the real estate market even lower by flooding it with bargain
properties.
	   _CREDIT CRUNCH: Japan's banks have cut back on new lending. Big
companies can raise money by issuing stock or selling bonds, but
small- and medium-sized firms rely almost exclusively on bank loans
to finance their operations. Smaller firms have been failing in
record numbers.
	   _COST: Cleaning up mess could cost taxpayers dlrs 382 billion,
more than the U.S. savings and loan fiasco of 1980s. There is
debate over whether taxpayer money should be used for clean up.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ They called it The Most, but a bold move to offer
long-distance callers unlimited evening and weekend service for a
flat, monthly fee of $20 proved to be Too Much for Sprint Canada.
	   The alternative long-distance company scaled back its wildly
popular discount plan Monday after receiving complaints about
constant busy signals on a clogged telephone network.
	   The flat-rate pricing scheme, introduced in July and copied by
most of Sprint's competitors, has led some people to keep their
phone lines constantly busy, either through marathon chats or a
binge on the Internet.
	   As of next Monday, Sprint callers will be limited to a maximum
of 800 minutes a month for calls made inside Canada during off-peak
hours. Any calls made above that limit will cost 10 cents a minute.
	   ---
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The new agency managing Canada's blood supply
officially took control of collection and distribution Monday with
a mandate to ensure ``the tragedies of the past don't happen
again.''
	   The blood system is ``as safe as any system can be, but it can
never be 100 per cent safe,'' said Lynda Cranston, chief executive
officer of Canadian Blood Services, which replaces the Canadian Red
Cross Society.
	   Cranston _ a former cable industry executive _ told a national
satellite-linked news conference there will be an ``open,
transparent and accountable'' way of giving Canadians the ``gift of
life.''
	   The agency, which has an estimated operating budget of $350
million a year, receives provincial and territorial funding. It
will operate at arm's length from the government so its
``responsibility is to the consumer, and not the government,''
Cranston added.
	   It will work closely with Hema-Quebec, Quebec's blood-supply
body which also began operations Monday.
	   ---
	   VANCOUVER (AP) _ The commercial fishing industry as it now
exists in British Columbia is finished, says a report prepared for
the David Suzuki Foundation.
	   ``We all have to recognize that it's over,'' Terry Glavin, who
wrote the report for the Vancouver-based environmental group, said
Monday.
	   ``The conventional industrial fisheries on this coast are
gone.''
	   The report comes near the end of another troubled salmon-fishing
season here, with hundreds of boats tied to the dock because of
drastic fishing restrictions to preserve threatened coho salmon
stocks.
	   Salmon returns have been disappointing for years and some stocks
have already experienced East Coast-style collapse, said Glavin.
	   His report also recommends replacing the Canada-U.S. Pacific
Salmon Treaty, because it is unworkable. Glavin wants a new
agreement whose priority is conservation instead of divvying up the
West Coast salmon catch.
	   ---
	   VICTORIA (AP) _ Canada continues to roll over and do nothing to
help hundreds of animals facing extinction, protesters pushing for
federal endangered species legislation said Monday.
	   About 150 people, some wearing fur bear masks and paper salmon
heads, chanted ``Save our species'' outside a hotel where federal
and provincial wildlife ministers were meeting.
	   Wildlife artist Robert Bateman said there are 307 animal species
on the national endangered list, but the federal government appears
afraid to offer them protection.
	   Canada needs a strong federal law to protect endangered grizzly
bears, Vancouver Island marmots and Pacific salmon stocks, he said.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ The federal government won't tap into the rich
Employment Insurance fund without giving Canadians a chance to talk
about it, Finance Minister Paul Martin said Monday.
	   Martin also denied reports he submitted to cabinet a formal
proposal to use the fund, expected to hit $20 billion by next
spring.
	   But the minister did acknowledge discussing the idea with
cabinet colleagues.
	   Martin spent much of the day explaining himself after word
leaked he's been eyeing the fund's huge surplus to ensure he
delivers on promises of lower taxes, a lower federal debt and more
spending on health and education.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Three veterans of the Second World War Merchant
Navy began a hunger strike Monday to win government benefits for
themselves and their former comrades.
	   But Veterans Affairs Minister Fred Mifflin, himself a retired
admiral, said they won't get the money they want.
	   The three, Ozzie Osbourne, Rudolph Hope and Ward Duke, all in
their 70s, want payments of $20,000 for each of the surviving
Merchant Navy vets or surviving spouses.
	   The money is intended to make up for the benefits denied the
merchant seamen in the years immediately after the war.

South Korean bank clerks vow strike after talks break down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bank union leaders failed to reach
agreement with management representatives in overnight negotiations
over layoffs Tuesday, setting the stage for a strike by employees
of five major South Korean commercial banks.
	   Riot police, armed with helmets and batons, were deployed to
guard the head and branch offices of the five financially shaky
banks which have been ordered by the government to restructure or
face closure or merger.
	   A key part of the restructuring involves layoffs.
	   ``We did our best but were unable to reach agreement on the
extent of layoffs,'' said Chu Kyong-su, head of the Korea
Federation of Bank and Financial Unions, after six hours of
overnight negotiations.
	   ``It's regrettable that the unions are shortsighted and did not
see the reality,'' said Ryu Si-yul, who represented the managers.
	   Less than two hours before the banks were to open for business,
7,000 unionized bank clerks continued a rally at a Roman Catholic
church in downtown Seoul, vowing to go on strike as scheduled.
	   But a fissure emerged in their ranks as the unions of four banks
_ Korea First, Kangwon, Chungbuk, and Peace _ accepted layoff
proposals by their managers and agreed to return to work.
	   Five banks facing strikes include Chohung, Hanil, Korea
Commercial, Korea Exchange and Seoul. Together, they have 17,000
unionized employees.
	   A major point of disagreement was a proposal by the managers to
cut total manpower by 33 percent by the end of this year but with
an offer of enhanced severance pay.
	   The unions demanded that the layoffs be spread over three years
with bigger financial compensation.
	   Restructuring its bloated, inefficient banking sector is a key
promise South Korea has made in return for a dlrs 58 billion
economic bailout provided by the International Monetary Fund in
December.
	   Five banks were closed earlier as part of the restructuring.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments. Their lending was frequently affected
by political and government policies.
	   When dozens of financially shaky businesses collapsed late last
year, many banks were left with piles of non-performing loans. That
eroded investor confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.

Latest poll shows conservatives just ahead in Australian vote

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Just days ahead of Australia's Oct. 3
national election, Prime Minister John Howard's government has
nosed ahead of the opposition Labor Party in the latest opinion
poll released Tuesday.
	   But the race is so close that the government may not win the
election if the poll result is repeated on election day.
	   The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper shows
Howard's conservative coalition ahead of Labor with a primary vote
of 43 percent, compared to Labor's 42 percent. That marks a
reversal of the previous Newspoll survey a week earlier, which had
Labor at 43 percent and the coalition at 42 percent.
	   Newspoll surveyed 1,729 people on Sept. 26 and Sept. 27. No
margin of error was published, but it is generally between two and
three percent.
	   The poll also shows, however, that Labor continues to lead the
government on a two-party preferred basis, garnering 51 percent
support, while the government attracts 49 percent.
	   That would give Labor a narrow victory after the distribution of
preference votes from minor parties.
	   Under Australia's preferential voting system, if no candidate in
an electorate gains 50 percent of votes, the one with the fewest
votes is excluded.
	   That candidate's votes are transferred to the other candidates
according to the preferences shown on voting cards. The process
continues until one candidate has more than 50 percent of the votes
and is declared elected.
	   The Australian said the distribution of right-wing populist One
Nation party preferences would be vital to the outcome of the
election.
	   Another poll published this week put Labor one point ahead of
the coalition with 50.5 percent of the primary vote against 49.5
percent for the coalition.
	   Labor needs a swing to it of about 4 percent nationally to win
the 27 electorates which would deliver the party government.
	   Labor's most senior strategist Gary Gray on Monday said Labor
would have to pull off the biggest political comeback in Australian
history to win Saturday's election.
	   No party had won more than eight seats after one term in
opposition, he said.

Schroeder's victory in Germany continues leftward swing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Election
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ When Helmut Kohl took command in Germany in 1982,
conservatism was at high tide. Ronald Reagan was in the White
House, Margaret Thatcher led Britain and the socialist President
Francois Mitterrand was a glaring French exception to the rule.
	   Kohl's defeat in Germany's national elections on Sunday by
Gerhard Schroeder followed a moderate swing to the left led by Bill
Clinton in the United States, Romano Prodi in Italy, Tony Blair in
Britain and Lionel Jospin in France.
	   Clinton and Blair in particular personify a new breed of
media-savvy leftist who feels most comfortable in the center.
Jospin and Prodi are less slick, both coming from academic
backgrounds.
	   Former British Prime Minister John Major, who lost to Blair last
year, said Monday that time catches up to all politicians.
``Politics is a little like a stream. It tends to move on,'' said
Major, whose Conservative Party was in power for 18 consecutive
years.
	   Blair beat Major with some typically conservative promises: no
income tax hikes, a determination to whip inflation, and a strong
national defense. But there was a strong sense that Britons had
simply tired of the Conservatives and were ready to try something
new.
	   In office, Blair suffers the strongest criticism from
disappointed constituents from the left of the party. This week,
party members registered their concern by electing leftists to four
of the six seats at stake on the Labor Party executive.
	   ``I know that while most Labor supporters were prepared to bite
their tongues to win, and were delighted when Tony Blair ended
Labor's decades in the wilderness, they did not intend doing so in
perpetuity,'' Mark Seddon, one of the newly elected members of the
executive, wrote in Monday's Evening Standard newspaper.
	   Jospin, 60, a loser to the conservative Jacques Chirac in the
presidential race in 1995, became prime minister two years later
and returned the left to grace in France with a surprise
performance as a consensus builder and crowd pleaser who remains
faithful to his socialist goals.
	   On practical matters, Jospin kept his promise to tackle
unemployment. Under him, the 12.8 percent unemployment rate has
dropped to 11.8 percent.
	   To quell critics, he softened his approach, but did not abandon
the 35-hour work week, and eased tough immigration laws without
ruffling feathers. He also went ahead with the right's planned sale
of state companies and held down the budget to prepare for the
single currency.
	   After a year in office, a poll published in the leftist
newspaper Liberation said that seven out of 10 rated Jospin
``courageous'' and ``open.''
	   In Italy, Romano Prodi's center-left ``Olive Tree'' coalition
government including ex-Communists, former Christian Democrats and
Greens, has been in office since 1996. An economist and academic
with little public experience, Prodi has seemed uncomfortable on
television and at political rallies. But voters evidently approve
the contrast to his predecessor, the conservative television
magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
	   For the first two years, Prodi pursued strict economic policies
to get Italy in line to join a European single currency.
	   With that achieved, he is now aiming to cut unemployment,
especially in Italy's depressed south where the jobless rate is
nearly double the national average of 12.5 percent. He also is
trying to slim the welfare state without upsetting his Communist
allies.

Arafat says will of Palestinians is statehood

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yasser Arafat heeded U.S. pleas in his
first speech to the General Assembly's annual debate, asking world
leaders to support Palestinian statehood but refraining from a
unilateral threat to declare a state next May.
	   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold, welcomed the restraint.
	   ``Clearly he has preferred the option of negotiations over the
option of a unilateral act,'' Gold told reporters. ``And in that
sense, we have something we can express our satisfaction with.''
	   Arafat delivered the speech after returning from Washington,
where he held a last-minute summit Monday morning with President
Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on an
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.
	   In what Netanyahu said was a breakthrough meeting, Clinton set
up a compressed schedule for concluding the West Bank accord.
	   ``Israel and the Palestinians can now move on in an attempt to
conclude a negotiated settlement, which will have to balance the
requirements and address the needs of both sides,'' Gold said.
	   Arafat had said as recently as Friday that he would use the
General Assembly speech to restate his intention of declaring an
independent Palestinian state next year regardless of whether a
final peace agreement with Israel was in place.
	   Palestinian aides had said Arafat wanted to seek support of U.N.
member states who traditionally back the Palestinian cause over
Israeli interests.
	   Over the weekend, however, diplomatic sources said that Arafat
would tone the speech down in the wake of apparent movement in the
peace process in consultations with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, and on Monday, Clinton.
	   The speech didn't rule out his original intention, though there
was no explicit threat that he would unilaterally declare an
independent state in May.
	   Arafat said repeatedly that statehood was not a debatable issue
and concluded by announcing that he looked forward to speaking to
the assembly once more ``when Palestine has taken its natural place
in the community of nations as an independent state.''
	   Arafat stressed that the Oslo peace accords expire on May 4.
``Our people demand of us to shoulder our responsibilities and they
await the establishment of their independent state.''
	   ``This independent Palestinian state must be established as an
embodiment of the right of our people to self-determination,'' he
said.
	   ``We appeal to you to continue your support for us, as has
always been the case in the decisive moments of the history, the
present and the future of our people,'' Arafat said.
	   ``Help us to achieve the national goal of our people in the
establishment of the state,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat's speech before the General Assembly has particular
significance: Never before has Arafat _ or any other Palestinian _
addressed the audience from the podium during the regular debate.
The Palestinian observer mission was granted that right earlier
this summer.
	   Arafat noted the occasion in his opening statement, thanking the
assembly for giving the Palestinians the enhanced status ``which we
consider to be an essential step towards full membership.''

Sosa's spectacular regular season draws to a close
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Even Michael Jordan has Sammy Sosa fever.
	   With one last chance to add to his 66 home runs and put the
Chicago Cubs in the playoffs, Sosa got a visit from Chicago's other
favorite athlete Monday night.
	   Wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket, Jordan was greeted with a huge
roar when he trotted out to the mound to throw out the first pitch.
	   The cheers grew even louder when Jordan shed the jacket and
turned around to show everyone that not only was he wearing a Cubs
jersey, but it was Sosa's No. 21 jersey. And Sosa laughed as Jordan
honored him with his own, chest-thumping, finger-kissing salute.
	   Then Sosa hunkered down behind home plate as Jordan, who played
minor league baseball for a season during his brief retirement from
basketball, wound up. But Jordan's throw sailed far above Sosa's
head, and Sosa had to run back to grab the ball.
	   Jordan walked off the mound laughing as he greeted Sosa with a
hug. The two, who've become friends during Sosa's spectacular
season, walked off the field arm in arm.
	   With 70 home runs Mark McGwire practically has a lock on the
home run record. But Sosa is chasing the playoffs, and if you have
any doubt about which is more important to him, you haven't been
listening.
	   ``I've been saying all year that he's `The Man,''' Sosa said
Sunday. ``(But) Mark McGwire is going to go home ... and maybe go
to the beach. And I'm going to play.''
	   McGwire hit five homers in his last three games to finish with a
whopping 70. The Cubs' wild-card playoff Monday night against the
San Francisco Giants gave Sosa one more chance, but even he knows
catching McGwire is unlikely.
	   But stranger things have happened, and it's been a wild season
for the Cubs. One fan posted a sign along the first-base line
reading, ``Hey Sammy! Gimme 5!''
	   Sosa fell short in his first at-bat, grounding into a double
play on check swing to end the first inning.
	   ``I cannot go out there and think about hitting home runs,''
said Sosa, who didn't talk before Monday's game. ``I have to get
base hits.''
	   Who'd have thought in spring training _ in May, even _ that Sosa
would have this kind of year? Sure, he had 30-homer seasons the
past few years, but this, this has been, to use one of Sosa's
favorite words, unbelievable.
	   ``They're both pretty humble about what has happened,'' said
Gary Gaetti, who started the season with the Cardinals and finished
with the Cubs. ``It doesn't even look right. It doesn't look right
at all for one guy to have those numbers.''
	   When the year began, the money was on McGwire and Ken Griffey
Jr. to challenge Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 homers.
Sosa, who trailed McGwire 24-9 in late May, wasn't even on the
radar.
	   Then came June 1. Sosa hit two homers off the Florida Marlins,
and he was off on a binge. By the end of the month, he'd hit 20
home runs and the chase for Maris was a three-man race.
	   Sosa has done more than just hit homers. His 158 RBIs going into
Monday's game are best in the majors and fourth-best in NL history.
His 414 total bases also lead the majors, as do his 132 runs
scored. After starting the season having never hit a grand slam,
he's now hit three.

Jordan testifies he never refused to star in film that flopped
</HEADLINE>
without him &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDSEY TANNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ A composed and soft-spoken Michael Jordan took
the witness stand for nearly four hours Monday and testified that
he never refused to act in a 1991 basketball film that flopped
without him.
	   ``I maintained enthusiasm about the project. I wanted to
participate,'' Jordan said, even when filming of ``Heaven is a
Playground'' was postponed several times while the producers sought
financing.
	   Jordan said he even agreed to return the dlrs 50,000 producers
paid him up front and offered his signature to help draw
prospective backers when financing hit a snag.
	   The appearance by the Chicago Bulls superstar came in the midst
of a multimillion-dollar breach-of-contract lawsuit alleging he
reneged on a deal to star in the movie, which ultimately was made
with former Loyola Marymount player Bo Kimble in the role Jordan
was to have played. The film made just dlrs 168,000 at the box
office, its producers allege, and never got national distribution.
	   The producers are seeking between dlrs 16 million and dlrs 20
million in damages, or what they believe could have been the film's
profit.
	   For days Jordan has sat quietly at the defense table while
lawyers did the talking. But on Monday, Jordan _ wearing a gray
suit, red-striped tie and silver hooped earring in his left ear _
took his accustomed starring role and loped across the downtown
courtroom to the witness box.
	   Jordan was called by the plaintiffs as a hostile witness, and
much of his testimony involved dry minutiae about contractual
obligations. But he provided comic relief as the plaintiffs showed
scenes from a video featuring film clips of Jordan's soaring
basketball feats.
	   Jordan bit his lip and smiled uncomfortably as the video
announcer called him ``this offensive juggernaut'' and ``the
greatest scorer since Wilt Chamberlain.''
	   When attorney Dean Dickie asked whether Jordan, ``as the
greatest basketball player ever,'' had considered how successful
the ``Heaven'' film would have been with him in it, Jordan
demurred.
	   ``I guess I should assume that I'm the greatest basketball
player,'' Jordan said humbly, prompting smiles from jurors and
audience members in the packed courtroom. ``I try to be the best I
can be.
	   ``I haven't really thought about'' how the film might have
turned out, he said. ``I haven't seen it.''
	   He maintains both sides agreed to postpone the film and has
countersued, alleging the producers knowingly misled him about
financing.

 &UR; Malaysia's ex-deputy premier brought to court after days of
protests

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister was quietly brought into a Kuala Lumpur court Tuesday just
before working hours began, eyewitnesses said.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested on Sept. 20 under the harsh
Internal Security Act, faces charges ranging from illegal
homosexual acts to treason.
	   It was not immediately known what charges had been made against
Anwar, 51, on Tuesday. His lawyers did not immediately comment.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from a courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.

Failure to tackle unemployment cost Kohl his job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Everybody said it would be a tight race. Everybody
thought the unpredictable former communist east would provide the
decisive swing votes. In the end, it wasn't even close. And it
wasn't only jobless easterners who were angry with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
	   A measure of Kohl's sweeping defeat: he lost even in his home
district of Ludwigshafen on the Rhine River.
	   While Kohl talked about historic accomplishments like unifying
Germany and promoted himself as a reliable, ``world-class'' leader
in a time of global turmoil, voters were worried about something
much closer to home: Germany's stubborn, double-digit jobless rate.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, hung the ``chancellor of
unemployment'' label around Kohl's neck. And he promised to change
things just enough to get Germans, known for their love of
stability, to give Kohl the boot. It was the first time voters had
completely rejected all parties in the previous government.
	   ``If you ask Germans what they really want, they want peace,
happiness and six weeks vacation. But they don't really want
changes,'' says Reinhard Schlinkert, managing director of the
Infratest polling agency.
	   Yet Kohl's failure to put Germans back to work not only angered
the hapless easterners, still struggling with the transition to a
market economy, but it became a gnawing worry even for those with
jobs in traditionally conservative strongholds like southern
Germany.
	   For many it came down to the wire; a quarter of Germans were
undecided until just before Sunday's election. Then they decided to
take a chance on Schroeder's cautious appeal to a ``new center.''
	   ``They were looking for new possibilities,'' Schlinkert said.
``When Schroeder said `I don't want to change everything but I will
make it better,' they believed him.''
	   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union came out of
Sunday's election with 35 percent of the vote, down more than 6
points from 1994 and the worst showing since 1949.
	   Most ex-CDU voters went to Schroeder's Social Democrats, who
finished up 4.5 percent at 41 percent. A big chunk just stayed
home, analysts say.
	   A third of the drop was attributed to the east where, with
unemployment stuck near 20 percent, Kohl's role as the ``unity
chancellor'' wasn't enough to guarantee voter loyalty.
	   In those states, the CDU fell 11 points compared with 1994.
Party officials were stung.
	   ``Chancellor Kohl had put his whole energy into rebuilding the
east, and to drop by double digits is certainly bitter,'' general
secretary Peter Hintze told German television.
	   But voters weren't surprised.
	   ``It was long overdue. They made big promises and they didn't
keep them,'' said Hans Juergen Riez, 52, as he sipped a morning
beer in the northeastern city of Schwerin. He lost his job in a
plastics factory in 1991 and has been looking for another ever
since _ without success.
	   ``I don't see any `flourishing landscapes' like he promised,''
said Annamarie Fenne, also out of work, referring to Kohl's 1990
pledge to revitalize the eastern economy after four decades of
communism.
	   ``The election wasn't only decided in the east, but easterners
made the decision even clearer,'' admitted Angela Merkel, Kohl's
environmental minister and party chairwoman in eastern
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state.
	   In fact, the drop-off in the west, where 80 percent of the
electorate lives, was less dramatic but significantly more
damaging. People there are relatively better off but still worried
about the future.
	   The feeling was that Kohl ``just doesn't care enough anymore
about the cares, needs, fears and problems of the `little
people,''' said Martin Guellner, head of the Forsa polling
institute.
	   _Kohl lost 5 percent in Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to Daimler-Benz
and a Christian Democratic stronghold.
	   _He lost almost 5 percent in his home state of
Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as his direct seat representing
Ludwigshafen. (Under Germany's complex political system, he stays
in parliament anyway as the party's top candidate in the state.)
	   _In Bavaria, his political allies easily won a statehouse race
two weeks ago, but recorded a 3.5 percent slide when it came to the
federal election. The drop in a state the conservatives have
dominated for decades was such a stunner that the chairman of the
Bavarian party announced on Monday he would step down.
	   Meanwhile, in one of life's little ironies, the successor party
to the East German communists _ which Kohl had attacked as a danger
to democracy _ made it over the 5 percent hurdle for the first time
to become a full-fledged faction in parliament.
	   The Party of Democratic Socialism even managed to pick up
support in the west, getting 1.2 percent of the vote, compared with
1 percent in 1994.

Schroeder reassures Germans and the world after victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Germany-How Kohl Lost &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The nation's future chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, made one thing clear after winning power as the voice of
change: Change will happen, but not too much for the good of
Germans, who cherish predictability.
	   The Social Democrat sought to reassure the world, too, declaring
Monday in his first news conference after Sunday's vote that his
administration will represent steady foreign policy and ``economic
stability.''
	   Much of that stability came from 16 years of consistent
conservative leadership by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, swept from
office by voters who wanted a fresh face and new ideas for solving
problems at home _ chiefly unemployment stuck at over 10 percent.
	   Not only has Schroeder vowed to continue Kohl's foreign policies
but the future chancellor also said Monday he may be consulting his
predecessor directly for advice on diplomacy.
	   As a first sign of continuity, Schroeder planned to visit Paris
on Wednesday in a symbolic trip to the capital of Germany's closest
European partner. Kohl made the same journey in 1982, when he, like
Schroeder, was elevated from state governor to the leader of the
nation.
	   ``Nobody needs to be afraid. We will ensure continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said. ``The international community can
rely on Germans to remain good partners.''
	   Some of Schroeder's first tests as chancellor will be on the
international stage, with NATO planning air strikes to quell
violence in the Serb-ruled Yugoslav province of Kosovo and with the
Jan. 1 introduction of Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   Germany is at the center of both developments: Kohl was
instrumental in starting European monetary union, and his
government has promised German fighter planes and soldiers for any
NATO action in the current Balkan conflict.
	   Grinning with exuberance, Schroeder dodged tough questions _
such as how he would handle Kosovo. He and Social Democrat party
chief Oskar Lafontaine apparently were unwilling to commit their
new government to any plan as they head into tough talks Friday on
forming a coalition with the enviromentalist Greens party.
	   But Schroeder made clear that the Social Democrats, as the
dominant partner, would not tolerate radical pacifist and
environmentalist causes pushed by many Greens. Fischer is a
moderate.
	   In an interview with Der Spiegel news magazine, he warned the
Greens ``not to be pushy with their demands.''
	   Eager to enter government for the first time, the Greens
emphasized ideas the two parties share: combating unemployment,
scrapping nuclear energy and giving long-time foreign residents of
Germany dual nationality.
	   Joschka Fischer, the leader of the Greens' moderate wing, was
pegged as a possible foreign minister in the new government. But
Schroeder has refused to discuss any cabinet posts.

Family devastated by Japanese tourist's apparent killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Friends and family of a missing
Japanese tourist are distraught after learning she appears to have
been murdered while on a sightseeing trip, police said Tuesday.
	   Kayo Matsuzawa, 29, had not been seen since she checked into a
backpackers' hostel in downtown Auckland on Sept. 11, Det. Senior
Sgt. Kevin Baker said.
	   Police suspect the naked, decaying body found last week in a
locked cupboard in a building only a couple of hundred meters
(yards) from Queen Street Backpackers hostel is Matsuzawa's.
	   The woman's family has been contacted in Yamagata, northern
Japan, and detectives on Tuesday began checking dental records to
confirm the body's identity.
	   The body was found in a fire alarm battery cupboard off a
stairwell last Tuesday by a serviceman and police say it had been
there for about a week.
	   Baker said Matsuzawa arrived in Christchurch from Japan late
last year, working in a restaurant and also sharing a flat with
another Japanese woman.
	   Police were making inquiries at the backpackers hostel, where
she paid a deposit and left her belongings before vanishing.
	   A colleague at the Thai Tasty restaurant in Christchurch, who
did not want to be named, said Matsuzawa went to Auckland by
herself for sightseeing and was supposed to be back in two weeks.
	   He said she planned to move on to Australia in November.
	   A Japanese tour guide in Christchurch, Stuart Henwood, said he
was concerned that many Japanese still came to New Zealand
`thinking it is so safe they can wander off and do whatever they
like,''
	   The director of the Nippon New Zealand Friendship Association,
Robin de Clive-Lowe, said the Japanese government would probably
issue a warning to tourists visiting New Zealand. The death would
impact on inbound tourism.

Six dead in Mexico City mudslides, flooding

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains have swollen rivers in central
Mexico and triggered mudslides in Mexico City that killed six
people and injured four others.
	   Monday's rain soaked squatter communities perched on the steep
slopes of hillsides south of the city. Television footage showed a
stream of mud roaring down gullies and the ruins of three homes
that had been swept away.
	   The slide killed a 13-year-old girl, Lourdes Barrera Orozco, who
was found still clutching her school notebook, witnesses said. All
that remained of the homes were a muddy pile of appliances and
clothing flung against a row of trees.
	   The girl's 6-year-old brother and a 9-year-old relative also
were caught in the slide and suffered head injuries. They were
flown by helicopter to a downtown hospital.
	   ``I heard a loud rumble and I went outside and saw my neighbors
buried there,'' said Pedro Ramirez, 55.
	   City officials had predicted the rainy season could bring
disaster to the shantytowns that ring the city's hillsides, but
most people refused to relocate.
	   ``It's very difficult to convince them. They don't want to leave
their houses,'' said Aurelio Garcia, a spokesman for the Magdalena
Contreras precinct, where the deaths happened.
	   Another family was buried in their home when mud came streaming
down on top of it earlier in the day. Two teen-agers were pulled
from the house alive by local police, but both their parents died.
	   Two other people were killed when a muddy hillside collapsed on
top of a containment wall, crushing their house. The Televisa
network reported another body was pulled from a mudslide in the
city, raising the number of deaths to six. In all, half a dozen
houses were destroyed in slides.
	   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas declared a state of alert, government
news agency Notimex reported. City officials issued evacuation
warnings to people living near a dam in the western part of the
city that was on the verge of overflowing.
	   Cardenas said the government would not force squatters from
their homes.
	   Some neighborhoods in a low-lying area east of Mexico City have
been flooded for days, and to the west, the Lerma River overflowed
its banks and left some villages inundated in sewage.
	   Mexico City's main highway to the western part of the country
also was blocked by a mudslide Monday. Rains are expected to
continue, the National Meteorological service said.
	   Rains also caused rivers to overflow in the southern state of
Chiapas, hit by flooding earlier this month that killed 185 people
and left many towns and villages cut off from the outside world.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks slip in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday
ahead of the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making meeting later in
the day. Japanese stock prices slipped.
	   The dollar bought 136.35 yen in early trading, up 0.63 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
135.85 yen overnight.
	   Traders were awaiting the outcome of the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting amid increasing speculation the Fed will announce
a cut in interest rates after the gathering in a bid to revive the
global economy.
	   In New York overnight, the dollar moved higher in line with a
rise on Wall Street before losing some of its early gains. The U.S.
currency's intermittent spurts higher were also cut short by
remarks from Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
	   Rubin reiterated his ``great concern'' over the recent weakness
of the Japanese currency.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 80.07, or 1 percent,
to a one-month high of 8,108.84 points.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, many investors were holding back to
await the outcome of the Fed meeting, traders said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 76.20 points,
or 0.55 percent, to 13,833.17 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Monday, the Nikkei gained 185.53 points, or 1.35
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.81 points, or 0.26 percent, 1,060.71
points. The TOPIX closed up 13.59 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.795 percent from Monday's finish of 0.800
percent, driving its price up to 109.06 yen from 109.01 yen.

Blair seeks to rally his increasingly restive Labor Party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Blair's keynote address expected to begin about 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BLK102-103 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Despite continuing popularity with
voters after 17 months in office, Prime Minister Tony Blair is
facing increased restiveness within his Labor Party over what
critics see as an authoritarian, conservative style of government.
	   Blair, in his keynote address Tuesday to the party's annual
conference, has a key challenge: convincing party left-wingers and
uneasy trade union leaders that economic stringency will bring
long-term stability rather than betray Labor's left-of-center
philosophy.
	   Left-wingers, buoyed by successes in elections to the party's
governing National Executive Committee, accused Blair at fringe
meetings outside the main conference of ignoring dissent over his
``New Labor'' centrist policies.
	   ``This control-freakery represents an actual danger to our
democracy if it continues,'' lawmaker Ken Livingstone declared
Monday night at a meeting of the Labor Left Briefing group in the
northern town of Blackpool.
	   Left-wingers accuse Blair of expunging dissidents as candidates
for next year's European Parliament elections; reducing the six-day
conference to a rally by permitting few votes on policy; and having
party headquarters decide which delegates are called for debates.
	   In addition, the largely moderate trade union bosses, whose
unions are major funders of the party, are uneasy about the
government's emphasis on keeping inflation at a low 2.5 percent.
They would prefer pay hikes.
	   State spending curbs have held down public service wages, and
the 7.5 percent interest rate has helped stoke the value of the
British pound. This makes exports, which the unionists make, more
expensive and encourages cheap imports.
	   Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the country's biggest union,
UNISON, which represents hundreds of thousands of public service
workers, received thunderous applause Monday when he criticized
appeals by government ministers for patience.
	   ``Don't just give us a vision of the promised land, give us a
place in it,'' said Bickerstaffe.
	   But Blair was expected to take a no-change line _ spelled out
Monday by his treasury chief, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown, that Labor, out of office for 18 years until its May 1997
election victory, has learned from past mistakes.
	   ``We will not go back to the idea that in the first two years of
a Labor government you have a binge, which means you spend the next
two years picking up the pieces,'' Brown said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview Monday night.
	   Earlier, Brown received subdued applause when he told delegates
``there is no other way, no solution, or even comfort, in soft
options.''

Howard endorses view of big Aboriginal land councils as
</HEADLINE>
`bloodsuckers'
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Racial politics, never far below the
surface in Australia, erupted into the national campaign Tuesday
when Prime Minister John Howard endorsed his deputy's attack on
large Aboriginal agencies as ``bureaucratic bloodsucking''
organizations.
	   On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called the Alice
Springs-based Central Land Council and the Darwin-based Northern
Land Council ``giant bureaucratic bloodsucking land councils which
take away from smaller communities resources and flexible
infrastructure and leadership.''
	   Aboriginal land councils advise the government on the allocation
of grants and resources for Aboriginal health, welfare, and other
projects.
	   Howard on Tuesday backed the thrust of Fischer's attack, saying:
``I haven't seen what Tim said but he's right when he wants the
resources available for indigenous people to go to them rather than
to bureaucracies.''
	   The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, or ATSIC),
which represents the interests of Aborigines on a national level,
demanded an apology from Fischer.
	   ``Mr. Howard can't talk about reconciliation one day and excuse
this type of language from his deputy the next.
	   ``His remarks do nothing for race relations in this country.
They demean the office of deputy prime minister,'' ATSIC chairman
Gatjil Djerrkura said.
	   Opposition leader Kim Beazley said he was sorry Fischer had
resorted to such language in the final days of the campaign for
Saturday's election.
	   ``I think Mr. Fischer faces terrible struggles on many fronts
but he does not need to break away and make an intemperate
statement,'' Beazley said.
	   The 350,000 or so Aborigines among Australia's 18 million people
are collectively the poorest and least healthy minority in the
country, with the highest rates of unemployment, high infant
mortality and much shorter life spans.
	   Two new polls on Tuesday show Howard's governing conservatives
and the Labor Party opposition in a dead heat before Saturday's
election, with a hung Parliament a possibility.
	   The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed
Howard's conservative coalition edging ahead of Beazley's Labor
Party by 43-42 percent, but with a margin of error of 2.3 percent.
	   Meanwhile, The Bulletin news magazine poll put the conservatives
at 40 percent and Labor at 39 percent, with a 2 percent margin of
error.
	   But with the right-wing populist One Nation party polling at 7
percent and the Australian Democrats at 8 percent in both polls,
there is a possibility that neither the conservatives nor Labor
will win a majority in the House of Representatives, where
government is formed.
	   To win government, Labor would have to take 27 House seats away
from Howard's ruling conservative coalition.
	   On Monday, the Labor party's most senior strategist said Labor
would have to pull off the biggest political comeback in Australian
history to win Saturday's election.
	   Labor national secretary Gary Gray said no party had won more
than eight seats back after one term in opposition.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Tanzania foreign minister decries terrorism, cites embassy blasts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Tanzania's foreign minister called for a
stronger international effort to fight terrorism and thanked
nations who helped his country recover from the terrorist attack on
the U.S. embasssy.
	   ``Terrorism is a heinous crime against humanity,'' Jakaya Mrisho
Kikwete told the General Assembly on Monday. ``Whatever cause may
have prompted the perpetrators to resort to it, we do not believe
that it is any way justifiable.''
	   Two bombs exploded almost simultaneously in the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on Aug. 7, killing
259 people. Eleven people died in the Tanzania attack, all of them
Africans.
	   ``In the wake of the attack, many friends sent us messages of
condolence and solidarity,'' Kikwete said, adding that the
government was particularly grateful for those that sent material
support to help the victims.
	   ``Of particular mention here is the people and government of the
United States of America who extended medical support and assisted
in the investigations through the FBI.''
	   He called for greater international cooperation to bring the
perpetrators to justice, so ``that they will find no solace or
refuge anywhere.''

Taylor ready to give evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor
says he is prepared to give evidence to a Pakistani match-fixing
inquiry, but is worried that the issue might provoke animosity
towards his touring team.
	   Australia starts the first of three tests against the hosts in
Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on Thursday. Australian Cricket Board chief
executive Mal Speed said they had received no official notification
from its Pakistani counterpart, but said it was possible that
Taylor and Mark Waugh might be called to give evidence.
	   Waugh was once of three players who accused Pakistan player
Salim Malik of trying to bribe them during a 1994 tour. Malik is
under investigation along with several others, including Wasim
Akram.
	   Taylor said he had no problems with giving evidence that he was
aware of accusations from Waugh, Tim May and Shane Warne that Malik
had offered them bribes.
	   ``It wouldn't worry me fronting up to the commission,'' Taylor
told Australian reporters Tuesday. ``But I think it's something
that has to be decided by the boards on what is politically correct
at this stage.
	   ``I don't want to inflame the situation. My understanding is
it's an internal investigation and we are right at the start of a
serious tour of cricket.''
	   Taylor said his greatest concern was that matters become
``inflamed and ... spill over onto the field.''
	   The Australians have never attended a hearing in Pakistan to
discuss their 1994 allegations against Malik. Pakistan Cricket
Board chairman Khalid Mahmood was reported by The Australian
newspaper as saying that the chance to appear now is ``a good offer
to substantiate the allegations of four years ago.''
	   ``In the past the players couldn't come for various reasons but
now they are here and it's a great chance,'' the paper quoted
Mahmood as saying. ``If any of my players had leveled accusations
against any other team's player I would have encouraged him to
appear before the inquiry commission.''
	   The hearings are being held in Lahore, which is hundreds of
kilometers from any of Australia's test venues on this tour, and
only on Saturdays.
	   The Pakistani High Commission in Canberra said the Australians
could not be ordered to front the hearings because they are covered
by diplomatic immunity.

Clinton takes foreign policy stage as a tonic to his personal
</HEADLINE>
trouble &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ For an American president weakened at home by
the embarrassment of personal scandal, President Bill Clinton's
impromptu Middle East summit offered a politically welcome stage to
show he can still lead.
	   The scene in the Oval Office on Monday, live on CNN: Clinton,
standing between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, proclaimed ``progress on the path
to peace.'' No dramatic breakthrough just yet, he cautioned
reporters, but ``all told, it was a good day.''
	   Simply bringing these two reluctant partners to the table was a
small victory, writ large for the beleaguered president.
	   For the past week or so Clinton has kept an unusually busy
foreign policy schedule, starting with a visit to United Nations
headquarters in New York for a speech on international cooperation
in the fight against terrorism. Over the next few days he held
separate meetings with the leaders of seven nations, then basked in
the public praise of widely respected South African President
Nelson Mandela.
	   ``It's his best turf at the moment,'' said John Steinbruner, a
senior foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution, a think
tank.
	   With an eye on the November elections, Clinton appears
determined to keep hammering for a deal on a further Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank. He said Monday that Netanyahu and
Arafat agreed to return to Washington for a potentially decisive
round of negotiations in mid-October. That time table would fall
smack into the final stretch of the campaign.
	   Steinbruner believes that despite the political wounds Clinton
sustained from his Monica Lewinsky scandal, he remains able to push
for progress in traditional foreign policy areas like the Middle
East peace process. But his ability to generate new policies to
address problems like Russia's economic distress or the civil
unrest in Kosovo has been ``seriously jeopardized,'' the analyst
said.
	   From the start of his first term Clinton has focused more on
domestic than foreign affairs, yet he has managed to build a
reputation as a peacemaker, an image bolstered by his successful
push for peace in Northern Ireland. Since his public admission in
August that he had a sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky and then lied
about it, critics have questioned whether it cost him the moral
authority to lead and whether he had lost the respect and trust of
key foreign leaders.
	   At his first news conference since admitting to the Lewinsky
affair, this was the first matter put to him.
	   ``I have never stopped leading this country in foreign affairs
in this entire year, and I never will,'' Clinton said sternly.
``The issues are too important and they affect the way Americans
live at home.''
	   The president addressed it again in an interview with syndicated
columnist Trude Feldman.
	   ``Those who have telephoned me with encouragement,'' Clinton
said of his recent conversations with foreign leaders, ``believe I
have done nothing in my public life to forfeit their trust, and
that in my private life, whether its is good or bad or troubled or
happy, is not their business.''
	   Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center think tank, Monday
that Clinton has never enjoyed a high standing abroad.
	   ``While the Monica Lewinsky problem did not undermine his
already diminished moral authority, it has made him less
effective'' in foreign policy, Simes said.
	   Fred Greenstein, a political science professor at Princeton
University, takes a more positive view. He thinks the scandal, by
threatening Clinton's political life, has forced him to focus
harder and press for concrete results.
	   ``In a sense, all Bill Clinton has to seize upon to redeem the
situation is competence, so that's what he's going to try to do,''
Greenstein said.

Economist predicts gas crisis could stunt Australia's economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Not only are millions of Australians
taking cold showers during Victoria state's natural gas shortage,
but the industrial shutdown it has forced may hobble the nation's
growth, a economist predicted Tuesday.
	   ANZ chief economist Saul Eslake said the crisis, which resulted
from a huge fire at Esso's Longford gas plant on Friday that killed
two men and injured eight, could seriously affect the national
economy.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for
two weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   Up to 100,000 workers in Victoria are expected to be laid off
this week as the Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and
brick-making plants and many other industries shut down.
	   In Adelaide in South Australia, Mitsubishi and General Motors
Holden are preparing for shutdowns Wednesday because of a lack of
parts from Victoria.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the shutdown could cost
100 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it
goes on.
	   ``If the disruption of the gas supply persists for more than a
week, then the impact on September quarter's gross domestic product
(GDP) could be of the order of 0.1 of a percentage point, perhaps a
third of the increase in GDP that forecasters had been expecting
for the September quarter,'' Eslake told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``Of course it now seems that this disruption may last for at
least two weeks, with some effects lingering beyond that, so
there'll be an impact on the December quarter figures as well.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   The CUB Malthouse Theater offered patrons a ``Show and Shower''
package, with theater-goers getting to use the electric-heated
showers backstage before the show.
	   The Australian Hotels Association spokesman Darryl Washington
said some Melbourne hotels were sending their laundry to Sydney for
cleaning.
	   He said all but a small percentage were offering only cold
showers and all would feel the full brunt later this week of
dwindling supplies, such as bread.
	   Victorian residents, facing fines of 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their gas meters Saturday
after the state's supply authority, VENCorp., ordered the shutdown
of the state's system.
	   Prime Minister John Howard offered federal assistance to
Victoria, ``In particular, both governments are concerned to ensure
the crisis does not hurt the sick, the elderly or the frail in the
community.''

Doohan set to quit after next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's four-time 500cc motorcycle
racing world champion Mick Doohan said Tuesday he would likely quit
after next season.
	   ``I've decided to continue again for next year but I doubt I'll
go for 2000. I think new century, new job,'' Doohan told an
Australian television network.
	   Doohan, who is in line for a fifth world title this year, said
he would like to top Italian Giacomo Agostini's long standing
victory record.
	   Agostini won 68 500cc races between 1965 and 1976, and won the
championship eight times between 1966 and 1975.
	   ``I don't think I have the motivation to go for eight world
championships but it would be good to have a go at the amount of
wins he had,'' Doohan said. ``I've won 52 so I'd have to have a
really good year. Top this season off with a few wins but also have
a really good year next year.''
	   Monaco-based Doohan said he wanted to remain involved in
motorcycle racing in some capacity.
	   ``I think I'd always do something within the sport but I'll
probably take a year off and really work out what I want to do and
where I want to be,'' said Doohan.
	   He expects to remain living in Europe, rather than returning
home to Australia. ``Everything's so familiar to me over there and
I think to just chop out that part of my life will be difficult,''
Doohan said.
	   Doohan's quest for a fifth world title was boosted by news that
the Brazilian Grand Prix, due to be held on Oct. 18, had been
canceled because the Nelson Piquet track in Rio de Janeiro failed
to pass a safety inspection.
	   With Doohan leading the championship standings by 21 points from
Italy's Max Biaggi and Spaniard Alex Criville a further seven
points back, the cancellation leaves just two rounds remaining in
the world championship _ the Australian GP on Sunday and in Buenos
Aires, Argentina on Oct. 25.

Malaysia's ex-deputy premier brought to court for arraignment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police ring around courthouse &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim was brought to a Kuala Lumpur courthouse
Tuesday to be arraigned on a wide range of charges.
	   Hundreds of policemen threw a ring around the colonial
courthouse building to prevent pro-Anwar supporters from thronging
the area for a glimpse of their leader who has not been seen since
his arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was marched off by armed police under the harsh Internal
Security Act. He faces charges ranging from illegal homosexual acts
to treason.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from a courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.
	   Mahathir has promised that Anwar would be given a speedy and
fair tried in an open court.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN DE LA MAGUANA, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Fallen bridges
and washed-out roads had left this western town isolated since
Hurricane George pounded it a week ago, but relief workers are
finally glimpsing the devastation.
	   Shantytowns perched on a river's edge were buried under several
feet (a meter) of mud. Dazed residents trudged through the muck to
examine their flattened adobe and plywood homes while rescue
workers searched for bodies.
	   Residents walked nonchalantly Monday past the rotting carcass of
a horse buried chest deep in mud, its head arching toward the sky.
	   At least 76 people were killed here, the Red Cross has reported.
The exact toll remained unclear, however. Local hospital officials
said they had documented 19 dead, but suspected that many more have
been buried by relatives or lay trapped under the mud.
	   While all Dominicans were affected one way or the other, it
appears the vast majority of the 200 dead nationwide were those too
poor to afford a better place to live. Most of the victims lived in
flimsy low-lying homes which were no match for the hurricane.
	   Flooding in this farming center of 20,000 people located 75
miles (125 kilometers) west of the capital Santo Domingo was
aggravated when workers at a dam upstream opened floodgates to
relieve pressure on the dam.
	   After a week of waiting for help to arrive, hurricane victims on
Monday waded into subsiding waters to guide the first relief trucks
into town.
	   In a small cemetery outside town, the graves of eight people
were marked by a two-foot-high (60-centimeter) mound covered with
red and purple flowers and crosses made of sticks. Nine other storm
victims were buried nearby.
	   Residents said they had some warning but were unprepared for the
disaster.
	   ``They told us before it happened, but I didn't think it would
be this bad,'' said Alejandro Mateo, 68, who fled his yellow
clapboard house in the Monte de Oca neighborhood as the water rose.
	   The house, which 20 years ago survived the last major hurricane
to hit the Dominican Republic, is now filled with mud and may not
be salvageable.
	   Until Monday, downed trees and bridges and raging streams
prevented rescuers from reaching the town by land or helicopter.
Both the U.S. Peace Corps and the U.S. Agency for International
Development had said getting to San Juan was a top priority.
	   Children dashed across a field Monday to collect packets of
disaster supplies dropped by a small Peace Corps plane buzzing over
the town. Doctors waited anxiously for medical supplies to
vaccinate residents against diseases and prepared for a surge in
dengue and malaria, both carried by mosquitoes that breed in
stagnant water.
	   Two flatbed trailers carrying 110-pound (50-kilogram) bags of
rice donated by Australia arrived Monday afternoon, and workers
prepared the trucks for a push across a flooded roadway leading to
town.
	   A barefoot boy squatted in the shade beneath one of the trucks,
collecting falling grains of rice in a tattered red baseball cap.
	   U.S. helicopters were expected to fly more supplies into the
area on Tuesday.
	   Georges killed more than 300 people, including at least 94 in
nearby Haiti, as it spun westward through the Caribbean last week.

Widespread bank strike fizzles in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with only two banks struck
 &UR; AP Photo

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A threatened strike by 35,000
unionized employees of nine major banks largely evaporated Tuesday,
leaving only two of the institutions struck but still operating.
	   Employees of seven of the nine financially shaky banks reached
last-minute settlements with management on the question of layoffs
and went to work shortly after normal opening hours.
	   But 11,000 employees went on strike at Chohung Bank and Korea
Exchange Bank after failing to settle the layoff issue in overnight
negotiations.
	   The two struck banks were operating normally, with nonunion
employees filling in for the striking workers. Riot police guarded
their head and branch offices.
	   The nine banks have been ordered by the government to
restructure or face closure or merger. A key part of the
restructuring involves layoffs.
	   The banks sought to cut manpower by 33 percent by the end of
this year, but offered dismissed workers enhanced severance pay.
The unions initially demanded that the layoffs be spread over three
years with greater financial compensation.
	   Five banks were closed earlier this year as part of a
restructuring process South Korea promised in exchange for a dlrs
58 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments. Their lending was frequently affected
by political and government policies.
	   When dozens of financially shaky businesses collapsed late last
year, many banks were left with piles of non-performing loans. That
eroded investor confidence, fueling a flight of foreign capital.

Kazakstan Urges Caspian Sea Oil, Gas Development At U.N.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Kazakstan's foreign minister called Monday
for a ``complete settlement'' of legal issues that have stymied
development of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea.
	   In his address Monday to the U.N. General Assembly, Kassymjomart
K. Tokaev also called for speedy implementation of the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium project.
	   The group, which includes Chevron and Mobil, is planning a
900-mile (1,440-kilometer), dlrs 2.2 billion oil export pipeline
from the Tengiz oil field in Kazakstan to the Russian Black Sea
port of Novorossisk.
	   Most of the oil and gas reserves in the Caspian region remain
undeveloped. An estimated 15.4 to 29 billion barrels of proven oil
reserves lies in the region. The region also holds 236 to 337
trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves, according to the
Petroleum Finance Group, a Washington-based industry analyst.
	   But production in the region has been delayed by legal issues.
One question is whether development rights are governed by treaties
between the former Soviet Union and Iran, which didn't establish
seabed boundaries or discuss oil and gas production. It's also
unclear whether the Caspian Sea is covered by the Law of the Sea.
	   In July, Russia and Kazakstan agreed to divide the northern part
of the Caspian seabed into two separate sectors. Iran and
Turkmenistan criticized the deal, arguing the riches of the Caspian
Sea should be divided equally among bordering countries.
	   Nevertheless, Tokaev called for ``concrete steps'' to implement
the bilateral agreement which, he said ``lays the foundations for a
complete settlement of the Caspian problem.''

Algerian FM pledges defense of human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Algeria's foreign minister pledged Monday
that his country was committed to protecting human rights and
keeping the issue from being manipulated by politics.
	   Speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, Ahmed Attaf noted that
the United Nations was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration on Human Rights this year.
	   ``The situation is, surely, better today than it was 50 years
ago,'' he said.
	   Human rights groups routinely decry the rights situation in
Algeria, where a Muslim insurgency has ranged for six years.
	   The insurgency began after the army canceled parliamentary
elections in January 1992 that an Islamic party was poised to win.
Since then, an estimated 75,000 people have been killed.
	   The Algerian government blames Muslim insurgents for the
massacres, but human rights groups, such as Amnesty International,
say the government has also carried out atrocities.
	   ``I would in this context reaffirm our solid adherence to the
universality, the indivisibility and the interdependence of all
human rights,'' Attaf told world leaders gathered for the annual
debate. He stated Algeria's ``firm pledge to defend them and
promote them _ safe from all political manipulation.''
	   The United Nations recently sent a team of high-ranking
diplomats to look into the insurgency. Their report, released
earlier this month, condemned terrorism as a whole and made a few
recommendations, such as urging the government rein in its security
forces who have been accused in some attacks.

China congratulates Germany's Schroeder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has congratulated Gerhard Schroeder and his
Social Democrats on winning Germany's election and expressed
confidence he would maintain warm bilateral ties.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang paid tribute to Helmut
Kohl, chancellor for 16 years before being unseated by Schroeder on
Sunday, and his work in improving Chinese-German relations.
	   ``The Chinese government and people will never forget Chancellor
Kohl's efforts in promoting these relations,'' the official Xinhua
News Agency paraphrased Tang as saying Monday.
	   ``We congratulate the German Social Democratic Party on winning
the national election. China has always valued its relations with
Germany,'' Tang was quoted as saying.
	   He also said China believed that as chancellor Schroeder will
continue to shepherd ties with Beijing.

	   _ Monica Seles captured her third straight Princess Cup
championship in Tokyo, defeating Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 4-6, 6-3,
6-4.
	   _ Jimmy Connors defeated John McEnroe 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, 11-9 to
win the PricewaterhouseCoopers Champions in Irving, Texas.
	   _ Andrea Gaudenzi, Davide Sanguinetti, Diego Nargiso and
Gianluca Pozzi helped Italy upset the United States and advance to
the Davis Cup final where it will play Sweden.
	   _ Jonas Bjorkman, Thomas Johansson and Nicklas Kulti powered
Sweden to a 4-1 victory over Spain and into the Davis Cup final.
	   _ Lindsay Davenport led the way as the Sacramento Capitals
successfully defended their World TeamTennis title by crushing the
New York OTBzz 30-13.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPEAKING &QC; 
	   ``These days players have to be better athletes, but I still
think with nostalgia about the old times, when people like John
McEnroe played.'' _ Martina Navratilova, commenting on today's
tennis players.
	   ``It really doesn't matter who is playing or how old they are. I
just worry about what I can control. It doesn't give me more or
less motivation.'' _ Monica Seles, when asked if she gets more
motivation out of playing the younger players.
	   ``The boys (Davis Cup team) have all got together amongst
themselves this week and they're happy for Mark to come back as
long as he's part of the team.'' _ John Newcombe, saying he's ready
to welcome Mark Philippoussis back to the Australian Davis Cup
squad.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STORMY CLASH &QC; 
	   When a fan hollered at Jimmy Connors to ``just play fair,''
Connors stormed off the court in the opening set of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers Champions title match against John McEnroe.
Although he was defaulted by umpire Myron Krueger, Connors
eventually was talked into returning to the court by McEnroe and
Nuveen Tour officials after a 20-minute delay. Connors eventually
overcame a match point in the Champions tiebreak to win 6-7 (2-7),
6-2, 11-9 and collect the dlrs 40,000 winner's share. McEnroe, who
earned dlrs 25,000, and Connors refused to shake hands at the end
of the match in Irving, Texas.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STEADY WORK &QC; 
	   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario reached the title match of the Toyota
Princess Cup in Tokyo for the fifth consecutive year. And for the

Mary Pierce.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STRUGGLING IN VAIN &QC;

6-2, 7-6 (7-5) in the reverse singles.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SWITCHING SPONSORS &QC; 
	   After next year, The Lipton Championships will have a new name.
Ericsson Mobile Phones will become the title sponsor in the year
2000 and the tournament will be called the Ericsson Open. Now the
fifth largest tennis tournament in the world in terms of prize
money, The Lipton is the only 11-day, 96-man and 96-woman draw
tournament on the professional tennis calendar.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SUCCESS, FINALLY &QC; 
	   Russian teen-ager Anna Kournikova is one of the world's
best-known tennis players because of her cover-girl look. But when
she teamed with Monica Seles to capture the doubles at the Toyota
Princess Cup in Tokyo, it was the first time she had won a tennis
title in her pro career. Kournikova and Seles beat Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-4 to share the
winner's prize of dlrs 23,750.

North Korea warns that another Korean War is more imminent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Celebrating its technological prowess in
launching a satellite, North Korea warned that the danger of
another Korean War ``is getting ever more imminent'' because the
Korean peninsula remains divided.
	   In a speech Monday to the U.N. General Assembly, Vice Foreign
Minister Choe Su Hon said reunification would remove the danger of
war. And he called the U.S. Army in South Korea ``the major
obstacle'' to reunification.
	   ``As a result of the present military maneuvers against North
Korea on and around the Korean peninsula, a danger that either the
20th century may close or the 21st century may open with another
Korean war is getting ever more imminent,'' he said.
	   Touting North Korea's historic first satellite launch on Aug.
31, Choe said it demonstrated ``the might of our scientific and
technical development.'' He said the satellite was launched
successfully with a multi-stage rocket ``developed by ourselves
with our knowledge and 100 percent of our own technology and in our
own way.''
	   U.S. intelligence agencies initially said the North Koreans
fired a three-stage ballistic missile, which flew across Japan. The
Japanese protested to the U.N. Security Council.
	   U.S. analysts later concluded the rocket was a failed satellite
launch and said the launch demonstrates continued North Korean
efforts to develop intercontinental-range missiles.
	   Choe said Japanese authorities ``behaved unreasonably, making a
fuss to forcibly question our satellite launch and committed a rash
act ... insisting that the Security Council should `respond' to our
satellite launch.''
	   ``If our satellite launch is a serious issue in terms of
security, Japan's satellite launches should come first as an issue
to be discussed by the Security Council,'' he said.
	   Choe said Japan shouldn't hinder reunification ``by aggravating
the tense situation on the Korean peninsula'' and intimated that it
was ``attempting to declare war'' by following the United States.
He gave no details.
	   After the missile launch, the United States and Japan agreed to
conduct joint research on a missile defense system that could
protect the island nation from attack.
	   While warning of the danger of another Korean War, Choe declared
that the 21st century should be ``peaceful and prosperous,'' and
said the world would see an independent and peace-loving North
Korea develop ``into a prosperous power.''
	   And he said North Korea remains committed to reunification.
	   ``It is our consistent stand to hold dialogue for reunification
and to improve relations between the north and south of Korea,'' he
said.
	   ``In order for the Korean people to solve questions on national
unity and reunification by themselves, countries concerned
including the United States and Japan should refrain from acts of
hindering the efforts of the Korean people,'' he said.
	   Choe reiterated North Korea's demand that the United States
withdraw its forces from South Korea.
	   He called for nuclear disarmament to remain a priority on the
U.N. agenda but made no mention of his country's nuclear program.

Albright: negotiators close to ``finish line'' in Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Mideast &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
she found her recent meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders
to be fruitful in pushing the Middle East peace process ahead.
	   ``In those meetings, the air was cleared and we were able to
focus on what remains to be done and how to get it done,'' she said
Monday at a dinner sponsored by the Business Council for the United
Nations.
	   ``We're getting close to the finish line of an agreement,'' she
said in a speech that also advocated that the United States pay its
U.N. arrears.
	   ``We were able to narrow the gaps on the two most important
issues _ further redeployment and the security issues,'' she said
without elaborating.
	   Albright's announcement echoed similar statements made earlier
Monday by President Bill Clinton who met with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
	   Clinton plans to send Albright and U.S. mediator Dennis Ross to
the region next week. The new timetable for an accord also calls
for Netanyahu and Arafat to return to the White House for a meeting
with Clinton in mid-October.
	   Albright, who was the guest of honor at the U.N. dinner, said
Mideast peace negotiations had become bogged down before the latest
meetings.
	   ``Too much focus has been placed on what divides the parties,
rather than what united them in the seach for peace,'' she said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister was brought to a courthouse Tuesday for the beginning of
what could be a landmark legal case in this Southeast Asian nation.
	   Anwar was led into the the Jalan Raja Court 15 minutes before it
was scheduled to open. Hundreds of policemen threw a ring around
the colonial building to prevent his supporters from thronging the
area for a glimpse of their leader not seen since his arrest on
Sept. 20.
	   Anwar was marched off by armed police under the harsh Internal
Security Act. He faces accusations ranging from illegal homosexual
acts to treason.
	   On Tuesday, Anwar was expected to be charged on nine counts of
corruption and ``unnatural'' sex acts, the national news agency,
Bernama, reported. The punishment for each count could be several
years imprisonment.
	   A tenth charge will be brought against him in another court in a
Kuala Lumpur suburb on Wednesday, Bernama said, quoting a statement
by the Attorney-General's Chambers.
	   After he was fired on Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, Anwar had led a campaign against his former boss, who has
ruled Malaysia for 17 years.
	   Since Anwar's arrest, Kuala Lumpur has been rocked by street
protests demanding his release and Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Monday, riot police chased a few thousand pro-reform
activists through the neon-lit streets of downtown Kuala Lumpur as
protesters defied warnings to gather for a second consecutive week
near the courthouse.
	   Chanting ``Reformasi'' or ``Reforms,'' the demonstrators marched
from a courthouse, carrying banners that said, ``Free Anwar.''
	   At least 16 of Anwar's associates have been held under a harsh
security law that allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   Anwar has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated.
	   Mahathir has promised that Anwar would be given a speedy and
fair tried in an open court.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Seventeen years after privatizing its
pension funds system, Chile may have some advice for other nations
adopting or planning a similar change.
	   But the Chilean experience, while generally considered
successful, also needs corrections, including cutting management
costs, experts say.
	   Since the private system was established in 1981 by the former
military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, it has accumulated dlrs
31 billion _ in a country with a GNP of dlrs 83 billion _ from
deposits by workers and interest earnings.
	   The old state-owned and -managed system was abandoned because
over the years it became broke. Critics say it was too dependent on
the condition of the nation's finances, especially on the fiscal
deficit which in the '70s was large in most Latin American
countries. It was also seriously affected by galloping inflation,
which reached more than 600 percent annually in Chile in the
mid-70s.
	   In the new privatized system, the funds are managed by 12
private companies known as Administrators of Pension Funds, or
AFPs, and workers may freely pick which one they want to send up to
13 percent of their monthly salaries to feed their retirement
funds.
	   The AFPs invest in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments
at home and abroad, under regulation of a government agency called
Superintendency of AFPs.
	   Returns to the investments boomed to 12 percent a year until
five years ago, but since then they have dropped consistently and
posted a 1.7 percent loss during the first half of this year.
	   Superintendent of AFPs Julio Bustamante attributed the decline
to a slower pace of the Chilean economy which is expected to grow
by around 5 percent in 1998, compared to over 7 percent annually in
recent years.
	   Experts point out that the law that created the system took into
account the volatility of markets and set rules to prevent excess
risks. Among them is a provision that requires that a large portion
of the money be invested in ``fixed income instruments,'' with
yields guaranteed by the state after a certain time and immune to
markets' fluctuations.
	   Pedro Corona, who heads an association of AFPs, called the
system ``the engine that has fueled Chile's development and one of
the biggest social reforms ever made'' in the country.
	   Bustamante and others agree that corrections are needed in a
system that has been or is being implemented in other Latin
American nations, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru,
Mexico, and El Salvador.
	   Reducing management costs, increasing investments abroad and
finding a wider variety of investments at home are needed to
perfect the system, said Bustamante's deputy, Andres Cuneo. Also
pressing is adopting special safeguards for the funds of workers in
the final years of their work life.
	   Workers have freedom to move from one AFP to another, which
creates competition among the AFPs to attract them. Some were known
to offer bicycles and other presents to lure customers.
	   But the practice, Cuneo told The Associated Press, has led the
AFPs to spend much money for marketing, thus making their
administration costs to skyrocket.
	   ``An estimated 3 percent of the money deposited by workers is
actually a fee they pay to the AFP for administering their money,''
he said, and the competition for clients is mostly responsible for
that.
	   The Superintendency recently took steps to reduce administrative
spending by the AFPs, especially by making switching from one AFP
to another more difficult, ``but not prohibiting it, as the basis
of the system is freedom of choice,'' Cuneo said.
	   At retirement age _ 65 for men and 60 for women _ workers can
use their accumulated funds to calculate a monthly pension, or
leave the income linked to the performance of those funds in the
market.
	   Most workers choose the first option, and monthly pensions in
the private system equal up to 80 percent of the workers' average
monthly salary in the last three years prior to retirement. This is
almost twice as much as it was in the old state-run system.
	   Despite the obvious results, Jorge Millan, a leader of the
Central Workers Federation, said one criticism of the system
remains: Workers should have a bigger say in the way their funds
are invested.

Japanese stocks down sharply, dollar falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell sharply at midday Tuesday on
growing concerns over the credit risks of Japanese companies. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen ahead of a Federal Reserve Board
policy meeting.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 270.39 points,
or 1.94 percent, ending the morning session at 13,638.98. On
Monday, the Nikkei gained 185.53 points, or 1.35 percent.
	   Concerns about credit risks in Japan are growing after news that
Japan Leasing Corp., a nonbank affiliate of the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., filed for court protection under
bankruptcy laws Sunday.
	   On Tuesday, an auto leasing subsidiary of Japan Leasing also
filed for bankruptcy.
	   Also, many investors stayed out of the market ahead of the U.S.
Federal Open Market Committee meeting later in the day, traders
said.
	   The FOMC is widely expected to cut U.S. interest rates in a bid
to revive the global economy. Such a move could push New York
stocks higher and have a positive impact on Japanese share prices
as well.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 11.36 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,052.16
points. The TOPIX closed up 13.59 points, or 1.29 percent.
	   In currency trading, strong expectations that the U.S. is set to
reduce interest rates weighed on the dollar for most of the
morning, traders said.
	   The dollar bought 135.36 yen at midday, down 0.36 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 135.85
yen overnight. Earlier Tuesday, the currency rose as high as 136.40
yen.
	   Lower interest rates likely would weaken support for the U.S.
currency in the short term by reducing yields on dollar-denominated
assets.
	   Also supporting the yen was a report by Kyodo News service
quoting an international financial source as saying G-7 finance
ministers and central bank chiefs would agree to strengthen efforts
to support the yen in Washington at their meeting on Oct. 3.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.810 percent from Monday's finish of 0.800
percent, driving its price down to 108.91 yen from 109.01 yen.

Japan refutes North Korea's claim it launched a satellite
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ There is little chance the rocket launched by North
Korea last month carried a satellite, Japan's Defense Agency said
Tuesday, contradicting claims by both the North and the U.S.
intelligence community.
	   No trace of a satellite has been found and investigators have
been unable to pick up broadcast signals that North Korea claimed
it transmitted, a Defense Agency investigation has determined.
	   The agency also contends the rocket, fired from a launch pad on
North Korea's east coast Aug. 31, did not reach the velocity
necessary to put a satellite into orbit, said an agency official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The rocket flew over Japan's main island, causing deep concern
here and indicating that the North has acquired much better rocket
capabilities than previously suspected.
	   Determining exactly what was launched has proven to be extremely
difficult, however.
	   The North says it launched a ``Bright Star'' satellite that went
into earth orbit and transmitted patriotic songs.
	   U.S. intelligence agencies said the North had tested a
multi-stage ballistic missile, with one stage dropping into the Sea
of Japan between Japan and Russia, and another overshooting Japan
to crash into the Pacific.
	   American officials initially expressed doubt about the North's
satellite claim, but have since said a satellite was indeed
launched _ but failed to achieve orbit.
	   Japan's Defense Agency, however, said it believes the U.S.
position on the launch contains ``estimations'' and requires
further study to be more conclusive.
	   Officials on both sides have said that even if the launching did
involve a satellite, it was still a serious challenge to Japanese
security.
	   The launch came amid U.S. efforts to curb the communist state's
missile sales to Middle Eastern countries. North Korea reportedly
is trying to develop ballistic missiles with ranges long enough to
hit Hawaii and Alaska.
	   The Japanese protested the launch to the U.N. Security Council
and suspended its dlrs 1 billion contribution to a dlrs 4.6 billion
project to build nuclear reactors in North Korea.
	   The launch also prompted the United States and Japan to agreed
to conduct joint research on a missile defense system that could
protect the island nation from attack.
	   In response, North Korea this week accused the United States and
``other hostile forces'' of slander and threatened to use its new
rocket system for military purposes.
	   The United States has 100,000 troops in North Asia, about
one-half in Japan and one-third guarding the tense demilitarized
zone between North and South Korea.

Lions 27, Buccaneers 6
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PONTIAC, Michigan. (AP) _ It was a big night for Detroit
rookies, and the Lions got their first victory.
	   Rookie defensive back Terry Fair returned a kickoff 105 yards
for a touchdown, and rookie quarterback Charlie Batch scored on a
sneak as the Lions beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27-6 Monday night.
	   Fair's kickoff return that broke the game open in the fourth
quarter was the longest touchdown in the history of the Lions.
Batch, in his second start, completed 14-of-23 passes for 115 yards
and scored on a 1-yard sneak in the third quarter.
	   He also rushed for 39 yards on eight carries as the Lions won
for the first time in four games.
	   Batch's total offense was 154 yards. Tampa's Bay's team total
was 133.
	   Bryant Westbrook scored on a 34-yard interception return, and
Jason Hanson, who had to assume punting duties when John Jett was
injured, kicked field goals of 27 and 25 yards for the Lions.
	   Michael Husted kicked field goals of 43 and 47 yards for the
Bucs (1-3), whose playoff hopes might also be in jeopardy because
both Green Bay and Minnesota both are in the NFC Central.
	   Barry Sanders, with his second 100-yard game of the season,
rushed for 131 yards on 27 carries and had 23 yards receiving.
	   Trent Dilfer was 12-of-30 for 120 yards with one interception
for the Bucs.
	   The game was held up for 10 minutes in the second quarter after
rookie Tampa Bay receiver Brice Hunter was injured during a
helmet-to-helmet collision with Detroit's Mark Carrier. Hunter was
carried from the field on a stretcher and evaluated at the POH
Medical Center emergency trauma center.
	   Hunter had full use of all extremities, and was expected to be
released late Monday night.
	   The Lions had luck on their side, too. With 1:42 left in the
third quarter, Dilfer hit Karl Williams in the end zone with a
24-yard touchdown pass that would have closed the gap to 20-10. But
the play was waved off by a delay penalty. Robert Porcher broke in
to sack Dilfer on the next play, and the Bucs punted.
	   With 10:44 left in the fourth quarter, Dilfer hit Dave Moore for
another apparent touchdown, but Dilfer was flagged for being beyond
the line of scrimmage when he threw the ball. The Bucs settled for
Husted's second field goal.
	   But Fair, whose muffed punt had set up the Bucs' score, made up
for it in hurry by returning the ensuing kickoff for a 27-6 lead.
	   Batch, as he did in his debut at Minnesota, moved the Lions
fairly well in the first half, keeping the Bucs off balance with
his scrambling.
	   But the results were the same. Batch couldn't get Detroit into
the end zone, so the Lions had to settle for a pair of field goals
and a 6-3 halftime lead.
	   And the Bucs, as they did a week earlier against Chicago, seemed
to slumber through the first two quarters. The Bucs had only 85
yards at halftime, compared with 170 for Detroit.
	   On that occasion, the Bucs snapped back for 27 second-half
points and won going away. This time, it was the Lions who came to
life.
	   On the third snap of the third quarter, Westbrook stepped in
front of Williams for Detroit's first turnover of the season.
Westbrook, with no one in front of him, zipped down the sideline
for the touchdown and a 13-3 Detroit lead.
	   Still fired up, the Lions defense forced Tampa Bay to go
three-and-out.
	   Then Sanders got going. He gained six yards on a first-down
carry. On the next play, he broke away on one of his patented
twisting, turning runs for 42 yards to the Bucs' 3.
	   Batch finally got the Lions an offensive touchdown with a 1-yard
sneak on fourth down for a 20-3 lead.
