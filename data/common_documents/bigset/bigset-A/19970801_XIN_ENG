<HEADLINE> Kenya to Limit Governmental Borrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has announced tough monetary policies to curb inflation and
strengthen the Kenyan Shilling including strict guidelines on
governmental borrowing from the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, the government is only entitled to
borrow up to six billion Shillings (109 million U.S. Dollars),
five percent of the 119 billion Shillings (2.16 billion Dollars)
that it earns as revenue, in the 1997-1998 financial year.
</P>
<P>
It is a sharp decline from the 38 billion Shillings the
government borrowed last year. The government now owes the bank
128 billion Shillings (2.33 billion Dollars), the Kenyan Times
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement issued by CBK governor Micah
Cheserem, excessive direct borrowing by the government from the
CBK is to blame for the monetary expansion and inflation in the
past.
</P>
<P>
The government borrowing from the Treasury will in future not
be allowed to exceed five percent of its gross recurrent revenue
while any advances made to the government shall be deemed to be a
loan from the bank whose terms and conditions shall be determined
by the finance minister, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new CBK monetary policy for the next
12 months is directed to achieving and maintaining price
stability as targeted single-digit inflation will support
meaningful and lasting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The policy is aimed at reassuring Kenyans that the Shilling
will retain its value over time and that it will help markets to
work efficiently in promoting better use of available resources,
said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Women Urged to Form Economic Blocs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Women should organize themselves
into strong economic entities in the informal sector, Zimbabwe's
first lady Grace Mugabe said here today.
</P>
<P>
Officially closing the eighth Pan African Women's Organization
(PAWO) Congress, Mrs. Mugabe said women should venture into these
because it is difficult for them to undertake large enterprises
under the current economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Much still needed to be done to improve the economic status of
women in Africa, she said, adding that governments should support
small-scale economic activities such as markets.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Mugabe also urged women to seek assistance to improve
their management skills so that they could run their undertakings
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
''Indeed, when women are safe and secure economically, they
can contribute immensely to solving some of our social ills,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
The first lady said the resolutions made at the congress would
have far-reaching implications especially in the areas of
education, economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
''Educated girl children are certainly a positive assurance
for our continent's prosperity,'' she said, adding that women
should assist in the preservation of African culture.
</P>
<P>
The congress, which started on July 28, discussed issues
pertaining to women and focused on poverty, education, violence,
economic empowerment and status of women.
</P>
<P>
The PAWO, formed by women in 1962 to fight against
colonialism, has now shifted its focus on regional conflicts.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Supply, Demand in 1997/98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is forecast
6 million higher at 585 million tons in 1997/98, compared with 582
million tons in 1996/97, according to a press release by the
International Grains Council today.
</P>
<P>
The main changes from last month include higher estimates for
the United States, Russia, China and Pakistan, but reductions for
the European Community, Central/Eastern Europe and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
World wheat trade is now forecast 1 million higher at 96
million tons, 2 million more than last year and the highest since
1992/93.
</P>
<P>
The latest data include increases for Poland, Iran, Pakistan
and Egypt, offsetting reductions for China and India.
</P>
<P>
With regard to exporting countries, a lower figure for
Australia is compensated by increases for Argentina and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
While projected exports are unchanged for Hungary and Romania,
supplies from these origins could include substantial amounts of
feed quality wheat.
</P>
<P>
World wheat consumption is forecast 2 million higher at 584
million tons, compared with 587 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure for food use is unchanged at 434 million tons. Feed
use has been raised by 2 million to 94 million tons, reflecting an
increase in the United States and a small recovery in Russia in
line with a larger harvest.
</P>
<P>
World wheat stocks are forecast 1 million tons up on last
season's revised total at 100 million tons. Amongst the major
exporters, stocks in the United States will increase, Canada will
record a decline, and those in Argentina, Australia and the EC
could be little changed.

<HEADLINE> New Treatment Increases Prostate Cancer Survival Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A combination of radiation therapy
and a hormone treatment can significantly increase the survival
rate of men with prostate cancer that has begun to spread, a joint
Canadian and European study has found.
</P>
<P>
The study followed a group of men who were treated after their
advanced cancer had spread outside the prostate but before it had
begun to form tumors in other organs of the body.
</P>
<P>
Those who received a hormone treatment after radiation had a
five-year survival rate of 17 percentage points higher than those
who received the standard radiation treatment alone.
</P>
<P>
In effect, the synthetic hormone shuts down production of the
male sex hormone testosterone, to prevent testosterone from
stimulating growth for cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
The side effects are losing interest in sex and hot flashes,
the study said. The results appear today in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year study involved 415 men, who were randomly
assigned to two treatment groups, one receiving seven weeks of
radiation treatment alone and the second receiving radiation plus
a hormone taken over three years.
</P>
<P>
After five years, 79 percent of the men in the first group were
still alive, compared with 62 percent of the second group.
</P>
<P>
And about 85 percent of the survivors in the combined therapy
group and only 48 percent of those who had radiation alone did not
have a recurrence of their cancer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers couldn't estimate how many more months or years
the hormonal therapy might add to the life expectancy of a
prostate cancer patient.
</P>
<P>
Yet, more than half the men in the study are still alive eight
years after treatment, Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, prostate cancer is the second-most common cause of
cancer death in men, and its incidence has been increasing by over
5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 new cases are diagnosed each year and more than
4,000 men die of it, the paper said.

JAKARTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today urged the international community to seek ways to implement
development and improve their welfare without causing damage to
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Opening the third international conference on zero emissions
held here at the State Palace, the president stressed that the
world is in danger as a result of the destruction of the
environment and ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
"The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro has encouraged an economic
development that is friendly to the environment, namely
sustainable development through activities that consider both
environmental and development aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the environment has been further
deteriorated five years after the Earth Summit and the developed
countries were obligated to deal with water and air pollution,
acid rains and an increasing volume of dangerous and poisonous
wastes.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot imagine the sufferings that will befall our children
and grandchildren if we ignore the threat to the environment,"
Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the three-day conference is the symbiosis between
global environment and industrial growth.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Arrives in Iran for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
arrived here today for talks with Iranians officials on bilateral
relations and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president was greeted at the airport by his Iranian
counterpart Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
This was Assad's second visit to Iran since the 1991 Gulf War
which changed the political map of the region.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the two sides will exchange views on the
sensitive situation in the region, issues concerning Muslim and
Arab states' relations with Israel, recent developments between
Turkey and the Israeli regime and the fourth Middle East and North
Africa economic summit scheduled for later this year in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He said Assad's visit is taking place at a time when the
U.S. Congress recognized Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the
Israeli regime and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
stated Israel's assertions of annexing the Golan Heights, a
strategic point captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that Iran and Syria have had
cooperation in economic and technical fields and that the Syrian
officials accompanying Assad are expected to hold talks with their
Iranian counterparts on ways to develop mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the friendly ties between Iran and Syria,
Rafsanjani said that Iranian and Syrian officials have always
consult on important regional and global issues since the triumph
of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Assad was accompanied on the visit by Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and Deputy
Prime Minister in charge of Public Services Rashid Akhtarini.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Plans to Restore Civilian Rule in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The military junta will hand
over power to a new civilian government after presidential
election is held in November 2001, according to a statement
broadcast on radio and television today.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by leader of the military government Major
Johnny Paul Koroma said the return to civilian rule will begin
with town, municipal and city council elections held on a
non-party basis in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
It will be followed by district council elections in August
1999 and by provincial assembly elections run on political party
tickets in May 2000. And a national parliamentary election will
follow in February 2001 with presidential election held nine
months later.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made after envoys from ECOWAS broke off
talks with the military junta and recommended tightening economic
sanctions to force it to reverse the May 25 coup in Freetown and
reinstate civilian president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
''We shall not be stampeded into hurrying matter beyond the
appointed time,'' Koroma said in the broadcast. He announced the
immediate setting up of a Constitutional Review Commission but
did not say who its members are.
</P>
<P>
Koroma said he would soon sign a decree to set up a People's
Revolutionary Court, which will be presided over by five
assessors, to try all civil and criminal cases except murder and
treason.
</P>
<P>
He also warned two British based banks -- Barclays and
standard chartered bank, which had been closed since May 26 that
they should ''start operations by Monday, August 4 or their
actions will be regarded as deliberate sabotage" and "we will
withdraw their licenses to operate and force them to liquidate.''
</P>
<P>
Some Sierra Leoneans today called the statement ''a crucial
blow and bombshell''. One irate politician said, ''a four year
time frame is too excessively long. We had hoped the army would
have stayed for at most a year.''
</P>
<P>
In Bo, in the south and the country's second largest city,
many residents reached by phone were ''completely
disillusioned''. In Makeni in the north, where agricultural farms
have been abandoned, residents said they now fear a military
intervention by ECOWAS -- the Economic Community of West African
States -- is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is leading pressure by the ECOWAS to evict the army
junta from power. For this Koroma called on Nigerian troops to
withdraw from Sierra Leone, saying that Sierra Leone is
reconsidering its membership of a number of unspecified regional
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq in Dreadful Shortage of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in the Karbalaa
governorate of Iraq, 90 kilometers south of capital Baghdad, has
seen 39 deformed newly-born babies in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq News Agency today quoted the hospital director as
saying that this is due to the dreadful shortage of vaccines and
other medicine, a damaging result of the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.7 million people, including 750,000 children below the
age of five, have perished because of the scarcity of food and
medicine since the U.N. embargo took effect in 1991 for its
invasion of Kuwait which sparked the Gulf War, according to
statistics released by the Iraqi Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The situation continues devastating. Under its oil-for-food
deal with the U.N. last December, Iraq was allowed to purchase 7
million U.S. dollar worth of medicine and medical instruments from
foreign pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
This amount, however, is far from adequate compared with its
annual import of some 2 billion dollar worth of medical supplies
in the years before the U.N. sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
Shelves have long been empty in state-run drug stores and
hospitals. Even the most commonly used medicine, such as
penicillin and other anti-biotics, are rare in black markets,
</P>
<P>
A tube of tetracycline, for example, is sold in the black
market at a skyrocketing price of 800 Iraqi dinars (about 0.6
dollars) when monthly salary for an average government employee
range between 4,000 and 5,000 dinars (three to four dollars).
</P>
<P>
What makes things worse is that state-run hospitals are not
able to keep their qualified doctors from leaving, battered by low
salaries. People have to go to private clinics for basic medical
help.
</P>
<P>
But most of them are daunted away by the appalling price tags
in the private clinics as visit fee normally stands as high as
12,000 dinars (about nine dollars), almost equaling three months'
salary and barely affordable for an ordinary income-earner.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in February that
Iraq's medical system is going to collapse because of the shortage
of medicine and medical facilities.

GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States considers the

immediately. The Ottawa process and CD negotiations each make a
useful contribution and each augments the other," he said. "In a
word they are `complementary.' There is no reason why either one
has to interfere with the other."
</P>
<P>
However, Earle said, the value of negotiating a landmine ban in
the CD could be confirmed by looking around the meeting room: as
of June 27, more than half of the CD members, including the United
States, have not associated themselves with the Brussels
Declaration of the Ottawa process. "Many of them have security
concerns about eliminating their landmines in the near future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States holds that negotiations in the CD can take
these concerns, including its own, into account. "While the CD's
task will take longer to accomplish than the Ottawa process, the
resulting treaty will, unlike the Ottawa process, extend the reach
of an APL ban to the major producers, stockpilers and exporters of
APLs," Earle stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earle also urged the CD to consider the reinforcing impact that
a fissile material cut-off convention would have on parallel
efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads. Without such a treaty the
chances of achieving the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament
would be decreased significantly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CD is yet to find agreement on a program of work for its
1997 session. It will have another plenary on August 7.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Extend Mandate of UNOMIG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations today decided to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Georgia for a period of six months
until January 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its deep concern at the continued deadlock in
achieving a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhaz,
the Security Council reiterated its commitment to the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally
recognized borders and to the necessity of defining the status of
Abkhazia in strict accordance with these principles.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the unacceptability of any action by the Abkhaz
leadership in contravention of these principles, the Security
Council stressed the primary responsibility for reinvigorating the
peace process rests on the parties themselves, and called on them
to achieve substantive progress without further delay towards a
comprehensive political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The council reaffirmed the right of all refugees and displaced
persons affected by the conflict to return to homes in secure
conditions in accordance with international law and condemned the
continued obstruction of the return.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the continued laying of mines, including new types
of mines, in the Gali region and called upon the parties to take
all measures in their power to prevent mine-laying and intensified
activities by armed groups and to cooperate fully with the UNOMIG
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping
force in order to honor their commitment to ensure the safety and
freedom of movement of all personnel of the United Nations, the
CIS peacekeeping force and international humanitarian
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Embnargo on S. Leone Tightened as Talks Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- West African countries today vowed
to tighten embargo and sanctions on Sierra Leone's military
government as talks for restoring democracy in the troubled
country broke off.
</P>
<P>
In a "final declaration" at the end of the talks in Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, said the new
position of Sierra Leonean delegation on the issue of reinstating
the civilian government toppled in the May 25 coup was "totally
unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
therefore will strengthen economic embargo and sanctions against
the military junta, said Ikimi, leader of the Committee of Four
on Sierra Leone, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi announced the the collapse of the talks in Abidjan after
military ruler Major Johnny Paul Koroma said the junta "will not
hand over power to a civilian government" until presidential
election is held in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
"It is an affront to ECOWAS. It is an affront to Africa. It is
an affront to the international community," Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
As the military junta has changed its position, Ikimi said,
the committee considered it "useless to continue discussion" in
Abidjan.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the second round between the two sides to seek ways
to restore the ousted government led by President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, began on Tuesday and ended abruptly after Koroma's
defiant announcement in the capital Freetown Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first round negotiation took place two weeks ago and the
committee, made up by foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea
and Cote d'Ivoire, decided to give the junta a week's time for
another talks.
</P>
<P>
The committee has earlier asked the Koroma regime to hand over
power to Kabbah's government or it will employ embargo or even
force to oust the military junta.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the blockade by the ECOWAS peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) has resulted in short supply of foodstuffs and
drugs in the troubled country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Arafat Not Responsible for Bomb Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said here today that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat should not
be blamed for the two bombings in Jerusalem that killed 15 people
and injured more than 170 others Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We should not overstate matters. We have expressed our sorrow
for this incident and to the families of the victims.
Responsibility cannot be placed on President Arafat," Moussa said,
quoted by the Egyptian MENA news agency.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed the bombings on the Palestinian militants,
accusing Arafat of encouraging such acts, while the U.S. has
demanded the Palestinian leader to take decisive steps to improve
security.
</P>
<P>
Moussa urged all parties to avoid anything which might lead to
an "erosion" of the peace process, stressing that maintaining
peace and security is an important responsibility of all.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has declared a state of emergency and launched an arrest
campaign among Islamic fundamentalists in the
Palestinian-controlled West Bank and Gaza Strip after Wednesday's
bombings, the deadliest since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on measures Israel took following the suicide
bombings, Moussa said that the exercise of self-restraint is
important in such circumstances and that no measures should be
taken to make matters more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with U.S. Ambassador here Edward
Walker, Moussa stressed that it was important that U.S. efforts
should continue to salvage the peace process so that it could not
be destroyed on any pretext.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Israeli President Ezer Weizman's statement that the
latest suicide operation was related to the planned building of an
Israeli settlement at Ras el Amud, Moussa said all measures which
lead to frustration and despair should not continue.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made separate telephone calls to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy to
express his condolences for the victims of Jerusalem blasts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of salvaging the peace process so
that all peoples in the area may enjoy security and stability.

<HEADLINE> One in 334 Angolans to be Wounded by Landmine: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- In Angola, one of the countries
which possess the largest number of landmines planted underground
in the world, one out of every 334 people is estimated to be
wounded by the landmine, the Angola News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African landmine sweeping expert Van Der Walt told
Angolan military personnel during a landmines clearance course
held in Pretoria, the South African capital, that there are more
than 10 million landmines buried underground all over Angola.
</P>
<P>
The large figure means that every Angolan has more than one
landmines on average, he said, adding that one of every 334
Angolans will be wounded by the landmine.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that nearly 70 people are wounded by the
landmine worldwide every day. More unfortunately, some countries
are continuing to bury landmines, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, since 1996, South Africa has been
helping Angola train professional personnel for landmine
sweeping. So far, scores of Angolan military personnel have been
trained in the field of landmine clerance in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> German Soldiers Continue to Fight Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of German soldiers today
continued their battle to save homes and crops from flooding in
eastern Germany as a new dike breach on the swollen Oder River
occurred this morning.
</P>
<P>
The new damage was 100 meters south of the gap which opened up
Wednesday in the Oderbruch region on the border with Poland.
</P>
<P>
Military helicopters were dumping thousands of sandbags onto
both sections while 5,000 troops were trying hard to heal the
rupture, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"The dikes have been badly waterlogged, like jelly," said
Michael Muth, chief of the crisis commission of the eastern German
Brandenburg state.
</P>
<P>
About 2,900 have already been evacuated from the region so far.
Another 10,800 people were also asked to leave today. If the dikes
collapse, floodwaters could submerge an area of over 200 square
kilometers in three to four days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the army's successful efforts so far, breaches could
occur at any time on the sodden dikes, they added.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters meanwhile are predicting more rains for the
coming days. Water levels on the Oder are not expected to go down
considerably until next week.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting in Warsaw today, German and Polish officials
reportedly proposed a joint program with the participation of the
Czech Republic and the European Union to regulate the Oder River
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The plan would involve water retention reservoirs,
environmental protection and dams to protect towns and cities,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The flood over the past weeks, the worse in central Europe in
200 years, has ravaged 550,000 hectares of land in Poland and one
third of land surface in the Czech Republic, killing 105 people in
the two countries. Germany has seen three border villages flooded,
but no casualties have been reported so far.

<HEADLINE> First Eastern African Stamp Show Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The first-ever eastern African
stamp exhibition, with thousands of delicate stamps on display
and sale, attracted hundreds of enthusiastic visitors here on its
first day today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition, sponsored by the postal authorities
of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and several regional stamp clubs,
was aimed at promoting philately and close cooperation between
philatelists in the region, said the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they also hoped the show, with key topics
on wildlife, plants, flowers, sports and local arts, can
encourage young people to use their spare time for this
interesting and educative hobby.
</P>
<P>
Although the organizers lamented that stamp collection are
old-fashioned among and neglected by the young generation in the
region, cheerful teenagers poured into the crowded fair and
showed strong interest in stamps riotous with color.
</P>
<P>
Many visitors registered and paid fees for taking part in
stamp clubs on the scene.
</P>
<P>
Four series of stamps designed to commemorate late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, two issued by Tanzania and the others by
Uganda, caused special attention and sold well.
</P>
<P>
The first east Africa stamps, square-shaped in red brown, were
issued in considerable quantity by Britain in 1890. Each of them,
if unused, now worths 500 pounds (some 816 U.S. Dollars), an aged
veteran philatelist told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The three eastern African countries, all once British
colonies, only issued stamps respectively by their own after they
declared independence in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Currently Kenya issues five to eight series of stamps annually
while Tanzania four to eight and Uganda eight to 12, said the
organizers.

UNITED NATIONS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today reiterated the call for immediate restoration of
constitutional order in Sierra Leone under President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
After informal consultations today, Council President Peter

<HEADLINE> US Economic Growth Slows Down in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth slowed
down sharply in the second quarter of this year, the U.S. Commerce
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at a moderate 2.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter,
declined from a robust 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter and a
4.3 percent rate during the final three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Labor Department said the number of
American workers filing first-time claims for unemployment
benefits fell by 22,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted
277,000, the lowest level in more than 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending -- accounting for about two-thirds of the
economy's output -- was the big factor. Their spending grew at a
lackluster 0.8 percent rate in the second quarter after surging at
a 5.3 percent rate in the first.
</P>
<P>
A key inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose at a scant 1.4
percent annual rate, down from 2.4 percent in the first quarter
and the lowest in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
Other factors detracting from growth in the second quarter
included a slowing in the accumulation of goods in inventories and
a deterioration in the trade balance. The fastest import growth in
13 years, 21.8 percent at an annual rate, swamped the 14.4 percent
rate of increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
Business investment, however, increased as did home building
and government spending. Business investment in new plants and
equipment grew at a 15.1 percent rate, more than triple the 4.1
percent pace of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
House and apartment construction grew at a 5.6 percent rate, up
from 3.3 percent in the previous quarter. Government spending
which includes that at local, state and federal levels, advanced
at a 3.8 percent pace, in contrast with a slight decline in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic output in the second quarter stands at
an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 7.14 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department today also issued revised GDP figures
back to 1993. It showed the economy grew a bit faster last year
than the previous estimate, 2.8 percent compared with 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Leaders Agree on Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash agreed today to
solve the long-standing issue of missing persons during Turkey's
invasion of the island in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to provide each other "immediately and
simultaneously" with all information at their disposal regarding
the location of graves, U.N. Resident Representative Gustave
Feissel told reporters after a meeting between Clerides and
Denktash this evening at his residence in the U.N.-controlled
Nicosia airport area.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between Clerides and Denktash
within a week to discuss the humanitarian issues which
constitute an important aspect of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing after 30,000 Turkish military personnel landed and took
over one third of the northern eastern Mediterranean island in
1974 following a pro-Athens coup by some Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said both leaders also agreed to appoint persons who
will exchange this information and prepare the necessary
arrangement leading to the return of the remains of the missing
persons by this September.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also announced that President Clerides and
Denktash agreed that the remains of persons killed in action
will also be returned to their families.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said the two leaders consider the issue of the
missing as purely humanitarian and agreed not to exploit it
politically.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy noted that a number of other humanitarian
issues were also discussed, and something will be announced in a
few days.
</P>
<P>
He added that Clerides and Denktash found "useful" their
meetings in Nicosia this week and indicated their readiness for
further meetings of this kind to deal with humanitarian matters
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two meetings took place after the first round of the
direct negotiations between the two leaders at Troutbeck, near
New York from July 9 to 12.
</P>
<P>
The second round of U.N.-led direct talks between the two
communities' leaders are scheduled on August 11-16 in
Switzerland to continue searching solution to the Cyprus problem
which has remained unsolved since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Iraq in Dreadful Shortage of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in the Karbalaa
governorate of Iraq, 90 kilometers south of capital Baghdad, has
seen 39 deformed newly-born babies in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq News Agency today quoted the hospital director as
saying that this is due to the dreadful shortage of vaccines and
other medicine, a damaging result of the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.4 million people, including 750,000 children below the
age of five, have perished because of the scarcity of food and
medicine since the U.N. embargo took effect in 1990 for its
invasion of Kuwait which sparked the Gulf War, according to
statistics released by the Iraqi Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The situation continues devastating. Under its oil-for-food
deal with the U.N. last December, Iraq was allowed to purchase 7
million U.S. dollars worth of medicine and medical instruments from
foreign pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
This amount, however, is far from adequate compared with its
annual import of some 2 billion dollars worth of medical supplies
in the years before the U.N. sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
Shelves have long been empty in state-run drug stores and
hospitals. Even the most commonly used medicine, such as
penicillin and other anti-biotics, are rare in black markets,
</P>
<P>
A tube of tetracycline, for example, is sold in the black
market at a skyrocketing price of 800 Iraqi dinars (about 0.6
dollars) when monthly salary for an average government employee
range between 4,000 and 5,000 dinars (three to four dollars).
</P>
<P>
What makes things worse is that state-run hospitals are not
able to keep their qualified doctors from leaving, battered by low
salaries. People have to go to private clinics for basic medical
help.
</P>
<P>
But most of them are daunted away by the appalling price tags
in the private clinics as visit fee normally stands as high as
12,000 dinars (about nine dollars), almost equaling three months'
salary and barely affordable for an ordinary income-earner.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in February that
Iraq's medical system is going to collapse because of the shortage
of medicine and medical facilities.

<HEADLINE> Russian Peacekeepers Still in Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The mandate of the Russian
peacekeepers in Abkhazia expires on Thursday, but their activities
in the conflict zone will not be stopped, the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted a senior Russian military official as reporting on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Alexander Arinakhin, who is an aide to the
head of Russia's General Headquarters for peacekeeping operations,
said that the decision to terminate the peacekeepers activity can
only be taken by a CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) summit
which had issued the mandate.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a decision on behalf of CIS leaders can also
be made by the present chairman of the CIS Council -- Russian
president Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Arinakhin continued, the peacekeepers' activities can
be terminated upon an official demand by one of the conflicting
sides. But, neither Georgia, nor Abkhazia has made such statements
yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Another report from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, said that
Georgia will not insist in holding the peacekeeping forces in the
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
Levan Aleksidze, Georgian presidential adviser and a major
legal expert in the Georgian delegation at the talks on settlement
in Abkhazia, said on Thursday "We will wait" for decisions the
CIS summit in the fall will make.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the same day Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko
Nadibaidze flew Moscow on a special commission from Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss problems pertaining to
the expiration of the Russian peacekeepers' mandate in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian peacekeepers were brought into the conflict zone on
June 23, 1994, in line with the ceasefire and disengagement
agreement dated May 14, 1994.
</P>
<P>
A CIS summit in the spring of 1997 extended their mandate until
July 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Russia's contingent of peacekeepers in Abkhazia currently
numbers 1,600.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advisory Team Gathers to Assess Mideast Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton's Middle
East advisory team on Thursday gathered at the White House to
discuss the situations after suicide bombings at a Jerusalem
market, which killed 15 people and injured more than 150, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
The team will discuss developments and "next steps" in the
stalemated peace process, White House press secretary Mike McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very much they will present recommendations to the
president at this point. It's more of an assessment meeting,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is not expected to attend the meeting, but
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who cut short an Asian
trip, Middle East mediator Dennis Ross and national Security
Adviser Sandy Berger were to take part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombings at the Jerusalem market, which killed 15
people and injured more than 150, was the deadliest attack since
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won election in 1996.
The Islamic militant movement Hamas claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Clinton on Wednesday condemned the bombings as a barbarous act,
and called on Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to take concrete
steps to strengthen security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright has said on her way back to Washington that Arafat
had assured her to commit himself to restoring security in the
region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Balanced Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Senate today approved a
legislation to balance the budget and shrink the size of the
federal government after the House of Representatives did so on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed with a bipartisan vote of 85-15, will be sent
to President Bill Clinton for signature.
</P>
<P>
The bill called for about 130 billion U.S. dollars in spending
restraint needed to balance the budget. Meanwhile, the measure
remodels Medicare and creates a new 24 billion U.S. dollars
program of health care for uninsured children insisted on by the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton called the budget bill "the
achievement of a generation and a triumph for every American,"
adding that it marks an end to decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the bill is "the achievement of generation and
a triumph for every American," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"This good for America," said Senate Republican Leader Trent
Lott. "It's a major step forward. Maybe not a leap, but a major
step."
</P>
<P>
The balanced budget bill, a measure designed to rid the nation
of deficits for the first time since 1969, had held center stage
in both the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
With the budget bill cleared for Clinton's approval, lawmakers
turned their attention to the 151.6 billion U.S. dollars five-year
tax cut legislation.
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to pass it later in the day while the
Senate is to approve it on Friday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said today that the commander of a U.S. air base in Saudi
Arabia failed to adequately protect against a terrorist strike
that killed 19 U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting President Bill Clinton, Cohen said he
was blocking the promotion of Brig. Gen. Terryl Schwalier, whose
unit lost 19 airmen to a huge truck bomb explosion that tore
through the Dhahran barracks known as Khobar Towers on June 15,
1996.
</P>
<P>
"The president accepted my recommendation that Brig. General
Schwalier's name be withdrawn from the promotion list, " Cohen
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Cohen faulted Schwalier for failing to adequately assess the
threat to the perimeter of the housing complex and prepare for a
possible bombing.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's decision goes against two internal Air Force reports,
which contended Schwalier did everything he could have done for
the safety of the men and women at the complex in Dhahran.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Attempt Foiled in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The British bomb disposal officers
carried out a controlled explosion today in a car at a hotel in
Northern Ireland, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve days ago, the Irish Republican Army declared ceasefire
in Northern Ireland in order to allow its political wing Sinn Fein
to take part in the substantive peace talks in September.
</P>
<P>
The device, reportedly containing up to 450 kilograms of
home-made explosive, was assumed to have been planted Thursday
night near the hotel in County Fermanagh, about 160 kilometers
west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were alerted to the device by two telephone
calls but without giving further details.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam today condemned the car
bomb attempt and asked for a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
No groups have claimed responsibility so far but security
forces suspect the Continuity Army Council (CAC) to be linked.
</P>
<P>
CAC is opposed to negotiations with Britain and says that an
end to rule of Northern Ireland by London will only come about by
force.
</P>
<P>
IRA, the key outlawed guerrilla organization which has been
fighting against the British rule of Northern Ireland since 1969
called for a ceasefire on July 20, bringing hopes to boost the
stalled Northern Ireland peace process.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Calls for Return to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
today called for a return to the Israeli-Arab peace talks despite
Wednesday's suicide bombings in Jerusalem, warning that all sides
will lose if the peace process collapses.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made this appeal in Abu Ghosh near Jerusalem during a
condolence visit to the family of an Arab victim of the double
bombings, which took 15 lives and wounded over 170 in central
Mahane Yehuda vegetable and fruit market.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli militant Palestinian organization Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) has claimed responsibility, though
Israeli security forces have not proved the authenticity of the
claim.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the stupidity of the bombings surpassed any other
previous terror attacks in Israel, Weizman said the tragedy
indicated the need for a common future for both Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The president also expressed the hope that both sides would
understand bombs and terror would not achieve anything, and urged
Israelis and Arabs to return to the negotiating table. "Everyone
would lose if the peace process collapses," Weizman said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's call appeared to be the most sober and rational voice
ever heard from Israeli leaders since the tragic bombings that
incurred tough reactions from Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the bombings on the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process could not continue until the
Palestinian side launches an all-out war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to dispatch Israeli troops to re-enter
Palestinian self-rule areas to track down Arab extremists, a move
that was criticized by the PNA as a "declaration of war."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders have warned about the danger of killing the
peace process and of pushing the region back to war in the
aftermath of the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday bombings erased the newly emerging optimism over
breaking the prolonged deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process caused by Israel's building of controversial Har Homa
settlement in East Jerusalem in March. Only two days before, the
two sides agreed to restart political negotiations some time in
the week.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack also canceled a planned visit to the region
by the United States Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross, who was
about to kick off, starting Thursday, a new round of mediation
aimed at achieving quick progress in the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Economic Growth Forecast for Third Quarter in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth of Shanghai,
China's largest industrial center, will continue to develop at a
fast pace in the third quarter of this year, according to a local
economic forecast.
</P>
<P>
The city's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the third quarter is
expected to reach 85.7 billion yuan, up 13 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, released by the Shanghai Information Center, was
based on the strong economic growth in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-June period, Shanghai's GDP rose to 154 billion
yuan, a 13.7-percent increase over last year's same period, four
percent higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The service trade developed rapidly, making up 44.6 percent of
its GDP. The added value of financial and insurance sectors
accounted for one third of that of the city's total service trade.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value surged 14.4 percent to 269 billion
yuan. It has achieved a good harvest in summer grain and farm
produce.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign trade registered a 12.7-percent rise to
reach 7.3 billion US dollars. The export value of foreign-funded
firms increased by 40 percent, with electronic and machinery
products making up a quarter of the export.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, overseas business people have
signed 888 contracts, involving a contractual value of 2.2 billion
US dollars. Some 60 percent were industrial projects. The 95 key
projects have absorbed 1.7 billion US dollars, making up three
fourths of the city's foreign funds.

<HEADLINE> More UK Women Return to Work soon after Having Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- More and more working women in
Britain return to their jobs soon after having a baby due to
financial and career pressures, according to a report published
today.
</P>
<P>
The report, Maternity Rights and Benefits, by the Policy
Studies Institute, said that two out of three women now go back to
work shortly after giving birth, compared with less than half in
1988, an increase of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report, funded by the government and based on
interviews with managers in 1,485 workplaces and a postal survey
of 2,051 mothers, showed that women are taking less time off work
before having their babies.
</P>
<P>
More than a third of women continued to work during the six
weeks before childbirth last year, compared with only 15 percent
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Women are also more likely to return sooner after the birth,
with 81 percent going back within 28 weeks in 1996, compared with
75 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
On average, women took 27 weeks' maternity leave in 1996, but
14 percent who were entitled to the statutory minimum of 14 weeks
took less than that amount.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the changes in women's work patterns may
be due in some cases to financial pressures, but others may be
trying to minimize any disruption to their careers.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the study, Harriet Harman, the social security
secretary, said that the report provided vital new information and
one of the government's key aims was to promote measures that
would help people to balance the demands of work and family life.
</P>
<P>
"We will do all that we can to encourage employers to make
improvements in the workplace generally, in particular in the
provision of flexible and family-friendly working arrangements,"
she said.

<P>
GENEVA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Chinese delegation
Long Yongtu today called on all the World Trade Organization (WTO)
members to be practical so as to bring the negotiations on China's
accession forward.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the fifth meeting of the Working Party on
China's Accession to WTO, Long, Chief negotiator and Vice Minister
of Foreign Trade, said that the Chinese delegation held "intensive
and productive" bilateral consultations with more than 16 WTO
members in the past week and won favorable response from some of
them.
</P>
<P>
He urged all others to "adopt the same positive, practical and
responsible attitude", saying the negotiations had translated the
Chinese government's firm commitment to joining WTO into concrete
actions.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that WTO adopt a long-term view and make realistic
requests on China in line with its current level of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that negotiations during the next few months will be
critical, Long pledged that China would make greater progress at
the next Working Party meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a summing-up of the meeting, Chairman of the Working Party
on China, Pierre-Louis Girard, said that the current meeting had

<HEADLINE> US Unemployment Declines to 4.8 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate
dropped to a near 24-year low of 4.8 percent in July after moving
up in June, but wage growth stalled, the Labor Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate marks a decline from
5 percent in June and matches the May rate, the lowest rate since
November 1973.
</P>
<P>
However, the strong job market has not produced bigger
paychecks. Seasonally adjusted average hourly earnings of nonfarm
production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged at 12.23
dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the unemployment rate has fallen from 5.4
percent a year earlier, hourly wage growth has actually slowed.
It's averaged 2.9 cents a month so far this year, compared with
3.8 cents in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separate report today from the Commerce Department
said that Americans' income grew 0.6 percent in June, the largest
in three months, while their spending increased by 0.3 percent for
the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
In July, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner
Katharine G. Abraham, employment growth was concentrated in
services, retail trade and local government.
</P>
<P>
Health services rose by 31,000 jobs and growth was quite strong
in engineering and management services and computer services, she
said. Retailers added 65,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local education accounted for almost the entire increase of
56,000 government jobs. Manufacturing jobs fell by 5,000 and
construction rose 3,000.

MOSCOW, August 1 (Xinhua) - Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
named Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy to the Russian State Duma, as
new deputy prime minister in charge of ethnic relations,
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced today by the president on
holiday at the Volga river resort of Volzhsky Utyos in central
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ramazan Abdulatipov, a former deputy speaker of the upper house
of parliament, was elected to a deputy to the State Duma, the
lower house, in 1996. He will be the seventh deputy premier in the
government.
</P>
<P>
Abdulatipov comes from the multi-ethnic North Caucasus republic
of Dagestan, which borders the Caspian Sea and the republic
of Chechnya, and is a member of the tiny Avar ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
His appointment comes amid renewed tension between two other
North Caucasus Russian republics -- Ingushetia and North Ossetia.
</P>
<P>
In a 1992 war, many ethnic Ingush people living in North
Ossetia were driven out of the republic. In recent weeks, conflict
in the area has escalated as these Ingush refugees trying to
return came under a new wave of violent attack.

BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will allow fresh imports

(DPRK) and another one to participate in its light water reactors
(LWR) construction program.
</P>
<P>
With the approval, the Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea's

<HEADLINE> 5,000-Year History of Chinese Handwriting: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese handwriting by using hard
utensils has a history of more than 5,000 years, according to a
Chinese expert Li Zhengyu.
</P>
<P>
Li, an expert on Dunhuang Research in northwest China's Gansu
Province, said that ancient Chinese used wood, bamboo, bone, gold
and stone as pens with which to write and draw, much earlier than
the use of calligraphic writing brushes.
</P>
<P>
The handwriting was very popular before the Qin Dynasty
(221-206 B.C.), and people not only used hard materials for
drawing pictures, but also use them as writing utensils, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The carving patterns on 7,000-year old pottery items unearthed
in the Dadiwan Cultural Ruins are regarded as the original form of
Chinese characters, and the 4,000-year old carving utensils in the
Yin Dynasty were regarded the earliest pens, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of handwriting forms appeared in the Zhou Dynasty, and
many kinds of hard writing utensils had been created from the West
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D.24) to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).

<HEADLINE> Birth Rate Picks Up in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The fertility decline which has
afflicted the European Union (EU) countries for years has come to
an end as women there averaged 1.44 babies in 1996, according to a
statement of Eurostat, EU's statistics arm, today.
</P>
<P>
Ireland registered the highest rate of 1.91 babies per woman
whereas Spain's 1.15 was the lowest. A total of just over four
million babies were born in EU countries last year.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 registed a post-war record low of 1.43 babies per
woman after years' of successive decline,
</P>
<P>
The EU population rose by an estimated 1,037,600 to 373,691,200
last year and the growth rate was nearly 0.3 percent, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the fertility decline to postponed motherhood, the
statement said last year's birth rate recovery was due to
immigration.
</P>
<P>
It said immigrants contributed a post-war high of nearly 80
percent of the EU population growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Births by immigrants last year, though falling from those of
1995, still accounted for three-quarters of the EU population
increase, it added.
</P>
<P>
World population grew by some 81 million last year, and the EU
contributed 1.3 percent to the growth, the statement pointed out.

LHASA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Development of a mine containing
7.14 million tons of copper in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous

NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said today that India does not have any hegemonic
designs on its neighbors and "Gujral Doctrine" is basically
extending a firm hand of friendship to all neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating an Afro-Asian students' meeting at Symbiosis
International Cultural and Educational Center in Pune city, about
1,500 km southwest of New Delhi, the prime minister said, "My
concept of neighborhood does not confine itself to South Asia. It
includes the countries in the Indian Ocean rim, Southeast Asia,
Central Asia, Russia and China."
</P>
<P>
"After a great period of turmoil and agony we have turned
corners in so far as South Asia is concerned. The summit meeting
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in
Male, capital of the Maldives, (in May this year) was a turning
point as there was a realization and appreciation that we must
build a region and cannot go up singly," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Male SAARC summit meeting, Indian and Pakistani Prime
Ministers Gujral and Nawaz Sharif in their bilateral talks agreed
to solve their disputes through peaceful talks and decided to set
up several working groups to discuss their differences. Inspired
by their sincerity in improving their bilateral relations,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka expressed
their desire to further enhance cooperation among the member
nations.
</P>
<P>
As India gets into the next half century it must give
friendship and cooperation in larger degree, Gujral said.

JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas will leave here Saturday morning for Phnom Penh to meet
with Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, an official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official disclosed that Alatas' main mission
is to exchange views with Hun Sen on political crisis in that
country, but he did not elaborate on the topics they will discuss.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn and Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon will
also go to Phnom Penh tomorrow to meet with Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
As representatives of ASEAN, the three foreign ministers had
met with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen separately last month in a bid to
help end the conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) now groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. Cambodia was delayed to enter the
grouping because of political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said earlier that ASEAN will never interfere in
Cambodia's internal affairs. He said if one of the two warring
factions opposed the ASEAN efforts, ASEAN will stop its mediation.
</P>
<P>
Alatas also said an agreement between the two warring factions,
namely, Cambodian People's Party led by Hun Sen and the PUNCINPEC
led by Norodom Ranariddh, plays a significant role in ending the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Last Emperor of Vietnam Dies in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bao Dai, the last emperor of
Vietnam who played puppet for France from 1949 to 1955, died here
today at the age of 83, Agence France-Presse reported.
</P>
<P>
Bao Dai was Vietnam's indigenous ruler from 1925 to 1945 under
the French colonial authority. He claimed independence of his country
in 1945, when Japanese troops invaded Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In 1945, he renounced his throne after Ho Chi Minh established
a republic in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He was brought back to Vietnam from Hong Kong in 1949 by French
troops, who waged a ruthless war to regain France's colonial grasp
of the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
He was deposed in 1955 after the French were beat in 1954 by Ho
Chi Minh's army.
</P>
<P>
The period of puppet rule on Vietnam by Bao Dai under the
French was vividly depicted by Graham Greene in his novel "The
Quiet American."

<HEADLINE> US, Russian Astronauts Attend Chinese Children's Summer Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- For the five American and Russian
astronauts who spoke at today's opening of "Science Fiction Camp"
here, fielding the whirlwind of questions from 2,000 five- and
six-year-olds was as challenging as working in a space station.
</P>
<P>
"This is no easy job," joked one of the astronauts as the kids
eagerly lined up for autographs on notebooks, envelopes, books and
caps and whatever else was handy.
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever met a spaceman?" one child asked US astronaut
Shannon Lucid, who has successfully completed a 223-day space
orbit.
</P>
<P>
Lucid, who was born in Shanghai, said no, but added she
believes there must be life on other planets.
</P>
<P>
"How did you feel the first time you flew in space?" asked
another child.
</P>
<P>
"It's like swimming in a swimming pool," Lucid said.
</P>
<P>
And then the inevitable question, "Can you see the Great Wall
from space?"
</P>

Lucid's answer, a firm no, brought a clamor of approval from

<HEADLINE> EU to Offer Germany Flood Relief Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will provide
the German state of Brandenburg with a flood relief fund of 1.5
million ECU's (1.62 million U.S. dollars), European Report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Report quoted Monika Wulf-Mathies, European commissioner in
charge of regional policy, as saying that the money will be used
to help the battered region cope with the worst flooding for more
than 200 years.
</P>
<P>
The fund, however, would be formally approved in September by
the European Parliament when it reconvenes after the summer break,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany is reportedly keen to funnel the emergency fund to
farmers in the flood-threatened Oderbruch region, where some 5,000
hectares of farmland is currently under flood water.
</P>
<P>
German troops and emergency services are working hard to
prevent the low-lying Oderbruch basin, with 76,000 hectares of
farmland at risk, from joining the disaster area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the European Union has granted an emergency money of 2
million ECU's (2.16 million dollars) to Poland and the Czech
Republic which have also been seriously affected by the flooding
Oder river.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Namibia today
agreed to strengthen their cooperation in the fields of economy,
trade and investment, a senior Indonesian official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during the talks between Indonesian
President Soeharto and visiting Namibian President Sam Nujome at

"SADEC provides many facilities, including easy access to the
European Union, Latin American and Namibian markets," the minister
told the press.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, who arrived here Thursday on a five-day state visit,
told Soeharto that Namibia is inviting Indonesian businessmen to
set up joint ventures in his country, Moerdiono said.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Area to be Set up in East and Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is expected to set up a free trade area
in the year 2000 in a bid to quicken the pace of regional
economic integration, a senior COMESA official said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here this morning after a one-day
seminar attended by business community in Kenya, acting COMESA
Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said the idea conformed to the
strategy of "promoting regional economic integration through
trade development".
</P>
<P>
He noted that the launching of the free trade area would offer
"exciting challenges and opportunities" to entrepreneurs in the
region for trade and cross-border investment.
</P>
<P>
The planned COMESA single market would have a combined Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of 120 billion U.S. Dollars and a total
population of 320 million.
</P>
<P>
According to him, five member states, namely Comoros, Eritrea,
Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe, have reduced their tariff rates by 80
percent while the tariff rates in Kenya, Malawi and Mauritius
have declined by 70 percent and would drop by 80 percent in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, Rwanda and Zambia have reduced their tariff rates by
60 percent and all the three countries are in the process of
cutting their tariffs pursuant to the COMESA timetable.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland have not reduced tariffs
because they are still enjoying derogation and are expected to
implement the COMESA tariffs after the expiry of the derogation.
</P>
<P>
Following the tariff reduction coupled with other measures,
the intra-COMESA trade has grown at an average annual rate of 14
percent, compared with 7 percent growth among COMESA and
non-COMESA countries.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that the intra-COMESA trade
increased from 838 million Dollars in 1984 to 1.7 billion Dollars
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Studies undertaken by the COMESA Secretariat revealed that
there was 3 billion Dollars of intra-COMESA trade which can be
immediately materialized.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote intra-COMESA trade, Mwencha pointed out,
COMESA will introduce a Customs Union and harmonize documentation
and institutional requirements in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
COMESA has implemented programs on fiscal and monetary
harmonization with the last phase introducing a single currency
in the year 2025, he added.
</P>
<P>
The programs being implemented by the COMESA Secretariat in
productive sectors of agriculture and industry are supportive of
the strategy of COMESA market integration, the COMESA official
stated.

SHANGHAI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
nation's westernmost region, recently consummated a science
and technology (S&AMP;T) cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the Shanghai Academy of Sciences (SAS) to
supply the Xinjiang Dushanzi Petrochemical Plant with automatic
ignition and gas recovery equipment, as well as coal additives.
</P>
<P>
Technology transfers and new equipment will enable the plant to
sharply reduce emissions of suspended particles, and are expected
to increase annual profits by more than 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
SAS, one of the nation's most prestigious academies, will also
supply the plant with stereo storage systems, steam recovery
equipment and technological consulting. In addition, the agreement
calls for the academy to sponsor S&AMP;T research programs for the
plant.
</P>
<P>
Delegations of SAS experts will visit Xinjiang twice each year
to explore new opportunities for cooperation and introduce new
high technology from Shanghai to local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to Dushanzi plant director Chen Zongyu, "Cooperation
with highly developed coastal and inland areas will enable
Xinjiang to overcome a lack of professional technicians,
contribute greatly to economic growth in ethnic minority areas,
and help to strengthen national unity."
</P>
<P>
The plant, which employees 14,000 people, has an annual
ethylene production capacity of 140,000 tons, and an annual
refined oil processing capacity of six million tons. Dushanzi
recorded total sales of 4.9 billion yuan in sales last year,
a major contributor to local revenues.
</P>
<P>
The central government has called for more of the nation's
developed eastern areas to seek common prosperity by assisting
underdeveloped regions in the west.

<HEADLINE> Hopes Fade on Australia's Ski Lodge Survival: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Relatives of the 16 people
believed trapped in Thredbo's landslide disaster were today told
by police to expect the worst as rescue efforts at the ski resort
ground to a near-halt.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 400 emergency workers stood by helplessly as a
massive boulder teetered dangerously above the rubble of the two
smashed ski lodges, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers tonight uncovered two more bodies from the ruins
of the ski lodge disaster, police said.
</P>
<P>
The discovery brings to four the total of confirmed deaths with
16 people believed inside the two collapsed lodges still
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
Late today the boulder was secured and workers tonight were
cutting up a huge concrete slab with diamond-tipped chainsaws to
expose the next layer of rubble.
</P>
<P>
Regional Police Commander Charlie Sanderson said the chance of
finding survivors now was small with mud and debris up to 10
meters deep. Temperature in the ski resort, which is about 150 km
southeast of the nation's capital Canberra, plunged well below the
freezing point for the third successive night.
</P>
<P>
The first body was removed from the wreckage by firemen late
last night, almost 24 hours after the landslide that swept one ski
lodge on top of another, and a second body was detected this
morning.
</P>
<P>
But tonight the second body remained well out of reach, about
10-15 meters below the first slab.
</P>
<P>
Among those the local residents fear are missing, believed
trapped in the rubble, are Mim Sodergren and Mike Sodergren, ski
instructors from the United States, and New Zealand-born ski
instructor Mary Phillips. The other unidentified missing people
are believed to be Australians working for the ski resort.
</P>
<P>
Police say it could take several days for everyone to be
removed.
</P>
<P>
The disaster, which occurred at midnight Wednesday, shocked the
whole nation as one of the worst fatal natural calamities in
Australia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Chibuluma Copper Mines Sold to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chibuluma mines in Zambia's
copperbelt have been sold to Metorex Consortium which is
comprised of two South African mining firms and one Canadian
company as part of the ongoing privatization of the country's
copper mines.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Luke Mwananshiku, chairman of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), as announcing here on
Wednesday that "the privatization of Chibuluma mine assets
guarantees the development of Chibuluma south."
</P>
<P>
"It is also in line with one of government's objectives of
diversifying the ownership of the mining industry on the
copperbelt and ensures that Kalulushi town will not be a ghost
town after cessation of mining at Chibuluma mines," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chibuluma mine assets include Chibuluma south and west ore
bodies, the mining and ancillary equipment necessary for the
operation of the west mine, and the social assets.
</P>
<P>
The social assets constitute the operation of Kalulushi
hospital, the trust school, the general upkeep of the town and
mine facilities including roads, water, sewerage and parks.
</P>
<P>
The buyers have undertaken to develop Chibuluma south for over
three to four years to cover production shortfalls arising from
the gradual cessation of operations at the mines within five
years.
</P>
<P>
So far the Luanshya, Baluba and Kansanshi copper mines and a
power division have been sold under the ZCCM privatization
program to revive the country's ailing copper-mining industry.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Heroin Trials to Face Int'l Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Australia will have to convince
the world community of the benefits of its controversial heroin
trials to ensure it does not break the country's international
drug enforcement commitments, experts said today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Australia's northeast coastal city of Cairns
Thursday evening, health ministers from states and territories of
the country approved the first stage of a heroine trial in
Canberra. The planned trial will see 40 drug addicts given
controlled doses of heroin under medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
The state of Victoria announced today trials on supplying
heroin addicts with alternative drugs could start within three
months in the state. The trials, which are expected to take three
years before producing reliable results, will involve a total of
400 drug addicts at a cost of about 1.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Australia will need to convince the International Drug
Commission to make sure the trial does not upset international
agreements designed to crack down on the drugs trade.
</P>
<P>
Professor David Pennington, an advocate for heroin trial, said
Australia would need to convince the international community that
the trials would be in the interest of scientific and medical
research.
</P>
<P>
Doctors today welcomed the trial's approval, saying current
methods to control drugs have not worked.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing numbers are dying as the result of heroin overdose.
Current laws have simply not worked," said Dr. Peter Joseph,
president of the Royal Australian College of General
Practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said heroin and heroin
substitution trials might be the solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the planned trials did not win universal support.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales state opposition and church groups said it
sent the wrong message to the community on drugs. The trial
decision was opposed Thursday by the states of Queensland and
Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

KAMPALA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda President Yoweri Museveni
decided Thursday to offer a pardon to the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) rebels who surrender to the government, "The New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to a rally Thursday in Kasese town in western
Uganda, the president warned that captured rebels will face
charge.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Museveni said that government troops would launch

Democratic Congo and Uganda now are harmonious and cooperative
and it will be impossible for the ADF rebels to between the two
countries.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corp's (HKBank's) monthly economic report
said that it expects Hong Kong to achieve real gross domestic
product (GDP) growth of 5.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it forecast that inflation will rise by 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new forecasts were updated from the bank's preliminary
forecasts of 5.2 percent GDP growth and 6.8 percent inflation made
 in December.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in 1996 Hong Kong's GDP grew 4.7 percent, while
the Consumer Price Index rose 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said Hong Kong's economy performed strongly in the
first six months of this year, driven mainly by robust domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by rising property and stock prices, private consumption
 expanded rapidly, while investment spending also benefited from
increased private construction activity.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, growth in Hong Kong's external trade remains
sluggish due to weak overseas demand, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said the strong momentum in domestic demand is expected to
continue in the second half of this year, while external trade
should improve somewhat due to stronger overseas demand.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Calls for Arab-Muslim Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Syrian President
Hafiz al-Assad today called for solidarity between Arab and
Muslim countries in the struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that Assad made the
statement during his meeting with Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was also
present at the meeting, according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Khamenei said that the Arab-Israeli peace
talks have ended in stalemate as Iran had expected.
</P>
<P>
"Right from the beginning, we believed that this peace would
not materialize ... because the nature of Zionist regime is
against peace and this regime tries to expand the areas under its
domination," Khamenei said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader said, "We consider expansion of ties with
Syria as an important part of our foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
"Arab countries must support Syria because it is the only
country that is bravely confronting Israel and withstanding
against pressure," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting today with Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami, Assad praised Iranian support for Syria and said that he
was confident that the ties between the two countries would be
boosted.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Iran and Syria have been two close allies
since the beginning of the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly the main common enemy of Iran and Syria is Israel
which is backed by the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said "Zionist regime has consistently ignored the
inalienable rights of the Arabs and its claim to seek peace is
false."
</P>
<P>
Hafiz al-Assad arrived in Tehran for a unexpected state visit
Thursday. This is his second visit to Iran since the Iranian
Islamic revolution in 1979. He last came to Tehran in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As reports say that Tehran, Damascus and Baghdad are trying to
form a block in confrontation with the Israeli-Turkish military
alliance, Al-Assad's visit has drawn wide international attention.

<HEADLINE> More Jobs Lost in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A further 42,000 jobs were
lost in South Africa's non-agricultural sector during the
first quarter of this year, figures released Thursday by the
government said.
</P>
<P>
The government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution
Strategy (GEAR) had projected the creation of 126,000 jobs last
year and 252,000 this year, none of which have materialised.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure comes when an increasing number of
economists are predicting that the economy will slip into
recession this year and register two consecutive quarters of
negative growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
South Africa's GDP dropped 0.8 percent during the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Local daily The Star today quoted government officials as
saying that the time had come for its GEAR strategy to be
supplemented with a comprehensive development plan to boost jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 figures released by the government,
South Africa's unemployment rate is about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the unemployment rate continue to accelerate, said the
officials, nearly 170,000 workers could be laid off this year
compared with 71,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that jobs were lost in most economic sectors,
including government organizations which, until the end of
1996, had been creating employment.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit was the manufacturing sector, which recorded
a 14,000 job-loss during the first quarter.

NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- India's trade deficit during
the first quarter of 1997-98 fiscal year (April 1997 - March 1998)

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Papers on SAR First Month Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Editorials carried in today's
local newspapers gave high marks to the performance of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in its first month
operation.
</P>
<P>
These editorials generally held that since its establishment on
 July 1, the SAR has had a good opening characterized by social
stability, high efficiency, bullish economic sentiment and freedom
 of expression.
</P>
<P>
"This is beneficial to implementing the 'one country, two
systems' policy, to improving the economic competitiveness, to
realizing the Chief Executive's administrative policies and to
maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity," Wen Wei Po said
 in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
It said that one of the characteristics of the present
conditions is that the executive and legislative bodies of the SAR
 have been coordinating very successfully, and the Chief Executive
 and the principal officials have been cooperating very well.
</P>
<P>
Another characteristic is the climbing trend of the economy, it
 added. The formerly forecast economic growth of 5.2 percent has
been readjusted to 5.4 percent. The inflation rate has been
lowered from 6.8 percent to 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The third characteristic is that economic relations between
Hong Kong and the mainland have become even closer, and the
handover has been deemed by overseas investors as a factor that
will lead to success in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that the central government has empowered
the SAR Government to manage its affairs wholly on its own. This
enables Hong Kong to maintain its factors for success. The
performance of ongoing infrastructure projects, properties, land
supply and other sectors is also satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in its editorial that the Hong
Kong Stock Market has had especially bullish performance during
the first month of the SAR, fully demonstrating investors'
confidence in Tung Chee Hwa and the SAR Government.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao said in its commentary that the first month
operation of the SAR has proven that Hong Kong people are able to
run Hong Kong and can run it better.
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers carried the results of a recent survey
conducted by the University of Hong Kong, which show that Hong
Kong people are more confident in their future and they give high
marks to the ability of the Chief Executive and the SAR
Government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Yet to Identify Suicide Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel is still unable to tell
the identification of the two suicide bombers of Wednesday's
bombing attack in Jerusalem after DNA tests showed there was no
relationship between the bombers and the families of two missing
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The twin bombings at a market in Jewish west Jerusalem killed
killed 13 Israelis and wounded 168 others.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the state-run Israel Radio today,
investogators into the incident have begun to look for other
directions after DNA test showed that there was no relationship
between the bombers and the families of the two missing Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) activists from Dahariya, a village
south of the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir conducted the
test on the families of two missing Hamas activists and the bodies
of the two bombers, and conveyed the results to the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops detained the families shortly after the suicide
bombing attack on Wednesday. The two young men, who were known as
Hamas activists, disappeared more than a year ago. The families
were taken to the morgue to see the bodies of the bombers, but
said they could not identify them.
</P>
<P>
The security forces, who were misled by their overconfidence
in believing that the two bombers were the two missing Dahariya
men, now have to consider other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Although they do not rule out the possibility that the two
attackers came from abroad, they still believe the bombers were
Hamas activists from the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Governor: Macao Security Neither Too Good Nor Too Bad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor General Vasco Rocha
Vieira said that the security situation in Macao is "not too good,
 but not too bad," Macao Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the governor made the remarks several
hours after a bomb exploded around 7:40 p.m. (local time) on
Thursday outside the headquarters of Macao security forces,
damaging two cars slightly but causing no injuries.
</P>
<P>
The attack by a bottle filled with gunpowder was described by a
 police spokesman last night as an "act of provocation by the
triads."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday morning, a similar incendiary gadget,
which was described as a "firecracker," was thrown into the garden
 of the Government Palace but caused no damage. The palace
includes the governor's office and the Macao Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of triad-related crimes began early Wednesday
morning when three or four masked gunmen shot into the lounge of a
 newly-opened hotel with automatic rifles, injuring three people
including one security guard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Portuguese News Agency Lusa reported that
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said during a visit to South
Africa on Wednesday that Macao's organized crimes must be dealt
with as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> India's Bihar State Observes Strike Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A dawn-to-dusk strike in
India's eastern Bihar state today disrupted normal life in the
whole state.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the strike was called by
recently floated Rashtriya Janata Dal with former Bihar chief
minister Laloo Prasad Yadav as its president. The new party is a
faction split from the Janata Dal, the main constituent of the
ruing United Front in the center.
</P>
<P>
The strike was in protest against the alleged "false
implication" of its president, Laloo Prasad, in the multi-crore
fodder scam case.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) decided to prosecute
56 persons including Laloo Prasad on April 27 this year in
connection with the fodder scam.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the Supreme Court rejected Laloo's appeal for
anticipatory bail on July 29, the CBI headquarters directed to
execute the arrest warrant issued by the designated court on July
25 when Laloo Prasad resigned from chief ministership.
</P>
<P>
In the following day, Laloo surrendered before the CBI
designated court. He told his supporters that he would be proved
to be innocent in the fodder scam case.
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Laloo Prasad supporters today blocked roads and
railway tracks in the state. Party activists, armed with laths and
swords, took to the streets shouting slogans against the CBI for
falsely implicating the former chief minister, Laloo Prasad, in
the fodder scam.
</P>
<P>
All modes of transport were badly hit throughout the state as
strike supporters squatted on roads and railway lines disrupting
movement of traffic at several places. Shops and business
establishments downed shutters in most major townships.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Leading Market for Luxury Watches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is maintaining its position as the
world's leading market for luxury watches from Switzerland,
according to today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said despite a drop last year, sales still exceeded
eight billion HK dollars (1.03 billion US dollars) and accounted
for 17.5 percent of all Swiss watch exports.
</P>
<P>
The local market for prestige brands kept a substantial edge
over second-placed United States, and was nearly double the sales
recorded in third-placed Japan.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC) said
 watches are by far Switzerland's biggest export, representing
nearly half of all sales to the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Watches and clocks are also Hong Kong's biggest export to
Switzerland, although the market was only worth 667 million HK
dollars (85.51 million US dollars) last year, which was less than
10 percent of Swiss exports to the SAR.
</P>
<P>
In terms of volume, Hong Kong is the world's biggest exporter
of watches, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the interests of the watch industry, Switzerland
is also the sixth largest source of foreign industrial investment
in the SAR with 20 factories employing nearly 4,000 workers,
according to TDC sources.

HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Assetu Koite, Secretary-General
of Pan African Women's Organisation (PAWO), pledged on Thursday
to support existing mechanism aimed at resolving conflicts on
troubled spots in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The PAWO, formed in 1962 to fight against colonialism, has now
shifted its focus on regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the close of the Eighth PAWO
Conference here, Koite said women delegations would be sent to
talk to warring factions in an attempt to amicably resolve
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The PAWO would also collaborate with the recently-formed First
Ladies' Club of the Organisation of African Unity as they had the
same mission, she said.
</P>
<P>
Koite said the PAWO would try to help countries such as Libya
who were facing sanctions. It was often the women and children
who suffered as a result of these, she added.
</P>
<P>
''African women have an important role to play in this because
without peace there is no development and therefore no women's
intergration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
The organisation would also work towards eliminating
illiteracy, poverty and other problems facing women, she said.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's PAWO conference was, ''Conflicts in
Africa, from Rhetoric to Action''.
</P>
<P>
The conference started on July 28 had focused its discussions
</P>
<P>
on issues concerning poverty, education, violence, economic
empowerment and status of women.

<HEADLINE> Australian Share Market Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
closed weaker today in uneventful trade, with some profit taking
and softer blue chips weighing upon the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones' Hamish Dee said the market closed on
a lower note this week with some profit-taking after the surprise
rate cut announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
Shaw Stockbroking's Michael Heffernan said it was a fairly
average finish to a busy week, inflated by a big move in Foster's
Brewing Group stock.
</P>
<P>
"It's about average but there was some portfolio buying... it
might be a little softer than normal," Heffernan said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished 7.6 points down at 2,727.5,
after trading in a 13 point range today.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 387.36 million shares traded with a value
of 906.39 million Australian dollars (670.72 million US dollars).
Rises of 527 outnumbered falls of 506.
</P>
<P>
Among the majors, Foster's Brewing Group was one of the most
heaviest traded stocks with turnover of 22.865 million shares
valued at 43.882 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the close, shares in Foster's were down 1.8 Australian cents
at 2.61 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I think the volume is a combination of a little Foster's
buyback activity," a broker said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Foster's shareholders voted to proceed with a 462.5
million US dollar share buyback deal with Japanese brewer Asahi.
</P>
<P>
The buyback of 254.5 million shares will be made at a price of
2.46 Australian dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index was down 9.2 points to 1,434.7, while
the all industrials index closed 6.4 points weaker at 4,386.1.
</P>
<P>
Market heavyweights BHP, WMC and Rio Tinto had all suffered a
drop in price.
</P>
<P>
BHP was down 23 cents at 18.01 Australian dollars on turnover
of 3.42 million shares, WMC fell 14.6 cents to 7.64 Australian
dollars and Rio Tinto lost 8.4 cents to 20.793 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the bank sector, National Australia Bank fell three cents to
19.51 Australian dollars, Westpac Banking Corp dropped 12.3 to
8.62 Australian dollars, ANZ was down three at 10.70 Australian
dollars and Commonwealth Bank of Australia remained steady at
16.65 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank shot up 21 cents to 8.95 Australian dollars in
the wake of the rate cut, a move Heffernan attributed to a general
review of the bank yields being conducted by brokers.
</P>
<P>
The gold index was up 12 points to 1,337.9.
</P>
<P>
Spot gold bullion was trading in Sydney at 324.55 US dollars an
ounce this evening, down from 326.50 US dollars at Thursday's
close.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investment For Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a traditional
industrial base in northeast China, is a new spot for foreign
investment, says Governor Wen Shizhen, speaking about economic
co-operation with Canada.
</P>
<P>
Although Canadian investment in Liaoning is still small, it has
been increasing in recent years and was up to 200 million US
dollars in 1996. Some 38 Canadian-funded ventures were set up in
1996, and trade with Canada was worth 84 million US dollars last
year, twice the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
Wen attributed the growth in investment to the province's
location in the center of the Northeast Asian Economic Zone and
importance as a passageway for inland areas. It also has a tenth
of China's large and medium-sized metallurgy, petrochemical,
electro-mechanical, and petroleum industries.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has built a road, railway, airline, and marine
transport web, leading other provinces in the number of railways,
and has 40 international and domestic air routes.
</P>
<P>
The central government has developed a series of preferential
policies for industrial enterprise reforms, providing more
opportunities for co-operation with the outside world.

<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- World champion Nicolas Fontaine
of Canada and Nikki Stone of the United States won their
respective events in the first round of the World Cup freestyle
skiing competition in Mt Buller, Australia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Events at the first ever Australian round of a World Cup
freestyle event were overshadowed by Wednesday's disaster at
Thredbo where up to 20 people went missing in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine dominated the men's section, scoring 238.89 followed
by American Matt Chojnacki with 235.18 and Canada's Andy Capicik
with 233.40.
</P>
<P>
Stone, the 1995 World Cup winner, was successful with a
full-double-full routine for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Canadians Veronica Brenner (174.48) and Caroline Olivier
(170.35) took the silver and bronze respectively.
</P>
<P>
Australia's world champion Kirstie Marshall finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever in a World Cup, Australian eucalyptus
gum leaves were thrown onto the landing area rather than the
northern hemisphere pine needles.
</P>
<P>
The leaves give the aerialists a contrast to the snow and an
indication of where the ground is as they twist and turn through
the air.

<HEADLINE> Southeast China City Uses Hong Kong for Its Export Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Zhangzhou city of Fujian province
in southeastern China has increased co-operation with Hong Kong by
using it as a gateway for economic and trade contacts with Taiwan
and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, there were 964 Hong Kong-backed
enterprises in Zhangzhou, half the overseas-funded enterprises in
the city, with 740 million U.S. dollars worth of capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou earned over 3.28 million dollars by providing labor
services for Hong Kong, which provided 22.5 percent of the 14.55
million dollars the city made from labor services.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businessmen have also introduced a number of
Taiwanese firms to Zhangzhou, using their own success there as an
example. Most of Zhangzhou's transit trade with Taiwan went
through Hong Kong and reached 110 million dollars by the end of
last year, accounting for 62 percent of the city's total trade
volume with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zhangzhou has four firms in Hong Kong and has
increased contacts with international markets in Southeast Asia,
America, Europe and Japan.

<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- About 350 cars were stolen in
Zimbabwe during the first five months of this year, the local
daily ''Herald'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
This means that about three cars are stolen every day, said
the report, adding that others are broken into and vandalised or
have valuables removed while some vehicles have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
While some of the thefts were unavoidable, police feel that
some could have been avoided, had the owners properly secured
their vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It was important for owners to ensure that their vehicles were
fitted with functional and secure locks in addition to alarms and
immobiliser systems, said the report quoting police officer
Comm Mpofu.
</P>
<P>
''Security is expensive but not foolproof. It is important to
have more than one system. This will make the job of the thief
more difficult,'' the police officer added.

<HEADLINE> American Irrigation Technology Helping Farming In NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Irrigation technology from the
United States has proven effective in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region for saving water, preventing diseases and
pests, and increasing crop output.
</P>
<P>
The region has been making an effort to become the country's
largest cotton producer and a major grain producer, but its dry
climate and lack of water are obstacles. So it spent more than 400
million yuan on water-saving agriculture, better canals, and the
new technology of drip irrigation, which is better than sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
Trial use in Turpan and Shihezi this spring showed that the new
method uses two-thirds less water than the traditional canal
irrigation, and reduced weeds, diseases, and pests at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers in the trial project areas have seen the difference of
the two irrigation methods, and have begun voluntarily to adapt
themselves to the new technology and modern agriculture," said
Dr. Menqi, associate research fellow at the Xinjiang Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The region now uses more than 3,000 cubic meters of water less
per-ha of farmland than in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Assad Calls for Further Actions to Liberate Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
called here today for further actions to liberate the occupied
Arab territories, to restore the usurped Arab rights, and to
establish just and comprehensive peace in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Assad made this statement in a written address to the Syrian
Armed Forces on the occasion of the Army Day on August 1, Syrian
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Assad asserted that Syria believed in just peace in the region,
but "this would not dissuade us from confronting any aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president also said, "we shall never cool down
or feel at ease so long as the Israeli occupation is in control of
certain sectors of the Arab territories. The liberation of the
occupied territory is a sacred duty which we will not hesitate to
perform and to achieve no matter what the sacrifices will be."
</P>
<P>
He added that "we have been calling for peace in our region, a
just and comprehensive peace that puts an end to aggression,
occupation and usurpation of rights. But Israel, under the rule of
the present government, has responded to our stance with further
extremism and fanaticism."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Golan Heights which was captured by Israel
in the 1967 Middle East war, Assad reiterated that the fate of the
Golan Heights is not to be determined by one individual or a
group, but by the legitimate owners of the land.

<HEADLINE> Britain Uses Gene Therapy on Hurler Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A British baby girl Thursday
became the world's first person to be given gene therapy for her
rare inherited Hurler disease, The Daily Telegraph reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The 15-month-old girl has Hurler disease which can cause an
essential protein missing and building waste products in
cells. The children with the disease often develop a range of
physical and mental problems and do not often survive beyond the
age of 10.
</P>
<P>
The transfusion of modified bone marrow back into her body took
about an hour at Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Last week,
the baby's bone marrow cells were removed and then modified at the
Paterson Institute, at the Christie Hospital, in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
The cells were put in contact with a virus containing a normal
gene. This was repeated over five days and the cells were returned
into the baby via a large vein. The normal gene should instruct
the baby's cells to make the missing protein and prevent the
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
In about six months, doctors will know if the transfer is
working and the girl is functioning normally.
</P>
<P>
"We emphasize that this is an experiment. We have shown it is
possible to do this in a laboratory using bone marrow cultures
from Hurler patients," said a spokesman for the Royal Manchester
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first attempt to do this in a patient. It is
likely we will get more questions than answers from this
attempt. We are taking the very first steps down a long road
toward finding an effective treatment for this disease and others
like it," he added.

<P>
-- Patrick Weil, chief of the Research Department of the
National Center of Scientific Research and member of the Council
of Integration, Thursday submitted to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
a report on immigration which will be subjected to parliamentary
debate in autumn. Among the 120 proposals presented in the report,

<HEADLINE> New Identity Cards to Be Issued in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will issue new
identity cards containing the name, photograph, and fingerprint
of a citizen to replace the present book-like identity documents,
local daily The Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
Provision for the credit-card size ID cards is made in a new
Identification Bill, introduced by Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
The future ID cards will be machine-readable, similar to
present automatic teller machine (ATM) cards.
</P>
<P>
The concept of the card is ''to ensure an efficient identity
verification service'' to any department of state, business house
or insurance company, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The cards would also provide sufficient security features to
ensure they cannot be forged or counterfeited, and that they
resist damage, Buthelezi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Existing identity documents will remain valid until people
have obtained new identity cards, or a date is promulgated for
the expiry of the old identity documents, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President in Tehran on Unexpected Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani and the visiting Syrian President Hafiz Al-Assad have
stressed the need for safeguarding Iraq's territorial integrity,
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Hafiz Al-Assad arrived in Tehran for a unexpected state visit
Thursday. This is his second visit to Iran since the Iranian
Islamic revolution in 1979. His last came to Tehran in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As reports say that Tehran, Damascus and Baghdad are trying to
form a block in confrontation with the Israeli-Turkish military
alliance, Al-Assad's visit has drawn wide international attention.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and Syrian presidents held the first round of talks
here Thursday focusing on the bilateral relations and the issue of
Iraq. However, IRNA gave no details on what Iran and Syria are
trying to do on the issue of Iraq and what kind of military
cooperation they are going to forge ahead to confront the military
cooperation between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the presidents of Iran and Syria had
exchanged their views for broadening regional cooperation between
the two strategic allies, for the ouster of foreign troops in the
Persian Gulf, for supporting the righteous cause and struggle of
the people of Palestine, and for closer collaboration between
Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told Syrian president that Iran and Syria are two
important Muslim nations of the region, and that closer relations
and cooperation between them would contribute to peace and
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is to uphold her original position in
relation with the issue of Palestine and stressed the need for
struggling against the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
"Iran greatly values her friendship with Syria," he was quoted
by the IRNA report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that the issue of Jerusalem was a
strategic one as far as Iran was concerned.
</P>
<P>
He added that in dealing with that issue Syria had acted more
responsibly than other Arab and Muslim governments.
</P>
<P>
"To establish or broaden relations with Muslim and Arab
governments that face the challenges of the international
arrogance and the Zionist regime more boldly than others is a
basic consideration in the principles of Iran's foreign policy,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Hafiz Al-Assad was quoted by the report as saying that
relations between the two countries were at their best in every
respect, and observed that his government was committed to
further broadening relations with Iran in the area of politics,
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafiz Al-Assad also appreciated Iran's
regional policy which, he said, was for peace and stability, and
good neighborly relations with all her neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Israel To Uproot Hamas Infrastructure In West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- In a move that may have
dangerous religious implications, the Israeli government has
decided to destroy the infrastructure of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) in the West Bank, according to a report of the
state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed security source was quoted by the radio as saying
that the Ministerial Committee on National Security, known as
inner security cabinet, had given the security forces the
go-ahead to operate against the civil infrastructure of Hamas in
Area B of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between Israel and the Palestinians signed
in 1995, during the interim period, the West Bank was divided into
Area A, Area B and Area C. Area B is under Palestinian civil
administration, but Israel still maintains overriding security
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The move was apparently part of the steps taken by the inner
security cabinet which met in an emergency session late Wednesday
night in the wake of the double suicide bombing attack in the
central open market of Jerusalem, which killed 13 Israelis and
wounded 168.
</P>
<P>
The security source said that actions could be taken, for
example, against Islamic charity funds and Mosques.
</P>
<P>
According to a cabinet communique issued at the end of the
inner security cabinet meeting, the army and security services
were ordered to carry out "a series of security measures against
the Palestinian terrorist organizations."
</P>
<P>
According to the radio report, some of the security measures
have aroused deep concerns of international human right
organizations.

<P>
LANZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A recently released biography
authored by Luo Qingzhi portrays the life of well-known scholar
Duan Wenjie and explains legends of the Dunhuang Caves.
</P>
<P>
The young author spent three years researching historical
materials and writing the 280,000-word book.
</P>
<P>
Duan, director of Dunhuang Research Institute in northwest
China's Gansu Province, has studied Dunhuang paintings and
conducted related intensive research since 1946.
</P>
<P>
The octogenarian scholar has copied numerous Dunhuang frescoes
throughout a long career filled with notable academic achievements.

equal the great academic achievements overseas experts have
recorded in the field of Dunhuang research.

<P>
The Dunhuang Caves, which date back as far back as 366,
house invaluable Buddhist statues, frescos and manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
The author retains his focus on Duan, while at the same time
describing the historical activities of other famous Dunhuang
scholars. Luo objectively depicts controversial figures, such as a
 Taoist priest named Wang who is traditionally regarded as a
traitor for selling cultural relics to foreign collectors.

<HEADLINE> Fruit Trees Benefit Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in mountainous parts of
China's Shanxi Province in north China have made life better with
a fruit tree program the provincial government started in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' efforts paid off, giving Shanxi a good part of the
domestic market, and access to more than 20 countries and regions
as well.
</P>
<P>
Some 660,000 ha of fruit trees in the province provide 1.8
billion kg of fruit annually, 50 kg per capita more than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
"We will double the acreage to 1.33 million ha by the end of
the century, to give every farmer a 15th of a ha of fruit
trees," said Wang Wenxue, deputy governor for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Five fruit-growing bases have taken shape and produce over 70
percent of the province's total fruit output.
</P>
<P>

<P>
URUMQI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Underdeveloped parts of China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are making the most of science
and technology for economic growth to narrow the east-west gap.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, it adopted this strategy, and by 1996, spending on
science and technology was 77.5 percent more than in 1992. The
region has completed 1,293 research projects in the past five
years, with science and technology contributing 35 percent to
local economic growth, according to the regional Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
It has also increased co-operation overseas and has sent
several hundred scholars abroad for further study and research.
</P>
<P>
Some large research projects, such as a mineral resources
exploitation project, a Tarim desert highway, and a cotton
research project have greatly helped local progress and have
helped train scientists.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology departments have begun to provide
technical assistance to improve enterprises and have set up more
than 1,000 information service centers in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has finished 56 of a planned 133 science and
technology projects, involving 25 million yuan in investment and
nearly a billion yuan of capital from other sectors. The projects
added 2.36 billion yuan in output value and 630 million yuan in
pre-tax profits.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Arrest 50 Palestinian Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
arrested 50 Palestinian extremist activists overnight in the
crackdown on terrorism in the wake of Wednesday's suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the operations were carried out by
Israeli troops in the areas in the territories under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
Despite Israeli government's decision to authorize its troops
to enter the PNA (Palestinian National Authority) self-rule areas
to arrest terrorists, Israeli soldiers so far have not entered
these areas.
</P>
<P>
The arrested were from the militant Islamic Jihad and Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), which carried out the twin bombings
Wednesday in central Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda free market,
killing 15 people and wounding over 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's pressure, Palestinian police have also arrested
a number of extremists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces were put on high alert amid
warnings about more terror attacks. Police reinforcements were
deployed in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, which is another popular
target for terrorists. Hundreds of policemen were stationed in Tel
Aviv's beach area and roadblocks have been erected at entrances to
the city.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Embassy to Israel in Tel Aviv has issued
warning to U.S. citizens to take precautions against possible
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
The closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, imposed by
Israeli troops after the Wednesday terror bombings, has been
eased to allow the entry into Israel of Palestinian lawyers,
medical personnels and people who needed humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
But about 20 members of the Palestinian Council who concluded a
meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah Thursday were refused
entry into Israel to travel back to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
To increase pressure on the PNA to fight terrorism, Israel has
transferred a list of suspected terrorists to the PNA, which was
asked to take tougher actions against not only the extremists, but
also the infrastructure that support them.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police chief, Ghazi Jabali, who is among the
wanted list for alleged involvement in terrorism, laughed off the
Israeli demand to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference in Gaza Thursday that Israel could
not arrest him because it ran counter to the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Jabali was charged by Israel for personally planning a terror
attack against a Jewish settlement near the West Bank city Nablus
last month. Israel said its soldiers arrested three Palestinian
policemen who were on their way to carry out the attack.

</P>
<P>

BERLIN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Three top political leaders from
the former East Germany were jailed by a Berlin court today for 11
years, nine years and seven and a half years respectively for
killing or injuring East Germans trying to escape across the
Berlin Wall to the west before the fall of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
The group includes Egon Krenz, chairman of the the German
Democratic Republic's State Council and general secretary of the
German Socialist Unity Party, and two of the party's Politburo
members, Guether Shabowski and Guether Kl Eiberkleiber.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of setting up attack points and planting
mines along the Berlin Wall, causing death and injury to East
German citizens who tried to flee to the west before the two
Germanies were reunited in 1990 after four decades of separation.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the court sentenced five military officers on
similar charges, giving them jail terms ranging from nine to 18
months.

JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas warned Thursday that Britain should not link future arms
deals with human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's basic position on the issue will remain
valid. ...We cannot accept it if economic deals are linked with
political matters," reports quoted the minister as saying at the
Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Monday in a written
answer to the House of Commons that weapons would not be sold
where there was "a clearly identifiable risk."
</P>
<P>
Alatas said he hoped that the new British government under
Prime Minister Tony Blair will continue to carry out its signed
agreement on supplying military equipment, including weapons, to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The contracts which had been signed before they won the
elections would not be disturbed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that he would visit Phnom Penh later this week or
earlier next month. He, along with foreign ministers of Thailand
and the Philippines, is expected to discuss political crisis there
with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Hun Sen would meet representatives of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Monday night,

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to buy several
submarines from Germany in the near future to beef up its warship
fleet, a senior navy officer said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on the deal is expected to be
signed next September, Arief Kusyariadi, chief of staff of
Indonesian navy, said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify how many submarines would be bought or
how much the deal was worth.
</P>
<P>
However, Yusuf Effendi, director-general of The Defense
Ministry for Planning and Budget, said recently Indonesia
considered buying at least six submarines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bruno Hasenpusch, defense attache of the German
Embassy here, said the type of submarine to be purchased by
Indonesia was U-206.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian navy now has two U-209 submarines, also bought
from Germany, the navy chief said.
</P>
<P>
The U-206 submarine can carry 26 crew members and is smaller
than the U-209.
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate for the Indonesian navy to operate the U-206
subs, Hasenpusch said, because the U-206 subs are suitable to
control shipping lanes in the Indonesian waters, which has
thousands of islands.
</P>
<P>
Both the U-206 and U-209 are able to remain under water for
three weeks, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- India will initiate a dialogue
with the European Union (EU) over the latter's recent decision to
ban marine imports from India, a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry officials have criticized the EU ban decision
as another non-tariff barrier and pointed out that informing the
sellers of the ban just before two weeks is improper and not a
good practice in trading.
</P>
<P>
India has already directed the Indian Mission in Brussels to
seek bilateral consultations in this regard as such move will
place the Indian industry into a major crisis. India would drag
the EU to the dispute settlement body of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) if it failed to respond to India's request, the
same official said.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, an expert team from the European Community had
visited the processing units in Kerala state and other seafood
exporting units in India to inspect the quality standards being
followed in the wake of the rejection of the Indian seafood
consignments at European ports recently. The team had expressed
dissatisfaction with the certification procedures being adopted by
the Indian inspection agencies. It was on the basis of its report
that the ban decision was taken, upsetting the export plans of
India's nearly 1,200 large and small exporting firms.
</P>
<P>
Almost 30 percent of India's seafood exports go to the European
countries. India's Commerce Ministry fears that the EU's ban
decision will also hurt India's seafood exports to Japan and the
U.S.

<HEADLINE> More Villages to Have Power Supply in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka hopes to supply
electricity to 1,000 villages covering 100,000 households by the
year 2000, Irrigation and Power Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The project under the rural electrification scheme will cost 60
million US dollars and the Asian Development Bank has already
provided a soft loan to Sri Lanka for this purpose, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, 80 percent of Sri Lanka's households
will have electricity by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Under a phased-out project 200 villages will be supplied with
electricity this year while 400 villages will get electricity in
1998 and another 400 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To meet an annual increase in the demand for power, a master
plan has been prepared by Sri Lanka's Electricity Board. This will
be implemented in 1999 at a cost of 25 billion Rupees (423 million
US dollars) and will be completed in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Panama Hails Prospect of End to U.S. Tuna Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama today welcomed the
United States Senate's vote to lift its embargo on tuna imports
which has cost Latin American exporters some 600 million dollars a
year. .
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Commerce and Industries Jose Troyano said
today the move was very significant as the embargo had seriously
affected Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
"We feel satisfied, because Panama is one of the Central
American countries that has been struggling for this measure to be
reversed," Troyano said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved ending the
tuna embargo which was imposed in 1991 because of allegations that
dolphins were being killed in tuna fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
Panama does not have a tuna industry, but faced losses from a
big drop in services to tuna fishing ships that arrived in the
country to make transshipments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal to lift the embargo will now be sent to the
U.S. House of Representatives, which has supported the lifting,
and then to U.S. President Bill Clinton for promulgation.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua-Mexico Free Trade Agreement Almost Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The free trade agreement between
Nicaragua and Mexico is almost ready with only differences of
imports of meat, sugar, dairy products and grain remaining,
Nicaragua's economics ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the agreement could be ready to sign in
September during Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman's visit to
Mexico, said Oscar Aleman, foreign trade director and negotiations
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
He said that on Tuesday Nicaragua and Mexico started a new
round of talks about the treaty focusing on access to markets,
agriculture, fresh food hygiene standards, services, copyright,
government acquisitions and unfair trade practices.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking points are in the drafting sections on
the agriculture and livestock sectors, where Mexico is concerned
about imports of meat, sugar, dairy products and grains.
</P>
<P>
"The free trade agreement should be seen as part of a process
of liberalization that cannot be reversed," said Aleman.

<HEADLINE>   International Conference on Albania's Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 23 countries and 15
international organizations met here today to discuss economic
reconstruction in Albania after the country's June election put a
new government in place.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Italy, Britain, the United States, France,
Germany, the European Union (EU) and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) studied the three-step political
and economic reconstruction scheme proposed by Albania's new
Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the country's reconstruction could not
be carried out smoothly unless the new government and other
political forces were committed to national reconciliation and
sought closer cooperation with the international community.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE's special envoy to Albania, Franz Vranitzky, said
after the meeting that as Albania's situation is still
complicated, the parties concerned are preparing a "package plan"
to ensure there is no repetition of the unrest which engulfed
Albania in earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of shady pyramid saving schemes in January
triggered nationwide anarchy and brought about the downfall of
President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to hold a donors' meeting next month in
Brussels, Belgium, to raise funds for the shattered Balkan
state. A ministerial meeting is also scheduled in September in
Rome to address Albania's medium-term reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Market Law Begins To Rule Shanghai's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Huasheng Chemical
Industry Company started out 15 years ago with just nine
employees, three water vats and six sticks for mixing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Now Huasheng is the country's largest paint-maker, with
per capita pre-tax profits of 730,000 yuan, ranking first among
all local firms in the city and even better than its international
competitors.
</P>
<P>
General Manager Li Longming attributes the success of his
company mainly to the market competition, which has forced the
firm to adopt a scientific approach to management.
</P>
<P>
Huasheng is only one of a large number of local enterprises
benefiting from the city's fledgling market economy, he says.
</P>
<P>
Competition, which is seen as the spice of the market economy,
has been playing an increasingly bigger role and created new
incentives for the economic development of China's largest
industrial city, some local experts say.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 43 local firms went bankrupt, bringing the total
number of bankrupt companies in Shanghai to 58. So far, 730 local
enterprises have been merged. And at least 50 large enterprise
groups have become big economic powers through capital expansion
and mergers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a unified and open labor market system, with 437 job
agencies, has taken shape to form a market-led employment system
in the city. In 1996, 157,000 laid-off factory workers found work
through the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the first city in China to forecast the market
demand for laborers.
</P>
<P>
As in other parts of China, the managers and directors of local
firms in Shanghai used to be appointed by higher-ups, but under
the market economy, head staffers must be hired for their merits.
</P>
<P>
The newly-founded Shanghai Factory Director and Manager Company
has a list of over 9,800 talent candidates for recommendation. The
year-old firm has found posts for 183 managerial-level job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
The market law has also accelerated the development of a social
security plan that protects all local employees and jobless people.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 6.15 million local employees and retirees, 95
percent of the city's total, are covered by the city's pension
system, while some 150,000 people have received cash from the
unemployment subsidiary fund, and another 120,000 people are
getting various forms of additional insurance.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Shanghai has set bottom lines for the lowest living
standard, lowest income level, and numbers of unemployed and laid
off people.

<P>
KUNMING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The first health care project
sponsored by the Canadian Government in China has been launched in
Yunnan Province, southwest China, benefiting mothers and children
of ethnic minority groups in 10 poverty-stricken counties, local
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next four years, the Canada International Development
Agency (CIDA) will pour a total of six million Canadian dollars
(about 4.3 million US dollars) into the program, which is designed
to build medical facilities and bring trained workers to the rural
areas of the counties.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 counties named in the project are the Naxi
Autonomous County of Lijiang, the Bai Autonomous Prefecture of
Dali, and the Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna, with a
total population of 2.38 million.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government will also provide an
additional 4.3 million dollars in funding, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
They say that each year in the counties, nine out of every
1,000 children under age five, and nearly two out of every 1,000
pregnant women die as a result of the shortage of medical
equipment and professional medical staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Medics and workers involved in
maternal and child health care started a week-long publicity
campaign today to promote breastfeeding among new mothers through
out China.
</P>
<P>
The annual World Breastfeeding Week, an event launched by the
World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (Waba), will be observed
in China and other 120-odd countries in the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Health (MOH) has issued a circular calling
for expanded publicity on breastfeeding this week so as to arouse
public concern and support to the drive, said a "China Daily"
report.
</P>
<P>
Medical workers at all levels are asked to go down to the
grassroots areas to give consultancy and carry out health services
for mothers and babies, it said.
</P>
<P>
Health departments in cooperation with market watchdogs will
take examinations over packaging, marketing of breast milk
substitutes as well as television advertisements for such products.
</P>
<P>
MOH has set a goal of 80 percent breastfeeding rate in China by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China has set up 4,730 baby-friendly
hospitals, in which infants are given to mothers for breastfeeding
immediately after birth, and doctors and nurses teach mothers
about breastfeeding and baby care.
</P>
<P>
Natural immunoglobulins and special antibodies contained in
mother's milk are generally considered to be good to development
of newly-borns.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Three-Year Loan for Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) --The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today announced the approval of a three-year loan for
Mongolia under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF),
in an amount of some 45 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided in support of the government's economic
program during 1997-2000.
</P>
<P>
The first annual loan, in an amount of 11.13 million dollars
equivalent is available in two equal semiannual installments, the
first of which can be drawn on August 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian government's medium-term strategy focuses on
rapidly completing the transition to a full market economy and
strengthening the foundation for strong and sustainable private
sector-led growth by reducing the size of the public sector and
fostering the development of private sector. The main objectives
of the program include to reduce inflation to single-digit rates,
achieve an annual real GDP growth rate of 6 percent and increase
official gross international reserves to the equivalent of over 15
weeks of import cover.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. ESAF loans carry an interest rate of only 0.5 percent a
year and are repayable over 10 years, with a 5.5-year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia joined the IMF in February 1991. Its quota is about 50
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
stands at about 42 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> IAAF to Reduce Doping Ban from 4 to 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletics Federation has decided to reduce the doping ban from
four years to two after two hours of discussion at the 41st IAAF
Congress which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The Congress voted to reduce the sanction for a first doping
offence for prohibited substances (like anabolic agents,
amphetamines, Peptide Hormones, cocaine etc) from four years to a
"mimimum of two years." The sanction for a second offence shall
be life.
</P>
<P>
Athletes who are currently suspended for four years may apply
to the IAAF Council for reinstatement after they have served two
years. They must supply evidence that they have undergone three
out-of-competition tests (at least four months apart) during the
final year of their suspension.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Congress also voted to change the current 3-month
sanction for using substances (stimulant, narcotic analgesics
etc) to a Public Warning. The sanction for a second offence
shall be two years. Performances obtained by an athlete in a
competition in which he, or she, tests positive will be declared
invalid.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of this decision, the Jamaican long jumper
James Beckford, 1996 Olympic silver medallist, will be allowed to
take part in the 6th World Athletics Championships here.
Beckford tested positive for a stimulant at the IAAF Grand Prix
meeting in Paris on June 25.

newspapers frontpaged the celebration activities to mark the 70th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)
Thursday and carried the full text of Jiang Zemin's speech
delivered at a grand rally held in Beijing's Great Hall of the
People on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
-- The grand rally was held yesterday by the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the State Council and the
Central Military Commission (CMC). Over 6,000 people including top
leaders and top military officers attended the rally.
</P>
<P>
-- Jiang Zemin, the general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the CMC, delivered an
important speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that all members of the PLA must hold high unswervingly
the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
He urged the armed forces to maintain a clear view of both
domestic and international situations, be vigilant in peace time,
strengthen their sense of responsibility and mission, and launch a
full-scale military development effort.
</P>
<P>
-- National Defense Minister Chi Haotian presided over a
reception marking the 70th anniversary of PLA's founding in the
Great Hall of the People yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Chi told the gathering that the PLA will always strictly follow
the command of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and that of the Central Military Commission (CMC).
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the CMC and state councillor,
said: "We will stand firm with the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core both in thought and action," and "We must
never lose our loyalty to the Party, to the motherland, to the
people and to socialism. We should serve the people heart and soul
and never change the nature of the people's army."
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The leading newspaper in the country carries an editorial
today to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of PLA.
</P>
<P>
The PLA is an armed group led by the Communist Party of China
to carry out revolutionary and political duties. It is also a
strong pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship and is an
important guarantee for national security, social stability and
the unification of the motherland, it says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 70 years, the PLA has adhered to the guidelines
and principles of the Communist Party of China and has played an
important role in founding New China, safeguarding the sacred
territories of the motherland, protecting the socialist
modernization, reform and opening drive, and promoting the
peaceful reunification of the motherland and the realization of
the smooth return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on the army to adhere to Deng Xiaoping's
theory on army building and meet President Jiang Zemin's demand
that the troops "be qualified politically and competent
militarily, have a fine work style, be strictly disciplined and be
assured of adequate logistical support."

<HEADLINE> Zelezny Wants to Cap World Title for Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic,
two times Olympic and world champion in the men's javelin,
determines to defend his world title at the 6th World Athletics
Championships starting here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
With a big aim in mind, the 31-year-old said he is ready, but
added that strong winds could produce either a world record throw
or a fatal failure.
</P>
<P>
"I came to Athens to win. I have finished my training well.
Of course, I love to win, but in athletics everything may
happen. I believe that a medal will go to the athlete who throws
the javelin further than 87 meters. A throw of around 90 meters
will probably win the gold medal," said Zelezny, who is holding
the world record of 98.48 meters.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big stadium that allows for strong winds and very
easily a good throw can break the world record or fail
completely," added the Czech who won the golds in the 1992 and
1996 Olympics plus world titles in 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zelezny flang the year's best mark of 94.02 meters last
March. The first three best throws this season were produced by
him. The only person who beat the 90-meter barrier this year is
Boris Henry of Germany, who managed a 90.44m performance early
this month.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Greek champion Kostas Gatsioudis, who ranks
third best on the season's list with a 89.22m effort, Zelezny
commented: "He is a young and strong athlete, but he is only one
of the opponents I have to face. Sergey Makarov of Russia and
Steve Backley of Britain are the most dangerous threats."

<HEADLINE> Dow Stumbles But Most Stock Indexes Set New Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
slipped from its record high Thursday, but most popular stock
measures set new highs again as interest rates hit another
17-month low in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell 32.28 to 8,222.61. It was weighed down by a report
confirming that the business activity slowed considerably in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported in the morning that the gross
domestic product expanded at a moderate 2.2 percent annual rate in
the second quarter as consumers grew more cautious after a
first-quarter spending spree that threatened to aggravate
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The government agency also revised its first-quarter GDP
reading downward to a still-vigorous 4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
More important than the weekly employment tally, however, will
be Friday's reading on July payroll and wage levels, two key
factors behind inflation.
</P>
<P>
As bonds rose Thursday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
dropped from late Wednesday's 6.32 percent, which was the lowest
finish since February 1996, to 6.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy again at
547.87 million shares, down slightly from Wednesday's busy pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 2.00 to 954.29, and
the NYSE composite index rose 0.93 to 494.50, the third
consecutive record highs for both measures.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index closed at a record high for the
second day in a row, rising 5.76 to 1,593.81, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.98 to 646.30, its fourth
straight record finish.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Frankfurt, Paris Hit New Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
ended mixed Thursday, with London closing lower for the first time
this week while Frankfurt and Paris hitting new record closing
highs.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market closed near their day's
lows after a topsy-turvy day in the City, influenced by a weak
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's overnight rise gave the FTSE 100 index early
momentum, but stocks gave up much of their gains amid more
confusion over the pound's future.
</P>
<P>
However, soft US economic figures restored confidence until the
profit takers moved in and dragged London shares down nearly 20
points to 4,907.5 by the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
German shares on the Frankfurt market, which closes before Wall
Street opens, hit another new high, boosted by the Dow's overnight
gains and the firmer dollar which is good for German exports.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index closed up 17.21 points at 4,438.93 although
trading was quieter than in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also ended at a new record closing high
although well off the day's peaks, supported by the settlement of
July futures and options contracts. The major CAC-40 index
finished 6.37 points up at 3,075.67.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Tax Cuts Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives today approved a package of tax cuts after the
Senate passed a bill to balance the budget and shrink the size of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the tax cut at mid-afternoon on a lopsided
vote of 389-43 and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to
vote on it on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Senate passed by a bipartisan vote of
85-15 the budget-balance bill which was oked by the House on
Wednesday. The bill will be sent to President Bill Clinton for
signature.
</P>
<P>
The bill called for about 130 billion U.S. dollars in spending
restraint needed to balance the budget by the year of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the measure remodels Medicare and creates a new 24
billion U.S. dollars program of health care for uninsured children
insisted on by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton called the budget bill "the
achievement of a generation and a triumph for every American,"
adding that it marks an end to decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the bill is "the achievement of generation and
a triumph for every American," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"This good for America," said Senate Republican Leader Trent
Lott. "It's a major step forward. Maybe not a leap, but a major
step."
</P>
<P>
The balanced budget bill, a measure designed to rid the nation
of deficits for the first time since 1969, had held center stage
in both the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
Late in 1995, the dispute between the GOP and the Democrats
over the issue led to shutdowns of the government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Libyan Offer on Pam Am Explosion Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
rejected an offer from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on a possible
settlement of the 1988 Pan Am flight 103 explosion by an
international entity.
</P>
<P>
Gadhafi's latest offer was contained in a letter, sent in June
to the families of the 270 victims. The letter said Libya was
ready to cooperate with the United States and Britain if they
accept any of the initiatives put forward by the "League of Arab
States, the Organization of African Unity or the Non-Aligned
Movement," or if they follow the more cooperative route of France.
</P>
<P>
The letter also said: "the government of the United States is
neither interested in the incident nor does it care about the
victims. Its main preoccupation has centered around the imposition
of sanctions against Libya."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, flatly rejecting the offer,
said it was "a callous offer... to prey on the emotions of the
families in an attempt to undercut our will to see that justice is
served. We will not be manipulated like that."
</P>
<P>
The United States believes the two Libyan suspects, who set the
bomb that destroyed the airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, killing 270 people, are still protected in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Attached to the letter were several offers from Libya: Accept
trial of the two suspects in a third country determined by the
U.N. Security Council, or trial under Scottish judges and law at
the Hague, or trial under a special criminal tribunal at the
Hague.
</P>
<P>
But Reno said the U.S. position was a trial in the United
States or in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Im Bank, Azerbaijan Sign Project Incentive Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Ex-Im Bank) and Azerbaijan on Thursday signed a
project incentive agreement, which would lay the foundation for
possible financing of U.S. exports to the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev attended the ceremony at
Blair House, the President's Guest House. Signing for Azerbaijan
were Azerbaijan's finance Minister Fikret Yusifov and National
Bank Chairman Elman Rustamov, and Ex-Im Bank President and
Chairman James Harmon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides a framework for financing U.S. sales to
Azerbaijan where repayment is based on export revenues generated
by the borrower, rather than a sovereign guarantee of the debt by
the host country government. Repayment of loans will be
facilitated through the establishment of offshore collateral
accounts.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Air Force Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today nominated Gen. Michael Ryan, commander of U.S. Air Force in
Europe, as Air Force Chief of Staff to replace Gen. Ronald
Fogleman.
</P>
<P>
Ryan, a former fighter pilot who flew combat missions over
Vietnam, also holds the post of commander of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) air force in central Europe based in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
He had coordinated the air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs two
years ago to drive the Serbs to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Fogleman submitted his resignation Monday, saying that he
felt "out of step" with the Pentagon leadership.
</P>
<P>
However, he resigned partly because of his anticipation of a
decision by Defense Secretary William Cohen to hold another air
force general, Terryl Schwalier, responsible for failing to
protect against a truck bomb that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi
Arabia last year.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he was blocking the promotion of Schwalier since he
failed to prepare for possible bomb attack against the U.S. in
Saudi Arabia.
