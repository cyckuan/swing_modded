<HEADLINE> One Killed, Six Injured in Land Dispute in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- One person died and six others
were injured today when farmers clashed with police who came to
enforce a court order to pull down a number of houses in a village
in the Nile Delta, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas after one of the owners of the disputed
houses threw a gas cylinder and set fire to stray on the roofs of
some neighboring houses, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted
an Interior Ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
One villager, identified as Munir Qandeel, was killed, and
Fouad Radhi, a police sergeant, was among the six injured, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in Abu Shindi village, Qatour, Gharbia
province, some 80 kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The court had ruled that the houses were built illegally on
land that did not belong to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security forces are still hunting the identified
gunmen who opened fire indiscriminately and killed nine people in
a village near al Badari area in the southern province of Assuit
Saturday night. Two others were injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The police are imposing a siege on the mountainous area near
the village, where the assailants are believed to have fled after
committing their crime, the Interior Minister source was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Top Aide Describes Egyptian-Saudi Relations as Good, Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's top aide, Osama el-Baz, has described relations between
Egypt and Saudi Arabia as "good and healthy," warning against any
foreign plots to harm the ties.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo Arabic-language weekly Rose Al
Youssef, the first undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry and
director of the President's Office for Political Affairs said that
the bilateral relations are consolidated by common interests of
the two countries. The weekly publishes his statements in its
Monday issue.
</P>
<P>
Individual incidents do not affect the ties and such incidents
would be dealt with individually, he said.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz accused what he called "quarters outside Egypt and Saudi
Arabia" of exaggerating these incidents with the aim of poisoning
relations between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The publication of el-Baz's statements coincided with Saudi
Information Minister Fouad Abdel Salm al Farsi's arrival in Cairo
today on a three-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Al Farsi said upon arrival that his visit is aimed at fostering
bilateral information cooperation.
</P>
<P>
His Egyptian counterpart Safwat el-Sherif, who met him today,
also described the Egyptian-Saudi relations as strong.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Egypt and Sudan, el-Baz reiterated Egypt's
stance urging Sudan to hand over to Ethiopia the three suspects
involved in the failed assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis
Ababa last June.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has repeatedly accused Sudan of supporting and exporting
terrorism to its neighboring countries. Sudan denies the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz also called on Sudan to surrender the terrorists whose
extradition has been requested by the Egyptian authorities
directly from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He told the weekly that Egypt has maps showing the locations of
Sudan's farms where terrorists are trained.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the killing of Egyptian prisoners-of-war (POWs)
by the Israeli authorities in the 1956 and 1967 Middle East wars,
el-Baz said that Egypt demands that Israel carry out investigation
without fabrication, apologize to Egypt and compensate the
families of the killed Egyptian POWs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cuts Spending Of Ministries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government
has slashed sectoral allocations to its ministries and agencies
this year to check wasteful overhead expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Explaining this to newsmen in capital Abuja at the weekend,
Nigerian Finance Minister Anthony Ani said that the savings made
from the reductions had been re-allocated to the development
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the overhead expenditures put up by most
ministries were frivolous, while some capital expenses were
duplications of past projects.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that they (ministries) should be able to manage
well with what they have and prioritise their expenditures," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ani made it clear that the reductions were not related to the
planned retrenchment in the public sector, stressing that
provisions for personnel costs, in terms of staff salaries and
allowances, remained generally at their 1995 levels.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of allocations to federal ministries and agencies
shows that 23 had their overheads reduced, eight retained their
1995 levels, while five, including the ministries of agriculture,
defence, education and the national electoral commission of
Nigeria, had their overheads increased.
</P>
<P>
Capital allocations to more than 20 ministries were also
reduced from their 1995 levels while more than 10 others had
theirs increased.

JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African has
allocated 5 million rand (about 1.37 million US dollars) towards
the redevelopment of the Red Cross Children's Hospital, South

Speaking at the Red Cross Children's Hospital fund-raising

"The mention of the red cross children's hospital warms the
hearts of hundreds of thousands of people in South Africa and
beyond our borders," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was built ten years ago in memory of all South
African prisoners of war and the red cross volunteers in World
War II. With substantial contributions from ordinary people, the
hospital is known as a world famous centre of pioneering research
and treatment of childhood diseases in Africa.

CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The killing of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's two sons-in-law, who defected to Jordan last
August, was dubious from the very beginning, said Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa today.
</P>
<P>
It was Egypt's first official reaction to the deaths of
Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother Saddam
Kamel, who were married to two daughters of Saddam. The two
brothers were murdered along with their father and another brother
by family members Friday, only three days after their surprise
return home, Iraqi media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Several question marks have been raised regarding the incident
which in the end deplorable," Moussa was quoted as saying by the

<P>
The foreign minister said that the bloody act would harm the
Arab image and is not the way issues should be handled.
</P>
<P>
Saddam had pardoned the defectors after their return in
response to an appeal for clemency, according to Iraqi official
reports.

<HEADLINE> New York Girl Tortured After Leaving Foster Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A 13-year-old orphan girl
suffered torture, beatings and repeated sexual abuse after running
away from a foster home in New York, local press report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The girl, who had been living at a Brooklyn apartment after
running away from a Westchester County foster home, was left
"almost incoherent" by her mistreatment, police said.
</P>
<P>
The girl's abuse was "one of the most brutal cases I've seen
in 27 years," Capt. Charles Wells of the Brooklyn detective squad
was quoted by The New York Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
She, whose name was not released, called the police Friday
morning after escaping from the apartment where she said she had
been living since December.
</P>
<P>
She told detectives that she had been hog-tied with a telephone
cord for three days, suspended from a closet rod, raped, sodomited
and finally scalded with boiling water.
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose parents are dead, was put into foster care by
an aunt in March 1995 and ran away on September 5. She met
Tamika Gordon, 21, who invited the girl to live with her in
December.
</P>
<P>
It was Gordon who initiated the abuse last week and the attacks
were carried out by Gordon and John Joyner, 14, another runaway,
along with an 18-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
In a search of the apartment, police discovered four other
children, with the age of 1 to 6, living in trash-strewn rooms
with no food or clean clothing. They appeared to have been
beaten and burned, police said.
</P>
<P>
Gordon and Joyner were both charged with attempted murder,
kidnaping, sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a minor.
But the 18-year-old man was still being sought.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why the 13-year-old girl ran away from the
foster home. But it was one of the latest cases of child abuse in
New York where the authorities and children's welfare
organizations were criticized for neglects.

MOGADISHU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader,
General Mohamed Aidid, today bitterly accused the United States
of trying to "disintegrate the African nation into small
emirates".
</P>
<P>
The South Mogadishu radio, which supports Aidid, quoted the
general as saying that the U.S. position on Somalia is being
"based on fiction and hearsay", referring to a recent U.S.
statement to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Madaline Albright
warned against a severe starvation in Somalia in the statement
made four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Albright, who is also the Chairman of the UN Security
Council, held General Aidid responsible for the political
deadlock in Somalia since he claimed himself "the president of
Somalia" months ago.
</P>
<P>
"As far as he is considering hismself president, it will be
difficult to negotiate with him," said Mrs. Albright.
</P>
<P>
Aidid's radio said any military or political intervention
carried out by the U.S. or the U.N. would not be accepted by
the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks among the Somali faction leaders have been
successful and have resulted in the formation of a broad based
government, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
"However, these types of reconciliation and government were
not the one Albright would expect from Somalia. They would like a
puppet government," said the radio.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Export 2.5 Million Bales of Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan exporters are
hopeful of exporting 2.5 million bales of cotton during the
1995-96 fiscal year, as the country is expecting a bumper cotton
crop.
</P>
<P>
Forward export sales of lint cotton swelled to a record 2.06
million bales on Saturday, and exporters say more firm orders are
in hand, said market sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total foreign sales, private sector exporters have
already shipped 1.162 million bales.
</P>
<P>
After three successive years of cotton crop failure, Pakistan
is expected to have a record cotton crop of over 10 million bales
this year, exceeding the set target of 9.5 million bales.
</P>
<P>
The current financial year started on July 1, 1995, and will
end on June 30, 1996. So far 9.4 million bales of cotton have
already arrived in ginning mills.
</P>
<P>
Cotton is Pakistan's major cash crop and the backbone of its
economy as 60 percent of Pakistan's exports are cotton and textile
products.
</P>
<P>
The total sale proceeds of 2 million bales will add 1.2 billion
US dollars to the foreign exchange reserves, making it easy for
the government to achieve the revised export target of 8.5 billion
dollars, said cotton exporters.
</P>
<P>
The government last year adopted a three year policy for free
export and import of cotton.
</P>
<P>
But exporters have to provide a bank guarantee of three percent
of the total value of the contract, open letters of credit within
35 days of the registration of contract with the official Export
Promotion Bureau, and physically ship the consignments within six
months.

beating Croat Goran Ivanisevic in Antwerp, Belgium, on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordanian Government Opens Fire at Iraqi Regime (Part II) (by Wen Xinnian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kabariti, who went further than any of his predecessors in
urging change in Iraq and criticizing the Iraqi regime, is
expected to focus on the human rights violations by the Iraqi
authorities and on the need for political change in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his condemnation of the killing of Kamel, Kabariti stressed
how the defectors were "murdered" despite assurances by the regime
that they would be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, he (General Kamel) chose to go where there is
neither dignity for humans nor freedom for citizens," said the
prime minister. "The killings were very much within the norms of
things that usually happen in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
But fears prevails in the Kingdom that Jordan would suffer a
great economic loss if commercial ties with Iraq were severed.
</P>
<P>
However, some supporters of the anti-Iraqi regime policies said
that the improvement of ties with the Gulf Arab states, with the
potential of promises of opening their markets for Jordanian goods
and labor, could reduce these fears.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is expected to be convincing in its argument for
alternative trade outlets to offset the loss of the Iraqi market
if it is to sever trade links with Iraq or even close its border
with Baghdad in what would be a U.S. supported regional effort to
unseat Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, local observers said.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who left today for the United States, is
expected to discuss the Iraqi situation with U.S. President Bill
Clinton. The two countries would be willing to coordinate more
closely to bring about political change in Baghdad, said the
observers.
</P>
<P>
The government's growing forcefulness in seeking change in Iraq
will be packaged with a policy whose objective is to end the
sufferings of the Iraqis and the violation of their human rights,
the observers said.
</P>
<P>
It would also be pursued with a regional backing that could
include assurances that the Kingdom will not be left in the cold
to deal with its economic losses in the Iraqi market as the Gulf
countries will open their doors to Jordanian exports and
reactivate the pipeline that once brought Saudi oil to
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordanian Government Opens Fire at Iraqi Regime (Part I) (by Wen Xinnian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's strong condemnation of
the killing of Iraqi defector Hussein Kamel Hassan ushered in a
new phase of Jordanian-Iraqi relations, marking the end of
cautious policy toward Iraq adopted by the previous government led
by Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's former government appeared conscious of a red line
beyond which it would not openly criticize the Iraqi regime, even
though King Hussein has been publicly criticizing the Iraqi
leadership and urging a political change that would end the
suffering of the Iraqi people since last August.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General Hussein Kamel and his brother Saddam Kamel, both
sons-in-law of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, defected to Jordan
last August. They returned to Iraq on Tuesday but were killed
Friday by their relatives in Baghdad. The relatives were said to
be avenging the dishonor the two brothers brought upon their
family.
</P>
<P>
Their wives, both daughters of Saddam, divorced them Thursday
and they were slain a day later.
</P>
<P>
The "red line" was blurred Saturday by Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Karim Kabariti by accusing the Iraqi ruling circles of being
responsible for a "premeditated criminal act" and describing Iraq
as a country where "there is no respect for human dignity or
freedom for citizens."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, a vocal critic of Iraqi government even
before becoming head of Jordanian government earlier this month,
is expected to sustain, or even increase, pressure on the Saddam
regime, said the English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper recently, King Hussein
said Jordan had no contacts with Iraq except for trade relations
which, he said, continue basically for humanitarian needs.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch ruled out a change in the situation as
long as the Iraqi regime maintains its current policies.
</P>
<P>
The King today described the killing of Kamel as a "terrible
crime," and predicted that a political change in Iraq is
"inevitable" and imminent.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti will no doubt face some local opposition, even from
some cabinet members, to his policies toward Iraq as the Kingdom
goes on tightening the screws on the Iraqi regime and in light of
expectations that Jordan is cooperating with the United States and
other regional allies to bring about change in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that before it translates its calls for
change in Iraq into tangible actions, the government is expected
to start building a popular base of support for its policies.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Holds Talks with Visiting Luxemburg Prime Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Juncker said that this is his first visit to Asia and China is
the first destination of this trip. Europe and Asia have many
things in common, but their direct exchanges are far from enough,
Juncker said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the two continents should have more direct
exchanges, in an effort to increase mutual understanding, he
said. He added that cooperation between the European Union (EU)
and China should also be strengthened, which will bring benefit to
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he hopes the upcoming Asia-Europe
Meeting will be a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China attaches importance to its relations with
the EU. The past several years have seen developed China-EU
relations, sustained economic and trade cooperation and frequent
exchange of visits by high-ranking officials from the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the China-EU relations will further develop on
the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and that
Luxemburg will continue to play a positive role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Asia-Europe Meeting, to be held in Bangkok
next week, is the first such meeting in history between leaders of
Asian and European countries. Li said he hopes that the meeting
will become a good beginning, and will turn out to be a meeting
for better understanding and strengthened cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Asian and European countries are different in terms of
politics, history, tradition, economy and culture, they even don't
agree with each other on certain points, Li said. "This is a
normal phenomenon, and the two sides can increase understanding
through candid and friendly exchange of views," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Seeking common ground while reserving differences," as a
Chinese idiom goes, should be an important principle for this
meeting, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China is an important part in world
economy and trade, and without its participation, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is incomplete. China has reduced its tariffs
by a big margin, which should be regarded as an important
contribution to the development of international trade.
</P>
<P>
"The attempt to obstruct China from entering WTO is not an
economic problem but a political one," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said that he believes human rights, a common topic in
the west, should primarily be concerned with people's livelihood.
Facts have proved that China has done a great job in this regard
and can even be regarded as an example to other countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Li said China has long held that human rights, as far as
developing countries are concerned, means the right to live and
the right to develop in the first place; at the same time, China
attaches great importance to ensuring its people the rights
stipulated by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We support and participate in dialogues over the human rights
issue on an equal and friendly basis, but we are against any
interference into other countries' internal affairs under the
pretext of human rights," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Juncker invited Li to visit Luxemburg at his earliest
convenience; Li accepted the invitation with pleasure and
expressed thanks.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Li presided over a welcome ceremony in
honor of the Luxemburg prime minister and accompanied him to
review the honor guards of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Juncker, accompanied by ministers, ranking government officials
and industrialists and businessmen, arrived in Beijing earlier
today on a five-day official visit. The delegation toured the
Great Wall shortly after their arrival.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the development of Sino-Luxemburg friendship and
relations of cooperation is in the interests of the people of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that although there are great differences between China
and Luxemburg in population and size, as well as in social system,
the two countries share many common points in safeguarding world
peace and promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks here this afternoon in his talks with
visiting Luxemburg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker at the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both leaders had a wide-ranging exchange of
views on developing bilateral relations and international issues
of common concern.
</P>
<P>
China's warm reception to him reflected the bilateral friendly
relations, Juncker said, adding that exchanges of visits and
direct dialogs between leaders of the two countries are conducive
to enhancing their mutual understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
There are many business executives in his delegation, and this
shows that Luxemburg attaches great importance to bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, he continued.
</P>
<P>
A series of documents on bilateral economic and trade
cooperation to be signed this time will lay foundations for the
future cooperation between the two countries, said Juncker.
</P>
<P>
Expressing admirations for China's tremendous achievements in
economic and political fields, Juncker said that the Luxemburg
side is very much interested in China's future reforms and
development.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Juncker said that Luxemburg is a small country in
Europe, the Chinese leader stressed that China holds that
countries, big or small, are equal members of the international
community, and Luxemburg has made its own contributions to world
peace, development and human cultivation.
</P>
<P>
China and Luxemburg have conducted good cooperations in
metallurgy, finance and public health in the past years, Li said,
adding that there are many opportunities for cooperation between
the two countries in their economies which are mutually
supplementary.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that businessmen accompanying Juncker in his
China visit would contact their Chinese counterparts to learn the
needs of each other and discuss fields and projects for possible
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed his appreciation for Luxemburg's "one China"
policy and the support of the Luxemburg Government for China to
become a member of the World Trade Organization at an earlier
date.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Li briefed the Luxemburg visitors on China's
reform and opening up to the rest of the world, as well as its
economic development.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Claims Responsible for Suicide Bus Bombings (By Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) today issued a leaflet, claiming responsibility
for this morning's two suicide bombing attacks in downtown
Jerusalem and southern Israeli town of Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet was issued in Gaza by "Yehya Ayyash Units" of
Hamas, an unknown group founded under the name of Hamas bomb
expert Yehya Ayyash, known as "The Engineer," who was
assassinated 50 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The group said in the leaflet that the this morning's attacks
were "carried out in loyalty to the Engineer who fell 50 days
ago," claiming the attacks "are intelligent and military victories
for the Engineer's units."
</P>
<P>
The units stressed that the group considered the attacks "a
strike at those stood behind the decision to exterminate the
Engineer," saying, "We will respond harshly to anyone who harms
our fighters and heroes."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, an anonymous caller who spoke on behalf of
Hamas told Israel Radio that the attacks were to mark the 50th day
after the death of Ayyash and the second anniversary of the Hebron
Massacre during which a Jewish extremist killed more than 20
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the Jerusalem attack has risen to 22 with
more than 49 others wounded, according to Israeli
police. Meanwhile, two people were killed and 29 others wounded in
another similar attack in Ashkelon. The two attacks took place
within one hour.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber who carried out the Ashkelon bombing has
been identified as Ahmad Shhin, 23, from the Jabalya refugee camp
in the Gaza Strip, who studied at the Islamic University of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that the suicide bomber of Jerusalem
attack is from the West Bank town of Hebron, but no name has been
made available yet.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who visited the Jerusalem
attack scene, urged Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat to take more actions to combat violence by
Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held in Jerusalem today
following the bombing attacks, Peres vowed that Israel will not
bow over to such violence.
</P>
<P>
Following the attacks, Israel immediately sealed off the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, whose closure was lifted only
Friday. Peres also ordered to halt all negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Arafat told reporters in Gaza that these attacks
were "terrorist operations." "It is not only against civilians. It
is against the whole peace process, and I am sending my
condolences to the families of the victims and to Prime Minister
Shimon Peres."
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was due to visit the West Bank town of Nablus this
morning, said he would definitely cancel this visit.
</P>
<P>
Today's suicide bombings were the first since last August's
Jerusalem bus bombing, which was also conducted by Hamas
activists.
</P>
<P>
The attack in Jerusalem took place around 6:45 a.m. local time
(4:40 GMT) when the No. 18 bus was traveling along the Jaffa
Road. The explosion completely torn apart the vehicle with only a
few passengers walking away uninjured.
</P>
<P>
About one hour later, another explosion occurred at a bus stop
in Ashkelon where many Israeli soldiers were waiting for vehicles
to take them back to their bases.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan to Form Oil Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkmenistan will
soon form a joint oil consortium to expand cooperation in oil and
gas fields, according to today's official Persian daily Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries are going to form an oil consortium in order
to increase the cooperation between Tehran and Ashkhabad," the
daily quoted Hakim Ishanov, Turkmen Deputy President for Energy
Affairs, as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ishanov accompanied Iran's President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani during his visit to the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Rafsanjani inaugurated a giant oil rig in a
bid to accelerate competition in exploration of the strategically
important oil resources in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Observerers here noted that the consortium to be formed by Iran
and Turkmenistan will certainly impose pressure and challenge to
the consortium between Azerbaijan and western blocks headed by
the United States in exploration of oil resources in the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is the powerful and important neighbor of
Turkmenistan. Iranians are our brothers. We hope that the level of
cooperation between the countries would further increase,"
Ishanov said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported that Iranian contractors recently won two oil projects in
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Ashkhabad enjoy good relations. Turkmen President
Saparmurat Niyatsov is a personal friend of the Iranian
president. The two presidents meet every year to discuss ways of
expanding the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkmenistan are both littoral states of the Caspian
Sea which has an oil reserve of 150 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities described the Caspian Sea as the
"second Persian Gulf" which is rich in oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian oil expert predicted that the Caspian Sea littoral
states will be able to exploit 12 million barrels of oil per day
and export about half of it until the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The expert also said there is a gas reserve of 75,000 billion
cubic meters in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran is trying its best to convince the Caspian Sea littoral
states that there exists no route more economical and secure than
Iran to transfer the Caspian gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh has stressed that Iran
offered the best condition of cooperation for transfer of
region's oil and gas to international market.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Spends More on Wheat Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's imports of wheat
dropped by 29.72 percent during July 1995-January 1996 as against
the corresponding period of 1994-95, but the country had to spend
more on the imports because of higher prices and the devalued
rupee.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan spent 213 million US dollars on wheat imports in July
1995- January 1996 compared to 181 million dollars a year earlier,
representing a 17.73 percent increase, the Karachi-based newspaper
the Dawn reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the wheat import bill is mainly because of the
rising prices on the world market and the devaluation of the
Pakistani currency rupee," said an official from the Ministry of
Food and Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's wheat crop had a record harvest of 16.9 million tons
in 1994-95. The government is planning to import 2.1 million tons
of wheat during the current fiscal year, mainly from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The official target for wheat production in the current fiscal
year is set at 17.4 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Downs 2 "Pirate Planes" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuba announced today that its
air force has shot down two U.S. planes, insisting the planes had
been in Cuban territorial air space.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued today by the Cuban foreign
ministry said the two planes were shot down on Saturday afternoon
some 12.8 kilometers off the Cuban coast.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the downing of the "pirate planes"
should serve as a lesson to those who carry out such acts.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Cuban air space had been violated in the
morning of the day which prompted a chase by Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The pilots of the downed planes were warned by air traffic
controllers of the risks they were incurring but the pilots did
not turn back, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Havana had agreed to allow U.S. Coast Guard
vessels into its territorial waters to conduct a search and rescue
mission jointly with the Cuban navy.
</P>
<P>
The two small planes reportedly belonged to the Miami-based
Cuban exile group, Brothers to the Rescue.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that though details of the attack were still murky, early
indications suggested that the two planes may have been heading to
Cuba to pick up people attempting to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
The Brothers to the Rescue has been doing this for years and
the Cuban government has warned that it will take measures against
such actions.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Beats Saudi Arabia in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan made a clean
sweep of their Davis Cup tie against Saudi Arabia today
as Omar Rashid and Hameed ul Haq outclassed their opponents in
reverse singles at the Artillary Mess Tennis Court in
Rawalpindi, a twin city of Islamabad,
</P>
<P>
The two Pakistanis, capitalizing on their vast experience on
clay courts, gave scant opportunity to their Saudi counterparts
Badr Al Mugail and Farah Somali to resist their straight sets
domination.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan number one Omar, sustaining a striking form,
defeated Badr 6-1 and 6-3 while seasoned Hameed remained even
more aggressive against Farah, overcoming him 6-0, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
The reverse singles were reduced to the best-of-three
matches following Pakistan's victories in the first three ties in
singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
Omar's seamless form on the clay courts was duly witnessed
in the final game of the second set as he concluded his victory
over Badr with four consecutive aces.
</P>
<P>
Badr had also no answer to the young Pakistani's volleys and
passing shots.
</P>
<P>
Hameed too was in a ruthless mood against Farah as, drawing
on his experience as well as expertise on the familiar courts, he
wound up the tie without conceding a game.
</P>
<P>
The Saudis had to field Farah Somali in the final encounter
in place of Zulfiqar Ahmed who fell prey to an injury before the
start of the match.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's success, coming in the wake of earlier wins in two
singles on the opening day and doubles victory on Saturday, not
only marked Pakistan's profitable sailing in the Oceania Group-II
Davis Cup tie but also heartened the boys for the next tie.
</P>
<P>
"Our performance has definitely inspired us and all the
players are determined to keep up this winning form in our next
tie against Uzbekistan," Omar Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, in their next Davis Cup tie, take on Uzbekistan in
the first week of April at Peshawar's grass courts which promise
to favour them against the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Hameed ul Haq, former number one, said Pakistan players will
be poised to exploit the conditions on grass courts as Uzbekistan
play normally on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
His optimism was backed by Sunday's success as the Saudis,
even after paractising on the clay courts for a fortnight, failed
to match their Pakistani rivals.

DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson
arrived here today for a two-day visit to Bangladesh on a mission
to mediate between the country's government and the opposition in
the wake of the parliamentary election 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"I will meet both Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and the
opposition leader Shiekh Hasina tomorrow and convey them some
views (on the political situation in Bangladesh)," Richardson said
upon arrival at the Zia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties demanded the resignation of the prime
minister and the establishment of a neutral caretaker government
to supervise the election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rejected the
demand and went ahead with the February 15 election, which was
boycotted by all the opposition parties who described the polls as
"farcical."
</P>
<P>
The BNP won the election, but the opposition demands the
cancellation of the polls and resignation of the government to
pave the way for a caretaker administration to oversee fresh
elections.

CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Kerry Saxby-Junna
improved her own world record in the five kilometers walk in
Hobart, Australia, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saxby-Junna clocked 20 minutes, 13.26 seconds, beating the
previous mark of 20:17.19 set six years ago in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Saxby-Junna was denied an unofficial world
record of 19:51.24 set in Sydney earlier this month because the
official timing mechanism was inoperative during her event.
</P>
<P>
In addition, only one judge clocked that record attempt,
instead of the regulation two officials as stipulated by the
world body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
Australian Commonwealth Games gold medallist Cathy Freeman also
ran her fastest 400 meters in 50.46 seconds in the Hobart meet.

</P>
<P>
FIFA will also send an inspector to assess the National

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press on Killing of Iraqi Defectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Although Iranian authorities
today refrained from making any comments on the killing of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's two sons-in-law, local press claimed
that the incident will certainly have a serious impact on public
opinion inside as well as outside of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Three English-language dailies today carried editorials on the
Iraqi defectors' murder, saying the defection was a blessing for
the United States since the U.S. intelligence service succeeded
in receiving highly classified data on Iraq's nuclear and
military plans.
</P>
<P>
"In a bid to liquidate opponents, the Iraqi president
encouraged the two defectors to return home and later shed
their blood to further consolidate his rule," said Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
The move is, on the one hand, a warning to the Iraqi
people that not a single Iraqi citizen will be spared by
Saddam's wrath if it is revealed that he or she is
sympathizing with the opposition, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It added that on the other hand, the move gets the point
across to the Iraqi opposition that it should not be deceived by
Saddam Hussein's goodwill gestures.
</P>
<P>
Irrespective of their ideological stands, the Iraqi opposition
groups should close ranks in order to force the ruling Baath
Party to listen to the voice of the Iraqi people, it said. The
paper suggested that referendums and free elections be held in
order to pave the way for a representative democratic system in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The article concluded that if the opposition fails to prepare
such groundwork, innocent Iraqi people will remain hostages in
the hands of a person whose thirst for power prompts him to kill
even his own kinsmen in cold blood.
</P>
<P>
Today's Iran News quoted Sheikh Adham Barezani, leader of
the Revolutionary Kurdish Hizbullah of Iraq, as saying that
Saddam Hussein, by killing his sons-in-law, proved to the
opponents that he cannot tolerate rebellion and opposition.
</P>
<P>
He said "Saddam wanted to prove to the Iraqi people that
no one can betray him or abandon his line of thought."
</P>
<P>
Barezani said that slain Hussein Kamel Hassan and Saddam Kamel
Hassan, who defected to Jordan some six months ago, made a grave
mistake by returning to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Their decision to return indicates they were not logical to be
capable of carrying out a plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi line on the murder of the two defectors was
that the two were slain Friday by their relatives after their
wives divorced them and their clan rejected their repentance,
ruling that their blood must be shed for treason.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the regime was responsible," said Barezani. He
rejected the efforts by some who had tried to make a hero out of
the two after their defection to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the latest killings will not impact on
future developments in Iraq and the determining factor will be
unity of the Islamic movements.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Keating Catches Up In Final Election Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's ruling Labor
Party is catching up with the opposition coalition in the last
week of the federal election campaign, with Prime Minister Paul
Keating beating Opposition leader John Howard again in a crucial
television debate tonight.
</P>
<P>
Keating reiterated the Labor Government's vision and leadership
philosophy during the second and last debate of the election
campaign, winning support from 56 percent of the on-the-spot
spectators in a local Channel Nine television studio.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed that Labor has halved its gap with the
Liberal-National Coalition. One poll put Labor only five
percentage points behind the Opposition in support ratings.
</P>
<P>
Keating's running triumphs in TV debates boosted Labor's hope
of re-election in the March 2 national poll. He successfully
impressed the spectators in both debates, who are still
uncommitted on whom they will vote for.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, Keating pointed out the Labor government's
achievements in running the economy, saying Australia has one of
the fastest growing economies, and relatively high employment and
low inflation among the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
He attacked the Opposition's environment policy as "untrue,"
because it would fund its environmental proposals with the money
from selling a government-owned company, and said that the
opposition's environmental package was a "blackmail" to
conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
Most major environmental groups have expressed disapproval of
the opposition's linking environmental policy with the
privatization of Telstra, a telecommunication company owned by the
Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
Howard tried to defend his soft point in the environment policy
by attacking the prime minister's credibility, saying that Keating
had broken his promise of not selling the government-owned
Commonwealth Bank in the last federal election.
</P>
<P>
Labor has launched a campaign to advocate "leadership" of the
country, trying to persuade voters that the Labor Government has
the vision and sophistication to lead Australia into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, on the other hand, has pushed the theme of
"it's time" and "enough is enough" during its election campaign,
saying that people want a change after 13 years of Labor
governing.
</P>
<P>
By winning the TV debate tonight, Keating won an important
battle at the beginning of the crucial final week of the election
campaign. Local analysts said Labor could continue to narrow its
gap with the opposition and even win the decisive poll on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Keating has proved his ability to turn the tide around in
crucial moments during the last two TV debates.
</P>
<P>
Latest opinion polls showed that a large proportion of
opposition supporters would vote for the opposition only because
they did not like other parties. This means that Labor still has
the chance to win over voters from the opposition side.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Israel Determined to Continue Peace Process (by Xie Dongfeng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres vowed here today that Israel is determined to proceed
with the ongoing Middle East peace process despite fatal attacks
by the Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to step up the fight against Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad "without hesitation, postponement, or restriction"
at a press conference following today's suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that all contacts with the Palestinians have been
temporarily suspended and a full closure has been clamped on the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
When asked how his government can convince the people to vote
for peace while citizens continue to be killed on city buses,
Peres said that the Israeli people know that they have to pay a
heavy price to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
The blasts came at an awkward time for the Israeli government
as the election campaign has just begun for the May 29 Knesset
(Israel's parliament) polls.
</P>
<P>
"There is no perfection against terror," said Peres, noting
the fact that for nearly seven months, there has been no major
attack by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Peres indicated that a long-term closure on the Palestinian
territories is not a good solution to violence by Islamic
extremists.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a long-term closure can worsen economic
situation in the Palestinian areas, from which Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad are able to exploit for their interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli leader called for stronger cooperation
and coordination on the part of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) to combat violence. "They do understand us that more
serious attempts are needed to counter terror," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peres revealed that 22 people have been killed in the
Jerusalem suicide bus bombing attack, while two have been killed
in the Ashkelon attack. In the attacks, 78 people have been
injured, including 49 in Jerusalem and 29 in Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
The 10-kilogram bomb exploded on a No.18 bus on the Jaffa
Road in downtown Jerusalem around 6:40 a.m. local time (4:40 GMT),
completely destroying the vehicle with only a few passengers
walking away uninjured. The blast also partially damaged a
following No. 36 bus.
</P>
<P>
The ensuing Ashkelon attack happened at a bus stop in less than
one hour.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today in a telephone conversation with PNA President
Yasser Arafat, Peres demanded that the PNA take actions to destroy
the infrastructure of extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
According to Peres, Arafat has pledged to crack down
immediately on Hamas and the Islamic Jihad and to make new arrests.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller, who spoke on behalf of the Hamas
organization, told Israel Radio that Hamas activists have
conducted the two attacks to mark both the 50th day after the
killing of Hamas master bomb maker Yihye Ayyash and the second
anniversary of the 1994 Hebron Massacre.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in Gaza this morning, Arafat condemned
the bombings, saying that they were not only aimed at killing
innocent civilians but also at sabotaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the bombing, Israel's opposition Likud Chairman
Binyamin Netanyahu said that it is necessary for the Israeli
people to come together on a tragic day like today. The whole
nation must express solidarity to the families of the victims, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meirlau called on the Israeli government
to do its best to combat violence and restore calm. He also urged
the public not to take the law into their own hands and launch
activities which may result in more bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> August First Beats Beijing Shougang Again by 24 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Liu Yudong scored 28 points,
including four three-pointers, as the August First downed the
Beijing Shougang 98-74 Sunday on its way to defending the title.
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 20th straight win for the August First in
the previous 20 rounds at this double-round regular season of the
Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league.
</P>
<P>
The August First had beat Beijing in the ninth round on
January 7 at home by 31 points, 100-69, when Beijing played
without power forward Bateer and center Shantao because of thier
health problems.
</P>
<P>
Though Beijing was helped by Bateer's 24 points and Shan Tao's
22, the host side still played hard to close the gap, especially
in the first half when it trailed at 29-50.
</P>
<P>
"We played well in the first half defensively and offensively,"
said the August First coach Wang Fei.
</P>
<P>
"We have known Beijing is strong inside, so I told my players
to use double-team to stop them. And we did and scored 50 points
before the break that was the key to win the game."
</P>
<P>
Beijing, now is third in the team placings with 16-4, went to
53-68 with 10:30 left, but never got closer than 15-point on the
stretch way.
</P>
<P>
"We are weaker team to the August First, but I am satisfied
with our performance in the second half," said Yuan Chao,
coach of the Beijing Shougang.
</P>
<P>
"On our way to placing the second or third in the regular
season, the decisive game is to beat the Guangdong Hongyuan," Yuan
added.
</P>
<P>
The Hongyuan, 16-4, shares third with Beijing in the team
placings after edging the Shenyang Army 90-81 Sunday at home in
Dongguan, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
In Anshan, the host Liaoning trounced the Nanjing Army 109-58
to stay second place in the 12-team leauge with 18-2. Wu Qinglong
and Jie Jun hit a combined total of 30 points for Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Beat Jiangsu 84-70 after a 48-35 halftime lead in
Hangzhou, leaving Jiangsu to struggle for staying at the leauge
next seaon.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu now is 6-14, same as the Air Force, who lost home game
to Shandong 85-94 in Wuhan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, the Jinan Army overwholmed the Vanguard 96-83 on
the road game.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard remained on the bottom of the league with one
win and 19 losses.

<HEADLINE> HK Cold Snap Toll Rises to 39 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The week-long chilly cold
that snapped the usually hot, humid sub-tropical Hong Kong has
taken the toll of 39 people, mostly elderly and weak, according to
 the HK Government Information Service today.
</P>
<P>
Among the latest victims of the cold onslaught was a
70-year-old woman who was found dead in her flat clutching her
telephone hand-set.
</P>
<P>
The ages of those found dead Saturday ranged from 20 to 95. The
 youngest was found in a stairwell in his home by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
His father, who last saw him Thursday night, said his son had
been a drug addict.
</P>
<P>
Under fire for failing to stop winter death toll from
increasing, officials of the Home Affairs, Social Welfare and
Housing departments were summoned to a special meeting of the
Welfare Services Panel yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Department officials and public servants in vans
scoured the streets last night in a last-ditch effort to herd
homeless people to the 18 temporary public cold
shelters. Mattresses and sleeping mats were bought for the
shelters.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 people are estimated to be homeless in Hong
Kong. They live in cardboard boxes and under flyovers.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 people aged above 60 live alone while 50,000 have
to manage on social security payment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Tourism Continues to Pick up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's tourism industry, which
fared well last year, continued to pick up as some 246,000
tourists visited the country last month, an increase of 25.3
percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The number of nights spent by tourists also increased
considerably last month, reaching 1,859,128, an increase of 34.8
percent over the same month of the previous year, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Tourism Ministry, about
196,000 tourists came to Egypt in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The southern resort city of Aswan, in particular, attracted
more tourists, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism, which had suffered a slump since 1992
largely because of a violent campaign launched by Islamic
militants against the government, greatly recovered last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.133 million foreign tourists visited Egypt in
1995, recording an increase of 21.4 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
This big number has been attributed to the improved security
situation in the country and a huge international advertizing
campaign launched by the tourism ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tourism income last year reached nearly 2.79 billion
U.S. dollars, increasing by 39 percent over the 2.0 billion in
1994. Tourism is now the second largest source of foreign currency
income behind remittances from expatriate workers.
</P>
<P>
The World Tourism Organization has said that Egypt accounted
for more than half of the Middle East region's 1995 growth in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is renowned for its monuments left over from the
Pharaonic era, mild weather in winter, unpolluted sand beaches
along the Red Sea coast and religious sites.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Producing Fake US Dollar Bills (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again
denied producing any fake U.S. dollar bills by inviting foreign
journalists to visit its own bank note printing house in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Organization for Producing Bank Notes and
Coins told Xinhua that Iran has never produced fake U.S. dollar
bills though it has the ability of producing all kinds of bank
notes.
</P>
<P>
Ali Sami'ee, Production Manager at the printing house, said
his house had produced bank notes for Tajikistan shortly after
its independence about two and half years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and the Ministry of Culture and
Islamic Guidance invited a group of foreign journalists from AFP,
ANSA, EFE, KYODO, Xinhua, WTN and other newspapers to visit
Iran's only printing house under heavy security in a bid to
convince the world media that Iran is innocent despite the
U.S. allegations.
</P>
<P>
The official said that they have no special ink or paper for
making U.S. dollar bills, terming the U.S. allegations as a
politically-motivated propaganda against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We did not make any fake U.S. dollar bills but the Americans
have produced fake 10,000 rial bills," he stressed, adding that
his factory had the evidence of fake rial bills confiscated in the
market.
</P>
<P>
"It will take 45 days for us to produce a complete set of new
bank notes. Had we been involved in the production of fake
dollars, you would have noticed us doing it during your tour of
the facility," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iran began producing bank notes from 1984 after it built
its own printing house with computerized equipment imported from
Germany. It now imports ink from Switzerland and paper from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to specify what amount of bank notes
it produces a year and how much salary each worker at the house
earns a month.
</P>
<P>
However, he revealed that there are 400 employees working
for the organizations. "The people working here are chosen after
a tough screening to weed out the dishonest people who might
misuse their position," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were "never" any case of wrongdoing by
any of the employees at the printing house.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) denied claims
made by some U.S. press organizations that Iran produced
100-dollar counterfeit bills.
</P>
<P>
The CBI statement stated that the United States has waged a
psychological war against Iran by tarnishing its image with false
accusations.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has made a decision to follow up the matter through
legal channels in the international court and it is expected to
file a law suit against those who have falsely made such claims,
it added.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the plot is in connection with a
recent decision made by the U.S. congress to plan subversive
activities against Iran.
</P>
<P>
It noted that such accusation of bogus bills and illegal acts
of similar kinds can only be the works of those governments who
allow the spread of such rumors, but not that of the Islamic
Republic of Iran. Such accusations aimed at tarnishing the image
of Iran by arrogant powers is nothing new, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities said that the U.S. presented
absolutely no evidence or document to support its claim.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the absurdity of the allegation would become
more evident when it is taken into account that Iran itself is
"affected by the circulation of counterfeit 10,000 rial bills."
</P>
<P>
It underscored the fact that the Clinton administration "has
embarked on a program to undermine the political system in
Iran and has the expressed incentive as well as the required
technology and expertise to destabilize the Iranian economy
through direct and/or indirect involvement in making phony Iranian
bills."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ramos Leads People Power Anniversary Rites (By Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten years ago, Filipinos braved
guns and tanks to topple the late Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year rule
in the historic EDSA "People Power" revolution and pushed Corazon
Aquino onto presidency.
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, President Fidel Ramos, one of the key players
in the EDSA uprising, led the nation today in commemorating the
10th anniversary of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Filipinos gathered at the site of the uprising on
the capital's Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) to mark the
event.
</P>
<P>
The day-long celebration began with a flag-raising celebration
early this morning at the EDSA People Power Monument and was
capped by a mass this afternoon at the EDSA Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reunited with other EDSA personalities led by former
president Corazon Aquino and Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin.
</P>
<P>
The three received the "freedom torches" from participants in a
17-day freedom run, after which Ramos lighted a "freedom flame" at
the site.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Ramos urged Filipinos to complete
the unfinished EDSA revolution, particularly in the war against
poverty, and warned that the country may undergo revolution "again
and again."
</P>
<P>
He said the EDSA revolution has taught the country three
lessons.
</P>
<P>
The first is that full political and economic democracy cannot
be won in a day -- or four days -- or a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is an endless process -- a civic habit -- that
people must painstakingly nurture day after day," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The second lesson, he said, is that "we may undergo revolution
again and again -- if we do not strengthen our country
economically."
</P>
<P>
He said all the revolutions of the latter half of the 20th
century have taken place in impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
"The third and final lesson is that even if we are economically
strong, we will still face the threat of upheaval -- if we do not
manage growth so that it brings social justice and better lives to
the poor," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a word, he said, "Our EDSA revolution is still unfinished.
To accomplish the mission, we need to recapture the sense of unity
-- the sense of being one people -- that we possessed at EDSA in
1986 and in 1896 at Pugad Lawin and Balintawak and at Bagumbayan."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Punish Violators of Trade Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
decided to punish trade regulations violators involved in cases
too minor to be subject to court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
A recent government decree has specified fines and other
penalties for administrative violations in trade, according to the
latest issue of the English-language Vietnam Investment Review.
</P>
<P>
State-run firms, private companies, foreign-funded businesses
as well as individuals and international groups are all subject to
the decree.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded businesses in breach of the code will be fined
between two million Vietnamese dong (181 U.S. dollars) and 100
million Vietnamese dong (9,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese law prohibits companies from using unregistered
duty-free imports in their operations.
</P>
<P>
In severe cases, punishments could be temporary or permanent
suspension of a business license or confiscation of goods.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Claims Responsibility for Jerusalem Bus Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) is responsible for this morning's suicide
bombing attacks in downtown Jerusalem and southern Israeli town
of Ashkelon, an anonymous caller who spoke on behalf of the
group told Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The caller said that the attacks were staged to mark 50 days
after the killing of Hamas bomb expert "engineer" Yihye Ayyash
last month and the second anniversary of the Hebron Massacre,
during which a Jewish extremist killed more than 20
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the Jerusalem attack has risen to 23
with more than 44 others wounded, according to Israeli police.
Meanwhile, two people were killed and 19 others wounded in
a similar attack in Ashkelon. The two attacks took place
within one hour.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who visited the Jerusalem
attack scene, urged President of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat to take more actions to combat
violence by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Peres also vowed
that Israel will not bow to such violence.
</P>
<P>
Following the attacks, Israel immediately sealed off the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank, whose closure was lifted last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Arafat told a press conference in Gaza that
these attacks were aimed not only at innocent civilians but
also at the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has sent his condolences to Peres and
the Israeli government over the tragic incidents.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was due to visit the West Bank town of
Nablus this morning, said he would definitely cancel this
visit.
</P>
<P>
Today's suicide bombings were the first since last August's
Jerusalem bus bombing, which was also conducted by Hamas
activists.
</P>
<P>
The attack in Jerusalem took place around 6:40 a.m. local
time (4:40 a.m. GMT) when the No. 18 bus was travelling
along the Jaffa Road. The explosion completely torn apart the
vehicle with only a few passengers walking away uninjured.
</P>
<P>
In less than one hour, another explosion occurred at a bus
stop in Ashkelon where many Israeli soldiers were waiting for
vehicles to take them back to their bases.

CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Some Christian Copts in southern
Egypt today appealed to the government for better protection of
their villages and churches following a wave of fatal attacks by
unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen opened fire randomly and killed seven people
Saturday near al Badari area in the southern governorate of
Assuit, 320 kilometers south of Cairo. The gunmen fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
The death toll today rose to eight with the death of a
Christian man, who died of his wounds.
</P>
<P>
Two persons were wounded in the attack and rushed to hospital,
the Middle East News Agency (MENA) said, citing a security source
from the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The police have been trying to arrest the assailants, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been haunted by terrorist attacks since 1992 when
the country's Islamic militants launched a violent campaign
against the government in an attempt to install strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have cracked down on militants fiercely and
largely contained terrorist activities, which have only happened
sporadically in villages in the south.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Lower Minimum Paid-in Capital for Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
agreeable to a legislative proposal lowering the minimum paid-in
capital requirement for foreign-owned domestic and marketing
enterprises from 500,000 US dollars to 200,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investments (BOI), which earlier pressed for a
minimum equity requirement of 150,000 dollars, said it was
"amenable" to the relevant provision in Senate Bill 1399 proposed
by Senator Ramon Magsaysay Jr.
</P>
<P>
The present requirement of half a million dollars has served as
a deterrent to the entry of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The BOI continues to press for the scrapping of the three-year
requirement before a domestic enterprise can change its status to
an export enterprise.
</P>
<P>
It has also recommended that the negative list C of the Foreign
Investment Act (FIA) be scrapped permanently in line with the
government's liberalization policy.
</P>
<P>
List C cites the sectors where foreign ownership is totally
banned or is limited to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the restricted sectors are the operation of cockpits,
travel agencies, tourist lodging services, pension houses and
tourist inns, convention and conference organizers, and life and
non-life insurance agencies.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates that registered foreign investments
will nearly double by the end of the decade if the FIA and other
laws regulating the entry of foreign capital are relaxed.
</P>
<P>
Based on the government projections, investments will steadily
increase from 8.04 billion pesos (322 million dollars) this year
to 15.4 billion pesos (616 million dollars) by 2000.

OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- German speed king Christoph
Langen completed a quadruple gold first as part of the winning
team at the four-man bobsleigh World Championships in Calgary,
Canada on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Langen's golden performance came just one week after he and
Markus Zimmerman captured gold at the two-man world championships.
</P>
<P>
Langen, with Zimmerman, Sven Ruhr and Olaf Hampel were never
seriously challenged in the two-day event as the Germans posted
the fastest time in all four runs for a combined winning time of
three minutes 38.39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Langen is the first driver to capture gold at the European and
World Championships level in both the two-man and four-man events
in a single year.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss crew of Marcel Rohner, Markus Wasser, Thomas
Schreiber and Roland Tanner maintained their overnight second
place to capture the silver medal in 3:39.06.
</P>
<P>
Germany's jubilation was enhanced with the addition of a
bronze medal performance by Wolfgang Hoppe's crew and a
fourth-place finish from Dirk Wiese and his crew.
</P>
<P>
But bronze was not nearly enough to satisfy defending world
champion Hoppe, who was visibly upset with his performances both
on both Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary event marked the end of the bobsleigh career of
Monaco's Prince Albert, who finished 19th overall.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people have been
killed and 44 others wounded so far in a bus bombing attack in
downtown Jerusalem this morning, a spokesman for the Jerusalem
Police District told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said however that no organization has claimed
responsibility for the incident.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israel has completely sealed off the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The closure on the territories was
just lifted last Friday, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least two people have been killed and 10 others
wounded, eight seriously, in a bombing attack in southern Israeli
town Ashkelon this morning, said the radio. No group has yet
claimed responsibility for this attack.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place at a bus stop in Ashkelon, the first
Israeli town to the north of Gaza, just about one hour after the
Jerusalem attack which occurred around 6:40 a.m. local time (4:40
GMT).
</P>
<P>
In what seems to be the worst bus bombing attack in the
history of Jerusalem, some 10 to 15 passengers have been killed
and dozens of others wounded when the No. 18 bus was travelling
along the Jaffa Road at the start of rush hour, according to
Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
The explosion torn apart the bus almost completely, and also
partially damaged the following bus. Most of the casualties came
from the first bus with only a few passengers walked away
uninjured.
</P>
<P>
Sunday is an ordinary working day in Israel following Sabbath
(Jewish day of rest).
</P>
<P>
This is the first bus bombing since last October.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security forces have been tightened up for the
past month or so to prevent bombing attacks by Islamic
extremists, especially Hamas activists who had vowed to avenge
the death of bomb expert Yihye Ayyash.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada's allegation of
match fixing by Malaysia and India during a hockey qualifying
match for the Olympic Games was an insult to both countries,
Sunday newspapers quoted Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is easy to make allegations and they should prove it,"
Mahathir told reporters on Saturday evening after receiving
sponsorship cheques worth more than 3.3 million ringgit (1.3
million U.S. dollars) for the Tour de Langkawi Cycling
Championship.

<P>
The Canadian Hockey Federation (CHF) reported to the
International Hockey Federation (FIH) that Malaysia and India had
conspired to fix the match in Barcelona last month.
</P>
<P>
The match ended in a scoreless draw, which enabled Malaysia to
clinch fifth place and the last ticket for the Olympic Games in
Atlanta in July. India also qualified.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Canada also claimed that six Indian players accepted money
during or after the match for "arranging" the result.

</P>
<P>
The regional government has recently worked out its plan of
science and technological development for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>

According to the plan, Tibet will set up a new science and
technological system by the year 2000 which meets the need of the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology are expected to contribute to 40 percent
of local economic growth by the turn of the century while 40
percent of scientific and technological achievements will be
commercialized for application in production.
</P>
<P>
The region has planned to further increase the two figures to
50 percent, respectively, by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
At present, the region has a research contingent of more than
13,000 scientists and technicians in state-owned units, with over
60 percent of them being ethnic tibetans.

CANBERRA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Australian Kerry Saxby-Junna,
denied a world record attempt earlier this month by an electronic
timing malfunction, bettered her world record in the women's 5,000
metre walk at a grand athletics prix meet in Hobart, Australia on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saxby-Junna sliced almost four seconds off her six-year mark,
covering the distance in 20 minutes 13.26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Australian bettered her own mark of 20 minutes,
17.19 seconds set in Sydney on January 14, 1990.
</P>
<P>
It was sweet justice for Saxby-Junna, who was dejected after
setting an unofficial world record of 19 minutes, 51.24 seconds in
Sydney only for the effort to be rubbed out because the official
timing mechanism was inoperative during her event.
</P>
<P>
Saxby-Junna has been Australia's foremost female walker for
over a decade and is a two-time Commonwealth Games champion and
finished second in the first women's walk over 10,000m at the Rome
World Championships in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Center Contributes to TB Control in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A South Asian tuberculosis
(TB) center in Nepal is contributing to the control of the
dreadful disease in the region especially by coordinating
activities in member countries.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) TB
Center was established in 1993 with the objective of sharing
experience and coordinating activities in TB control among South
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the SAARC TB Center, there are more than 5 million
TB patients in South Asia at present and the disease claims nearly
700,000 lives every year in the region.
</P>
<P>
Every year in South Asia, the number of new TB cases is about
3.1 million, ranging from 600 in the Maldives to 2.3 million in
India, the center said at a recent press conference.
</P>
<P>
About one-fourth TB patients in the world live in South Asia
and experts attribute the prevalence of the disease in the region
to poverty, bad socio-cultural habits and lack of government
efforts and medical resources.
</P>
<P>
TB disease can be cured in eight months if a patient completes
the course of treatment, but many patients discontinue their
treatment once they start feeling better, impeding the satisfied
result of the control drive of the infectious disease, researchers
of the center said.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu-based center announced that it will launch a
pilot TB control project next month in Nepal and the results of
the project would be introduced to all South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the project would conduct a new system known
as directly observed treatment short course (DOTS), under which
patients would take their doses under close observation of health
workers.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC TB center said it had emphasized the introduction of
this new system in all member countries including India,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party For Economic Indigenization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling party, the
ZANU (PF), has stressed indigenization of the national economy
for the development of the country.
</P>
<P>
ZANU (PF) laid the emphasis in its presidential election
manifesto released here yesterday, which said, ''We cannot
continue managing an economy that is largely owned by foreigners
and in which indigenous people have a very small stake.''
</P>
<P>
The document reiterated socialism, based on the Zimbabwean
experience, as the party's ideology.
</P>
<P>
It spelt the theme for the forthcoming presidential election
as mass mobilization for economic development, saying such
development would seek to improve the standard of living for the
country's people.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto also hailed the first Secretary of ZANU (PF) and
the President of state, Robert Mugabe, as the best candidate for
next month's presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Coetzer, Schultz-McCarthy Reaches IGA Classic Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Amanda Coetzer
dashed top seed Chanda Rubin's hope of clinching her first career
title of the WTA Tour with a 6-4, 6-4 semifinal upset on Saturday
at the IGA Classic tennis tourney in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, the 17th-ranked South African will take on
second-seeded defending champion Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the
Netherlands, who beat seventh-seeded Russian Elena Likhovtseva 7-6
(7-2), 6-3 earlier in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Coetzer, who had never beaten the 20-year-old Rubin in their
four previous meetings, broke five times to topple the 10th-ranked
American in 83 minutes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The South African broke Rubin's serve in the first set to go up
5-4, and held to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
After Rubin jumped out to a 2-0 second-set lead, Coetzer reeled
off five games in a row to take a 5-2 lead. But Rubin fought back
to pull within 5-4 before the third seed served out the match.
</P>
<P>
Schultz-McCarthy and Likhovtseva went into the tie-breaker
after each held her own serves throughout the first set.
</P>
<P>
The big-hitting Dutchwoman scored three mini-breaks to prevail
the breaker 7-2.
</P>
<P>
Schultz-McCarthy cashed in on an early service break in the
second set to secure a 3-1 lead and made it hold up for victory.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Shooting-down of Two U.S. Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
tonight condemned the reported shooting down of two American
planes by Cuban jet-fighters earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
"I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms," said
Clinton, who is touring the northwestern U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he has dispatched two F-16 fighters to
protect search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that he has ordered the U.S. interest section
in Havana to seek an immediate explanation form the Cuban
government of what happened.
</P>
<P>
The two small planes belonging to the Miami-based Cuban exile
group, Brothers to the Rescue, were reportedly shot down as they
flew toward the coast of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that while details of the attack were still murky, early
indications suggested that the two planes may have been heading to
Cuba to pick up people attempting to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
The Brothers to the Rescue has been doing this for years and
the Cuban government has warned that it would take measures
against such actions.

<HEADLINE> Israel's "No" Will Block Peace, Says Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad has said that Israel's rejection of the
Palestinian State will impede the West Asian peace process and
undermine the leadership of Palestine President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local newspaper New Sunday Times, Mahathir
said: "I believe it will, to a certain extent, adversely affect
the peace process. It will make it difficult for Arafat's
leadership to hold negotiations with Israel."
</P>
<P>
"This is because Arafat's support depends on the extent of his
capability to negotiate with Israel. If he cannot influence his
supporters with the peace process, his capability will be
undermined," Mahathir said when he answered questions in a
interview with the newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He also said that although many Muslim countries had
established diplomatic ties with Israel, Malaysia did not do so as
it still had doubts over Israel's stand on the status of
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Expressing disappointment over Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres' statement Thursday in rejecting a Palestinian State,
Mahathir was quoted by the newspaper as saying: "I don't know
whether this is a pre-election statement. But even if it is, such
statement will commit the parties contesting in the elections and
they will be bound by it."

KUALA LUMPUR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has said that
at the moment the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) should not be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian newspaper New Sunday Times today quoted Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying if the ASEM becomes too
big and with too many conflicting interests, the meeting will be
so confused and nothing will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
When asked in a interview with the paper Saturday whether
Australia and New Zealand were qualified to join the meeting,
Mahathir said: "We will have to see how much they identify with
Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said India and Pakistan had every right to join the
meeting but there must be some criteria, otherwise other countries
like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal would also want to join the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
On whether Malaysia will oppose the expansion of the second
ASEM, Mahathir said, "At this moment, we will have to see whether
it will work or not."
</P>
<P>
The first ASEM meeting, involving 25 leaders from Europe,
seven-member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), China, Japan and South Korea, will be held in Bangkok on
March 1 and 2.

All three were given one-month detention and sent to the Dhaka
Central Jail last night.

<P>
Awami League, Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, which had

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy to Resume F-14s Flights on Restricted Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. navy announced
today that it will allow its F-14 fighters to resume flights on a
restricted basis starting Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Navy ordered flight suspension of its 330 F-14s for three
days after a series of three accidents in less than a month,
including the loss of one of the supersonic jets off a U.S.
carrier in the Gulf Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Navy said that it would continue to investigate the causes
of the three crashes while allowing the resumption of its F-14
flights.
</P>
<P>
The first investigations have shown that there were no
significant similarities in any of the accidents, the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
F-14s constitute about one-fifth of the U.S. Navy's fighter
strength and have been used extensively to patrol the skies in the
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Some 26,000 U.S. troops are carrying out peacekeeping
operations in Bosnia and its neighboring countries as part of the
60,000 NATO peace implementation forces.
</P>
<P>
While ordering the resumption of flights, the U.S. Navy asked
commanders to make certain that crew members of the F-14s were
familiar and complying with all operating and safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
It also placed strict restrictions on speed and the use of
afterburnings at certain altitude.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Calls for End to Debate Over EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today called for an end to debates in the country over the
European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"I suggest now that we stop discussing who will, who can and
who can't join (EMU)," he said in a televised speech tonight.
</P>
<P>
Every country has to finish its "homework" and Germany also
has a lot to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl noted that the standards for EMU should not be lowered,
adding, "Stability is the absolute priority for me."
</P>
<P>
However, that does not mean a deferment of the monetary union,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl made the remarks in response to allegations in the country
that EMU would be delayed despite the government's repeated
assurance that it will take effect on time.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine "Focus" said in an issue to be published
Monday that the German Finance Ministry is preparing for a delay
since only Luxemburg can meet the standards by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was denied by the Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper "Bild AM Sonntag" also reported in an
issue to be published Sunday that a state secretary from the
Finance Ministry said Germany can't meet EMU's standards in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Germany's financial deficit in 1997 will account for 4.02
percent of its gross domestic product, exceeding the EMU standard
of 3 percent, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the parliament group of the
Christian Democratic Union/the Christian Social Union, who has
always supposed that there might be a postponement of the monetary
union, told the magazine "Capital" recently that EMU could be
delayed if need be.
</P>
<P>
"We suggest a delay if the standards aren't met," he added.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Grows Fast in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The private sector in
Mongolia enjoyed rapid development in recent years with its output
value accounting for 63.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The latest official figures showed that the fast-growing
enterprises were mostly from industry, animal husbandry and
construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
The growth resulted from government efforts to privatize
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises since
1991. Mongolia began to speed up the privatization drive in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia reported 22,600 enterprises by the end of 1994, 68.5
percent of which were privately run, the figures showed.

<HEADLINE> Transport Strike in Nepal Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide transport
strike in Nepal launched from Friday was finally called off late
Saturday by organizers.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Nepal Transport Entrepreneurs (FNTE) said
Saturday evening in a press release that it decided to end the
strike as the government had given assurance to positively
consider its demand for the increase of transport fares.
</P>
<P>
FNTE called an indefinite transport strike Friday after the
government refused its demand to raise public transport fares by
more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the two-day strike seemed to be unsuccessful as other
transport organizations in the country boycotted it and operated
their services as usual.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, Minister for Transport Bijaya Gachchhadar said
in a press statement that the government would take a positive
attitude about FNTE's demand in three days.
</P>
<P>
He said the strike from Friday had caused some inconvenience to
the general public and urged an immediate call-off of the strike.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 25 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels have
seized large stocks of kerosene and fruit drinks which were being
transported in fishing boats from one coastal village in the North
Western district, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The kerosene amounting to 10,500 liters were being transported
in 50 barrels together with a large stock of fruit drinks in two
fishing boats from Kalpitiya to Mannar.
</P>
<P>
A boat service of the liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
had been established to transport essential commodities from one
village to another in the district, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The area is under the surveillance of the government security
forces. However, a sea fleet of the LTTE also frequents the area.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a separate Tamil state in the
north and east of Sri Lanka since 1983. More than 50,000 people
have been killed in the ethnic war.

<HEADLINE> Chavalit Gives Qualified Backing to Thai Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister and New
Aspiration Party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said Saturday his
party's votes in next month's censure debate will depend on the
explanations given by targeted ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit's statement came after a number of MPs from his party,
the second largest in the coalition government, last week
threatened to vote against cabinet ministers from the Chart Thai
(Thai Nation) Party, the core coalition party, which is led by
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa.
</P>
<P>
The ministers in question include those who allegedly received
a 20 billion baht (800 million US dollar) loan from the Bangkok
Bank of Commerce to take over companies listed on the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said cabinet ministers who come out with confusing
explanations on the charges leveled against them will not survive
the censure.
</P>
<P>
If they are unable to provide the public with clear
explanations it will not be possible for them to remain in the
government, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers noted that Chavalit's warning might be
aimed at sending a message to Prime Minister Banharn not to take
him for granted.
</P>
<P>
The two men have not seen eye-to-eye on a number of issues of
late including the selection of military senators in which
Chavalit, who is also defense minister, was excluded from having a
say by Banharn.
</P>
<P>
Banharn also reportedly wants Chavalit to give up his defense
portfolio and to take the interior minister's post.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit, who observers claim is building a support base within
the military to help him obtain the premiership, reportedly
declined the offer.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Trade Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Joint efforts are needed to
pave the way for the further development of Sino-Russian trade and
economic cooperation, a trade official said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian trade witnessed a growth last year following the
severe drop in 1994, according to a official with the European
affairs department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that trade between the two countries reached
5.46 billion US dollars last year, up 7.6 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted an official with the ministry as
saying the rebound was partly due to the Chinese side's active
efforts at pushing ahead bilateral trade ties, pointing to the
frequent high-profile visits to Russia by Chinese government
officials last year.
</P>
<P>
"However," he said,"there are still some problems which will
require joint efforts from the two sides to solve."
</P>
<P>
Attention should be paid to facilitating the development of
cash trade and encouraging large and comtetitive Russian and
Chinese enterprises to play a key role, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China has already provided a list of
recommended large companies to Russia in an effort to upgrade
trade quality and decrease the exchange of shoddy products, which
were often exported by unqualified small private traders.
</P>
<P>
"We are also concerned about the trade imbalance on the Chinese
side and hope to alleviate the trade deficit through the efforts
of both sides."
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's trade deficit with Russia hit 2.13 billion
US dollars, compared to 1.9 billion US dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ballooned deficit resulted from a mild increase of Chinese
demand for Russian-made fertilizer, raw steel and machinery, and
the relatively saturated Russian market for consumer products
during the period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Research also needs to be done to exploit new fields for
economic cooperation, he said, noting that the two countries are
considering cooperation on a nuclear power station in Liaoning
Province, and on some other projects.

SANTIAGO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Police recently
confiscated a record quantity of drugs, 23.5 kilograms of pure
cocaine and 105 kilograms of cocaine paste in the northern city of
Antofogasta.
</P>
<P>
A drug trafficking network formed by six Chileans who
distributed and supplied drugs, and two Bolivians who processed
cocaine paste, was dismembered.
</P>
<P>
The seizure is part of the recent crackdown on drug trafficking
in the south American country.

illicit trafficking of pharmaceutical substances.

A 26-year-old person was detained in Talca and was charged with
illicit cultivation of marijuana.
</P>

trafficking, confiscating 272 grams of dehydrated marijuana.

<HEADLINE> China Lashes Out at Trade Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese trade official today
criticized discriminative stand of some countries in their trade
with China, urging them to change it quickly.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuqing, deputy director-general of the Treaty and Law
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation, said that as tariff barriers reduce gradually, some
countries are resorting to anti-dumping measures to implement
trade protectionism in the name of fair competition.
</P>
<P>
China is at a disadvantage as many countries regard China as a
non-market economy and use surrogate figures to estimate
production costs in China in handling dumping charges, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
While many Chinese exporters enjoy healthy profits from their
overseas sales, some of them have become victims of anti-dumping
measures because of discriminative treatment by some countries, he
said without identifying those countries.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs are generally much lower in China than in western
countries, Zhang noted. Using a third country's production cost as
comparative base does not conform to reality, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, Chinese exports have been targeted in over 200
anti-dumping cases overseas and the figure has kept on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will go on negotiating with other
countries and urge them to change such treatment, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese producers should do more research abroad and
fix their export prices at a level similar to those in foreign
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also told that China is amending its own laws on dumping,
subsidies and other issues to protect the legal interests of
domestic manufacturers, in a bid to strengthen anti-dumping
administration in China itself.
</P>
<P>
The amendments are expected to be submitted to the State
Council for examination in the coming months, Zhang said.

MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian economy should be
geared to the needs of the domestic market, Russian Minister of
Economy Yevgeny Yasin told the Itar-Tass news agency today.
</P>

To focus on the home market, increase production, attract more
foreign investment and build good relations with other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will be the key

Because of the wide price gap existing between Russia and the
international market, it is getting more and more difficult for
Russia to keep its share in the global market, said the minister.

Most Russian processing industries were depending on exports,
but their export has come across difficulties when rouble is
getting stable, he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The government and the
entertainment industry need to understand each other better as
concern over sex and violence in film and on TV spurs calls for
regulation, U.S. House Representative Sonny Bono said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing how little the government and the GOP knew
about the industry," local press quoted the California Republican
as saying. "The whole point here is to try to bring this gap
closer together."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senator Sam Nunn also said film and TV producers have an
obligation to be responsible in their work while violence and
other social ills are primarily caused by the breakup of the
American family.
</P>
<P>
"Television and movies have a very powerful effect on the
American people, and on children in particular," the Georgia
Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
About 40 people from government and entertainment gathered at
Paramount Studios in Hollywood to ponder over the censorship on
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
The conference precedes this week's scheduled White House
meeting between President Bill Clinton and entertainment leaders
on how to reduce sex and violence on the screen.
</P>
<P>
While both sides generally agreed on the need for discretion in
the content of their product, there was concern that legislated
solutions -- such as the "V-chip" censorship devices in television
sets -- were simplistic.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by two groups -- the Center for
the Study of Popular Culture and the National Review Institute,
and the Wednesday Morning Club, a group of actors, writers,
directors and producers.
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address last month, Clinton urged
Hollywood to reduce sex and violence on screen and called for a
ratings system for TV programs.

<HEADLINE> South African Boxer Keeps IBF Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Frans Botha
will be allowed to keep his heavyweight crown despite testing
positive for steroids after his title fight with Axel Schultz last
December, the International Boxing Federation ruled on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Botha received what amounts to a slap on the wrist in the big
money world of heavyweight boxing. He was fined 50,000
U.S. dollars and ordered to fight a rematch with the German within
the next 180 days.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the IBF Championship and Executive Committees
made the ruling after hearing nearly three hours of testimoney
regarding Botha's use of steriods prior to his victory over Schulz
for the vacant heavyweight title last December 9 in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that he did not know that he was taking anabolic
steriods," said IBF president Bob Lee upon returning with the
decision after nearly an hour and a half of deliberating at a
Newark Airport hotel.
</P>
<P>
"He took these steriods by prescription by a doctor," said
Lee. "If we thought he knew he was taking anabolic steroids it
would have been a different story.
</P>
<P>
"We did not feel that it was sufficent to take his title," Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both Schultz and American heavyweight Micheal
Moorer, whose promised title shot will now be put off for several
months, were upset with the decision and threatened legal action
to overturn the ruling.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ruling, Botha will not be permitted fight
anyone before his ordered rematch with Schultz. The winner will
have to make a mandatory title defence against Moorer within the
following 120 days.
</P>
<P>
Botha testified that he had injected himself with the
medication, deca durabolin, just weeks before the title fight on
the orders of a doctor in South Africa to relieve pain from an
injury to his right arm he suffered in 1988.
</P>
<P>
After beating Schulz in the controversial split decision, Botha
failed a doping test and last month, a second test of the same
specimen by a laboratory in the United States also came up
positive for steroids.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Dam under Smooth Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Ongoing construction of the
Three Gorges Dam is expected to ensure interception of the Yangtze
River between October and November next year.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the construction is being accomplished ahead
of schedule, according to Yang Qing, head of China Yangtze Three
Gorges Development Corp's Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
The project officially started in December 1993. By the end of
1995, 108.8 million cubic metres of earth had been removed and
1.35 million cubic metres of cement placed.
</P>
<P>
The only delay experienced was in the building of a highway
linking the dam site with the nearest city, Yichang, where the
Three Gorges company is based.
</P>
<P>
Yang estimated that the road, originally scheduled to open to
traffic in June, will not be ready for another one to three months
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
But a bridge spanning one of the three gorges will be built in
March, three months ahead of schedule, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that the pressure to start the second phase of
construction in early 1998 did not force the company to exceed its
budget.
</P>
<P>
Invested capital by the end of last year totalled 11.5 billion
yuan, with 20-30 percent of the total used as working capital, 0.8
billion yuan spent on heavy-duty equipment and almost 7.5 billion
yuan on infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At present, construction of a 350-meter-wide diversion channel
is in full swing on the right bank of the Yangtze and a temporary
shiplock 60-90 metres high is also under construction.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, Yang said, the dam will be built to a
height of 87 metres and by 2003, the first turbine will have been
installed on the southern bank to start generating power.
</P>
<P>
When the second phase is completed, 14 turbines and a
135-metre-high permanent ship-lock will have been built on the
southern bank.
</P>
<P>
In the final phase, the dam will be raised to a maximum height
of 175 metres and an additional 12 turbines will be installed on
the northern bank of the Yangtze River.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said today that Central and eastern Europe is
one of Russia's foreign policy priorities.
</P>
<P>
Talking with his visiting Bulgarian counterpart, Georgi
Pirinski, who arrived here Friday, Primakov said that this area,
which is close to Russia, "is of great importance to Russia."
</P>
<P>
As for those countries' bid to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), he said that Russia does not want to exercise
veto on these countries, but wishes to develop friendly relations
with them.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also spoke highly of Pirinski's proposal for a meeting
of foreign ministers from Balkan countries in the Bulgarian
capital of Sofia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on helping safeguard the peace accords
in Bosnia and expanding Balkan countries' cooperation in the
fields of politics, economy, science and culture.
</P>
<P>
Pirinski, the first foreign minister from east Europe to visit
Moscow after Primakov took his office early this year, is here to
make preparations for next month's trip of Bulgarian Prime
Minister Jean Videnov.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has not applied for NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> Border Trade to Be Unified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A new policy regulating border
trade will become effective soon, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will bring China into compliance with
international practice by standardizing taxes on border trade,
which currently differ by province.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted an official with the ministry as
saying that according to Gatt agreements, it is not unusual to
grant favorable treatment to border trade, but such a practice
should be standardized under unified administration.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been granting priorities in taxes
and import and export power to enterprises dealing with border
trade during the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no unified standard, and local government
announced differing policies guiding local border trade.
</P>
<P>
This has caused unbalanced regional development and many firms
pretended to be border-trade firms to take advantage of the
favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation stipulated that "border trade" refers to
border-market trade and small-scale trade by registered
border-trade enterprises within 20 kilometres of borderlines.
</P>
<P>
The regulation makes it clear that the government encourages
various forms of border trade in accordance with the new
definition, not just barter trade.
</P>
<P>
The definition is also expected to help curb the practice of
doing common trade in the name of "border trade" with an attempt
to enjoy favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, true border trade will continue to
enjoy favorable taxes and will enjoy comparatively more freedom in
imports and exports.

<P>
BONN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Fourth seed Jana Novotna upset
German second seed Anke Huber to set up the final clash with top
seed Iva Majoli in the WTA tournament in Essen, Germany on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player, who played what she called her best match of
the week, ousted Huber 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Majoli, 18, cruised past Sweden's unseeded Asa
Carlsson 6-3, 6-2 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Novotna struggled a bit in the first set when Huber, ranked
fifth in the world, jumped to a 3-0 lead on the strength of her
solid baseline game.
</P>
<P>
But Novotna stormed back by breaking Huber's service twice to
take the first set.
</P>
<P>
Huber fought hard in the second set but could not match the
experience of the former Wimbledon finalist.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Wins Champions Series Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- American champion Michelle Kwan,
overcoming a death threat delivered to team headquarters before
the competition, produced a rock solid free programme to win the
women's title at the Champions Series figure skating finals on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old Kwan, who has been given a bodyguard here
after the threat delivered to the U.S. training base in Colorado
Springs, recovered from her disappointing short programme on
Friday which left her fourth to claim the title in the event that
is the finale of the new grand prix series this season.
</P>
<P>
Performing under tight security, Kwan made herself favourite
for next month's world championships in Edmonton with a routine
containing six triple jumps, including two in combination.
</P>
<P>
Irina Slutskaya, the first Russian to win a women's singles
gold medal at a major international championship at last month's
European championships, was second.
</P>
<P>
Josee Chouinard of Canada, withstanding the pressure that has
haunted her throughout her career, held on to finish third.
</P>
<P>
World champion Chen Lu of China, the leader after the short
programme, plummeted to fourth place after her free skating got
off to a disastrous start by crashing to the ice on an attempted
triple lutz and never recovering. She missed out on two other
intended triple jumps in a routine that was fifth best of the
seven competitors on the night.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic champions Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov
of Russia were the clear winners of the ice dance competition
ahead of compatriots Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov.
</P>
<P>
The French duo of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat
advanced one place to third ahead of Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne
and Victor Kraatz.
</P>
<P>
Skating to a playful Latin beat, Gritschuk and Platov were
superb and appear poised to add a third world championship title
in Canada as all seven judges awarded their performance with near
perfect marks of 5.9 for artistic impression.
</P>
<P>
The Champions Series finals were open to a small, elite field
of skaters who battled here for a share of $700,000 in prize
money, the winners of each event taking away $60,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hails Peru-Ecuador Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
hailed an agreement by Ecuador and Peru to move toward final
negotiations on their longstanding border disputes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a
statement that the agreement showed the "courage and vision" of
presidents Sixto Duran Ballen of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimore of
Peru in finding a peaceful solution to the territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful agreement was signed Friday in Quito, capital of
Ecudaor, by foreign ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bilateral agreement, the two nations will
establish a joint military working group to promote security and
stability in support of the diplomatic negotiations over the
disputes.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains firmly committed to its role as
guarantor nation and will continue to work closely with the other
guarantors under the leadership of Brazil," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador fought about a month in January and February
1995 over a disputed 78-kilometer border stretch that still lacks
clear demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were killed and more 100 injured during the
clashes last year.

WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Navy jet crashed
into the ocean off the Southern California coast during a carrier
exercise earlier today, killing one crew member and injuring two
others, the Navy said this evening.
</P>
<P>
A fourth crew member was missing, a spokesman for the Navy
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The EA-6-B Prowler crashed about 12:05 p.m. local time (20:00

Hawk, some 240 kilometers off the Southern California coast, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two injured crew members, who were rescued by helicopter,
were being examined aboard the carrier. Their conditions were not
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to disclose the names of the killed and
injured crew members before notifying their relatives first.
</P>
<P>
The crew members belong to the U.S. Navy Tactical Electronic
Warfare Squadron 135, based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in
the northwestern U.S. state of Washington. They were at Miramar
Naval Air Station in San Diego for carrier training, according to
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash was not known, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The crash came six days after an U.S. Navy F-14D Tomcat fighter
jet crashed into the Pacific Ocean off San Diego during exercises,
killing its two crew members.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- World champion Paul Tergat of
Kenya won the third Nairobi International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF) cross-country challenge series here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tergat was timed 36 minutes and 24 seconds, ahead of teammate
Ismael Kirui who raced in 36:27:06. Kenya's latest discovery
Hezron Otwori was third in 36:41.20.
</P>
<P>
Former five-time world champion John Ngugi failed to take part
because of a leg muscle injury he sustained while training three
days ago.
</P>
<P>
He had finished in 96th position during a domestic meet here a
week ago, but had, nevertheless, been allowed to take part in the
Nairobi challenge series.
</P>
<P>
Ngugi, 33, served a three year IAAF ban between 1992 and 1995
for refusing to take a random drug test. He has struggled to find
his form with little success since the ban was lifted.
</P>
<P>
The highest placed foreign runner was Finland's Ann Marri
Sandell who finished in seventh position in the women's race.
</P>
<P>
Sandell, who is training in Kenya for the next month's world
championships in South Africa, was timed at 21:37:79.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Rose Cheruiyot won the women's race with a clocking of
20:52:92 to beat defending champion Sally Barsosio into second
place in 21:01:38.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigating Reported Downing of Cuban Exile Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Coast Guard in
Miami has sent several aircraft and cutters to investigate the
reported shooting down by Cuban fighters of two airplanes
belonging to a Cuban exile group, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Pentagon told reporters that U.S. Navy
ships were also on the way to search the international waters off
Havana, the Cuban capital, where the planes were said to have been
downed earlier in the day by Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The two small planes belong to the Miami-based Cuban exile
group, Brothers to the Rescue, which has routinely flown near the
Cuban coastline to search for rafters attempting to flee to the
United States during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government last year complained about the group's
activities, and warned it would shoot down any aircraft straying
into Cuban air space.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Carr told reporters that
pilots of the Guard planes had reported seeing nothing except two
oil slicks in the water of the reported incident.
</P>
<P>
Carr said that there was no word on the fate of the pilots or
passengers of the reportedly downed planes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Coast Guard would continue to search in the
waters to investigate and rescue possible survivors.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson of the
United States extended his 400-meter finals' win streak to 50
events since 1989 after his victory in the Mobil Invitational
athletics meet in Fairfax on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The world's top-ranked runner at 200m and 400m won in 45.32
seconds, pulling away at the finish to beat runner-up Mark Everett
by 1.78 seconds.
</P>
<P>
This was Johnson's first competition since last Setepmber at
Tokyo, when he edged Frankie Fredericks of Namibia in the 200m.
It was a tuneup for next week's US indoor championships at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The indoor season for Johnson is a first step on the road to
his main goal for the year, sweeping the 200m and 400m gold medals
at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He won both at last year's US and
world championships.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Donovan Bailey, whose world 50-meter record of 5.56
seconds earlier this month was ratified Saturday, won the 60-meter
dash in 6.60 seconds, with Randall Evans second in 6.62.
</P>
<P>
Bailey's start in the record run was questioned, but the
sprinter said he was notified before Saturday's race the record
was his.
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced I had the world record," Bailey said. "It was
up to someone else to realize what was going on."
</P>
<P>
Gwen Torrance matched her personal best of 7.02 seconds to win
the women's 60 meters by 14-hundredths of a second over Jamaica's
Michelle Freeman, who pushed her to that career best two weeks ago
in Reno.
</P>
<P>
World indoor and outdoor sprint hurdles champion Allen Johnson,
a hometown favorite, defended his 60-meter hurdles in 7.54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Freeman led a jamaican sweep in the women's 60m
hurdles, winning in 7.82 seconds with Gillian Russell and Dionne
Rose following.
</P>
<P>
Bob Kennedy edged Morocco's Khalid Kairourani by one-tenth of a
second to win the 3,000 meters in 7:42.29, the third-fastest US
indoor clocking ever. Kennedy took the lead with 200 meters
remaining and held off Kairouani and US rival Steve Holman at the
finish.
</P>
<P>
Tisha Waller, an elementary school teacher who lives in
Atlanta, won her third straight meet high jump title at 1.96m.
She will teach full-time until May, when she begins work for
June's US Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Maicel Malone won the 400m in 51.80 seconds, beating 1993 world

SAN JOSE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan laborers in Costa
Rica send home about 240 million U.S. dollars every year,
according to Costa Rican Labor Minister Fard Ayales.
</P>
<P>
Remittances from Costa Rica, which amount to some 20 million
dollars a month, are an important source of hard currency for
Nicaragua, local press today quoted Ayales as saying.
</P>
<P>
The money sent home by Nicaraguans in Costa Rica constitutes 69
percent of Nicaragua's exports during the same period, which
amount to 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 200,000 Nicaraguans registered as laborers in the
country sends home an average of 100 dollars a month, said Ayales.

<P>
BRASILIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Health Ministry
today announced the reduction of the rodent population through
anti-pest campaigns in the country, whose capital is infested with
about 8 million mice.
</P>
<P>
There are about three to four mice for each of the 1.8 million
residents in Brasilia, but the figure is lesser than that of
five rodents per inhabitant registered in the 1960s, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The successive anti-rodent campaigns implemented in Brasilia
since the 1970s and a drive to increase public awareness of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Guara, Taguatinga, and Ceilandia, which surround
Brasilia, are the ones with most serious complaints for the mice
presence. Those places have a 12 mice per capita rate.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Official, IFOR Commander Visit  Sarajevo Suburb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Bosnian Serb
parliament Momcilo Krajisnik and commander of the multinational
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) Admiral Leighton Smith today
toured Vogosca, a Sarajevo suburb placed under Muslim-Croat police
control since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The visit was planned to provide them with first-hand
information about the problems caused by the entry of the
Muslim-Croat federation police in the Serb district.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 federal police started patrolling in Vogosca, a
Serb-dominated industrial suburb since Friday, signaling the shift
of power from the local Serbs to the Muslim-Croat federation under
the peace accord. A total of five Serb sectors of Sarajevo will be
reverted to the Bosnian government by March 19 to make the capital
a united city.
</P>
<P>
During their visit, both Smith and Krajisnik promised an
unhindered and safe passage out of those parts of Sarajevo to the
local Serb population who wish to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 15,000 out of 17,000 Serbs living in Vogosca have fled
the sector to avoid possible retaliation from their Muslim and
Croat foes, leaving that part of Sarajevo as almost a "ghost
town." Many Serbs in the other four districts have also left their
home towns.
</P>
<P>
International High Representative for civilian affairs in
Bosnia Carl Bildt and chief of the International Police Peter
Fitzgerald also toured Vogosca today with Smith and Krajisnik.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Buy Record Canadian Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors' purchases of
Canadian bonds last year doubled that of 1994 to a record high of
21.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We saw foreigners come to our market en masse and buy up our
bonds," a local economist was quoted as saying by the Canadian
daily Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
With returns of 20.4 percent, Canadian bonds offer the highest
yields at any debt market among the Group of Seven industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
Canada's high bond yields represent the risk premium demanded
by foreigners because of massive government debt and political
uncertainty, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Last year's bond purchases by foreigners exceeded the previous
record of 20.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government alone pays about 36.3 billion U.S.
dollars annually in interest charges for its debt of over 400
billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Iran To Increase Non-Oil Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Non-oil trade between
South Africa and Iran could top 300 million US dollars a year
should bilateral business links develop in 1996, visiting Iranian
Commerce Minister Yahya Ale-Iss-Haq said today.
</P>
<P>
Iran ranked as South Africa's second largest trading partner
before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. But subsequent developments
in both countries saw non-oil trade dropping to an almost
negligible amount, Ale-Iss-Haq told reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister arrived in South Africa yesterday to open
an Iranian trade exhibition in Johannesburg, in an attempt to
boost commercial relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the exhibition was Iran's first major step in
developing political and economic relations with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also urged South African businessmen to visit Iran and
develop closer links with their Iranian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Iran's strategic location in the Middle East and the Persian
Gulf meant that it was the perfect gateway for South African
business people wishing to target the region's 400 million
consumers, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the country, Ale-Iss-Haq discussed with
South African Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel ways of
increasing bilateral trade as well as developing banking
relations and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral trade agreement drafted by the Iranians was also
being considered by the South African government, Ale-Iss-Haq
said, adding that a top-level Iranian business delegation would
soon visit South Africa to promote commercial ties.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Denies Support for Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan assured
Kuwaiti people that he never supported the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, according to Radio Jordan today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Oabas published
today, the King said Jordan did not in any way know about the
intentions of the Iraqi leadership to carry out such an act.
</P>
<P>
He added that he could not be blamed for trying to find an Arab
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The King said it is Iraqi defector Hussein Kamel's description
of the sufferings of the Iraqi people under the U.N. Security
Council sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait that
made him reverse his country's policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He told the Kuwaiti daily that relations between Amman and
Baghdad are now limited to humanitarian needs and a change in Iraq
was imminent, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the matter was up to the Iraqi people
themselves.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein reiterated that he had no vested interest in Iraq
and did not see a categorical role in bringing about a change
there.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a reported statement by U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Perry that Jordan was expected to help the
U.S. back the efforts to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
the King said the Kingdom was not a part of any plan.
</P>
<P>
On Jordan's relations with Kuwait, King Hussein welcomed an
announcement by Kuwaiti Crown Prince Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah for
the Arab reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein said he believed Jordan and Kuwait have started
walking along the path of normalizing relations between the two
countries, adding that his country was ready for detailed and
candid discussions on basis of mutual respect.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa NP Advocates Balanced Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua)-- The South African
National Party (NP) today said it wanted a constitution which
would contain checks and balances to guarantee multi-party
democracy.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at Hermanus in Western Cape Province,
Roelf Meyer, NP's chief negotiator for the country's final
constitution, listed key checks and balances as Parliament, with
proportional representation; separation of powers of the
executive and the legislature; and a bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the NP's policy on the seats of parliament,
Meyer said his party was in favor of the status quo remaining and
that this should be changed only by a two-third majority of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meyer is to resign from his post of provincial affairs and
constitutional development minister on March 1 to become the NP's
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Deputy chairman of the Constitutional
Assembly (CA) Leon Wessels said that the CA Management Committee
would not be nervous if the May 9 deadline for the writing of the
final constitution was not met.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the committee would on March 14 review
progress on outstanding issues currently being negotiated to see
whether an amendment to the interim constitution would be
necessary to extend the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promotes School Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday underscored the idea of requiring youngsters to wear
school uniforms as a means of instilling discipline and order.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a rash of juvenile crimes across the country,
Clinton said in his weekly radio speech, "School uniforms are one
step that may be able to help break this cycle of violence,
truancy and disorder by helping young students to understand that
what really counts is what kind of people they are, what's on the
inside."
</P>
<P>
To stress his point, Clinton was to visit Jackie Robinson
Academy, a public school in the Long Beach Unified School
District, California, which claims to be the first in the country
with a mandatory uniform policy in all elementary and middle
schools, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also signed a directive instructing the Education
Department to distribute a manual on school uniforms to all 16,000
school districts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced his proposal on his 22nd visit as president
to California, a state crucial to his re-election hopes. He will
reportedly be back in California again early in March in advance
of the state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said Long Beach's school
uniform policy has paid off by cutting school crime, reducing
fights and discouraging students from bringing guns to class.
</P>
<P>
"We must get violence out of our schools and we must put
discipline and learning back in our schools," the president said.
"If it means teenagers will stop killing each other over designer
jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their
students to wear school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
"If it means that the schoolrooms will be more orderly, more
disciplined, that our young people will learn to evaluate
themselves by what they are on the inside instead of what they're
wearing on the outside, then our public schools should be able to
require their students to wear school uniforms."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mission Urges Abacha To Continue Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- An American civil rights
delegation on a fact-finding mission to Nigeria has urged
Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, to continue
promoting the spirit of reconciliation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The head of the delegation, Stephen Hayes, told Abacha that he
was fascinated by the general peace in the country, when he was
received by Abacha in capital Abuja yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha thanked the delegation for their on-the-spot assessment
of the true situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "a nation is not built overnight. We have nothing to
hide. We have tried to do our best since independence to achieve
unity in diversity."
</P>
<P>
Abacha's military government has been beset with difficulties
in solving the crisis resulted from the controversial annulment
of June 12, 1993 presidential election and isolation from a few
western countries.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted a statement from the
chief press secretary to the head of state, David Attah, as
saying that the delegation noted with delight, the freedom
enjoyed by Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The delegation described Nigeria as a very important African
country and commended its contribution to the peace-keeping
operations in troubled countries, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They members of the delegation said that their visit, which
ended on February 24, exposed Nigeria to them as very positive,
the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Shrinking Market Helps Feed Bulls, Analysts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The value of stocks taken out
of circulation on the New York Stock Exchange has far exceeded the
value of new stock issues, a fact partly explaining the bull
market entering 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the "New York Times" today, the
outflow of stocks outpaced the inflowing issues by 235 billion
U.S. dollars in value since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Company mergers and acquisitions amounted to 258 billion U.S.
dollars, the paper reported. Some companies go private or buy back
their own stocks which worth a total of 66.9 billion U.S. dollars.
These accounted for 324.9 billion U.S. dollar in all, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
But the initial public offerings and secondary offerings by
already listed companies worth only 89.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"As with any goods, a smaller supply of stocks will push up
their prices," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The falling number of stocks -- along with the growing economy,
the booming technology sector and other forces -- may be playing a
role in the booming market, it said, adding that "if stocks get
scarcer still, their prices may be more likely to keep climbing."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the banking, chemical and computer industries were
particularly active in repurchases, and the year set a record over
all, with a total of 1,108 corporate buybacks. Companies bought
nearly 40 billion U.S. dollars of their own stock last year.
</P>
<P>
And the buybacks are accelerating this year, it said. Up to
Friday, 211 corporations have announced repurchases totaling 25.4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said companies would value the costs of buying and
selling stock issues all the time, so it was more than just a
supply trend.
</P>
<P>
"With companies increasing buybacks, it indicates that
corporate America is confident," the paper quoted an economist as
saying.
