<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- As farmers head to banks to arrange loans for
spring planting, some will be turned down following losses during last season's
drought. Some will become depressed again and will need help. Farmer Richard
Jameson has been there, and he knows.
</P>
<P>
	   As week after week went by last summer without any rain, Jameson saw his
crops wither and felt his spirits decline. He sank into a depression that was
exacerbated by the death of his father and a close friend's serious illness.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was at the bottom of the barrel. And one of the keys for me was our
minister," he says, adding that medication and support from his family and
doctor also helped.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he wants to make sure other farmers who are depressed as they try to
scrape together money for seed and fertilizer have a place to turn for help.
</P>
<P>
	   With the help of the Methodist Conference Program for Ministries, Jameson
and his minister, the Rev. Stan Waldon of Brownsville First Methodist, have
assembled three meetings with pastors from churches in western Tennessee and
Kentucky. The idea was to alert pastors to the seriousness of the drought and
give them ideas for providing pastoral care to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We try to instill hope, try to help them recognize that the problems are
not the fault of poor farming," Waldon said.
</P>
<P>
	   They invited farmers, bankers, mental health professionals and agriculture
specialists, to educate the ministers about how the drought and failing crops
could hurt families and communities.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's not really much that we can do as pastors to put money in their
pocket," Waldon said. "What we're trying to do is say the church is here."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar efforts have been organized in other states where farmers are in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers were feeling they had failed to do their work properly. ... They
were really hurting," said the Rev. Gene Handwerk, a Lutheran pastor who
coordinated efforts to reach out to farm families in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Handwerk, a staff member for the Northeastern Pennsylvania Synod near
Allentown, Pa., and a partner in a family farm, helped get hay donated by
Nebraska and Wisconsin farmers to drought-stricken Pennsylvania farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   The synod also ran a series of workshops for farmers about how to deal with
crisis and gave pastors and rural congregations specific suggestions on how to
reach out to farm families.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've gotten quite a bit of both verbal and written feedback that people
have finally listened to their plight. ... It's been a spiritual lift to farmers
who have been open to it," Handwerk said.
</P>
<P>
	   He sees worse times coming.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be like the aftershock of an earthquake when farmers need to
come up with money for seed and fertilizer. I don't know that banks are going to
be very liberal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandra A. LaBlanc agreed. She is director of Rural Ministry Resouces and
Networking for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   "A freight train is coming down the pike and it's going to hit in March,"
said LaBlanc, who is developing a national program for clergy awareness of the
farm crisis. "What I've been told is that March is when operating loans to
farmers will be refused."
</P>
<P>
	   The Catholic-Lutheran Rural Life Commission of Northwest Minnesota developed
an outreach program after a flood in 1993, said the Rev. Milo Mathison, a
retired Lutheran pastor in Mentor, Minn., and vice chairman of the commission
which serves the northwest corner of Minnesota. The outreach arm was eventually
incorporated and receives federal funding.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have pockets of the state now that after years of crop losses may lose
30 percent of the farmers," he said. That's despite good crops last summer. "The
crops were decent, but the prices were low," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Outreach workers help farmers plan an orderly transition out of agriculture,
with job training and direct assistance for such things as utility bills, child
care and counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission runs workshops for ministers and priests on depression so
they can spot farmers who need help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Farmers tend to be rather quiet and reserved. ... A lot of the pain is
hidden," Mathison said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tennessee, the drought began early last summer and stretched into the
fall. West Tennessee, where farmers mainly grow cotton and soybeans, was hit
hardest.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are places that went 60 to 80 days without rain," said Gene Danekas,
state statistician with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When rain did
arrive, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not just poor quantity of harvest, it's poor quality," Danekas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some agriculture officials estimate the drought will force up to 10 percent
of the state's farmers to quit the business, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At one of the Tennessee meetings, farmer Sidney Talley Jr. of Ripley, about
50 miles northeast of Memphis, told the ministers that he had considered killing
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "I figured I was worth more to my family dead than alive," Talley said,
explaining his family could have sold the farm and collected insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   He sought counseling and said it helped, but what really helped was
switching to organic farming. "I did pretty well with that and I'm working on
places to sell it," Talley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The outreach program has been word of mouth, with no formal referral service
or hotline. Mike Campbell, director of health and welfare ministries for the
Methodist Hospital System, said farmers say they just need a place to turn to
for help.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are asking for a sense of personal support," Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> US Issues Visas to Elian's Grandmas  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Three American church leaders met with Elian Gonzalez's
grandmothers late Thursday night, a step that could lead to their traveling to
the United States to argue for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The custody fight over Elian took a new turn earlier in the day as the
grandmothers obtained visas from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba for U.S.
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation from the National Council of Church arrived in Havana in the
evening and began meeting with the Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana shortly
before midnight at the Havana offices of the Cuban Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm here to get my grandson,'' Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother,
told reporters as she arrived at the office.
</P>
<P>
	   The women were expected to fly to New York on Friday, apparently escorted by
the church group. Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, who has offered to
accompany the boy to Cuba, planned to meet with the women. They hoped to return
home with Elian, according to congressional sources.
</P>
<P>
	   These sources said New York was chosen as a destination because the welcome
there would be far friendlier than in Miami, where Elian has been living with
relatives for almost two months and where sentiment for his remaining in the
United States is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, National Council of Churches spokeswoman Sara Vilankulu said
the three council representatives arrived in Havana aboard a chartered plane
around 6 p.m. EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials did not permit reporters access to the plane or its
passengers, and neither the church delegation nor Cuban officials spoke with the
media Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a shipwreck in late November. The boat on which he was
heading for south Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States refused to return Elian immediately to Cuba, aggravating
the already hostile relationship between Washington and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family is pleased about the grandmothers' visit and hopes Elian will
get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
Elian must to be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team filed a lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's
due-process rights and asked the judge to prevent the agency from returning the
boy before it gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts insist that Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal standing
because their rights do not trump those of his father, his closest relative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative,'' said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the University of Miami. ``That is the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside because of his ties to both sides. U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a
daughter who works for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez also has ties to the Florida judge who ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until March, working as a political consultant for Miami-Dade
County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign. She said
she was not required to remove herself from the case because of the affiliation,
a suggestion made by a legal expert.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes 2, Sabres 1  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Keith Tkachuk scored a goal and Dallas Drake added one, with
Phoenix short-handed, as the Coyotes defeated the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Taylor ruined Sean Burke's shutout attempt, scoring on a rebound with
9:05 left, but the Coyotes, who blew a three-goal lead in a 4-4 tie with
Nashville two days earlier, regrouped and preserved their Pacific
Division-leading 25th win.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke had 28 saves. He and Phoenix's special teams kept the Sabres, who had
scored seven power-play goals in their last seven games, scoreless in four
advantages.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo's Martin Biron, the top rookie goalie in the NHL, stopped 21 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes improved to 14-1-1 when Tkachuk, who scored in the first period,
has a goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix played the first 12:30 without taking a shot, but capitalized
quickly on Biron's second straight shaky start. Biron, who had two shutouts in
three previous games, gave up three goals in 14 shots in a loss at Los Angeles
on Tuesday. Tkachuk's go-ahead goal came on Phoenix's third shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk scored with 4:54 left in the opening period, firing a wrist shot at
a sharp angle from the circle. The puck stayed low, disappeared between Biron's
knees and reappeared in the back of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Tkachuk slashed Buffalo defenseman Rhett Warrener as the period ended, and
the Sabres started the second with a power play, but couldn't convert. Their
next power play turned out even worse when Drake scored the Coyotes' NHL-best
10th short-handed goal -- his second of the season -- with 5:34 left in the
period.
</P>
<P>
	   The play that opened a 2-0 lead began when Teppo Numminen picked up the puck
in the Phoenix end and passed to Trevor Letowski, who skated in and took a quick
shot from the circle. Biron turned that one back, but had no chance when Drake,
speeding across the top of the crease, banged in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor got his first goal on the rebound of a shot by Geoff Sanderson.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Library To Be Replaced  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH KOHLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- School board officials voted late Thursday to replace
the Columbine High School library where two students gunned down their
classmates in the nation's deadliest school shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Columbine students and parents has proposed raising $3.5 million
to tear down the current library, replace it with an atrium and build a new wing
with a new library.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're saying to the world that life goes on, yes, life will be better,''
Jefferson County School Board President Jon DeStefano said after the 4-1 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten Columbine students were killed in the library before gunmen Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold took their own lives during the April massacre. Two other
students and a teacher were killed outside the library.
</P>
<P>
	   The school was reopened in the fall, but the library has been sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Mauser, whose son, Daniel, was killed, has said he dreaded the prospect
of his 8-year-old daughter someday having to use the room where her brother was
fatally shot.
</P>
<P>
	   School district officials initially considered renovating the suburban
Denver school's library, but they were persuaded by students and parents to
consider the atrium proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents have asked architects to help design a new library and estimate
it will cost about $2.25 million plus $350,000 for the atrium.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan has some critics.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbine graduate Aaron Welsh, who witnessed the April 20 rampage, said in
a letter to a local newspaper that money should be spent on counseling,
intervention and building security rather than ``modifying a building that last
year's eighth-graders won't know the difference in anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   His parents, Lyle and Nancy Welsh, were among six parents who urged the
board to get more input from students, parents and the community before deciding
to restore the old library or build a new one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Aaron said he needs to go back into the library to take back the library
and the school and if he doesn't, those two will have won from the grave,''
Welsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a difficult process,'' DeStefano said. ``But I don't think
any decision about Columbine has been easy.''

<HEADLINE> Man found chained to toilet, daughter says it was to keep him safe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ADAMS, N.Y. (AP) - A 73-year-old man was found chained to a toilet in
his tiny bedroom. His daughter told police she did it for his own good.
<P>
	   Carolyn White, 45, was charged with first-degree unlawful imprisonment even
though state police acknowledged that Jack Wolfe appeared well fed and showed no
signs of physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that place had caught fire, he would have been unable to get out," state
police Senior Investigator Richard H. Ladue said Thursday. The Jefferson County
house was heated with a wood-burning stove.
</P>
<P>
	   White was arraigned Wednesday before Adams Town Justice Donald B. Shaw, who
assigned her a public defender and ordered her held in the county jail on
$10,000 bail. If convicted, the crime carries a maximum penalty of four years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfe's confinement could have been going on for as long as 10 years, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She took good care of him while she was home. She's been taking care of him
for 25 years," state police Investigator Mary Clark said, noting that White
regularly bathed and fed her father, who has physical and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting on a tip when White was out, state police on Wednesday found Wolfe
alone in a tiny upstairs bedroom, sitting on a portable commode and double
handcuffed to an adjacent bed rail and to the toilet. Wolfe also had a chain
around his waist that was padlocked to the toilet, troopers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "She had turned off the lights and he was in the dark," Clark said. "I
didn't know where he was. I had to call out his name in order to find him."
</P>
<P>
	   Ladue said Wolfe had little to say to his rescuers, other than "he made some
statements about being uncomfortable."
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuers described Wolfe as confused but calm. They gave him oxygen and then
Wolfe was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Watertown for evaluation and
placed under the care of county social services. He was listed in stable
condition Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   White told investigators that about 10 years ago her father started
scratching himself until he bled. She began restraining her father to his bed so
he wouldn't hurt himself, damage his room or awaken her, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Then she decided if she had to leave the house that would be the best way
to handle the situation," Clark said. "Her reasoning was she didn't want him to
hurt himself or destroy the house."
</P>
<P>
	   When White was home, Wolfe was allowed to move freely throughout the house,
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said the amount of time Wolfe was left chained to the toilet varied
from two to six hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite living in a small community, few neighbors knew much about White and
her father.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't even know he was still alive," said Sonja Rutherford, who with
husband Donald lives only three houses from the White residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rutherford said she remembered several years ago seeing Wolfe out
frequently walking on the road. He stopped at their house and at others to ask
for a cigarette. He also was known to urinate in the road or in their driveway,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody was alarmed by that, Mrs. Rutherford said. "He was a nice old guy,
just a little bit off. When he walked up the road, he'd be talking to himself,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Poll finds New Yorkers in favor of teacher scholarships  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Seventy-two percent of New York voters polled by
Quinnipiac College last week called tuition breaks for prospective urban school
district teachers a "good idea," even with few details of the plan made public.
<P>
	   Approval was even greater in New York City, where 77 percent of residents
surveyed said they favored the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Touted as a centerpiece of Gov. George Pataki's 2000-01 budget proposal,
"Teachers of Tomorrow" would allocate $25 million for loan forgiveness over the
next 10 years. The governor hopes the program will boost the state's teaching
ranks by 50,000 classroom instructors.
</P>
<P>
	   The polling institute queried 812 New Yorkers throughout the state in a poll
with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Poorly performing schools tend to be in low-income, heavily minority
districts that are plagued by social problems and can't afford to pay teachers
very well, according to education officials.
</P>
<P>
	   They're a hard sell for young teachers who can boost their salary by $10,000
or more in a suburban district where prerequisites include everything from
bright, modern buildings to not having to pay street people to guard their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people say they're coming and then accept a better offer," said
Daniel Lowengard, superintendent of the Utica City School District, which has
had to recruit 150 new teachers in the past three years alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowengard would like to see extra added incentives for minority candidates,
as his student body is 30 percent non-white. He would also like to see a
substantial "payback" period.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the key element, if you got four years, you should have a four-year
obligation" on the part of teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Education Committee Chairman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat, said the governor's plan was lacking in details.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's some sort of loan forgiveness program, that is pretty much all we
know," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Quinn, spokesman for the state Division of Budget, said many of the
details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, he said, the program would work as retroactive grants paid by
school districts as part of a new teacher's compensation package. Since the
maximum a district could pay would be $3,400 a year, a new teacher would need to
stay at a school for four years to realize full benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $3,400 figure coincides with current tuition levels at State University
of New York schools. Teachers who attended private colleges should get the same
level of benefits under the program, even if their tuition was higher, Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear whether students who did not take out tuition loans would be
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to replace schools' graying work force is a national one and has
spurred a host of incentive ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Education Association estimates 2.4 million new teachers will
be needed nationwide over the next 11 years due to retirement, attrition and
rising student enrollment.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Colucciello, superintendent of Schenectady's school district, said
his district would appreciate any statewide recruitment efforts. At least 113 of
the approximately 700 teachers in his district are eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can see that we have to start producing and encouraging young people
who are bright and able and anything we could do would help," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a three-year commitment would help the problem, Colucciello said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can keep somebody three years, they've made some kind of commitment.
They've got tenure. The feeling is 'I know the kids, they know me.' That's when
you start to get in the groove."

<HEADLINE> Trump, like McCain, facing ballot access problems in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - John McCain isn't the only candidate facing problems
getting on New York's presidential primary ballot. Mega-developer Donald Trump
also faces a challenge to his national presidential delegates.
<P>
	   For a time, it also appeared former Sen. Bill Bradley might face a challenge
over some of his primary petitions, but that apparently disappeared Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike McCain or Bradley, Trump is not an announced candidate. Nonetheless,
he is considering running for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. New
York's Reform Party, which calls itself the Independence Party, and some of its
leaders are trying to get Trump convention delegate slates on the state's March
7 presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   But the effort has wound up in the middle of a battle for control of the New
York party.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora Fulani, has
filed challenges with the state Board of Elections to the petitions filed to get
Trump delegate slates on the ballot. The Fulani forces have also filed a state
court lawsuit. Fulani is backing conservative Pat Buchanan's run for the Reform
Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Backing Trump is Jack Essenberg, who Fulani is battling to have removed as
state chairman of New York's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Cathy Stewart, the party's Manhattan chairwoman and a Fulani supporter, said
the Trump forces did not file the necessary signatures of Independence Party
members to qualify for the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't comply with the petition requirements set out in
black-and-white in the election laws," coalition lawyer Gary Sinawski said.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify for the primary ballot, candidates need the signatures of 5,000
party members statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone said the legal requirements have been met
to get on the New York ballot. He would not say how many petition signatures had
been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The same taxes tactics that Mr. Bush is using against Mr. McCain, Miss
Fulani is trying to use on Mr. Trump," Stone said.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain petitions for the GOP primary ballot have been challenged in New
York by supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump said he was worried about the infighting in the Reform Party and urged
party leaders to settle their growing divisions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state elections board could rule on petition objections early next week,
but the lawsuits could last longer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, a slate of five prospective Bradley delegates in the
Bronx, including Nate "Tiny" Archibald, a Hall of Fame basketball player and
member of the Boston Celtics 1981 title team, also had drawn a possible
challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   While general objections to the Bradley slate were filed Jan. 12, specific
challenges had to be postmarked by midnight Tuesday. As of Thursday, the state
board had not received those. Without specific objections, the challenge is
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the
Al Gore campaign had vowed not to challenge Bradley's petitions, the general
objections had been filed by one of the vice president's top New York
supporters: Bronx Democratic Chairman Roberto Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ramirez said: "From everything I know, Mr. Bradley's petitions are not
being challenged.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a general rule, as certainly as long as I've been part of the process,
we've always taken a look at the petitions," the state assemblyman added.
</P>
<P>
	   Filing a general objection to the petitions is a way to preserve the right
to later go ahead with a full-blown challenge, Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hopeful there will be no challenges," Bradley spokeswoman Julia
Rothwax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of New York's top Democrats have endorsed the vice president over the
former New York Knick. Officials with Gore's New York campaign said they knew
nothing about the challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, McCain is battling challenges to his petitions in 17 of the
state's 31 congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> Pataki suggests higher license fees for barbers, cosmeticians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Steve Starr is a barber and knows about cutting.
<P>
	   This year, the Army veteran is going to be watching to see what state
legislators cut from Gov. George Pataki's executive budget.
</P>
<P>
	   An increase in examination and license renewal fees for barbers,
cosmetologists and nail specialists is among the proposed $28 million in fee
increases proposed in Pataki's executive budget for fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like it at all," said Starr, who works at Siena Unisex Hair Styles
in Colonie, an Albany suburb. "But it's something we have to do to keep our
licenses. Sometimes you have to do things you don't like."
</P>
<P>
	   Barbers aren't the only ones who will see their costs grow if Pataki's
proposals are adopted by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Other fee increases include an average 20 percent increase in hunting and
fishing licenses, increases in license fees for real estate brokers and agents,
notary publics, as well as security guards and an extension on a fee for
fishermen who harvest clams and quahogs.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of crime will also go up, with the fees charged to crooks doubling
in some case.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, fees make up roughly $800 million of Pataki's $77 billion budget
this time around, Pataki budget spokesman Kevin Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   In comparison, fees made up about $756 million in Pataki's $72.7 billion
spending plan last year. Fees went up $37.9 million during that budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn points out that Pataki has been cutting taxes in all of his budgets,
including a proposed $2.3 billion in this year's proposed plan. He also said all
the fee increases will benefit the people who are paying them, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases for hunting and fishing licenses would go to the state's
Conservation Fund, which pays for about half of the state's fish and wildlife
programs. "Without this increase, the state would have to cut back on its
hunting and fishing programs," said Brian O'Connor, spokesman for the Department
of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases for barbers, cosmetologists, security guards and real estate
brokers will go to improving the computers at the Department of State, which
will eventually allow online licensing for those professions, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved, new barbers, cosmetologists and nail specialists would see a
$10 increase in the examination fee to $25 from $15 and experienced ones would
see a $10 increase for licensing renewals to $30 from $20.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those fees haven't been increased in years, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't worry about the price of haircuts or a pedicure going up, though.
"It's only a one-time fee," Starr said. "It shouldn't affect the prices at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposed increases include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Doubling the Crime Victim Assistance Fund fee charged to criminals to $10
from the previous $5. The mandatory crime surcharges also are going up: to $50
from $40 for criminal violations, to $110 from $85 for misdemeanors and to $200
from $150 for felonies. All those fees go to the Crime Victim Assistance Fund,
Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   - Extending the fee for fishermen who take clams and quahogs from New York
waters. The 15-cent-per-bushel clam surcharge and 10-cent-per-bushel quahog
surcharge was supposed to expire in January 2001 but the money is needed to fund
marine research, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   - A new fee on public water systems to fund monitoring and testing public
waters. Public water systems that have less than 1,000 connections will have to
pay $100 annually, while larger systems will have to pay $3 per connection.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will dramatically improve the quality of drinking water around the
state," said John Signor, spokesman for the state Health Department. "This will
help prevent a repeat of the tragic events that happened at the Washington
County fairgrounds."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials blamed water contaminated by cow manure at the annual fair
for the deaths of a child and an elderly man in September. About 1,000 people
were sickened with E. coli.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers already are lining up to fight some of Pataki's proposed
increases, however. The Legislature will be holding hearings on Pataki's
executive budget for the next few weeks before taking up the budget later this
year. The next state fiscal year begins on April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, who has opposed sportsman
fee increases, wants Pataki to wait until after an audit of the state
Conservation Fund is completed before asking for an increase in hunting and
fishing fees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only this independent evaluation will provide the data the Legislature will
need to responsibly address fee increases," Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have maintained for more than a year ... the need for a resident fee
increase has not yet been demonstrated or justified."

<HEADLINE> Poll finds New Yorkers in favor of teacher scholarships  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Seventy-two percent of New York voters polled by
Quinnipiac College last week called tuition breaks for prospective urban school
district teachers a "good idea," even with few details of the plan made public.
<P>
	   Approval was even greater in New York City, where 77 percent of residents
surveyed said they favored the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Touted as a centerpiece of Gov. George Pataki's 2000-01 budget proposal,
"Teachers of Tomorrow" would allocate $25 million for loan forgiveness over the
next 10 years. The governor hopes the program will boost the state's teaching
ranks by 50,000 classroom instructors.
</P>
<P>
	   The polling institute queried 812 New Yorkers throughout the state in a poll
with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Poorly performing schools tend to be in low-income, heavily minority
districts that are plagued by social problems and can't afford to pay teachers
very well, according to education officials.
</P>
<P>
	   They're a hard sell for young teachers who can boost their salary by $10,000
or more in a suburban district where prerequisites include everything from
bright, modern buildings to not having to pay street people to guard their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people say they're coming and then accept a better offer," said
Daniel Lowengard, superintendent of the Utica City School District, which has
had to recruit 150 new teachers in the past three years alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowengard would like to see extra added incentives for minority candidates,
as his student body is 30 percent non-white. He would also like to see a
substantial "payback" period.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the key element, if you got four years, you should have a four-year
obligation" on the part of teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Education Committee Chairman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat, said the governor's plan was lacking in details.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's some sort of loan forgiveness program, that is pretty much all we
know," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Quinn, spokesman for the state Division of Budget, said many of the
details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, he said, the program would work as retroactive grants paid by
school districts as part of a new teacher's compensation package. Since the
maximum a district could pay would be $3,400 a year, a new teacher would need to
stay at a school for four years to realize full benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $3,400 figure coincides with current tuition levels at State University
of New York schools. Teachers who attended private colleges should get the same
level of benefits under the program, even if their tuition was higher, Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear whether students who did not take out tuition loans would be
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to replace schools' graying work force is a national one and has
spurred a host of incentive ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Education Association estimates 2.4 million new teachers will
be needed nationwide over the next 11 years due to retirement, attrition and
rising student enrollment.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Colucciello, superintendent of Schenectady's school district, said
his district would appreciate any statewide recruitment efforts. At least 113 of
the approximately 700 teachers in his district are eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can see that we have to start producing and encouraging young people
who are bright and able and anything we could do would help," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a three-year commitment would help the problem, Colucciello said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can keep somebody three years, they've made some kind of commitment.
They've got tenure. The feeling is 'I know the kids, they know me.' That's when
you start to get in the groove."

<HEADLINE> Package Bomb Kills Woman in Mass.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Mass. (AP) -- A package bomb exploded in a house in this Boston
suburb Thursday, killing a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   The package was left at the house around 12:30 p.m., and it exploded after
the victim brought it upstairs, said Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley.
She said she didn't believe the package was delivered by the U.S. Postal Service
because it was already there when her mail was delivered Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no reason to believe it is a random event,'' Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors and co-workers said the woman had been stalked for the past year,
and The Boston Herald quoted an investigator, who the paper did not identify, as
saying authorities were looking into the possibility that a stalker was behind
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors identified the victim as Sandra Berfield, 32, and said she worked
at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby residents were evacuated while agents from the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms investigated the scene. State police detonated the
trunk of the woman's car to make sure there wasn't a bomb inside.

<HEADLINE> Helms Seeks U.N. Reforms  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, who has made a career of lambasting
the United Nations, kept up the attack as he addressed the Security Council on
Thursday, saying Americans feel ``a lack of gratitude'' from the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., who has previously branded U.N. officials as
``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' tempered his criticism by proposing a new
spirit of cooperation with the world body and suggested formal, annual visits
between members and U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are to have a new beginning, we must endeavor to understand each
other better,'' Helms said in the first-ever address by a U.S. lawmaker to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his courtly tone and offer of a ``hand of friendship,'' delegates
reacted coolly to Helms' litany of U.N. excesses and failings.
</P>
<P>
	   American tardiness in meeting its payments and Helms' insistence on a lower
U.S. contribution ``has hindered and not helped'' peacekeeping efforts, said
Jeremy Greenstock, the British envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, complained that the United States
failed to abide by terms of a U.N. budget that all members approved. ``All the
other members of the United Nations expected the United States to keep its
word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money we spend on the U.N. is not charity,'' Helms declared. ``To the
contrary, it is an investment -- an investment from which the American people
rightly expect a return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million in back U.S. dues over three
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States paid a $100 million installment late last year. But to get
the rest, the United Nations must meet about a dozen conditions drafted by
Helms, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, and Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., the committee's senior minority member.
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions includes a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular budget from
25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms said the United Nations must also trim its spending and not draw the
United States into ``entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation, and -- I want to
be candid -- eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator also accused the General Assembly of an anti-American bias.
``The American people hear all this, they resent it. And they have grown
increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a lack of gratitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was invited to speak by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who holds
the rotating council chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the blunt exchanges, Holbrooke said he hoped Helms' appearance would
help in ``bringing to a close a chapter of great tension between Washington and
the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The full 188-member General Assembly must approve any major changes in the
organization's operations and cost-sharing formula.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms told the Security Council it had a ``mixed record'' in recent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   While it ``performed admirably'' in ending Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
in 1990-91, ``In the more recent case of Kosovo, it was paralyzed,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to
protect the Bosnian people from Serb genocide is well documented,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.'' The United Nations ``must
respect national sovereignty'' and not seek ``to impose its utopian vision of
international law on Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan met privately with Helms before the meeting and escorted him into the
chamber, but did not stay for the speech. John Ruggie, a top Annan aide, said
Annan's absence was not a snub, but that the secretary general had other
engagements.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, on ABC's ``Nightline,'' Annan said, ``What is important is that we've
established a direct contact.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to Helms' criticism that the United States has paid billions in
support of U.N. peacekeeping missions, Annan said many international U.S.
commitments are national decisions and can't be lumped in with U.N. spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms mixed his lecture with folksy charm, saying at one point that he hoped
``you have a translator here who can speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the Security Council's 14 other members spoke in response to Helms'
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your warm accent from the South was entirely understood by our
interpreters,'' said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet. ``We did hear you.... But
the idea in this house is that others must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the United Nations ``is not perfect
... but it is irreplaceable and it is there for everyone to see.'' He did
suggest agreement with Helms' views that the United Nations exhibit ``respect
for sovereignty'' and ``nonintervention in internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms spoke while seated at the head of the horseshoe-shaped Security
Council table, mostly reading from a loose-leaf notebook, sometimes banging his
hands on the table to emphasize a point. Council members looked on with little
apparent emotion.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms later told reporters none of the rebuttal comments had changed his
mind about the United Nations, but he added, smiling broadly, ``I think we have
a certain camaraderie going. Let's keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke's analysis of Helms' performance: ``It was something.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Referendum Seeks Strike End  </HEADLINE>
   By LISA J. ADAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Teachers, students and employees of Latin America's
largest university gave overwhelming support Thursday to a proposal aimed at
ending a nine-month strike that has kept hundreds of thousands of students out
of class.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum at the 286,000-student National Autonomous University and
affiliated high schools asked voters whether they support a compromise proposal
from recently appointed rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente, and whether the proposal
should be used to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   With results tallied from 852 of 930 polling stations, the rector's proposal
won support from 89 percent of teachers, 88 percent of students and 75 percent
of workers, university officials announced.
</P>
<P>
	   On the second question of whether the proposal should lead to the strike's
end, 90 percent of teachers and students, and 74 percent of workers responded
affirmatively.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 172,700 voters cast ballots at the 852 stations counted Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today with the results presented ... we can say with satisfaction that the
plebiscite, without a doubt, has given a satisfactory result for the university
community,'' de la Fuente said. ``This is a consensus that will unite us and
reconcile us.''
</P>
<P>
	   A group of increasingly radical students has kept the university and other
institutions closed since April 1999. As the strike has worn on, university
authorities have taken an increasingly hard line on the strikers' demands, which
include more student representation in university decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente's ``Proposal for a Consensus'' recommends a return to previous
tuition levels -- officials initially wanted to increase tuition from a token
few cents to the equivalent of $140 -- and the creation of a university-wide
congress to work on reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also would agree to several student demands, including that the
strikers not be punished. But it rejects others, and the strikers vehemently
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I prefer a bloodstained people to a subjugated one,'' said UNAM political
science professor and strike supporter David Navarrete, 35. ``Either you have
school for everyone or you have school for no one.''
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM officials set up polling places around the city, as well as at
university branches in 23 other Mexican states. Booths also were opened in UNAM
offices in San Antonio, Texas, and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the gates of the school, 40-year-old Melania Alviter, the mother of
a university student, threw her arms in the air and begged for divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm praying to God that he will help to solve this conflict,'' she said,
sobbing.

   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A military attack jet crashed Thursday night in
southwestern Idaho, killing an Idaho National Guard pilot on a training flight.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani maintains slight lead over Hillary Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's slight lead
over Hillary Rodham Clinton in their expected matchup for this year's U.S.
Senate race in New York is holding, according to a statewide poll.
<P>
	   Meanwhile, plans were being finalized Thursday for a visit by the first lady
on Monday to the state Capitol where she planned to meet privately with
Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani was also scheduled to be in Albany on Monday to testify at a
legislative hearing on Gov. George Pataki's proposed state budget and its impact
on localities.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, from the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, the New
York City mayor was favored by 46 percent of voters to 42 percent for the first
lady. That is statistically unchanged from Quinnipiac polls conducted in
October, November and December.

	   "Clinton and Giuliani are so well known now - with only a handful of voters
saying they don't know enough to form an opinion - that nothing in the news
seems to affect the status of their campaigns to be," Maurice Carroll, head of
the Hamden, Conn.-based polling institute, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani have formally announced their candidacies.
Mrs. Clinton said Wednesday that she will make her announcement Feb. 6. The
Republican mayor hasn't said when he will make his expected announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   In February of last year, Mrs. Clinton led Giuliani, 54 percent to 36
percent in the Quinnipiac poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest poll did find that voter favorability ratings for both Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani had gone up slightly since last month. The first lady's
rose to 37 percent, up from 32 percent in December. The mayor's favorability
rating climbed to 41 percent, up from 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The unfavorability ratings for both remained relatively high, 36 percent for
her and 30 percent for him.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mrs. Clinton led Giuliani among women voters, 49 percent to 38
percent, the mayor was ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent, among white women. Male
voters favored the mayor, 54 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 812 registered voters was conducted Jan. 11-17 and has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results came out a day after Giuliani reported raising $8.8 million
over the past six months. Aides to Mrs. Clinton said she had raised about $8
million.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 94, Grizzlies 89  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 18 of his 32 points
in the third quarter as the Utah Jazz improved to 17-0 all-time against the
Vancouver Grizzlies with a 94-89 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Byron Russell scored 25 and John Stockton had 12 assists as the Jazz bounced
back from Wednesday's 91-88 loss to Minnesota with their ninth win in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone, who went 8-for-10 from the field in the third quarter, also pulled
down 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Bibby and Othella Harrington each had 22 points for the Grizzlies, who
lost their fourth straight game, and sixth straight at home. Bibby added nine
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz pulled out the victory despite Vancouver's 9-2 run which cut Utah's
lead to 90-89 when Shareef Abdur-Rahim hit an eight-foot hook shot from the
right post with 18.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Russell, who finished 6-for-11 from the free-throw line, sealed the victory
by sinking two foul shots on Utah's next possession.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies' last chance to tie the game ended when Bibby threw up a wild
and awkward 3-point attempt which banged off the backboard and into Howard
Eisley's hands.
</P>
<P>
	   After managing just 37 points in the first half, the Jazz got hot in the
third quarter, going 15-for-20 from the field while outscoring the Grizzlies
34-25 to take a 71-64 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Malone carried the load in the second half, hitting shots from all over the
floor.
</P>
<P>
	   With Utah trailing 60-59, it was Malone who put the Jazz ahead for good,
sinking a 16-footer with 3:22 remaining in the third quarter. That basket
sparked a 12-4 run, which was capped by Malone when he sank a nine-footer at the
right baseline while falling backwards with 45 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz won despite a poor first half in which they hit 48 percent of their
shots, but only managed 37 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies set a franchise record in holding the Jazz scoreless during a
span of 6:53. After Quincy Lewis hit a nine-foot jumper putting Utah ahead 25-18
with 28.8 seconds left in the first quarter, the Jazz didn't score another point
until a Greg Ostertag dunk with 5:34 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver went on an 11-0 run during that span.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver limited the Jazz to 12 points in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Arizona 76, No. 25 UCLA 61  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Wright scored 22 points and Gilbert Arenas added
18 as No. 2 Arizona defeated No. 25 UCLA 76-61 Thursday night for its seventh
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Wright, one of only three Wildcats to previously play in Pauley Pavilion,
dominated the low post in the first half with 14 points. Arenas, a freshman from
nearby North Hollywood, scored 15 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats (16-2, 5-0 Pac-10) also got 20 points from Jason Gardner, who
along with Arenas makes up Arizona's freshmen backcourt.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona freshman Luke Walton made his second career start playing for the
first time at his father's alma mater. The younger Walton doesn't shoot much and
he went scoreless, with four assists and three turnovers in 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Walton, who led UCLA to two NCAA titles and 30-0 seasons in 1972 and
'73, was in the stands to hear fans chant "Dad's house" at his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerome Moiso led the Bruins (10-5, 1-3) with 22 points. His basket early in
the second half tied the game at 32 before Arizona went on a 28-13 run for a
60-45 lead with 5:41 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Twice during their run the Wildcats had 7-0 spurts as the Bruins wasted
possessions with turnovers and missed shots, including an airball by Earl
Watson.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA regrouped for a 12-3 scoring run, helped by consecutive 3-pointers from
Jason Kapono and a three-point play by reserve Billy Knight, to trail 63-57 with
3:30 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all the Bruins could muster, with Watson, Dan Gadzuric, Kapono,
Moiso and Rico Hines in foul trouble and continued carelessness with the ball
that led to 26 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins trailed by just two at halftime despite missing all 11 3-point
attempts and never getting to the free-throw line in the first half when the
Wildcats had only three fouls.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA didn't get to the foul line for the first time until there was five
minutes left in the game. The Bruins finished 2 of 4 on free throws and were 3
of 21 from 3-point range.

Moon Creeps Into Earth's Shadow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Across the Western Hemisphere wherever there wasn't a
curtain of clouds, one of the greatest shows on Earth played overhead Thursday
night. Starting about 9:30 p.m. EST with a shadow along its left edge, the moon
began moving toward total eclipse as it crept into Earth's shadow. The darkest
phase, when the moon climbed to its height over the East Coast, was to end at
12:22 a.m. EST Friday. The moon was expected to leave Earth's shadow at 2:24
a.m. EST. Snow spoiled the viewing in some places, especially in the Northeast.
And in much of the North, temperatures dipped into single digits or below,
turning eclipse watching into a test of hardiness.

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Three American church leaders met with Elian Gonzalez's
grandmothers late Thursday night, a step that could lead to their traveling to
the United States to argue for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba. The custody
fight over Elian took a new turn earlier in the day as the grandmothers obtained
visas from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba for U.S. travel. The women were
expected to fly to New York on Friday, apparently escorted by the church group.
They hoped to return home with Elian, according to congressional sources.

Columbine Library To Be Replaced
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- School board officials voted late Thursday to replace
the Columbine High School library where two students gunned down their
classmates in the nation's deadliest school shooting. A group of Columbine
students and parents has proposed raising $3.5 million to tear down the current
library, replace it with an atrium and build a new wing with a new library. Ten
Columbine students were killed in the library before gunmen Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold took their own lives during the April massacre. Two other students
and a teacher were killed outside the library. The school was reopened in the
fall, but the library has been sealed.

Elsewhere, Ahmed Ressam, the man accused of trying to smuggle the explosives

ending a nine-month strike that has kept hundreds of thousands of students out
of class. The referendum at the 286,000-student National Autonomous University
and affiliated high schools asked voters whether they support a compromise
proposal from recently appointed rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente, and whether the
proposal should be used to end the strike. With results tallied from 852 of 930
polling stations, the rector's proposal won support from 89 percent of teachers,
88 percent of students and 75 percent of workers, university officials

the Federal Correctional Institute at Lompoc on Friday, must keep his hands off
all computers, software, modems, cell phones, Internet-connected televisions and
any other electronic devices that would give him access to the Internet. Mitnick

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darryl Sydor and Brett Hull scored second-period
power-play goals as Dallas beat Los Angeles 5-2 Thursday night, the Stars' 10th
straight victory over the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano and Blake Sloan each had a goal and two assists and Richard
Matvichuk assisted on three goals as the Stars extended their unbeaten streak
against the Kings to 21 games (15-0-6).
</P>
<P>
	   The streak matches Dallas' longest unbeaten stretch against any opponent.
The Stars were 17-0-4 against the Kings from March 31, 1970 through Dec. 11,
1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Garry Galley scored for the Kings, Marko Tuomainen added a short-handed goal
and Sean O'Donnell had two assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas, which also got a goal and assist from Brenden Morrow, has won 39
consecutive games when scoring at least three goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamie Storr stopped Modano on a breakaway 8 1-2 minutes into the first
period, keeping the game scoreless until Sydor's power-play goal at 3:18 of the
second.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal was Sydor's sixth of the season and second in 18 career games
against his former team.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings, who have allowed at least one power-play goal in 13 of 15 games,
surrendered another one after Aki Berg was sent off for holding.
</P>
<P>
	   Hull carried the puck unchecked from the left boards to the slot and sent a
20-foot wrist shot past Storr for his 16th goal and 602nd of his career, ending
a six-game drought.
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Muller recorded his 900th NHL point with an assist on Hull's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Sloan made it 3-0 at 3:17 of the third, but the Kings scored just 23 seconds
later on Garry Galley's 25-foot slap shot off Ed Belfour's blocker.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles closed to 3-2 with 12:24 to play, as Tuomainen beat Belfour
through the pads from 15 feet out at the end of a two-on-one break while
short-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   But Modano got another breakaway and beat Storr to the glove side, with 5:11
remaining, for his 17th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   The last Kings victory against Dallas was a 3-2 decision on April 6, 1995 at
the Forum.

<HEADLINE> US Issues Visas to Elian's Grandmas  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Three American church leaders met with Elian Gonzalez's
grandmothers late Thursday night, a step that could lead to their traveling to
the United States to argue for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The custody fight over Elian took a new turn earlier in the day as the
grandmothers obtained visas from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba for U.S.
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation from the National Council of Church arrived in Havana in the
evening and began meeting with the Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana shortly
before midnight at the Havana offices of the Cuban Council of Churches. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, however, neither the grandmothers nor the church leaders
would confirm if the women would fly to New York. The two women refused to
answer journalists questions as they left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very delicate situation,'' the council's general-secretary, Bob
Edgar, told journalists. When asked for further details, he said only, ``Keep us
in your prayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, congressional sources said the women were expected to fly to
New York on Friday, apparently escorted by the church group. Democratic Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York, who has offered to accompany the boy to Cuba,
planned to meet with the women. They hoped to return home with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   These sources said New York was chosen as a destination because the welcome
there would be far friendlier than in Miami, where Elian has been living with
relatives for almost two months and where sentiment for his remaining in the
United States is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, National Council of Churches spokeswoman Sara Vilankulu said
the three council representatives arrived in Havana aboard a chartered plane
around 6 p.m. EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials did not permit reporters access to the plane or its
passengers, and neither the church delegation nor Cuban officials spoke with the
media Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a shipwreck in late November. The boat on which he was
heading for south Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States refused to return Elian immediately to Cuba, aggravating
the already hostile relationship between Washington and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family is pleased about the grandmothers' visit and hopes Elian will
get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, said the boy knows his grandmothers
might be coming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
Elian must to be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team filed a lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's
due-process rights and asked the judge to prevent the agency from returning the
boy before it gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts insist that Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal standing
because their rights do not trump those of his father, his closest relative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative,'' said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the University of Miami. ``That is the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside because of his ties to both sides. U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a
daughter who works for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez also has ties to the Florida judge who ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until March, working as a political consultant for Miami-Dade
County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign. She said
she was not required to remove herself from the case because of the affiliation,
a suggestion made by a legal expert.

<HEADLINE> Little Rock Recovering From Tornado  </HEADLINE>
   By KRISTEN EVERETT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A historic section of Little Rock torn apart by a
series of deadly tornadoes a year ago is on its way back. It's been anything but
easy.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding craftsmen with the skill to recreate intricate wood work and other
touches has been difficult. Also complicating matters has been the search for
clay roofing tiles, bubble glass and other materials for 100-year-old houses.
</P>
<P>
	   In frustration, some homeowners have moved, while others have opted for
modern building materials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A major concern is finding people with the skill and expertise to make the
repairs,'' said Anne Gutherie, Historic Preservation Administrator for Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   Fred Nelson, a contractor, is among those who moved. He said he recognized a
good deal -- $27,000 for a home that needed $200,000 in repairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You talk to craftsman and you find out they either don't understand how to
work on an old house or are not dependable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago today, 56 tornadoes hit Arkansas, a one-day record. Eight people
were killed, dozens were injured and 375 structures in the five-square-mile
Quapaw area were damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The area encompasses five national historic districts and includes the
Governor's Mansion, which lost many of its oak trees.
</P>
<P>
	   The district's homes, churches and commercial buildings in the area are
Victorian, Queen Anne and Spanish Colonel Revival style.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the features needing replacement are clay tile or slate rooftops,
chimneys with brick laid in decorative patterns and glass made 100 years ago
which had ripples and bubbles. The roof on a home called the Villa Marre had
colored slate found only in quarries in New England and Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who have been able to help is Becky Witsell, who does historic
stenciling and finishing. She was recreating ceiling patterns on the Villa Marre
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I try and get in the mind of the craftsman who did it the first time,''
she says, ``then plan for how it'll all be put back.''
</P>
<P>
	   She says restoring the decor in a historic home includes a lot of research
-- tracing patterns, matching colors and even looking at paint samples under a
microscope.
</P>
<P>
	   On other buildings, historic trim has been fabricated, with copper used
instead of wood to replace some rooftop ornaments.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if some details haven't been recreated exactly, many appreciate the
restoration efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important not only to the people who live here but to everyone in
this city,'' said Sarah Brown, executive director of The Landmark Trust of
Greater Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When visitors come here they want to know something about the character of
the place represented in its buildings.''

<HEADLINE> Valujet Case May Not Come to Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- State murder charges against SabreTech in the ValuJet crash
may never come to trial because of the defunct jet repair company's finances, a
prosecutor says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After the federal sentencing, I don't know what's going to be left,''
Assistant State Attorney Gary Winston said Thursday in court. Circuit Judge
Ronald Dresnick set Oct. 23 for the murder trial to begin.
</P>
<P>
	   SabreTech faces a $4.5 million fine after last month's federal hazardous
materials conviction and has no deep pockets to pay in that case, defense
attorney Martin Raskin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the numbers are not public, we've maintained for a very long time
that SabreTech was driven out of business and there is no big pot of gold,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum penalty for the corporation in the murder case over the deaths
of 110 people in the Everglades crash would be a $1.5 million fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Winston said the state is prepared to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is less about the money and more about the point. The point is
airline safety,'' he said outside court. ``No one else should ever feel that
their life is in danger by going on an airline that's transporting hazardous
waste illegally.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sentencing is expected this spring in the federal case, which produced
guilty verdicts against the company on eight counts of causing the
transportation of hazardous materials and one count of failing to provide
training in handling hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
	   SabreTech failed to install safety caps on and improperly packed
explosive-tipped oxygen generators blamed for causing a cargo fire on the DC-9
that crashed May 11, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Racial Profiling Claims Hit Ill.  </HEADLINE>
   By KATE N. GROSSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. (AP) -- Until now, this community of sprawling homes and
upscale boutiques on the shore of Lake Michigan has always embraced its
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chicago suburb has all the trappings of wealth and exclusivity --
average incomes in the six figures and one of the world's most famous residents
in Michael Jordan -- but it prides itself most on a liberal tradition and
diverse population.
</P>
<P>
	   But now a federal lawsuit is calling the city's image into question,
charging the police chief and 10 of his commanders with racial profiling,
sexism, anti-Semitism, union busting and falsifying records.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit accuses the chief of stopping motorists for being ``black,
Mexican, poor or stupid,'' and claims the department tried to limit the number
of blacks in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few years, allegations of racial profiling have become
increasingly common nationwide. Cases in New Jersey and Maryland have drawn the
interest of the U.S. Justice Department and bolstered claims of widespread
targeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, this case stands out. Not only are the charges leveled in a city that
brags about its access to public housing and wins awards for fair housing
practices, but they come from an unusual source -- five current and former
officers of the police department itself, all of whom are white.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (the police) want to portray an image of the city as safe and equal
for all, but that's not how it is,'' said patrolman Rodney Watt, among those who
filed the lawsuit. ``You could be driving through town and you could be harassed
and that's not right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officers defending their department portray the lawsuit as nothing more than
a trumped-up labor grievance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This lawsuit is a sham and a feeble attempt to extort money from the
city,'' said Detective Carl Weaver. ``They decided to invent the issues of race,
gangs, anti-Semitism, corruption and cover-up to pique the interest of the
media.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer representing the accused officers said they deny any wrongdoing.
The defendants aren't not talking about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   But some city residents are quick to speak up: ``Don't lend this more
credibility than it deserves,'' said Robert Mills, who has volunteered with the
police for years.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the City Council last week that he has never seen the police target
minorities. ``I'm proud to be associated with the Police Department,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed more than a year ago and it was vague and brief,
alleging discrimination because of union affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   It was amended in November to include some of the more inflammatory
material, accusing 11 officers with a ``series of schemes'' meant to control the
department and ``deprive the plaintiffs, ethnic and racial minorities and
females of their civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations became public earlier this month when 12 police employees
filed affidavits in support of some of the lawsuit's claims.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials have since voted to hire an independent counsel to
investigate and the police chief has arranged to meet with some minority
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the allegations are proven or not, there is a growing public
perception that there is some truth to them.
</P>
<P>
	   At a recent council meeting, several blacks and Hispanics recounted their
experiences. Among them was Jordan's wife, Juanita.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to be embarrassed for my family and friends who visit us here
and are pulled over for no other reason than they are black,'' Mrs. Jordan said.
``We are all being naive to think it's not happening here because it happens
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ralph Ledford, 27, said he was stopped up to three times a week during his
last years of high school and has been subjected to numerous police pat-downs.
He says officers held a gun to his head on more than one occasion. He remembers
receiving a ticket only once during that time -- for speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It felt like we were always on trial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ledford and his mother, Karen, 49, said they are relieved to see racial
profiling finally come under public scrutiny and are hopeful Highland Park will
be the better for it.
</P>
<P>
	   The family chose to live in Highland Park because of its diversity, but Mrs.
Ledford said that spirit certainly is not universal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't delude yourself into thinking this community is free of racism,''
she told the council last week. ``It is by far not free of racism.''

<HEADLINE> Advocates say what mayor calls help can actually harms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As winter weather continues to chill the city, advocates
for the homeless say that Giuliani administration policies may hurt the homeless
more than they help.
<P>
	   Their most recent ammunition: A sweep early Wednesday in which police
arrested 129 people seeking shelter from the 20-below-zero wind-chill.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates and some politicians fear the raids - which occurred at 4 a.m. in
nine shelters citywide - will mean that at least some of the city's 22,586
people who seek shelter each night will simply avoid help in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, at least two homeless people have died in the city from
overexposure during the recent cold snap.
</P>
<P>
	   "The administration seems to be giving homeless people an ultimatum: Freeze
or face jail," Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields said Thursday.
"There will undoubtedly be some people who will be afraid to go to shelters and
will be in grave danger of freezing to death."
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Police Department said that of the 129 arrests, six were
felonies, including robbery and forgery. Many of the others arrested had
outstanding bench warrants for minor violations, including public urination.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said Thursday that police made the arrests because the homeless
people were suspected of violating various laws, and further, that the arrests
will help make shelters safer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's the reality the advocates have to face: "There are some homeless
people that are criminals. Not all. Not most. Not a majority," said Giuliani. "I
can't ignore that. I'm the mayor of the city. I can't ignore the fact that among
homeless people are some dangerous criminals and some, not so dangerous, but
still criminals."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say that they are particularly concerned by the raids
because they come after two other highly publicized initiatives: A city plan to
deny shelter to able-bodied, mentally stable homeless people who refuse to work
and a homeless crackdown that led to hundreds of arrests and referrals to
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The work-for-shelter requirement - which is currently held up in court - has
a provision that allows the city to take children away from parents who refuse
to comply with the rules, including working. However, a judge must approve the
removal of any children from families.
</P>
<P>
	   After his homeless policies generated outrage, Giuliani has more recently
sought to explain the initiatives as "compassionate" and "loving."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say that without adequate housing and drug treatment
programs, the mayor's homeless policies are cruel.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, in the 1990s, the city and state funded the "New York New
York" initiative which built 5,000 units of housing for low income city
residents. A subsequent agreement however, calls for building only 1,500 units
over the next five years. And after several years of declining numbers of
homeless people, advocates say the numbers are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
	   The middle-of-the-night raid to arrest minor offenders, say advocates, only
makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is part of a series of very punitive policies on the part of the
Giuliani administration," said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst for the
Coalition for the Homeless.

<HEADLINE> Bradley: Heart Issue Irrelevant  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley says repeated episodes of
irregular heartbeats in the last month are irrelevant to his Democratic
presidential campaign, and some sympathetic backers appeared willing to give him
the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   But they made clear that any health issues must be explained -- quickly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know some athletes who live to be 100 because they're in such good
shape,'' said Fred Mathews, of Mount Pleasant. ``I would be concerned, but I
would want to hear his explanation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes before his fourth rally of the day Thursday, the 56-year-old Bradley
disclosed to reporters that he has suffered four irregular heartbeat episodes
since revealing the non-life-threatening condition last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tense campaign staffers were waiting to see how the news would play out
after its delivery just four days before Iowa voters make the first statement on
the presidential campaign in precinct caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After an impromptu news conference, where he took only a few questions,
Bradley proceeded with the rally. Afterward, some of those who attended said
they were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have two sons who are doctors, and they don't think that's a problem,''
Mount Pleasant resident Bob Stafford said of Bradley's condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Rich, also of Mount Pleasant, said she suffers a similar condition,
and conceded the emotional impact of admitting a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be a little scary until you understand it,'' she said. ``I, like a
lot of people, have irregular heartbeats.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest disclosures raise questions about timing and candor as candidates
address health issues. The former New Jersey senator has suffered from the heart
ailment since 1998, but disclosed it last month only after it forced him off the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Thursday he would only make such episodes public if they
required a doctor's intervention, and he bristled at suggestions that the
condition hampered his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign released the information in response to an inquiry from ABC
News.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't think we needed to disclose it,'' Bradley said. ``If I have to
see a doctor or if there has to be any medical attention given to it you will
hear about it immediately. Otherwise it's just the nature of the particular
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   He vowed to continue the campaign without alteration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has absolutely no impact on the race or my capacity to have a schedule
or the intensity of campaigning,'' Bradley said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the episodes are ``regular and predictable,'' although he conceded
that four in a month is more than he's used to. ``It's more frequent than I've
had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   While loyal backers at Thursday's rally were supportive, the timing of the
disclosure was awkward. Bradley's rival, Vice President Al Gore, leads in all
polls in Iowa. It's far from clear how the episode will play out over the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign aide Anita Dunn said Bradley had not seen his doctors, but had
contacted them about the episodes, which began shortly after Christmas, around
Dec. 26-28. The most recent occurrences came on Jan. 6, Jan. 9 and Sunday, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all of very short duration,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley takes four doses of an anti-arrhythmic drug called Procanbid twice
daily and the irregular heartbeat almost never occurs when he regularly takes
the medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn said doctors are ``not sure why'' he's experiencing irregular
heartbeats, but have voiced no concern and have not recommended any change in
medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was examined at a California hospital on Dec. 10 for the chronic
condition that he previously has dismissed as ``just a nuisance.'' Doctors found
no other problems.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer says his client is not cooperating with prosecutors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn man accused of helping an Algerian try to
smuggle explosives into the United States pleaded innocent in Manhattan, as an
alleged accomplice appeared in a Canadian court.
<P>
	   On Thursday, Abdel Ghani Meskini pleaded innocent in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan to charges of providing and concealing support for Ahmed Ressam, an
Algerian national accused of trying to sneak explosives into the United States
just before New Year's.
</P>
<P>
	   Several hours later, Meskini's lawyer, Roland Thau, sought to dispel rumors
his client was cooperating with investigators, saying Meskini hadn't spoken to
law enforcement officials since Thau began representing him, a few hours after
his Dec. 30 arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Thau said prosecutors have told him Meskini, 31, made statements after the
arrest, adding it was possible that "cops coerced some kind of statement from
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, appeared in Superior Court
in Montreal on Thursday for the start of court proceedings aimed at bringing him
to New York. He has been indicted on the same charges as Meskini.
</P>
<P>
	   Thau said any statement made by Meskini would likely have been to declare
his innocence or explain why he traveled to Seattle the week Ressam was arrested
in Port Angeles, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 on explosives smuggling charges after he
allegedly tried to smuggle timing devices and a powerful demolition explosive
called RDX into Washington from Canada. The arrest increased fears of terrorism
planned to coincide with millennium celebrations, but no such attack
materialized.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was formally indicted on federal terrorism conspiracy charges by a
Seattle grand jury on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, federal prosecutors allege Haouari asked Meskini to travel
to Seattle to meet Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment against Haouari and Meskini accuses them of conspiring since
October 1997 to support members and associates of a terrorist group. Haouari
allegedly provided various forged identification documents while Meskini went to
Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, court documents and statements by authorities have not indicated
exactly what the alleged terrorists had planned to do, or how many of them were
involved. Suspects in the case have been linked to the Armed Islamic Group,
known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
	   According to documents filed in Montreal courts, Haouari said he fled to
Canada in 1993 because he was wanted by military police in Algeria over his
involvement with the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. He said he left the
group in 1992 because "it is against my principles and religion to use any form
of violence."
</P>
<P>
	   In denying bail to Haouari on Thursday, Judge Jean-Guy Boilard ruled that
evidence indicated Haouari was a member of an Algerian terrorist group and was
involved with Ressam in a plot to bring explosives into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States "seems to have credible proof implicating the accused,"
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proof that has been revealed satisfies me that he belongs to a
terrorist organization," Boilard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also said Haouari posed a flight risk, given his history of using
false documents and credit card fraud.

    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Vlade Divac had 17 points, 12 rebounds and five
blocks as the Sacramento Kings won their seventh straight with a 111-103 victory
over the Orlando Magic on Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Democracy is stronger in Russia than New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. John McCain clearly enjoys doing things his way.
<P>
	   While the competition was trolling Iowa for votes just days before the
first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses there, McCain was riding his campaign
bus down Fifth Avenue on Thursday and pressing to get his name on New York's
primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   He accused party leaders who have challenged his petitions of making the
state less democratic than Russia. At a news conference outside the Russian
consulate, the Arizona Republican said voters in Moscow and St. Petersburg would
have a wider choice at the polls in March than those in the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot" in the March 26
presidential election, McCain said. "In New York, unless something happens,
there will be only one name on the ballot (in the March 7 primary). It seems to
me that history has been turned on its head."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes are expected to appear on the state's ballots, although others are
skipping New York altogether because of its notoriously complicated ballot
requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of New
York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required
number of signatures from party members. McCain is suing to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona state Sen. Scott Bundgaard flew from Phoenix to accuse him of
hypocrisy, saying McCain has used Arizona election laws to push his opponents
off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain went through the same process that the state party is going through
here," Bundgaard said. "If there is such a groundswell of support for John
McCain, then he should have no problems getting enough signatures."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, McCain challenged the petition signatures of a little known
opponent in the Republican primary for his Senate seat, forcing him to withdraw
from the race. And in 1992, he mounted a similar challenge to petitions filed by
another Senate opponent, former Republican Gov. Evan Mecham. McCain eventually
dropped the challenge and handily defeated Mecham.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain called Bundgaard's accusations untrue and said credible candidates
have never been removed from Arizona ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has hopped up and down the East Coast this week, raising campaign
cash from New York to Boston. He was scheduled to attend a closed fund-raiser
Thursday night at the Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO president John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said after his New York news conference that his attacks on politics
as usual are the reason party leaders oppose him in New York and around the
country. Republican leaders have lined up behind front-runner Bush in state
after state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anybody who wants the status quo in Washington doesn't want me," McCain
said. "The establishment is threatened by my candidacy and I understand that,
and I respect them all."
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed on one point with Bush, who said Thursday that their campaigns'
public sniping over McCain's tax plan wouldn't weaken the two men's friendship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course we are friends," McCain said. "He's a fine man and you're not
going to hear anything negative from me about him. He's a very good man."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says a provision in McCain's tax plan would raise taxes on workers by
$40 billion. McCain's advisers say the number is actually $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall the senator proposes cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years
and has criticized Bush's $483 billion tax cut, saying it ignores Social
Security, Medicare and the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   While competitors feverishly wooed Iowans, McCain, who has chosen not to
compete in the caucuses there, set his sights on New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
And he says he's enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's 12 days, four hours and 37 minutes before the polls close in New
Hampshire," he joked. "But who's counting?"

<HEADLINE> McCain Hits Bumps in Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was late in 1996, and GOP presidential nominee Bob
Dole longed for a friendly face as he flew around the country with a planeload
of fighting advisers and angry reporters. So he summoned his favorite buddy from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``C'mere, McCain,'' Dole growled, and they were off.
</P>
<P>
	   But to Sen. John McCain, riding along on Dole's ``Leader's Ship'' was more
than a favor for a friend; it was a flying seminar on how -- and how not -- to
run his own White House bid four years later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dole's plane is where I really firmed up the plans,'' McCain recalled
recently, as his campaign bus rolled through New Hampshire. ``I learned a lot
about how you do something like this. A lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   No lesson, however, could have prepared him for Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
unprecedented $67 million White House bid. McCain has stumbled against the
competition on issues ranging from gays to taxes, his Commerce Committee
chairmanship and the sheer challenge of sending his staff of 85 into battle
against Bush's army of 200 aides.
</P>
<P>
	   While trailing Bush elsewhere in the country, McCain has tied or surpassed
the GOP presidential front-runner in New Hampshire, home of the nation's first
primary Feb. 1. And that status as a serious challenger, McCain says, paints a
big target on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you see a campaign get traction, it gets very tough,'' he said
earlier this month. ``I have every reason to think it's gonna get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   It has, and McCain has nearly hit his own bull's-eye more than once.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the key lessons he says he learned from Dole is that if reporters
want access to the candidate, give them more than they can use.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Dole, whose aides tried to stem the flow of gaffes by keeping him at
a distance, thus angering reporters, McCain sits at the center of his traveling
press corps whenever he is on the bus in between campaign stops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kill 'em with access,'' the Arizona senator says, with a wink.
</P>
<P>
	   But his blunt-spoken style and a bawdy sense of humor makes such
freewheeling risky, as McCain has learned. He was criticized for saying this
week that he can tell ``by behavior and by attitudes'' whether a person is
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
	   He later promised to stick to a more disciplined answer. ``I intended to
say, 'don't ask, don't tell.' That's how I'll answer it from now on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another lesson from Dole, McCain said, was to make sure that he, the
candidate, makes the major campaign decisions rather than leaving them to aides
and consultants.
</P>
<P>
	   But as McCain is learning, that's not always possible with an expanding, but
still badly outnumbered staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Bush bluffed McCain into releasing details of his
tax-cut plan as it was being written.
</P>
<P>
	   A week before McCain had planned a Jan. 11 announcement, Bush slammed a
proposal McCain had put forward last year to help end the budget standoff
between Congress and President Clinton. McCain was forced to correct the record
with elements of the yet-to-be-released tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But the correction contained what McCain later admitted was a ``cheap shot''
at Bush, a press release handed out at the back of a room as McCain stood up
front appealing for a contest free of personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain's Mature Vision for America's Future vs. Bush's Political Plan for
the 2000 Election,'' read the headline. McCain's denunciation of the flier
didn't stop his campaign from posting it on his Web site later that day.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also has caused his own problems by participating in the same
campaign finance system he has condemned during his crusade to end big money's
influence over government.
</P>
<P>
	   As Senate Commerce Committee Chairman, McCain has written letters to federal
agencies on behalf of major contributors, prompting criticism that their money
has bought them more access, just like the contributors of other senators.
</P>
<P>
	   And he also has come under fire for accepting favors, ranging from private
jet travel to fund-raisers, from companies overseen by the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says he has only prodded federal agencies to act, not on which
decision to make. ``We're all tainted by the process,'' he says repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain says he cannot avoid the appearance of conflict arising from his
committee chairmanship because the panel regulates more than 80 percent of the
nation's companies. To stay in business as a politician, he says, he has to play
within the system until he succeeds in changing it.

<HEADLINE> Mesic's Folksy Style New in Croatia  </HEADLINE>
   By SNJEZANA VUKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Smiling and joking, Stipe Mesic wanders into cafes,
mingles with the people. ``I'm just like you,'' he says, assuring them that if
they elect him president he's ready to work for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic's folksy campaign style is nothing new in the West. But it's a novelty
in Croatia, which for nine years was ruled by President Franjo Tudjman's iron
hand until his death on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Croats seem to love the change Mesic presents. A longshot only three weeks
ago, the 65-year-old former member of Yugoslavia's rotating presidency now leads
the other eight candidates in all opinion polls ahead of Monday's presidential
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   He's greeted like a superstar when he campaigns across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analyst Davor Butkovic calls Mesic's rise ``the biggest political
surprise'' of the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He often made wrong judgments, didn't have a clear vision of Croatia's
political future, and, after all, he was largely unsuccessful in his political
career,'' Butkovic said of Mesic's record.
</P>
<P>
	   For many Croats, though, none of that seems to matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not arrogant or vain,'' psychologist Mirjana Krizmanic said. ``People
feel that he would not hold on to the power with his teeth and nails -- which is
so different to what they've seen so far. That obviously suits them at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman was fond of an imperial style of leadership, often barking at his
opponents, looking down at his people from the pedestal reserved for the man who
led the country to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   After Tudjman's death, Croats voted his party from power in the Jan. 3
parliamentary elections, and replaced it with the center-left, Western-oriented
opposition coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   According to polls, Croats have also turned their backs on the presidential
candidate of Tudjman's party, Mate Granic. Surveys also indicate they prefer
Mesic to the ruling coalition's co-leader, Drazen Budisa. The coalition includes
the Social Democrats and Social Liberals.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic's laid-back manner and wit make him the complete opposite of Tudjman.
And that seems to be the secret of his unexpected appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Budisa is offering another serious and a very demanding country. Right or
not, people believe Mesic is still so playful that, even if he would want to, he
could never be Tudjman,'' said Drazen Vukov Colic, a political analyst for the
independent newspaper Novi list.
</P>
<P>
	   With so many candidates, no one is expected to win in the first round, since
the winner must obtain an absolute majority. For the runoff, scheduled for Feb.
7, analysts believe Mesic must convince the voters he is more than just
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic is no stranger to politics. He represented Croatia on the Yugoslav
collective presidency as the federation began disintegrating in 1990. He became
a close aide to Tudjman, but fell out with him in 1994 over Croatia's aggressive
policies in Bosnia during the war there.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, his role in Croatian politics has been small. His People's Party
barely won enough votes to enter parliament. But he was always around, giving
interviews to independent media in which he sharply criticized Tudjman's
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fancy a coffee with the president? Let's go,'' a Mesic campaign ad says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll sell Tudjman's aircraft and the 'herd''' of government-owned luxury
cars, he tells voters, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
	   He has a message for Croats in neighboring Bosnia, whom Tudjman cultivated
as a source of support. ``They will have to work and make their own money,''
Mesic said. ``They cannot live on the backs of Croatian taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic accuses Tudjman's associates of ``plunder, war profiteering and mafia
deals.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rest assured,'' he told a crowd at a recent rally. ``The new government
will not steal anymore -- the old one took it all.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Debate Abortion  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PELLA, Iowa (AP) -- While working hard to turn out the vote in Monday's
caucuses, George W. Bush is having to explain his views on abortion in a state
where morality matters while fending off attacks on the issue from his
conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential front-runner said Thursday that if the daughter
of a friend or relative were raped and asked him about abortion, he would hope
to respond with sympathy but would advise that ``it's up to her'' whether to end
the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion,
``was a reach,'' and that he ``would not be inclined to accept'' government
approval of abortion-inducing medicines such as the French pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's abortion,'' Bush told reporters during a news conference at Central
College where he was bombarded by abortion questions and, later, criticism from
his rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes told reporters after touring an abortion-counseling center that
the procedure can leave women emotionally scarred, and he accused Bush of not
doing enough to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What all this underscores is that it's not enough just to say one is
pro-life,'' Forbes told reporters at the Aid to Women center in Cedar Rapids.
``You have to find ways to move people, even if it's just step-by-step, toward
your goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rival Alan Keyes reacted with surprise to Bush's comments on Roe vs. Wade.
``He's just realizing this? Oh my gosh,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he has reached this conclusion for the sake of political expediency,
then I hope it's too late,'' Keyes said before an appearance in Mason City.
``But if it reflects real conviction, then it's never too late to admit the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the Iowa caucuses on Monday, Bush is working to convert his lead in
public opinion surveys into victory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to have a nice lead in the polls. It's another thing to
have a lead when they actually show up'' at caucus sites, the Texas governor
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, Keyes and conservative activist Gary Bauer are trying to distinguish
themselves from Bush in the eyes of conservative voters by elevating the
abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Moral issues have great sway over voters, particularly in the year after
President Clinton's impeachment trial for his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody wants to get rid of excessive taxation, but to me morality is
important because it's the heart and core of the nation. If everybody is on the
wrong end morally, we can't expect good things to happen,'' Marlys Driesen, 49,
a second-shift worker at the local Pella window factory, said after hearing
Bush's speech at Central College.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to tap into such sentiment, Forbes is running TV ads in the state
featuring women who insist that fetuses are people deserving of the legal
protections he advocates. Bauer and Keyes are also running abortion ads.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, Bush routinely says he would not impose an abortion litmus
test on nominees to the Supreme Court and would appoint only ``strict
constructionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   But while he opposes abortion, Bush says he would make exceptions in three
instances: when a woman becomes pregnant through rape or incest, or when
delivering a baby would jeopardize her life.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking with reporters after the speech, Bush defined a strict
constructionist as a jurist who ``doesn't use the opportunity of the
Constitution to pass legislation or legislate from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what such a judge would think about Roe vs. Wade, Bush said: ``Roe vs.
Wade was a reach, overstepped the constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned.
I would remind you I'm not a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether the ruling would be in jeopardy because he believes it is
a ``reach'' legally, and because he would appoint only strict constructionists
to the bench, he replied: ``I'm going to name strict constructionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when asked what he would tell a friend's or relative's child if they
were raped and sought his about abortion, Bush said: ``I would say, first of
all, I believe in three exceptions when it comes to abortion. But I would say, I
would hope I would be able to evoke enough sympathy from a rape case that I
could help comfort her as a friend.''

<HEADLINE> Indictment returned against top Wall Street executive and porn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A lawyer says a top Wall Street executive will plead
innocent to allegations he engaged in insider trading with an X-rated movie star
with whom he was allegedly intimately involved.
<P>
	   An indictment returned Thursday named James McDermott Jr., the former CEO at
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, and Kathryn Gannon, known as "Marylin Star" in the
adult film industry.
</P>
<P>
	   A third defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio, was also charged. McDermott, 48, of
Briarcliff Manor and Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., have already been
arrested and freed on bail. Ms. Gannon, 30, of Miami, Fla., remains a fugitive
and is believed to be in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Denis McInerney, a lawyer for McDermott, said: "Mr. McDermott will be
pleading not guilty to the charges in this indictment and we look forward to the
opportunity to address these allegations in court."
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for Ms. Gannon did not immediately return a telephone message for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York investment bank chief was accused of tipping Ms. Gannon about
companies on the verge of mergers that would dramatically affect their stock
prices. Ms. Gannon then allegedly bought the stocks and shared the information
with Pomponio, a friend who also allegedly cashed in.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, McDermott, 48, who is married, was intimately
involved with Ms. Gannon while the insider trading was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   Pomponio allegedly told investigators that Ms. Gannon worked in adult films
and as a prostitute. He said her New York City clients included "well connected
Wall Street types" such as lawyers and stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment accused McDermott of stealing confidential information from
his company and its clients and feeding the information about six potential or
actual mergers to Ms. Gannon, who then told Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the trio made more than $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods had been scheduled to go public with a stock
offering last spring but withdrew the plans suddenly in May. According to court
papers, the offering was canceled after McDermott told the company's directors
that a friend of his - apparently Ms. Gannon - was being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for trading in stocks he had recommended to
her.
</P>
<P>
	   McDermott, Ms. Gannon and Pomponio were each charged by U.S. Attorney Mary
Jo White with conspiracy and securities fraud. Pomponio also was charged with
perjury. A separate civil complaint was brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   McDermott resigned from the bank in June. He remains free on $1 million bail
while Pomponio is free on $50,000 bail. Both have declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Nixon Tapes To Be Distributed  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For years, Americans have read transcripts of President
Nixon's secretly recorded tapes. Now, they will be hearing hear his baritone
voice on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will listen to him in class. Historians, Nixon buffs and writers
across the nation will play and replay his voice at home, or maybe in the car.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Archives today was beginning to distribute cassettes of some of
the president's tapes -- at $18 a pop.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, the public only could listen to them if they went to the archives
in College Park, Md. Copying was prohibited. So, besides a few bootleg tapes
illegally broadcast years ago and snippets of recordings played in court and at
Nixon's California library, the tapes have not been aired publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've heard Johnson's voice on tape, Kennedy's voice, but the most famous
tapes -- the Nixon tapes -- the public really has never had the opportunity to
hear his voice on tape,'' said Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Listeners will hear coffee cups clinking on saucers, the pounding of desks
and clearing of throats. They will hear the famous ``smoking gun'' conversation
about Watergate that led to Nixon's resignation. They will listen to the
infamous tape erasure -- a full 18 1/2 minutes of buzzes and clicks. They will
hear the chat between Nixon and former White House counsel John Dean, who tells
the president: ``We have a cancer -- within -- close to the presidency that's
growing.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I certainly think the American public has a right to hear this material.
Those tapes are what resulted in Richard Nixon resigning from office. And while
they know the content, they really sound much different than they read,'' said
Dean, now an investment banker in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nixon kinda growls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon secretly recorded 3,700 hours of tape. So far, 264 hours of Watergate
and ``abuse of government power'' tapes can be purchased. These contain
conversations about the break-in and bugging of the Democratic National
Committee headquarters in the Watergate in 1972, subsequent cover-up and
wrongdoing by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nixon estate believes the tapes should be heard in context -- in
chronological order.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, there should be less focus on Watergate and more on the
Democratic Congress' decisions during the communist takeover of South Vietnam,
said John Taylor, director of the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation
in Yorba Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is the real scandal of the Vietnam and Watergate era,'' he said.
``When the (baby) boomers move on and stop celebrating their great antiwar
achievements, history will look anew at the era and it won't matter what order
the materials were released.''
</P>
<P>
	   The archives began taking tape orders late last year. Today, it was
distributing the first batch -- 12 1/2 hours of tapes played during Watergate
trials in the mid-1970s. The entire set of trial tapes costs $702.
</P>
<P>
	   The tapes cost $18 for each 30-minute recording. Prices are set to cover the
cost of copying and packaging tapes. The archives will not profit from the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, about 50 orders have been placed by the news media, historians,
universities and individuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Beam, director of the Edmund S. Muskie Archives at Bates College
in Maine, plans to put them in the college library and play them students he
teaches at the University of Southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC News bought a complete set and planned to begin airing them Friday on
``Nightline,'' said producer Jon Ebinger.
</P>
<P>
	   C-SPAN, which in February 1998 began airing President Johnson's White House
tapes on the radio and its Web site, is waiting to assess the quality of the
Nixon tapes before deciding how to use them, said history producer Maura Pierce.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers, earphones clamped to their heads, have spent years listening to
the tapes, trying to decipher every last word. One historian, who is directing a
project to transcribe all known presidential recordings, thinks that with more
ears listening, the tapes will yield new information about Nixon's presidency.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Could Visit US  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Three American church leaders met with Elian Gonzalez's
grandmothers late Thursday night, a step that could lead to their traveling to
the United States to argue for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The custody fight over Elian took a new turn earlier in the day as the
grandmothers obtained visas from the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba for U.S.
travel.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegation from the National Council of Church arrived in Havana in the
evening and began meeting with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana shortly
before midnight at the Havana offices of the Cuban Council of Churches. Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, also attended.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, however, neither the grandmothers nor the church leaders
would confirm if the women would fly to New York. The two women refused to
answer journalists questions as they left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very delicate situation,'' the U.S. council's general-secretary,
Bob Edgar, told journalists. When asked for further details, he said only,
``Keep us in your prayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, congressional sources said the women were expected to fly to
New York on Friday, apparently escorted by the church group. Democratic Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York, who has offered to accompany the boy to Cuba,
planned to meet with the women. They hoped to return home with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   These sources said New York was chosen as a destination because the welcome
there would be far friendlier than in Miami, where Elian has been living with
relatives for almost two months and where sentiment for his remaining in the
United States is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, National Council of Churches spokeswoman Sara Vilankulu said
the three council representatives arrived in Havana aboard a chartered plane
around 6 p.m. EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a shipwreck in late November. The boat on which he was
heading for south Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States refused to return Elian immediately to Cuba, aggravating
the already hostile relationship between Washington and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family is pleased about the grandmothers' visit and hopes Elian will
get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that
the boy knows his grandmothers might be coming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
Elian must to be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team filed a lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's
due-process rights and asked the judge to prevent the agency from returning the
boy before it gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts insist that Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal standing
because their rights do not trump those of his father, his closest relative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative,'' said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the University of Miami. ``That is the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside because of his ties to both sides. U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a
daughter who works for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez also has ties to the Florida judge who ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until March, working as a political consultant for Miami-Dade
County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign. She said
she was not required to remove herself from the case because of the affiliation,
a suggestion made by a legal expert.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Nixon Tapes for Sale  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   On June 23, 1972, President Nixon and his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman,
propose having the CIA ask the FBI to halt its investigation into the Watergate
break-in by claiming that it was a national security operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: When you get these people (in) say `Look, the problem is that this
will open the whole, the whole Bay of Pigs thing ... and that they should call
the FBI in and say that we wish for the country, don't go any further into this
case period.'
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On Sept. 15, 1972, three months after the break-in, Nixon talks to former
White House Counsel John Dean about bugging in political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: (Arizona Sen. Barry) Goldwater put it in context. He said `Well, for
Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else.' We know that.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean: That was priceless.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: Well, it's true. It happens to be totally true. ... We were bugged in
'68 on the plane and bugged in '62, even running for governor. Goddamnedest
thing you ever saw.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On March 17, 1973, Nixon discusses Watergate with Dean.
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: I stayed miles away from it so I didn't know even if there was a
White House involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean: Well, there was, ah, you know, there was a preliminary discussion of
setting up an intelligence operation ...
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean: I came back from a meeting ... and told Bob (Haldeman) that if there's
something like that going on, we've got to stay two miles away from it, 10 miles
away from it because it just is not right and we can't have any part of it. Bob
said I agree and he'll have no part of it. That was where I thought it was
turned off and the next thing I heard was that, that was this, the break-in on
June 17 (1972).
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon: You didn't hear any discussion of bugging did you, in that, your
meetings? Or did you?
</P>
<P>
	   Dean: Yeah. I did.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Mideast Compromise  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Again offering his help, President Clinton's advice to
the Palestinians and Israel is to compromise and settle for less than 100
percent in order to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As in any process like this,'' Clinton said as he met Thursday with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, ``there must be inevitable and difficult
compromises. No one can get everything that either side wants.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are faced with a Feb. 13
deadline for an outline of an accord, but all key issues separating them remain
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm convinced we can get there and I'm convinced that Chairman Arafat is
proceeding in great good faith,'' Clinton said at a picture-taking session in
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials made no statement after the hour-long meeting, and
there was no indication what a frustrated Clinton administration may do to try
to hasten a settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Israel-Syrian track, meanwhile, talks are suspended indefinitely. But
Clinton told reporters: ``I think they'll both have something to say about that
before long. I think they'll keep working right along.''
</P>
<P>
	   And, he said, differences between Israel and Syria are ``more bridgeable
than I would have thought by now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat concurred in Clinton's statement that the issues between him and
Barak were difficult. However, he ducked when asked if he was willing to
compromise, as Clinton had suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   With evident satisfaction, meanwhile, Arafat said he had reached agreement
with Barak for Israel to transfer another 6.1 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Within two weeks, we will receive the 6 percent,'' Arafat said. ``This is
something Prime Minister Barak and I agreed to 24 or 48 hours before arriving.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat and Barak met outside Tel Aviv on Monday to implement Israel's
commitment to turn over the territory under a U.S.-brokered agreement between
the two leaders in September.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear from Arafat's remark whether the two sides had resolved
exactly what land Israel would surrender.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting with Clinton, the Palestinian leader said he had asked for
Clinton's help to assure successful negotiations. ``It was a very fruitful and
productive and important meeting,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Clinton's support, Barak and Arafat last year set Feb. 13 as the
deadline for resolving their disputes over Palestinian statehood aspirations and
the future of Jerusalem, at least to the extent that Israel and the Palestinian
Authority could complete a framework accord.
</P>
<P>
	   A final settlement, which also would deal with refugees and other issues, is
due in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton on Thursday said ``the resolution of the issues between Palestinians
and Israelis is at the core of the comprehensive effort that we all want to make
for peace throughout the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement backed up a long-standing Palestinian view.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Boost in Science Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will seek a $2.8 billion boost in basic
scientific and medical research to spur economic growth and enhance health for
Americans in the 21st century, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech today at the California Institute of Technology, Clinton was
announcing that his administration's budget for fiscal 2001 would include a
major new investment in the 21st Century Research Fund aimed at boosting
research in several critical fields, including cancer, diabetes and AIDS, and
promoting development of super-fast computer technology.
</P>
<P>
	   While in the Los Angeles area, Clinton also planned to host a pair of
fund-raising events to benefit the Democratic National Committee. He may also
get in a round or two of golf.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, Clinton, administration officials and allies on Capitol Hill
have been disclosing pieces of the 2001 budget that the president will present
to Congress on Feb. 7. Details of Clinton's research-investment proposal were
made available by White House officials who commented on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will tell his Cal Tech audience that a new investment in basic
research of the magnitude he proposes is an important step in assuring U.S.
prosperity in the 21st century and will lead to longer and healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the new proposal include:
</P>
<P>
	   --A $1 billion increase in biomedical research at the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
	   --A $675 million increase in spending for the National Science Foundation. A
White House official said, that if approved, the new spending level will
``double the largest dollar increase ever in the history of the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   --$475 million for a nanotechnology initiative. This could lead, the White
House official said, ``to the ability to store the contents of the Library of
Congress in a device the size of a sugar cube.'' Nanotechnology is a new field
that proponents hope will lead to the development of atom-sized devices and
machines.
</P>
<P>
	   --More than $500 million for information technology research. The White
House official said this could lead to the development of a super-fast super
computer that could predict tornadoes and hurricanes more rapidly and have other
important practical applications.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Across the Western Hemisphere wherever there wasn't a

night: a total eclipse of the moon. Starting about 9:30 p.m. EST with a shadow
along its left edge, the moon began moving toward total eclipse as it crept into
Earth's shadow. The darkest phase, when the moon climbed to its height over the
East Coast, was to end at 12:22 a.m. EST Friday. The moon was expected to leave
Earth's shadow at 2:24 a.m. EST. Duke Johnson, planetarium director at SciWorks

library, replace it with an atrium and build a new wing with a new library. Ten

Weak Euro Gets Little Attention

turn instead to the strong yen in advance of Saturday's G7 meetings. A weak euro
has become a fact of life in economic circles, and many analysts say that is not
a bad thing as long as the U.S. economy stays on the fast track and European
growth continues slowly. "The euro is weakening because it needs to do that,"

<HEADLINE> Fleming Triumphs in Strauss Opera  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE SILVERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Renee Fleming added another memorable portrayal to her
gallery of Metropolitan Opera heroines, singing the Marschallin in the first
revival in five years of Richard Strauss' bittersweet comedy "Der
Rosenkavalier."
</P>
<P>
	   The role of the Viennese princess who generously gives up her lover to a
younger woman is a touchstone of the soprano repertory, a part that is both
vocally gratifying and psychologically challenging.
</P>
<P>
	   At Thursday's opening performance Fleming was in lustrous voice and, in her
Act 1 monologue, brought an exceptional poignancy to her character's musings on
the inevitability of growing old.
</P>
<P>
	   The American soprano can seem to do no wrong these days. Last season she
triumphed in two vastly different roles at the Met, the Countess in Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro" and the title character in Carlisle Floyd's "Susannah."
The season before that she was hailed for her interpretation of the title role
in Massenet's "Manon." And earlier this season she revived Charpentier's
"Louise" in San Francisco and Handel's "Alcina" in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest of the "Rosenkavalier" cast was largely the same as five years ago.
Mezzo Susan Graham, in the "trousers" role of the Marschallin's lover, Octavian,
sang with complete assurance and thrilling warmth and power. As Sophie, the
young girl who wins Octavian's heart, Heidi Grant Murphy used her sweetly
tremulous soprano to charming effect.
</P>
<P>
	   When the three women joined in the Act 3 trio, the climax of the opera,
their voices floated magically through the house.
</P>
<P>
	   No "Rosenkavalier" can be a complete success without a strong bass in the
part of the boorish Baron Ochs, the Marschallin's cousin who wants to marry
Sophie for her money. Franz Hawlata, a much younger Ochs than usual, sang
splendidly and brought out qualities that are often missing from the role -- a
charming self-assurance and a certain sexual menace.
</P>
<P>
	   The production by Nathaniel Merrill with sets and costumes by Robert O'Hearn
dates from 1969, making it one of the very oldest in the Met repertory. And it's
still one of the best, especially the glorious Act 2 setting inside the ornate
palace of Sophie's father.
</P>
<P>
	   The orchestra, buoyantly conducted by James Levine, played Strauss'
difficult score with precision and great spirit.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Make Waves Over Sea-Monkeys  </HEADLINE>
   By LISA ORKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Sea-Monkeys may be getting into hot water in Greece.
</P>
<P>
	   The tiny aquatic creatures -- which have attained a cult-kitsch status in
the United States and elsewhere -- are the subject of a serious probe into a
question that has fascinated children for decades: What are these things?
</P>
<P>
	   Amid concerns over marketing the product to children, a parliament member
has demanded a Development Ministry inquiry into the biology of the Sea-Monkey
-- the trademark name for the flea-like nymphs that have flitted around
countless bowls and juice glasses since they first appeared in stores in 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, they are a type of brine shrimp that exist naturally in high
saline ecosystems -- such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. They can survive for
long periods in dry eggs and hatch when immersed in warm, salty water. Their
recent arrival in Greece, though, has made some people nervous, and prompted
some to ask: Are they real? Have they been genetically modified? Should they be
sold to children as toys?
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is the ministry going to do to protect the little consumers?'' asked
Maria Damanaki, deputy of the small Left Coalition party, during a parliament
session Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministry is expected to give its report Monday, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, toy shop owners are being peppered with questions by reporters
and parents are fretting over children's demands to have their own Sea-Monkey
kit, which were introduced in Greece shortly before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   The importers are bemused.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are facing it with humor,'' said Apostolos Vakakis, president and chief
executive officer of Primo Toys, which imports Sea-Monkeys, marketed in Greece
as ``Thalasopsihoules,'' or ``Little Sea Souls.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sea-Monkeys began as just another ``miracle'' science toy in the
post-Sputnik age. But they quickly took its place in the annals of marketing
puffery: the packaging showing cuddly and frolicking ``Sea-Monkeys'' when in
fact all you got was a lot of little translucent shrimp.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Sea-Monkeys have reached a nostalgia nirvana among Baby Boomers, along
with such icons Lava Lamps and Brady Bunch reruns. Clubs and Internet sites are
dedicated to Sea-Monkeys.
</P>
<P>
	   ExploraToy, which markets Sea-Monkeys and related paraphernalia, offers such
accessories as a watch that can be loaded with Sea Monkey-filled water or a
glow-in-the dark Ghostly Galleon for the creatures to swim around their
typically brief existence. A colony of Sea-Monkeys can reproduce and survive for
up to two years with meticulous care and feeding, according to the company based
in Carson, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ExploraToy spokeswoman Vicki Sweetser said she could not remember any other
government intervening in Sea-Monkey sales.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It certainly seems unusual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Greek officials learn what Sea-Monkeys are, other complications may
emerge.
</P>
<P>
	   A ``live organism being used as a game ... brings an ethical problem,'' said
Christina Papanikolaou, consumer general secretary. This means there could be
restrictions on Sea-Monkeys being marketed as a toy. Even the Greek chapter of
the environmental group Greenpeace has said it could throw its weight behind
Sea-Monkey rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Vakakis said the toy is as harmless as a goldfish in a bowl. ``What ethical
problem could there be?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greece has very strict laws regarding marketing to children. Television
advertisements for toys are banned until the evening after most young children
are asleep.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Meets With Taliban  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The most senior U.S. official to visit Pakistan
since an army coup met representatives of Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on
Thursday, apparently to press for the expulsion of suspected terrorist Osama bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither side released details about the meeting between U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and Taliban administrative head Amir Khan
Muttaqi and Saeed Mohammed Haqqani, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan,
according to the Taliban-run Radio Shariat.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting came on the first day of Inderfurth's visit to Pakistan, which
ends Saturday. During his stay, he will be pressing Pakistan's army leadership
on issues of terrorism, tensions with nuclear neighbor India and a return to
civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Inderfurth met Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed,
who ``reaffirmed Pakistan's unequivocal opposition to terrorism,'' according to
a Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
	   That visit also focused on the Taliban, who consider Pakistan a close ally.
Washington imposed sanctions against the ruling religious army early last year
and has demanded they hand over bin Laden for trial either in the United States
or a third country. The U.S. also is offering a $5 million reward for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   When Inderfurth meets with the country's military ruler Gen. Pervez
Musharraf on Friday, he is expected to press for the closure of the Pakistani
offices of militant Islamic groups such as Harakat-ul Mujahedeen, the successor
to Harakat-ul Ansar, which was declared a terrorist group by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   A member of Harakat-ul Mujahedeen, Maulana Masood Azhar, was one of three
pro-Kashmiri militants freed by India to end last month's eight-day highjacking
drama in southern Afghanistan. The handover secured the release of 155
passengers and crew aboard the Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Another key issue is the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.
Both countries lay claim to the region, which is split between the two hostile
neighbors. Kashmir shot to international prominence last year after India and
Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and declared themselves nuclear weapons states.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan's foreign ministry is pressing the U.S. to get involved in finding
a peaceful solution to the 52-year-old Kashmir conflict, but India has refused
international mediation by any country.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the hijacking, India and Pakistan have been waging a fierce war of
words that U.S. officials visiting the region have warned could escalate into a
military conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Pakistan of orchestrating the hijacking, a charge vehemently
denied by Islamabad, which says New Delhi is trying to cover up its botched
handling of the incident and isolate Pakistan internationally before the March
visit of President Clinton to South Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, Washington said Pakistan would probably be withdrawn from Clinton's
South Asian agenda, which is to include India and Bangladesh, because of the
army takeover in October. But both sides said there has been no final decision.

<HEADLINE> Candidates on School Vouchers  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press asks the presidential candidates a
question on the issues. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   School Vouchers
</P>
<P>
	   Do you support allowing parents in areas that are poor or with bad schools
to use tax money to subsidize private education?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I do not support any measures that divert funding from
public to private schools. I am strongly committed to improving our public
schools and have offered a specific plan to address four critical needs:
creating early learning centers and significantly increasing funds for Head
Start so that kids are ready to learn when they start school; hiring 60,000 new,
high quality teachers per year for urban areas; funding for new after-school
programs; and strengthening lifelong-learning programs through new funding for
community colleges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``No. I oppose any proposal that would divert funds from our public
schools. I believe we must focus our efforts on strengthening the public schools
that serve nearly 90 percent of our nation's schoolchildren, rather than
siphoning funding away from public elementary or secondary schools through risky
schemes like vouchers to subsidize tuition at private and parochial schools. To
put it simply, I oppose vouchers because they drain important resources away
from our public schools, they provide little or no accountability for student
achievement, quality teachers or even the use of public funds, and even risk
making private and parochial schools less independent. I support greater choice
in public education, including magnet schools, charter schools and
schools-within-schools. And I think we need to roll up our sleeves and get down
to the hard work of fixing failing schools, not abandoning them and the students
in them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe in parental choice. Tax dollars for primary and secondary
education should be spent on those schools that parents choose for their
children. Vouchers, but without strings -- we don't want the government
following vouchers into religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Yes. The Milwaukee and Cleveland pilot projects have been very
encouraging, and if activist judges allow them to continue and expand, will
increase the pressure on urban public schools to improve their performance.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``My proposal says any school that receives federal Title I
funds must measure student improvement. If, after three years, student
performance does not improve, the federal funds should be given directly to the
parents to use as they see fit, including private education. Under my plan, the
federal government will no longer pay schools to cheat poor children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``As a father and a business leader, I strongly support school
choice, especially for low-income parents. No mother should be forced to send
her child to a bad school. As President, I will immediately turn federal
education funds into block grants for states and local communities with this
directive: Give parents the freedom to choose schools that work -- public,
private and parochial. I will champion educational savings accounts, opportunity
scholarships, vouchers, tuition tax credits, home schooling, charter schools,
dramatic expansion of faith-based schools and fast-track teacher certification
to bring business and retired military professionals into K-12 math and science
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``Yes. I support local communities who wish to undertake
programs for school choice and charter schools. We should do what we can to
assist our public schools, but we should never allow children to get trapped in
poorly performing schools. Why must children be the ones who suffer if their
schools are failing them? It is important, however, that choice and charter
school initiatives be locally designed and initiated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Yes. Parents should be able to use their tax dollars to send
their children to the school of their choice, public or private. Tuition
vouchers would give low-income families the same choice as better-off families,
and instill competition among schools to promote excellence in education. I have
proposed an initiative to empower lower- and middle-income parents whose
children attend our poorest performing schools with the ability to place their
children in the best learning environment for their particular needs. This $5.4
billion plan would fund a nationwide test of school vouchers without diverting
funds from the public school system, because it is paid for entirely by
eliminating inequitable and unnecessary corporate subsidies for the ethanol,
sugar, oil and gas industries.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Playing on Emotion in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- As the presidential race here heads into the final
weekend, Vice President Al Gore wants Iowa Democrats to feel ``dissed'' -- or
disrespected -- by his rival, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has seized on a comment Bradley made earlier this week in New Hampshire
-- that the Iowa caucuses Monday night reward the vice president's ``entrenched
power'' -- in an attempt to provoke his troops into a rebellion-sized turnout.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was focusing today on a trio of get-out-the-vote meetings with his
own supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is popular among Iowa Democrats, were jointly
showcasing the vice president's health care agenda in a noontime forum at Mercy
Medical Center in Des Moines. The Gore camp hoped the joint appearance would be
seen as a quasi-endorsement from the officially neutral Vilsack.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore's focus rested on Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   In two noisy rallies in western Iowa, Gore accused Bradley of committing ``a
disservice to Iowa'' when he suggested that any lead the vice president enjoys
here is due to the ``entrenched power'' of his backers in the Democratic Party
establishment and labor union hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fighting for family farmers, fighting for pharmaceutical benefits for
seniors, fighting for improvements in our schools -- that's not entrenched
power. That's fighting for people,'' Gore roared to an audience of several
hundred in the Sioux City Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Several supporters forming the backdrop for news cameras aimed at Gore were
equipped with posters mocking Bradley's words. ``I am a Mom and I have the
power,'' read one. Another: ``I am a teacher and I have the power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told reporters he respects Iowans and was ``absolutely not,
absolutely not,'' in the words of Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, ``dissing'' the
state's political processes. Aides eagerly reminded reporters of comments Gore
made during his failed 1988 presidential bid, when he described the Iowa contest
as ``an arcane procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president has the backing of President Clinton, ``most of the
Democratic National Committee officialdom and most of the Democratic Party
fund-raisers, has the backing of the leadership of organized labor and rides in
Air Force II. That is entrenched power,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Gore, who worries that complacency will keep his supporters home
Monday night, was hoping for a backlash against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is attacking grassroots activists who are playing a very important role
in choosing the next president,'' said Steve Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa campaign
director. ``Senator Bradley is doing nothing but firing up our troops to go out
and work harder.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some union organizers for Gore doubted the potency of this strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernie Kinsella, a railroad worker and union caucus coordinator, said he may
be insulted by Bradley's comment but, with only one hour's sleep in the last 2
1/2 days, ``As far as me working harder for Gore, I don't know if that's
possible.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No plans for the weekend?
</P>
<P>
	   Stay tuned to the C-SPAN cable channel for nonstop coverage of the
presidential campaign in Iowa, where the first votes will be tallied Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the weekend, the channel will offer live and taped events
featuring all of presidential candidates, and its daily call-in program,
``Washington Journal,'' also will originate from the Hawkeye State.
</P>
<P>
	   And the programming won't stop on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, C-SPAN plans to broadcast live from a caucus site -- the
Kate Mitchell Elementary School in Ames, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable channel is planning another ``All Politics'' weekend Jan. 29-31,
before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BY THE NUMBERS:
</P>
<P>
	   55,875 -- Square miles in Iowa, the 23rd largest state.
</P>
<P>
	   8,969 -- Square miles in New Hampshire, the 44th largest state.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   VOTER'S VOICE:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want somebody in the White House who has the morals, and we love his
Dad. We're hoping the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I want somebody that
my children can look up to and be proud of.'' -- Judi Duggan, 32, of Dubuque,
Iowa, who brought her 9-year-old and 5-year-old children out in the blowing snow
and face-reddening wind Wednesday night to hear Gov. George W. Bush and shake
his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate and Sen. Bob Dole reached across the
generational divide in New Hampshire by appearing on the original ``Animal
House'' and taking a mystery tour of sorts aboard MTV's ``Choose or Lose''
campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not the age of the man. It's the man for the age,'' Dole, at 72, the
oldest presidential candidate, told MTV's Tabitha Soren in an on-the-bus
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in his usual crisp white shirt and dark suit, Dole sat for an hour
in the leopard-patterned interior of the bus as it rolled across the New
Hampshire countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THURSDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley told Iowa senior citizens
that reform of the nation's health care system is now inevitable because his
campaign took ``the risk of leadership'' and put the issue on the political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in Iowa, Republican candidate Gov. George W. Bush defended an ad he is
running against rival Sen. John McCain's tax plan, saying it is ``not a personal
attack by any stretch of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rival Steve Forbes criticized Bush for saying that if a relative were raped,
any decision about having an abortion would ultimately be ``up to her.'' Forbes
blasted Bush for the answer, saying it is ``not enough just to say one is
pro-life.'' Gary Bauer accused Forbes of stealing his issues and words.
</P>
<P>
	   And in a blow to Democratic hopes of regaining the majority in the Senate,
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., announced he would not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   FRIDAY'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the presidential candidates continue their focus on Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley holds a ``Get to Caucus'' event to encourage supporters to vote
for him on Monday. Vice President Al Gore appears at a Des Moines hospital with
Gov. Tom Vilsack.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush meets supporters and walks the streets of several towns. Gary
Bauer discusses farm policy in Huxley, Sen. Orrin Hatch visits a Des Moines
hospital and Steve Forbes continues his bus tour of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain, who is not competing in Iowa, will be in the South
Carolina cities of Orangeburg and Hilton Head.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-U.S. Radio Wants Elian To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH HASTINGS AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Next, the news. But first, a wish for the death of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Radio Mambi, WAQI-AM, is the largest Cuban-American station in Florida. It
is also accused of being the most opinionated and insulting, militant even, but
few dispute its power to galvanize and mobilize much of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   There's not much that Radio Mambi won't embrace or deride. In the midst of
the Elian Gonzalez maelstrom, it screams the loudest to keep him on American
soil. It also plays upbeat jingles advocating Castro's death.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, when news broke that Elian's grandmothers had obtained visas
enabling them to travel from Cuba to America, news director Armando Perez-Roura
lost no time taking aim.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I don't understand is how the grandmother of Elian acts so cold in
interviews when she talks about her daughter, who not too long ago died in the
ocean as tragic as she did,'' he told listeners.
</P>
<P>
	   Six-year-old Elian lost his mother in November, after their boat sank in the
Florida Straits. Of 14 onboard, only Elian and two adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the boy has lived in a virtual fish bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   His great-uncle has refused to return him to Cuba, where his father waits.
On Wednesday, attorneys for Elian's Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit
seeking to block the Immigration and Naturalization Service from sending him
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the plight of a brown-eyed, brown-haired, little boy has become a
national peep show.
</P>
<P>
	   Cameras flash when he goes to class. They flash again when he trudges home,
pulling a school bag on wheels almost as tall as he is.
</P>
<P>
	   In the middle of it all is Radio Mambi and its 50,000 watts of power.
Announcers recently helped push hundreds of Cubans into the streets, blocking
traffic and paralyzing downtown Miami, all in the name of keeping Elian here.
</P>
<P>
	   If his grandmothers take him home, Perez-Roura said on the air Thursday, the
Cuban government ``will use him. They will make him hate his mother. They will
make him into a monster.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the station's rhetoric nor its influence goes unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radio Mambi unabashedly, and proudly, gives news from a certain slant. And
that is anti-Castro and anti-Cuba,'' said Dario Moreno, professor of political
science at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are not listening to objective news in the U.S. tradition of
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The station has about 55,000 listeners, Perez-Roura said. Though its
audience has declined in recent years, it remains the most popular Cuban radio
station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They represent the most powerful segment of the community, and that's the
political segment,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Francisco Aruca, a frequent critic of anti-Castro groups, calls Radio Mambi
announcers ``fanatics.'' He favors returning Elian to Cuba and also is a
talk-show host at two much smaller radio stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people are not fighting for Elian's welfare. They are fighting
because they are neck-deep in a battle they didn't realize would be so
difficult,'' Aruca said.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez-Roura makes no apologies: ``I live in a democracy where we have the
right to speak our mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radio Mambi listeners are intensely loyal and unwilling to forget,
particularly the revolution 40 years ago that put Castro and communism in charge
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami's Domino Park in Little Havana, old men slam green-and-white tiles
on outdoor tables. Efrain Rodriguez, 72, believes every word spoken by
Perez-Roura.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The veins continue running with Cuban blood when I listen to Radio
Mambi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   What about criticism that the station is biased and incendiary?
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think they push people, they are just transmitting information on
what is going on,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with Fidel being bad, bad,
bad. That is the obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday evening, callers were eager to air their opinions of Elian's
grandmothers, even though both women are strangers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If those grandmothers really loved him, they would let him stay,'' said
one caller.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they take the child they will have to kill all of us old people who are
going to throw ourselves into the street,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't be fooled by the hyperbole. Radio Mambi does not represent all of Dade
County's 780,000 Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when a crisis hits,'' Moreno said, ``we all listen to it.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> 'Hordes' Surround Bradley in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTUMWA, Iowa (AP) -- Frances Gordon is a spunky sort, but not much of a
match for the horde that descended on the 2nd Street Cafe tagging along after
Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I need some stilts,'' said the exasperated Ms. Gordon, huddling behind a
bank of cameras and boom microphones. ``I've got a good question to ask him,
too.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state's reputation as a bastion of down-home, grassroots politicking is
getting a serious test as the leadoff precinct caucuses near. The horde, as it's
known, surrounding the leading candidates is getting nearly unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't long ago that Democratic presidential candidate Bradley was
rattling around the state in a van virtually alone, but that was hard to imagine
at the 2nd Street Cafe.
</P>
<P>
	   About 50 reporters jammed into the bistro, with attendant television
cameras, jangling cellular telephones and the typical jostling and shoving that
accompanies the beast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish they had a little bit more structure here,'' said Marlys
Breon-Drish. ``It would be nice to get closer to him.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley enters the room, he first must work his way past a bank of
cameras before reaching a real voter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a problem,'' said Bradley. ``You just have to push through and take
your time going in.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley ascended a hastily constructed stage, he stared out at a wall of
journalists, with voters far behind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For those of you who are behind the Fourth Estate, I can see you,''
Bradley joked. ``I'll get over to you.''
</P>
<P>
	   To get a sense of the scene, understand that the 2nd Street Cafe is
something short of expansive. To be precise, there are three booths, a counter
and nine tables. A few months ago, Bradley could have sat in the cafe with eight
or nine folks and chatted for an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Chatting at this event amounted to television producers shouting into
phones, and satellite trucks maneuvering around the front door.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Iowans are an unfailingly polite and patient bunch, and most took
things in stride.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll get close enough to him,'' said Terry Denefe, who recalled a visit
last summer from Vice President Al Gore. ``We got a chance to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Parry had made the trek from Drakesville -- about 20 miles -- and he
was watching the chaos with bemusement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of exciting,'' he said. ``It's so unusual in Ottumwa, Iowa, that
it's kind of exciting.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue is complicated far beyond the confines of the cafe. Where once a
single van plowed the byways of Iowa, there are now two full-size buses and nine
vans full of staffers, plus other cars of reporters chasing along.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the support from authorities that Gore receives, that can be complex
and delay the caravan, which usually runs about an hour behind schedule.

<HEADLINE> Pro Bowl Receiver Moss Fined $40,000  </HEADLINE>
    By MARGARET TAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Pro Bowl receiver Randy Moss is getting fined a second
time for abuse of game officials; this time $40,000 for squirting a water bottle
at an official.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL said Thursday the latest fine resulted from Moss' conduct in the
Minnesota Vikings' 49-37 loss to the St. Louis Rams in an NFC divisional playoff
game Sunday. The league also confirmed Thursday that it fined Moss $10,000
earlier for excessive verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The lanky wide receiver, standing near the Minnesota bench during the fourth
quarter at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis, squirted liquid from the bottle at
field judge Jim Saracino following an incomplete pass intended for him. Vikings
spokesman Bob Hagan said the bottle most likely contained water.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis fine was high because it was the second violation this year
against Moss for abuse of game officials, the league said. The amount for a
second offense is up to the NFL commissioner.

<P>
	   Moss was fined $10,000 for excessive verbal abuse of side judge Larry Rose
during a game against the Chicago Bears on Nov. 14. In that game, Moss was
flagged after Cris Carter caught his third touchdown of the day and Moss
continued to argue with an official about a call on the previous play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Players, coaches, and other club personnel must maintain proper respect for
game officials at all times," the NFL said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss' agent, Dante' DiTrapano, said both fines are being appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our position is that the fine is excessive and that we are in the process
of appealing it," DiTrapano said of the $40,000 penalty. He said Moss would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss acknowledged the squirting after the game, but has said little about
it. It happened after there was contact on a long pass and Moss unsuccessfully
lobbied for a defensive interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were some things going on," Moss said after the game. "I don't really
want to talk about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Moss is the third Vikings player fined this season. In November, defensive
end Duane Clemons was fined $7,500 for punching Dallas Cowboys tackle Flozell
Adams below the belt. The same month, Carter was fined $5,000 for spiking a
football that hit an official in the nose during the San Diego Chargers game.

<HEADLINE> Big Differences in AFC Title Game  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- When people tell Wayne Weaver that his
Jacksonville Jaguars have never dealt with failure in their five years of
existence, the team's chairman protests:
</P>
<P>
	   "You forget our first year. We were 4-12."
</P>
<P>
	   When everyone thinks of the Tennessee Titans, they think 8-8, 8-8 and 8-8 in
consecutive years in different stadiums before a 13-3 finish when they finally
found a home this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, the contestants in Sunday's AFC title game like to think of themselves
as underdogs working their way up in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   But the facts are different, particularly with Jacksonville, which followed
up that 4-12 freshman year with a trip to this same title game their second.
That raised expectations so high that they're viewed around here as a
disappointment after going 1-2 in the playoffs the past two seasons and 14-2
this season without beating a plus .500 team.
</P>
<P>
	   So while Tennessee, 13-3 plus two playoff wins, has already had a successful
season after those three .500 years, the Jaguars still have a chip on their
collective shoulders.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were there a little sooner than we thought and the reality of us being
just a moment away from being in The Game that soon has had a significant
bearing on us," says Michael Huyghue, the Jaguars' senior vice president for
football operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since then, we've been mindful of how precious it is to be in this
situation and the significance of having advanced this far."
</P>
<P>
	   This year, in a way, was worse.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars entered the season as the AFC favorite and were, as one team
official put it, "an uncomfortable 14-2," drawing criticism in print, on the air
and from the ubiquitous callers on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
	   The only team the Jaguars played with a winning record was Tennessee, and
they lost twice, making this game even more pivotal.
</P>
<P>
	   Before this season, Tennessee had been playing on the road for three years,
even when the team was nominally at home. So even despite a solid nucleus of
talent, the team was 8-8 for three straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the lame-duck Houston Oilers drew less than 20,000 to most of their
home games and went 6-2 on the road and 2-6 at home. The next year, their
stadium in Nashville still under construction, they played in the Liberty Bowl
in Memphis, averaged about 30,000 per home game and again went 8-8.
</P>
<P>
	   And last season, when Adelphia Coliseum remained under construction, they
played in Vanderbilt's stadium, where for some reason the Nashville fans gave
them only a lukewarm receptions. Again, they were 8-8 and considered
underachievers.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Titans fans in their new home are among the loudest in the NFL,
and they finished 13-3 and won their first two playoff games, including "the
Music City Miracle," decided on a last-second lateral-kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
	   "For three years, we were lame duck teams," said running back Eddie George,
whose 68-yard touchdown run was the key play in the playoff win over
Indianapolis. "The organization was in disarray at the time. It wasn't easy for
us to get organized and it wasn't easy to win."
</P>
<P>
	   Best of all, they got Jevon Kearse -- "the Freak"-- with the 16th overall
pick in the draft. He had 14.5 sacks, forced 10 fumbles and allowed the Titans
to play the conservative style preferred by coach Jeff Fisher -- running,
defense and field position.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Jaguars seem confident.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have every psychological edge except one -- that they beat us twice,"
Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "But we have the big one -- we're at home."

<HEADLINE> Bucs' Gruber Hasn't Decided on 2001  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Paul Gruber was already contemplating retirement, so the
prospect of this being his last NFL season didn't faze him. He just never
expected it to end with his teammates in the playoffs without him.
</P>
<P>
	   No one on Tampa Bay's roster has waited longer for an opportunity to get
into the Super Bowl than the 34-year-old offensive tackle, who broke his right
leg in the Buccaneers' regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
	   Gruber will be on the sideline when the Bucs face the St. Louis Rams in
Sunday's NFC championship game. However, he won't be in uniform, and he hasn't
decided if he'll suit up for a 13th season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't really given it much thought," he said. "Right now, I'd just like
to get healthy again and just take my time and evaluate the total situation, and
then we'll see."
</P>
<P>
	   Gruber was pass protecting when he was injured during the second half of a
victory over the Chicago Bears that clinched Tampa Bay's first NFC Central title
in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
	   While his teammates celebrated in the locker room at Soldier Field, the
cornerstone of the franchise was stretched out on a medical table in a nearby
trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of screaming fans greeted the team when they returned home, while
Gruber was met by an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs expect a full recovery after months of rehabilitation, but Gruber
isn't in a hurry to make up his mind about returning. He's only missed nine
regular-season games -- four because of injuries and five due to a contract
holdout -- while starting a club-record 183 since the Bucs picked him in the
first round of the 1988 draft.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his injury won't play into his decision. Nor will the prospect of
the Bucs, should they remain championship contenders in 2000, appearing in the
Super Bowl in their home stadium next season.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Gruber intends to weigh whether he still wants to play and still
thinks he can play well.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been around a long time and there's no guarantees. There's injuries.
There's a ton of things that could happen and this team could be completely
different next year than it is this year, so who knows what the situation will
be," Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite being on crutches, Gruber accepted coach Tony Dungy's offer to
accompany the other co-captains to midfield for the coin toss before last
weekend's playoff victory over the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
	   For Dungy, it was an easy call.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anyone symbolizes hanging in there, going through tough times and, when
things look bad, still playing hard, that's Paul," said Dungy, who also
presented the 12-year veteran with a game ball after the Bucs' 14-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Teammates said the injury was a prime example of why the Bucs (12-5) can't
take their success for granted. The Bucs are a young team with a seemingly
bright future, but they aren't assured of reaching the playoffs year after year
-- let alone the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never know when the opportunity is going to rise for you to go,"
defensive tackle Warren Sapp said. "Paul Gruber's played in this thing 12 years
and he's had two playoff games, so it doesn't happen much. The opportunity we
have now is rare, and we've created it. Now it's time for us to take advantage
of it."

<HEADLINE> Rams Have a Defense Too  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams have a defense, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe it doesn't measure up to the team's overpowering offense. Or even to
Tampa Bay's rugged defensive unit, led by NFL Defensive Player of the Year
Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
	   It does, however, deserve some credit, even if it tends to get ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   "With an offense like ours, it's understandable if people forget about our
defense," middle linebacker London Fletcher said as his team prepared for
Sunday's NFC championship game with the Buccaneers. "Hey, offense draws
everyone's attention, especially one that scores the way our offense scores.
</P>
<P>
	   "But we've got some playmakers on our defense, and we've done our share of
good things."
</P>
<P>
	   --Such as score seven times on interceptions returns, led by outside
linebacker Mike Jones and end Grant Wistrom with two apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   --Such as get a league-high 17 sacks from All-Pro end Kevin Carter. In all,
the Rams had 57 sacks, most in the conference and tied with Jacksonville for the
NFL lead.
</P>
<P>
	   --Such as rank first against the run, yielding only 74.3 yards a game. No
runner got 100 yards on the ground against them.
</P>
<P>
	   It will be the chore of Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott to break that streak.
If they can't get something going on the ground, the Bucs could be in trouble
with a rookie quarterback in Shaun King and a so-so group of receivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay's offense has been good at making even mediocre defenses such as
Washington's look intimidating. The 'Skins shut out the Bucs deep into the third
quarter last weekend before Tampa rallied, sparked by All-Pro safety John
Lynch's interception.
</P>
<P>
	   This is no mediocre average defense the Bucs will face, however. Like the
St. Louis offense, it is aggressive and fast.
</P>
<P>
	   "They make plays," Dunn said, "and when you make mistakes they take
advantage of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Bucs coach Tony Dungy, considered a defensive mastermind:
</P>
<P>
	   "The thing people do not talk that much about is they have been playing
great defense and their special teams and defense are creating field position.
This is a well-rounded team."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs have three All-Pros on their defense in Sapp, Lynch and outside
linebacker Derrick Brooks. Carter is the only one for the Rams, but they have
several topnotch defenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Fletcher, the Rams' leading tackler, is extremely active and gets to the
sidelines quickly. Jones is a ball hawk. Todd Lyght has had a strong season at
cornerback. D'Marco Farr is a run-stopper at tackle who also can penetrate the
passing pocket. Wistrom, who faces backup tackle Pete Piersen, has come on all
season and was the Rams' best defensive lineman against the Vikings in last
Sunday's victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people talk about Tampa Bay and all its Pro Bowl players and that
is a great defense," Lyght said. "We feel we are an elite defense, too."
</P>
<P>
	   Lyght emphasizes the collective skills of the unit. It might not have a Sapp
or Brooks or Lynch, but it has lots of talent.
</P>
<P>
	   "This team is bigger than one individual," he said. "We're a team. We like
each other and play for each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the way the league is and free agency, it's difficult to remain a
cohesive unit, but this team has found that."
</P>
<P>
	   Can the Bucs find enough holes in the St. Louis defense to control the ball
and keep that scintillating Rams attack off the field?
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not coming to be a foil for an unstoppable team," Dungy said.

    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- After eight winning seasons in 17 years with the
Houston-Tennessee franchise, Bruce Matthews knows there is no worse time to lose
a game than in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "All your preparation is geared toward moving on," Matthews said. "When it's
over, it hits you harder than any 2-14 season I've been through. What happens in
the regular season is, you have eight to 10 weeks to prepare for the season to
be over, so when it comes, it's no big deal."
</P>
<P>
	   With no bye week before the Super Bowl, the Titans learned their tentative
schedule for next week the day after they defeated the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when Matthews remembered how important it is to win playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't want it to end," he said. "When it does, it's going to hit you
twice as hard."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   ROAD WOES: The Jacksonville Jaguars are 30-4 at home since 1996, but three
of those losses have been to the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, coach Tom Coughlin insists that the Jaguars have a psychological edge
over the Titans in Sunday's AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   He was reminded that the Titans had handed his team its only two losses this
season. "That's their psychological edge," Coughlin replied.
</P>
<P>
	   "What's yours?" he was asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're at home," Coughlin replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Coughlin says what many people forget is that the Jaguars have won four of
five on the road against the Titans-Oilers. It's a strange phenomenon to
explain, but Coughlin has a theory.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two good football teams that have been able to take advantage of certain
things, and they just happen to have happened on the road," he said. "There are
explanations for everything. You just have to dig underneath. This year, we're
minus-5 in turnovers against the Titans, and you're not going to beat anyone
that way no matter where you're playing."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   COOL POOL: The Jaguars' defensive backs have a kangaroo court with a heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The cornerbacks and safeties have a fine pool for mistakes in practices and
games. Instead of using the proceeds for a fancy dinner or party at the end of
the season, the backs will use the money to establish a scholarship fund for a
deserving youth.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was thinking if I had to give my money for things I did wrong, it should
go to something productive," safety Donovin Darius said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defensive backs fine each other $10 for mistakes in practice and $50 for
mistakes in games.
</P>
<P>
	   The pot is now close to $3,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The players haven't worked out the exact criteria for who will qualify for
the money, but grades, athletic ability and, most of all, need, will be part of
it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will set parameters, with one being someone under the poverty level,"
Darius said. "We'll talk more about coming up with the things we feel are most
important to us. This is a chance to help someone who is primed to become
something. This is our chance to do something productive."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   PEP RALLIES AND PARTIES: The only celebration planned by the Titans will be
Sunday night at Adelphia Coliseum, win or lose. Coach Jeff Fisher said the
Titans aren't interested in pregame pep rallies like the Indianapolis Colts held
before last week's divisional playoff or some functions being held this week by
the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our fans understand what this is about. They appreciate our time here and
understand how difficult the preparation is," Fisher said. "We'll celebrate if
things go the way we hope they go.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything in between I think is a potential distraction, and I know our
fans, who've supported us all year long, realize that as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Fans are being invited to Adelphia on Sunday afternoon to watch the NFC
championship on the stadium's video screens as a warmup to when the team returns
from Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   Team officials decided to open the coliseum after up to 10,000 people
unexpectedly showed up at the airport last week to greet the Titans following
their victory over Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BRUNELL'S NUMBER: Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell insists his strained
left knee will be at 100 percent come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Tom Coughlin thinks differently.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe 90, maybe 85," Coughlin said. "I don't know what he thinks. Maybe he
thinks it's better. He knows better than I."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BALL, BALL, BALL: The Titans entered the playoffs with the best turnover
margin of any team in the postseason at plus-18. But after two playoff games,
Tennessee is minus-1, and coach Jeff Fisher wants his team to think turnovers
against Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an issue," Fisher said. "It's something we've obviously addressed
defensively. But the other side of that is we've done a pretty good job
protecting the ball against two challenging defenses the last couple of weeks."

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- If Tampa Bay wins Sunday's NFC championship game, Tony
Dungy would become the first black coach to lead a team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously there would be a lot of pride in there," Dungy said. "I think if
I got there, I'd think about Art Shell and Denny Green and Ray Rhodes and the
job that they've done and not quite getting there. I'd think about some other
guys who didn't get the opportunity to be a head coach and didn't get the chance
to get there."
</P>
<P>
	   Green, Dungy's close friend and former boss, reached the same stage of the
playoffs a year ago, but his Vikings lost to Atlanta in the NFC title game.
Shell took the Los Angeles Raiders to the AFC championship game, where they lost
to Buffalo after the 1990 season.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   WEIGHTY QUESTION: Rams offensive guard Adam Timmerman scoffed at a
suggestion that Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp is slimmer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Weight loss? Have you seen him lately?" Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sapp supposedly lost 40 pounds before the season, which helped him play
better. He won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.
</P>
<P>
	   Sapp weighs 303 pounds. Timmerman weighs in at about the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   HEAVY WORKLOAD: Here's an indication of Marshall Faulk's value to the Rams'
No. 1-rated offense: Faulk touched the ball 340 times during the season, and the
rest of the backs totaled 158.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk had only 16 touches in the 49-31 playoff victory against Minnesota
last Sunday. The rest of the Rams' backs had three.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   NOISE CONTROL: Crowd noise in the Trans World Dome figures to be a factor
in Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs are concerned enough about Shaun King receiving plays from the
bench that they're adding two speakers to the quarterback's helmet so that he
can hear wireless communications from quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen. The
Vikings did the same thing last week for Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   NO DILFER: Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer, who hasn't played since breaking
his right collarbone on Nov. 28, was officially declared out for Sunday's game.
Linebacker Al Singleton, who broke his left leg in last weekend's playoff
victory over Washington, and receiver Reidel Anthony, sidelined with a strained
quadriceps muscle, are also out.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   MORE AWARDS: Kurt Warner and Dick Vermeil received more honors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Each was given awards by The Sporting News. Warner was voted the Player of
the Year by NFL personnel directors, and the Rams quarterback edged QB Peyton
Manning of Indianapolis 9-8.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil got the Coach of the Year honor by a 14-5 margin over Jim Mora of
Indianapolis. The league's coaches vote on that award.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're a couple of very ordinary guys surrounded by extraordinary people,"
Vermeil said. "That's the only way we would win these awards.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the one the coaches vote on, and I think it's a tremendous
reflection on the contributions of an outstanding coaching staff and personnel
department. I'm the lead dog, so I get the credit. But never in my career have
the contributions of others been more important in someone receiving an award."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   KICKING WITH PAIN: Jeff Wilkins is determined to play with pain.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' kicker gritted his teeth and booted several 50-yarders indoors
Thursday, probably keeping Nick Lowery in retirement. Lowery, 43, who hasn't
kicked since 1996, was Vermeil's choice in case Wilkins, who has bothered by
tendinitis in his left knee last week, couldn't kick.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins was in a lot of pain last week and abandoned his form on a 42-yard
field goal attempt that was wobbly and wide right. On Thursday, the form was
back.
</P>
<P>
	   "It hurts, and it's going to hurt, and I guess I've accepted it, whereas in
the past we've tried to keep it from hurting," Wilkins said. "It went pretty
good, so I'm playing."
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dick Vermeil didn't think Wilkins' range would be affected on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "His leg bothered him, but he kicked well anyway," Vermeil said. "Just like
most players at most positions that play a little banged up and bruised, he's
determined to kick."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkins knows it might be a busy day because the Rams have the No. 1 offense
in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless that thing ruptures, I think I'll be able to kick as many extra
points as we need," he said. "If we score 10 (touchdowns), that'd be great."

<HEADLINE> Rams' Horne Dangerous in Playoffs  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The postseason hasn't slowed down the NFL's top kick
returner.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Horne, who scored on returns in consecutive games in the regular
season, made it three touchdowns last week in the St. Louis Rams' playoff
victory over the Minnesota Vikings. It's getting to the point where the NFC
champions (14-3) are expecting something big every game from Horne, who averaged
29.7 yards per return.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know many that are like him," special teams coach Frank Gansz said.
"He's a gifted guy. He's up there, I think, in the realm of a Mel Gray or Albert
Lewis."
</P>
<P>
	   Gansz pegged Horne, who signed as an undrafted free agent last year, as a
natural the first time he saw him.
</P>
<P>
	   "He works at it, and you could tell it from the very first day," Gansz said.
"He knows how to focus."
</P>
<P>
	   Horne set a team rookie record for kickoff return yardage with 1,306 last
year and had a 23.3-yard average. It was slow going for a time, but coach Dick
Vermeil stuck with him, and Horne rewarded the Rams with a 102-yard touchdown
return against Atlanta in November.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, he had a 97-yarder against the San Francisco 49ers in Game 4 and
a 101-yarder against Atlanta in Game 5, and both were crucial to victories. The
first gave the Rams breathing room against the 49ers, who had beaten them 17
straight times, at 35-20 in the third quarter. The second put the Rams ahead
21-7 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Horne's return against the Vikings was the biggest of the three, by far. It
came on the opening kickoff of the second half and turned a 17-14 deficit into a
21-17 lead, jump-starting a 35-point second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams set up the Vikings by returning their earlier kickoffs to the
right. This one faked right, and went to the left.
</P>
<P>
	   "To tell you the truth, one of those could have gone to the house," Horne
said. "And we were just setting them up."
</P>
<P>
	   A block by wedge-buster Andy McCollum sprung Horne for good.
</P>
<P>
	   "I kind of stumbled at first," Horne said. "Once I caught my balance I knew
nobody could catch me. All I saw was sideline."
</P>
<P>
	   Horne was the first Rams player since 1950 to return kickoffs for touchdown
on consecutive weeks. Coach Dick Vermeil said he was named a Pro Bowl second
alternate mostly because of a four-game suspension for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's paying his price by not going," Vermeil said when the teams were
announced. "Hopefully, it'll be more deeply seeded in his mind what he has to
do."
</P>
<P>
	   Gansz said Horne worked just as hard before as after the suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a bump in the road," Gansz said. "I can't say enough about him.
I'm crazy about the kid, and have been since I started working with him."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil doesn't expect the Buccaneers to squib kick on Sunday, which would
avoid long returns but basically guarantee the Rams nice field position.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what kind of confidence they have in their coverage team, but
my approach has always been to say 'Go to work, go do it,"' Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   Said Horne: "I'm hoping they're going to be brave."

<HEADLINE> Searcy Gives Jags Hope Vs. Kearse  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- In two games, Jacksonville tackle Leon Searcy
thinks he found the key to stopping Tennessee pass rusher Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to his first Pro Bowl, Searcy held Kearse to nine tackles and a
sack in two regular-season games, both won by the Titans. The sack came on a
desperation attempt at the end of the first half of the second meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   But Searcy isn't one to boast about his success against Kearse, especially
with a third meeting on tap between Tennessee and Jacksonville on Sunday in the
AFC championship game. He realizes that stopping the Titans' best player isn't
necessarily the key to beating them.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to treat The Freak like you treat Michael Jordan," Searcy said.
"Remember Jordan? Everybody used to rally around stopping Jordan and then the
rest of the guys would beat you."
</P>
<P>
	   That's precisely what happened to the Jaguars in their 41-14 defeat Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   While Kearse was running into a stone wall, linemen like Jason Fisk and Josh
Evans were plugging up run lanes, forcing fumbles and getting sacks of their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaguars center John Wade was at a loss to explain how Searcy could have so
much success while the rest of the line struggled.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only thing it might be is that Leon has been in this league for eight
years and Kearse has only been here for one," Wade said. "That's a big
difference in experience."
</P>
<P>
	   Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin seconded that opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Leon is a big powerful guy who has outstanding feet and quickness,"
Coughlin said. "He is a guy who has enough power to be able to hold off a man of
that kind of quickness, power and speed. I think you are fortunate sometimes to
control him, and we've had some success with that."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this season, the Titans considered moving Kearse, who finished the
season with 14.5 sacks, from left to right end.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move would get him away from Searcy and line him up against Ben
Coleman, who is playing left tackle for Jacksonville in place of the injured
Tony Boselli.
</P>
<P>
	   Titans coach Jeff Fisher has conceded no such plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jevon's success this year is because we've avoided the temptation to move
him, so we're going to leave him there," Fisher said. "He's going to have to
study hard and work hard and play his best game to be a factor in the pass rush
this week because of the way Leon's playing."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, this is Searcy's time of year. He came over to Jacksonville from
Pittsburgh in 1996 and has not missed the playoffs in his career. But he has
only been to one Super Bowl, a trip that resulted in a loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, he is in the limelight -- the best healthy lineman on the Jaguars
roster, the protector of Mark Brunell's blindside and one of the few who has
found a way to stop Kearse.
</P>
<P>
	   It's all great, Searcy says, as long as it's part of a return trip to the
Super Bowl and another chance for a title.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not on cloud nine about what I did earlier this season," Searcy said.
"That's what I get paid to do. Jevon is going to be a big-time star in this
league and it is definitely a day at work. He brings out my best game. I've done
well against him, but we have lost."

<HEADLINE> Kraft Posts a 65 in Hope Classic  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- During the last two months of the year when
most players were recharging their batteries, Greg Kraft was in the gym at 5
a.m., driven by past failures to win a PGA Tour event that counted.
</P>
<P>
	   The reward for his hard work did not come Thursday in the Bob Hope Classic,
where Kraft had a second straight round of 7-under 65 to take a 1-stroke lead
after 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-round tournament is ultimate birdiefest on the PGA Tour. Kraft only
has to look back one year at David Duval's final-round 59 to realize this event,
more than any, doesn't really start until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a glance at the second round, again played on four calm, sun-baked
desert courses, show how much work he has left.
</P>
<P>
	   Brent Geiberger had back-to-back eagles and birdied the last six holes for a
61, the lowest round of the tournament so far. That put him at 13-under, along
with Rich Beem (63) and Andrew Magee (65).
</P>
<P>
	   Another stroke back was a group that included Barry Cheeseman, who had a 62.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anything in the mid-60s every day keeps you in contention," Magee said.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, that's enough to give Kraft another chance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know 14-under is not going to win," he said. "I just have to keep making
birdies ... and see how far I can go; wait until the last nine holes on Sunday
and see if I'm still around, and what might happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Casey Martin might not be around to watch.
</P>
<P>
	   In his debut as the first cart-riding member of the PGA Tour, Martin
struggled again with his putter and bombed his approach over a hospitality suite
on the 18th hole of Bermuda Dunes. He managed only an even-par 71 and was 10
strokes back.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I can keep hitting it like this and make some putts, I can have a low
round," Martin said. "I'm just not putting with a lot of confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   One thing he didn't have to worry about Thursday was any tension while
playing with Richard Ferris, the chairman of the PGA Tour policy board who
testified against Martin two years ago in his federal lawsuit over the right to
ride a cart.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got a chance to know him and he's a very nice man," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the round, Martin had to call Ferris over to sign the card, and a
television camera moved in to capture the scene. Martin discreetly moved to the
left to block the camera, then rolled his eyes when more cameras moved in for
the kill.
</P>
<P>
	   "Got to be sure to get this monumental moment," Martin said, as Ferris
laughed.
</P>
<P>
	   First-round leader David Toms had one of those moments a professional dreads
when one of his amateur partners told him, "Wish I could trade my par for your
double."
</P>
<P>
	   Toms fell out of the lead with a double bogey on No. 13, but scratched out a
68 at Bermuda Dunes and was two strokes back, along with Bob Tway and J.L.
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval had a 67 at La Quinta and was at 9-under, along with Ryder Cup star
Hal Sutton. Fred Couples, in his first tournament of the year, was another shot
back.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 13 players remained over par through two rounds, including John Daly
and 70-year-old Arnold Palmer, who has missed only one Hope Classic in its
41-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   The pros play with three amateurs for the next two days, then have the final
round Sunday to themselves at Bermuda Dunes. By then, Kraft may still be around
to get rid of the bitter taste from two close calls last year.
</P>
<P>
	   At Doral, he needed a par on the 18th hole to get into a playoff. He decided
to attack the flag, chunked a 5-iron into the water and was lucky to make bogey
for second place alone. Two months later, he had a three-stroke lead at the turn
on Sunday until hitting a tree twice for double bogey and failing to give
himself a birdie chance on the 18th for a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "In both events, I wasn't playing my best golf," he said. "It's nice to know
I don't have to play perfect to win a golf tournament. I know I have to be
patient and hang in there."
</P>
<P>
	   He fought back tears at Doral, but the blown chances have served as
motivation. Kraft hasn't forgotten the sting of losing, nor does he want to.
During the offseason, he spent all but five days working out or working on his
game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to let go of that taste," he said. "When I was going to the
gym at 5 o'clock every morning and I didn't want to be there, that's what kept
me going."
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps he'll find out this week how far that will take him.

<HEADLINE> Meg Mallon Leads Naples Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- The LPGA Memorial of Naples is shaping up as a close
one.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending champion Meg Mallon was just one stroke in front after an
8-under-par 64 in the first round Thursday, and plenty of worthy contenders were
near the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider that Mallon has 11 tour victories, and the next 10 on the leader
board have combined to win 18 times -- nine of those by Chris Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Nanci Bowen and 22-year-old Colombian Marisa Baena were tied for second at
65. Nancy Scranton and rookie Jen Hanna were two shots behind Mallon, while
Johnson was three back.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowen also has one win, the 1995 Nabisco Dinah Shore, while Scranton has
two, the last in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the top players on the leader board, Mallon and Baena were two of the few
who played in the afternoon, when the wind kicked up.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked up at the board on No. 18 and everybody was finished on the leader
board, so obviously it was all from the morning," said Mallon, who played with
Kelly Robbins and Donna Andrews. "I said to Kelly and Donna, 'Was it that hard
of an afternoon?' They said 'Yes, it was.'
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just one of those zones you're in where you're not affected by
anything."
</P>
<P>
	   Scranton, who returned from shoulder surgery almost four years ago to finish
26th on the money list last year, also noticed.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're out in the morning, especially when you have it the first day,
you'd like to get a good score in," she said, "because you know the conditions
are usually better in the morning than they are in the afternoon round."
</P>
<P>
	   Baena, who played collegiately at Arizona, birdied the last three holes
after three-putting for bogey on No. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was probably 20 feet away," said Baena, who was in one of the final
groups of the day. "That really made me mad. I birdied the rest of the holes."
</P>
<P>
	   On the back nine, Mallon was 6-under, including an eagle on the par-5 No.
11.
</P>
<P>
	   The important part, though, was surviving the front nine.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to get that through that front side, especially when the wind's
blowing," said Mallon, who won last year's inaugural event by a shot over
Robbins and Helen Alfredsson. "You feel like if you get around even-par or
1-under, then you can just get kind of aggressive on the backside.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was fortunate to be 2-under. I just took off on the back."

<HEADLINE> Jury To Decide Fate of Councilman  </HEADLINE>
   By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMARILLO, Texas (AP) -- A Dallas city councilman accused of accepting more
than $36,000 in bribes from a cab company owner testified that the money didn't
influence his votes on taxi issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Lipscomb, 74, is charged with 65 counts of bribery and corruption for
accepting the monthly payments from Yellow Checker Cab Co. owner Floyd Richards.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides rested their cases Thursday, and jury deliberations were expected
to begin by tonight. Defense attorney Billy Ravkind said Lipscomb hopes, ``the
truth will set him free.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you read the indictment, you realize this case is a lot to do about
nothing,'' Ravkind said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors said payments began prior to Lipscomb's re-election in
1995 and continued until as recently as last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Lipscomb could get 265 years in prison and $16.2 million in
fines. The federal case was moved more than 300 miles to Amarillo because of
Lipscomb's prominence in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipscomb, a black civil rights activist, told the all-white jury that
accepting money, food, clothing and other benefits was a way for him to enable
people to support his civic struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged that blanks on his campaign finance reports had cast a cloud
of suspicion over him and said he put ``not applicable'' on the forms to protect
contributors. He said he did so to shield white contributors from criticism for
helping a black person, and to avoid criticism from the black community for
accepting contributions from whites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Coming from my era ... I have always made it an effort to protect the
people who have helped me in the struggle,'' he said. ``Mr. Floyd, bless his
heart. I know what my intentions were and I thought his were the same.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys tried to show the cash did not influence council votes on
taxi issues because most of those decisions were unanimous.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richards, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in exchange for his testimony
against Lipscomb, testified this week that he expected Lipscomb would vote in
his favor.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Urges Use of Polio Shots  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Children should be given polio shots instead of the oral
vaccine to avoid a tiny chance of a polio infection from the oral dose, the
government says.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer, an advisory panel concluded that the shots -- which contain the
inactive form of the polio virus -- are preferable to the oral vaccine because
of the slight risk.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed
the panel's advice as it published its annual recommended schedule of childhood
vaccinations, which guides state and local health departments and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
	   The guide also recommends children get a hepatitis A vaccine in Western
states with historically high rates of the virus: Alaska, Arizona, California,
Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Hepatitis A is a relatively mild form of the virus; most patients require no
medical care. The CDC also removed a diarrhea vaccine because it can cause bowel
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The oral polio vaccine has been used for nearly four decades and played a
major role in the elimination of polio. But because it is made with a live
virus, it causes about eight people in the United States each year to become
infected with polio.
</P>
<P>
	   The injectable vaccine, developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in the 1950s, relies on
a killed virus. Salk had long insisted his vaccine was safer, but other
scientists said it was not as effective at providing lifelong immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics said its members can continue
using their remaining supplies of the oral vaccine if given as third and fourth
doses. The first and second doses should be the injectable vaccine, the academy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Academy of Pediatrics said last month its members can continue
using their remaining supplies of the oral vaccine if given as the third and
fourth doses. The first and second doses should be the injectable vaccine, the
academy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Melinda Wharton, the CDC's chief of childhood vaccines and preventable
diseases, said the agency is investigating one report from 1998 of a child that
got polio after being given the half-oral, half-injectable schedule. She said
the case had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Gerber, a pediatrician in Bethesda, Md. and member of the
pediatrics academy's infectious diseases committee, said any such risk is
miniscule.
</P>
<P>
	   But to Informed Parents Against VAAP, a group of parents whose children
contracted vaccine-associated paralytic polio, even a miniscule chance of
infection is too much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the risk is small, why should we have any cases?'' said John
Salamone, a member of the group whose 9-year-old son contracted polio from the
oral vaccine in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Could Visit US  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- U.S. church leaders held talks with Elian Gonzalez's closest
relatives early today, but there was no word whether the boy's grandmothers
would fly to the United States to bring him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to the two grandmothers
Thursday, and there was speculation they would head to the United States with
the church delegation to appeal for the boy's repatriation to end the
international custody battle over him.
</P>
<P>
	   However, after meeting, the relatives and officials from the National
Council of Churches would not say if the women had decided to go.
</P>
<P>
	   As she left, paternal grandmother Mariela Quintana waved her finger when
journalists asked if she was going to New York. It was not clear if that meant
she would not go or did not wish to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very difficult situation,'' said Bob Edgar, the council's
general-secretary. ``We had a good visit with the family. We're going home and
get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked for more details, he would say only, ``Keep us in your prayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said before the meeting she would only go to the United States if
she could return with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami, however, have raised legal action to keep the
boy in the United States. The boy was found floating at sea in late November
after the boat on which he was heading for south Florida capsized, killing his
mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters hoped that the relatives' presence in the United States might
help convince U.S. skeptics that the family really did want the six-year-old boy
to return. Some anti-Castro activists claim the family's appeal for the boy's
return is made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   The father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who was present at the meeting in Havana,
has said he does not want to have to visit the United States to pick up his son.
Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's communist government will hinder
his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Congressional sources in Washington said the grandmothers were
expected to fly to New York today and meet with Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel
of New York. They said New York was chosen to avoid Miami, where Elian has been
living with his father's uncle for almost two months and where there were
disturbances over earlier proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated the return of
Elian to Cuba and the group's former general secretary, Joan Brown Campbell,
earlier had offered to help mediate the dispute. She took part in the meetings,
but made no comments.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned
to his father in Cuba. Elian's Miami relatives and Cuban-American activists
argue he would have a better life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle filed a lawsuit
accusing the INS of violating Elian's due-process rights and asked a judge to
prevent Elian's return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the 6-year-old in a major political battle between
President Fidel Castro's government and anti-Castro forces in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family would be pleased by a visit by the grandmothers and hopes Elian
will get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that
the boy does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside because of his ties to both sides. U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a
daughter who works for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse

<HEADLINE> Shortage of Snow Hurting Ski Resort  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT WELLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- While East digs out from the first true snowstorm of the
season, Colorado resort owners are still hoping for a regular winter -- and the
skiers that usually come with it.
</P>
<P>
	   A shortage of snow and earlier Y2K stayaways have hit ski lodges hard. And
for the second straight year, skier numbers are down in the nation's No. 1 ski
state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole industry is suffering from a snow drought,'' said John Frew,
president of Colorado Ski Country USA, noting a nearly 17 percent decrease.
``I'm just glad it wasn't any worse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before a storm moved across the Midwest and into the Northeast this week,
New England resort owners had fired up snow machines on their own barren slopes
to entice ski buffs back to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Resorts in Utah and California have also suffered as storms have tracked
north and blanketed the slopes of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Colorado, the season of discontent continues. Destination resorts
like Crested Butte have suffered the most, with the funky, southwestern area not
able to even give lift tickets away when it opened with free skiing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had such limited snow and opened five days late, and it was 60 degrees
in Denver,'' said spokeswoman Gina Kroft. Like many others, Crested Butte is
offering unprecedented deals on lodging.
</P>
<P>
	   Through Dec. 31, skier days totaled 2.2 million, down more than 440,000 from
the previous year. Last season, Colorado was down 4.2 percent overall -- its
worst showing in two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   In a good year, the state records nearly 12 million skier days. A skier day
is the equivalent of one skier or snowboarder buying and using a lift ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   From Vail to Aspen, where it rained this week, sales tax revenues are down
by double digits, hurting communities and their businesses that depend on the
money.
</P>
<P>
	   Vail Resorts reported attendance at its four ski areas was down 9 percent.
Last season, Vail was down 16 percent, and lost its title of the nation's
busiest resort to nearby Breckenridge. Meanwhile, the city of Vail, used to
having a budget surplus, has had to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Some resort operators say there's plenty of time to make up for what's been
lost. Easter comes a week later this year, and the extra day afforded by Leap
Year alone could add 75,000 skiers, according to Frew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can still have a very good season,'' said Joan Christensen, spokeswoman
for Winter Park. ``We started seeing a turnaround about the third week in
December when we started getting good snow. We were nearly full for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many people who earned time off for working on New Year's Eve are starting
to turn up, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People still very much want to ski,'' she said. ``They are just waiting
for the moment, and the moment is now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last Saturday was Winter Park's biggest day of the season with 14,000
visitors. The area has picked up considerable snow in recent weeks, and is only
2 inches off last year's snowfall. Steamboat Springs also benefited from several
mass snowfalls during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Martin Luther King weekend was the savior of the month,'' said Steve
Sheridan, owner of Performance Sports in Vail. ``Reservations at my store are up
for February and March. I think we can make some of it up.''

Elian's Grandmothers' Trip to U.S. in Doubt
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- U.S. church leaders held talks with Elian Gonzalez's closest
relatives early Friday, but there was no word whether the boy's grandmothers
would fly to the United States to bring him home to Cuba. The U.S. diplomatic
mission in Cuba issued visas to the two grandmothers Thursday, and there was
speculation they would head to the United States with the church delegation to
appeal for the boy's repatriation to end the international custody battle over
him. The relatives and officials from the National Council of Churches would not
say if the women had decided to go. As she left, paternal grandmother Mariela
Quintana waved her finger when journalists asked if she was going to New York.
It was not clear if that meant she would not go or did not wish to comment.

Clinton Urges Mideast Compromise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Again offering his help, President Clinton's advice to
the Palestinians and Israel is to compromise and settle for less than 100
percent in order to reach a settlement. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak are faced with a Feb. 13 deadline for an
outline of an accord, but all key issues separating them remain unresolved. On
the Israel-Syrian track, meanwhile, talks are suspended indefinitely. But
Clinton told reporters: "I think they'll both have something to say about that
before long. I think they'll keep working right along."

Attempt at New Austria Govt. Fails
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Attempts to form a new Austrian government failed
Friday when the leading party broke off coalition talks with an opposition party
after more than three hours of closed-door negotiations. Chancellor Viktor Klima
of the leading Social Democrats announced the end of the talks. He said he would
propose to President Thomas Klestil that the Social Democrats form a minority
government. It was not immediately clear if the president would let Klima form a
minority Cabinet, which would be the first such government since 1970. Another
likely alternative would be new elections.

Moon Creeps Into Earth's Shadow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Across the Western Hemisphere wherever there wasn't a
curtain of clouds, one of the greatest shows on Earth played overhead Thursday
night: a total eclipse of the moon. Starting about 9:30 p.m. EST with a shadow
along its left edge, the moon began moving toward total eclipse as it crept into
Earth's shadow. The darkest phase, when the moon climbed to its height over the
East Coast, was to end at 12:22 a.m. EST Friday. The moon was expected to leave
Earth's shadow at 2:24 a.m. EST. Duke Johnson, planetarium director at SciWorks
science museum in N.C., said it is a "much brighter eclipse than we've had in
recent years. It's a nice red color," he said.

Columbine Library To Be Replaced
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- School board officials voted late Thursday to replace
the Columbine High School library where two students gunned down their
classmates in the nation's deadliest school shooting. A group of Columbine
students and parents has proposed raising $3.5 million to tear down the current
library, replace it with an atrium and build a new wing with a new library. Ten
Columbine students were killed in the library before gunmen Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold took their own lives during the April massacre. Two other students
and a teacher were killed outside the library. The school was reopened in the
fall, but the library has been sealed.

Weak Euro Gets Little Attention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Europe's common currency neared parity with the
dollar again this week, but its slide has not sounded alarm bells as concerns
turn instead to the strong yen in advance of Saturday's G7 meetings. A weak euro
has become a fact of life in economic circles, and many analysts say that is not
a bad thing as long as the U.S. economy stays on the fast track and European
growth continues slowly. "The euro is weakening because it needs to do that,"
said Gerard Gardner, a London-based foreign exchange strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. "Europe is just finding the right price as to where things
work for it."

<HEADLINE> Triathlete Fights Against Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA VOZZELLA-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Mass. (AP) -- A month ago, four-time world champion triathlete Karen
Smyers had six hours of surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid and some lymph
nodes.
</P>
<P>
	Today she is working out three hours a day, preparing to compete for a spot on
the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily, I'm not new to overcoming obstacles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Smyers is so intent on competing that she got permission from doctors
to postpone cancer treatments until after the Olympic trials this spring.
</P>
<P>
	The Summer Games in Sydney will be the first to feature the triathlon as a
medal sport. At 38, Smyers figures this could be her only shot at Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
	``If this is my last shot, I've got to go for it,'' she said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	The cancer diagnosis and surgery are only the latest in a string of recent
setbacks for Smyers, who spent 13 injury-free years in the sport.
</P>
<P>
	In the past 2 1/2 years, she has severed a hamstring installing storm windows,
broken six ribs when an 18-wheeler hit her bike and broken her collarbone in a
crash with another cyclist.
</P>
<P>
	Smyers has been able to turn some setbacks in her favor.
</P>
<P>
	While recovering from her hamstring injury, she had her first child, Jenna, now
20 months old, and it was a job layoff that gave her time to become a
professional triathlete.
</P>
<P>
	Smyers was a swimmer at Princeton University and started competing in
triathlons after she began work at a Boston computer company. When the company
faltered and her work hours were slashed, she began devoting more time to the
sport.
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Smyers won four world championships and captured the women's division
of the grueling Ironman competition. Four other times she has placed in the top
four.
</P>
<P>
	This year, the U.S. Olympic Committee named her Triathlete of the Year.
</P>
<P>
	Smyers returned to competition last year, finishing second in the Ironman in
Hawaii in October. She finished the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike race and a
26.2-mile run in 9 hours, 20 minutes and 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	A remarkable feat, considering her past injuries. More remarkable considering a
month earlier she was told she might have cancer.
</P>
<P>
	Smyers had gone to a doctor with a bout of bronchitis and mentioned that her
glands or thyroid felt swollen.
</P>
<P>
	Because thyroid cancer is slow-growing, her doctor said she could finish the
triathlon season before getting a biopsy. After finishing the season in Mexico,
where she broke her collarbone, she returned to Boston for treatment and a
biopsy that confirmed the thyroid cancer.
</P>
<P>
	She still needs radioactive iodine treatment, but that requires going off her
thyroid medication, which could make her lethargic.
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, she hasn't lost sight of what matters most to her.
</P>
<P>
	``As a mom, my first priority is getting better for the long term,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	And if she doesn't make the Olympic team?
</P>
<P>
	``I've done more in the sport than I ever dreamed of,'' she said. ``I could
retire tomorrow and still be completely satisfied with my career.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three salvos of gunfire shattered the silence
over Belgrade's cemetery, giving a military farewell to Serbia's famed warlord
and underworld don -- Arkan.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred by Arkan's notorious background, thousands swarmed to the New

touched by elements of urban folk tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan, whose real name was Zeljko Raznatovic, was assassinated along with
two bodyguards on Saturday in a ritzy Belgrade's hotel. Opposition leaders
charge that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was behind the killing,
silencing a man they say could link the national leadership to Balkan
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's ruthless tactics during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, where he
commanded a fearsome militia nicknamed the ``Tigers,'' led to war crimes
charges. His battlefield exploits and earlier criminal record as a bank robber
earned him the status of an outlaw.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, his popularity seemed apparent Thursday
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe Arkan was a hero,'' said Dobrosav Lukic, 76, one of the
mourners. ``Milosevic killed him because he (Arkan) wanted to surrender himself
to the Hague,'' the site of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping men, women in mink coats and children clutching traditional beeswax
candles squeezed into the cemetery's courtyard, craning their necks for a
glimpse of Arkan's casket or his popular widow Ceca, a folk singer.
</P>
<P>
	   Six members of Arkan's Tigers, dressed in camouflage fatigues and maroon
berets, stood as an honor guard at the casket.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkan's premier league soccer team was also in attendance, as were
ashen-faced business associates clad in black leather jackets and overcoats. No
prominent members of the ruling establishment attended, even though Arkan was
once a member of the Serbian parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   After the recitation of last rites, members of Arkan's militia carried the
coffin draped with his militia's flag to a luxury hearse.
</P>
<P>
	   A brass band played a death march and militiamen fired off three rounds from
their AK-47s before his casket was lowered into the ground. The shots were an
open defiance of an automatic weapons ban.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Balkan wars, Arkan rose to become one of Serbia's richest men,
with controlling interests in gambling, betting and oil smuggling.
</P>
<P>
	   For days people have been captivated by rumors that the government organized
the attack because Arkan reportedly was prepared to offer war crimes
investigators evidence implicating Milosevic and other Yugoslav leaders. The
government rejected the charges again on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of his controversial biography and discrepancies in assessment,
he was a patriot,'' said Ivica Dacic, the ruling Socialist Party spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspaper reports said an alleged accomplice who was wounded in the attack,
Dusan Gavric, was recovering after surgery in a town near the Bosnian border
where he fled after the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-run Dnevnik daily, based in the city of Novi Sad near the
Hungarian border, cited a police source as saying a suspect named Goran Jevtovic
had been arrested in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
	   But many of the mourners said they weren't interested in talking about the
rumors or the politics that may have led to the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here for curiosity to see Ceca,'' said Milica Basic 36, who stood
on an empty grave to get a better view. ``I think he (Arkan) was a crook, but he
fought for the Serbs as well ... I think his criminals killed him. Or the state
did it. Who cares?''

<HEADLINE> Film Director To Win Honorary Oscar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Polish film director Andrzej Wajda will
receive an honorary Oscar for his work in bringing European cinema to the
attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oscar will be presented during the 72nd Annual Academy Awards on March
26, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "By showing both the loftiest heights and the darkest depths of the European
soul, he has inspired all of us to re-examine the strength of our common
humanity," academy president Robert Rehme said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 73-year-old Wajda's 44 films include "A Generation," "Kanal," "Ashes and
Diamonds," "Lotna," "Landscape After Battle," "Man of Iron," "Man of Marble,"
"Korczak," "Land of Promise" and "The Maids of Wilko."
</P>
<P>
	   The special Oscar recognizes "a man whose films have given audiences around
the world an artist's view of history, democracy and freedom, and who in so
doing has himself become a symbol of courage and hope for millions of people in
postwar Europe," said the academy Board of Governors, which voted for the honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous honorary awards have been presented to Michelangelo Antonioni, Fred
Astaire, Greta Garbo, Kirk Douglas, Buster Keaton, Akira Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray
and Orson Welles.

<HEADLINE> Strict Exams Sought for Bus Drivers  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Bus drivers and truckers should face the same strict
medical exams that pilots take to avoid being grounded, the head of the National
Transportation Safety Board says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wouldn't want to get on an airplane with a pilot who is unfit,'' said
NTSB chairman James Hall. ``Each and every day we are sharing our highways with
(bus and truck) drivers who are unfit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hall spoke Thursday during a break from a hearing about a bus crash in New
Orleans last May that killed 22 people. The hearing was to resume today.
</P>
<P>
	   An NTSB investigation found that driver Frank Bedell had a history of heart
and kidney problems before the crash, but flaws in the licensing system allowed
him to keep on driving.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration program to make sure pilots are healthy
and free of drugs was held up as a model that the U.S. Transportation Department
should adopt to improve bus and truck safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA requires doctors to take a one-week training course before they can
examine pilots, said Dr. Warren Silberman, chief medical officer with the FAA's
pilot medical certification program.
</P>
<P>
	   All results are forwarded to the FAA for possible review. Also provided to
the FAA are results of drug and alcohol tests. Pilots who test positive are
grounded while they undergo treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last year passed laws revamping the federal agency responsible for
bus and truck regulations, requiring employers to report positive drug tests to
state officials and mandating that employers check driver drug test histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet transportation experts testified that commercial drivers with serious
health problems ``doctor shop'' for physicians who give easy exams. Others said
doctors are unaware of rules about driver health and that oversight by federal
officials is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors who perform exams bus drivers and truckers must get every two years
never receive training on how commercial drivers should be assessed. And no one
monitors their performance, said Dr. Natalie Hartenbaum, a Philadelphia
physician who wrote a guide on medical certification for the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To do a complete exam takes 20 minutes. Many of them do it in five,'' Dr.
Hartenbaum testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety advocates attending the hearing said the number of highway deaths
will drop if federal officials do a better job making sure bus drivers and
truckers are healthy and drug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell ``should have been caught before that tragic crash occurred,'' said
Daphne Izer, a founder of Parents Against Tired Truckers, based in Lisbon Falls,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The chartered bus Bedell drove was carrying mostly elderly women on a day
trip to a Mississippi casino when it veered off Interstate 610 and overturned.
Police said Bedell's use of marijuana hours earlier was the main cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell had a history of failing bus company drug tests, but the information
was never passed on to licensing officials because no federal rules required the
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also found that a doctor had diagnosed Bedell with
congestive heart failure in 1998 but signed his medical certificate -- even
though federal law prohibits commercial drivers with the disease from driving.
</P>
<P>
	   And less than 12 hours before the crash, Bedell was treated in a hospital
emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell died in August before giving a detailed statement about his drug use,
health problems or the crash.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Was Sundance Fluke  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Movie-goers never did get to see that scary lady
haunting the woods in "The Blair Witch Project."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Sundance Film Festival, where the low-budget blockbuster was
discovered a year ago, movie scouts are not expecting another find like that.
</P>
<P>
	   Shot for about $60,000 and acquired for $1 million, "Blair Witch" hit
theaters last summer and grossed $140 million. It is the first certified
mega-hit to come out of the nation's premiere independent movie showcase.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie's success prompted predictions that such festivals would become
crowded with films copycatting its shaky, home-video look and improvised
approach. But there's no evidence of "Blair Witch" imitators among the 113
features at Sundance, which opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sundance co-director Geoffrey Gilmore said nothing jumps out as a possible
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't tell you the number of times I get asked what's the next 'Blair
Witch'?" Gilmore said. "Well, there's no such thing, guys. If a film emerges
that has that kind of commercial potential, it's certainly not one that's
readily apparent."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success of "Blair Witch," buyers remain as cautious as ever
about opening their checkbooks at Sundance. Some distributors say there's even
more hesitancy this year because of recent box-office underachievers such as
"Happy, Texas" or "Next Stop, Wonderland," which were multimillion dollar
Sundance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Blair Witch' was a wonderful phenomenon, but I don't think any of us
really expect lightning like that to strike twice," said Clint Culpepper,
co-head of acquisitions for Columbia Pictures, which scouts Sundance for
acquisitions for its Sony Classics or Screen Gems labels.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1978 and taken over by Robert Redford's Sundance Institute in
1985, the festival runs through Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival began as a creative showcase, but the success of "Blair Witch"
emphasizes that it's become as much a movie marketplace where frenzied bidding
can push the price of a film as high as $10 million, beyond the box-office
potential of most independent films.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan Entertainment had no competition for "Blair Witch," the story of
three filmmakers who vanished while hunting for a legendary witch. After seeing
the movie at a midnight screening at Sundance, Artisan snapped it up, along with
sequel rights, within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The success of the film had as much to do with its marketing as its gimmicky
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan's Internet-heavy campaign pitched the fictional movie as a
documentary about real filmmakers whose story is told through their own footage,
recovered a year after they disappeared in the woods. A top studio likely would
have plugged the film through traditional advertising that might never have
captivated the youthful, computer-savvy movie-goers who made "Blair Witch" a
hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Blair Witch' was a marketing person's dream," said Amir Malin, Artisan
president. "It provided us with ample opportunities to promote it and get it out
of the art-house ghetto and find a commercial audience."
</P>
<P>
	   For every independent film that succeeds, though, there may be a dozen
others that lose money. Buyers said they need to remain skeptical about a film's
commercial prospects to avoid getting caught up in the hype of Sundance.
</P>
<P>
	   "People love movies at Sundance. When a picture gets a standing ovation, it
can create a false feeling that that's how the movie's going to play to
audiences around the world," said Larry Gleason, head of distribution for MGM.
"You have to be cautious and not so anxious to pull out a blank check."

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers will come to NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAVANA (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez are flying to New York
City later today along with a U.S. church group to press for the return of the
6-year-old boy to Cuba, a church leader said.
<P>
	   The women are making the trip to "make an appeal to the American people,"
said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said there would be no further comment until the grandmothers arrive
in New York in the afternoon. The announcement came after the church delegation
met with the boy's father, Juan Miguel, at a hotel in the Cuban capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday, and there had been speculation they would head to the United States
with the church delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, had said earlier she would
only go to the United States if she could return with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the past 24 hours we have been in delicate and emotional conversations
with Elian Gonzalez's family, a loving family," Edgar said. "We are very pleased
that Elian's grandmothers have agreed to accompany us to New York City to have
an opportunity to speak to the American public, particularly to ask that Elian
Gonzalez come home."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters hope that the relatives' presence in the United States might help
convince U.S. skeptics that the family really did want the 6-year-old boy to
return. Some anti-Castro activists claim the family's appeal for the boy's
return is made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel, has said he does not want to have to visit the
United States to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's
communist government will hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear
before Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington said the grandmothers were
expected to fly to New York and meet with Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York. They said New York was chosen to avoid Miami, where Elian has been living
with his father's uncle for almost two months and where there were disturbances
over earlier proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned
to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, filed a lawsuit
accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family would be pleased by a visit by the grandmothers and hopes Elian
would get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that
the boy does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.

<HEADLINE> University considering installing sprinklers after fatal fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - No fire drills. No sprinklers. A string of
false alarms.
<P>
	   Students at Seton Hall University lashed out at university officials
Thursday for not doing more to prevent a fire a day after three students were
killed and 62 injured in a blaze at its freshman dormitory.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that was our hall, I'm just wondering if everybody would have been
prepared," said Nathan Umbriac, 18, a freshman from Danville, Pa., who lives in
another freshman dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   An Essex County grand jury subpoenaed fire inspection records and
engineering plans for Boland Hall, Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant Essex
County prosecutor, said today.
</P>
<P>
	   No cause has yet been determined for the fire, and no charges or arrests
have been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Township attorney Edwin Matthews said the subpoena requires municipal
officials to provide the grand jury with all documents pertaining to the
dormitory, including recent renovations.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman, meanwhile, said she would consider legislation
requiring sprinklers in all state college dormitories, and a Seton Hall
spokeswoman said the university is considering installing sprinklers at Boland
Hall, one of two university dormitories that don't have them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you could put a price tag on human life," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators continued searching for a cause to the smoky fire that began
in the dormitory's third-floor lounge and sent hundreds of terrified students
fleeing a burning building in the predawn cold.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are ruling out nothing at this juncture," Essex County Prosecutor Donald
Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He refuted a report in Thursday editions of The Star-Ledger that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and electrical problems as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said that investigators were seeking three young men whom a
resident assistant had asked to leave the building less than an hour before the
fire broke out. Campolo declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Six students remained hospitalized Thursday from the fire. Four were in
critical condition, including a 21-year-old student who had surgery Thursday to
restore skin to her back and hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university said the school had not prepared
them well for a fire. Fire alarms rarely ring at most of the dormitories, and
they ring so frequently at Boland Hall that they aren't taken seriously, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the alarm, I thought 'I'm not leaving,"' said Marissa
Lorenz, 18, who was released from the hospital on Thursday. "I mean, there are
so many alarms."
</P>
<P>
	   Omar Soriano, a 1997 Seton Hall alumnus, said Thursday that 25 false fire
alarms rang in Boland during one semester in 1994, when he was a resident
assistant. Eighteen alarms have rung at Boland since September 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Umbriac said he doesn't recall going through a fire drill and said resident
assistants haven't given them detailed instructions about preparing for a fire
or warned them against pulling prank alarms.
</P>
<P>
	   The university released a page from its student manual on Thursday which
tells students what to do if a fire alarm goes off and warns that students can
be expelled for setting a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The school will consider "anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again," spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Seton Hall's six dormitories, Boland Hall and Aquinas Hall, don't
have sprinkler systems because they were built before 1984, when the law
required them. The dormitories, which are equipped with fire extinguishers, are
the only two that house freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   A rare fire alarm rang Thursday morning at Xavier Hall, evacuating nearly
200 students from the upperclassmen dorm. Grider said she didn't know the cause
of the alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got up real quick for this one," said Guerschom Nazaire, 20, a junior
from Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the university's 10,000 students left campus following the fire. The
school postponed its weekend basketball games and extended its break from
classes until Monday, when a memorial service is scheduled for the three
victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of West Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland
and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. All were 18-year-old freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Students quietly walked through the snow-covered campus lined with yellow
police tape Thursday, and some said it is too early to cast blame.

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers headed to NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAVANA (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez were flying to New York
City today along with a U.S. church group to press for the 6-year-old boy's
return to Cuba, a church leader said.
<P>
	   The women are taking the trip to "make an appeal to the American people,"
said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said there would be no further comment until the grandmothers arrived
in New York this afternoon. The announcement came after the church delegation
met with the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, at a hotel in the Cuban
capital.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday, and there had been speculation they would head to the United States
with the church delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, has said she would go to the
United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the past 24 hours we have been in delicate and emotional conversations
with Elian Gonzalez's family, a loving family," Edgar said. "We are very pleased
that Elian's grandmothers have agreed to accompany us to New York City to have
an opportunity to speak to the American public, particularly to ask that Elian
Gonzalez come home."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were waiting for them," Gonzalez said. But he said the family has had no
contact with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow the women to take the
boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem," he said. "The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might help convince U.S. skeptics that the family really does want
the boy back. Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return
is made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's communist
government will hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington had said the grandmothers
were expected to fly to New York and meet with Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of
New York. They said New York was chosen to avoid Miami, where Elian has been
living with his father's uncle for almost two months and where there were
disturbances over earlier proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Was Sundance Fluke  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Movie-goers never did get to see that scary lady
haunting the woods in "The Blair Witch Project."
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, movie scouts at the Sundance Film Festival, where the low-budget
horror blockbuster was discovered, aren't expecting another such find this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shot for about $60,000 and acquired for $1 million, "Blair Witch" hit
theaters last summer and grossed $140 million. It is the first certified
mega-hit to come out of the nation's premiere independent movie showcase.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie's success prompted predictions that such festivals would become
crowded with films copycatting its shaky, home-video look and improvised
approach. But there's no evidence of "Blair Witch" imitators among the 113
features at Sundance, which opened yesterday. Sundance co-director Geoffrey
Gilmore said nothing jumps out as a possible blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't tell you the number of times I get asked what's the next 'Blair
Witch'?" Gilmore said. "Well, there's no such thing, guys. If a film emerges
that has that kind of commercial potential, it's certainly not one that's
readily apparent."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the success of "Blair Witch," buyers remain as cautious as ever
about opening their checkbooks at Sundance. Some distributors say there's even
more hesitancy this year because of recent box-office underachievers such as
"Happy, Texas" or "Next Stop, Wonderland," which were multimillion dollar
Sundance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Blair Witch' was a wonderful phenomenon, but I don't think any of us
really expect lightning like that to strike twice," said Clint Culpepper,
co-head of acquisitions for Columbia Pictures, which scouts Sundance for
acquisitions for its Sony Classics or Screen Gems labels.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1978 and taken over by Robert Redford's Sundance Institute in
1985, the festival runs through Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival began as a creative showcase, but the success of "Blair Witch"
emphasizes that it's become as much a movie marketplace where frenzied bidding
can push the price of a film as high as $10 million, beyond the box-office
potential of most independent films.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan Entertainment had no competition for "Blair Witch," the story of
three filmmakers who vanished while hunting for a legendary witch. After seeing
the movie at a midnight screening at Sundance, Artisan snapped it up, along with
sequel rights, within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The success of the film had as much to do with its marketing as its gimmicky
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan's Internet-heavy campaign pitched the fictional movie as a
documentary about real filmmakers whose story is told through their own footage,
recovered a year after they disappeared in the woods. A top studio likely would
have plugged the film through traditional advertising that might never have
captivated the youthful, computer-savvy movie-goers who made "Blair Witch" a
hit.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Blair Witch' was a marketing person's dream," said Amir Malin, Artisan
president. "It provided us with ample opportunities to promote it and get it out
of the art-house ghetto and find a commercial audience."
</P>
<P>
	   For every independent film that succeeds, though, there may be a dozen
others that lose money. Buyers said they need to remain skeptical about a film's
commercial prospects to avoid getting caught up in the hype of Sundance.
</P>
<P>
	   "People love movies at Sundance. When a picture gets a standing ovation, it
can create a false feeling that that's how the movie's going to play to
audiences around the world," said Larry Gleason, head of distribution for MGM.
"You have to be cautious and not so anxious to pull out a blank check."

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 36.92; Nasdaq Down 8.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell modestly in early trading today as this week's
flood of company profit reports eased in advance of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 36.92 at 11,314.38, extending Thursday's 138-point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower, although smaller-company shares
were showing some strength. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.65 at
1,442.92, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 8.95 at
4,180.56 after closing at record highs Wednesday and yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no government economic reports to steer the market, and the only
major development among the 30 companies that comprise the Dow was a strong
fourth-quarter report by Caterpillar. However, shares of the heavy equipment
maker slipped  5/8 point to 46 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, Sun Microsystems fell 2 /14 to 84 5/16 despite a
better-than-expected profit report late Thursday by the producer of hardware and
software for the Internet and other computer networks. Sun's stock had rallied
more than 25 percent over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, while gainers led in Nasdaq trading. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was up 1.65 at 528.93.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 227.71 million shares, up from 142.91 million at the
same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.68 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.70 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.17 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.18 percent.

<HEADLINE> UConn scientists trade notes with lobstermen on lobster deaths in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRANFORD, Conn. (AP) - Lobstermen devastated by the die-off of lobsters
in Long Island Sound today asked for help from U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley.
<P>
	   In a conference call from the New Haven office of U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
they requested Daley declare an emergency in the Long Island Sound Fishery.
</P>
<P>
	   That designation would enable lobstermen to receive financial aid. DeLauro,
a Democrat, said the Clinton administration would review the situation to
determine if other aid is also available.
</P>
<P>
	   The lobstermen say their livelihoods have been threatened by the recent
mysterious deaths of thousands of lobsters in the Sound.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday about 30 lobstermen met with scientists from the University of
Connecticut to discuss their investigation into the deaths..
</P>
<P>
	   Slides of diseased lobsters showed nerve cells that looked like pink Swiss
cheese - riddled with a parasite called a paramoeba.
</P>
<P>
	   The UConn scientists are trying to determine whether the parasite is working
with contamination or environmental factors to contribute to the lobster deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no information out there that anything like this bug has every
been seen in lobsters before," said Richard French, a veterinary pathologist at
UConn.
</P>
<P>
	   French said something else may be working with the paramoeba to kill the
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe it's opportunistic. It's coming in because the lobster is
debilitated," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several lobstermen at the meeting quizzed the scientists on their suspicions
that some kind of pollution or contamination is making the lobsters sick.
</P>
<P>
	   Their theories include pesticides or their byproducts from spraying for
mosquitoes in New York, following the outbreak of the West Nile virus, and MTBE,
the gasoline additive that has contaminated wells in Connecticut and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Crismale, head of the Connecticut Commercial Lobstermen's Association,
said scientists should not rule out pollution or contamination, seeing how the
die-off was sudden and severe.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was such a massive kill - that one time, for something to do that kind
of damage, so extensively, so quickly," Crismale said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have not ruled out anything," said Sylvain De Guise, an environmental
toxicologist at UConn who is testing for pollution and contaminants in the
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   Lobstermen also question whether sewage, chlorine or chemicals in the water
may play a part. Others wondered if the fishery was sabotaged with an unknown
pathogen.
</P>
<P>
	   Some scientists also wonder about rising water temperatures and low oxygen
levels in the water.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time that lobsters are dying in the western part of the sound,
French said he has seen eastern Long Island Sound lobsters afflicted with a
disease that corrodes their shells. Starfish, sea urchins and crabs also are
having problems, French said.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientists plan to subject healthy lobsters to the paramoeba to see if
the disease can be brought on.
</P>
<P>
	   UConn is seeking grants to continue the work, although no dollar amount has
been specified. French said he and other scientists plan to work with the state
Department of Environmental Protection to get diseased lobsters and money - and
asked lobstermen to report where in the sound diseased lobsters are being found.

<HEADLINE> United Water Shareholders OK Buyout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARK RIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- United Water Resources shareholders have accepted a
$1.36 billion buyout offer from the French utility giant Suez Lyonnaise des
Eaux.
</P>
<P>
	   If government regulators allow it, the Harrington Park-based water company
will operate under foreign ownership for the first time in its 130-year history.
It would be the latest in a series of takeovers involving Suez Lyonnaise, which
is buying other utility companies while divesting itself of non-utility
properties.
</P>
<P>
	   Suez Lyonnaise already owned a 30 percent stake in the company when the deal
was struck in August. United Water operates community water systems serving 7.5
million people in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
	   United Water investors voted to accept Suez Lyonnaise's $35.48-per-share
offer following an investors meeting here Thursday. The payment is 54 percent
higher than the stock's price when the deal was first announced in August.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyout required the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares to vote
yes. The vote was 72.7 percent in favor, 3.7 percent against and the remainder
abstaining or not voting.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal requires approval from regulators in seven states. The New Jersey
Board of Public Utilities has scheduled hearings for Monday and Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   United Water officials expect all regulatory agencies to clear the deal
within three months. The change is ownership is not expected to affect rates
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Suez Lyonnaise officials have said they expect to have annual water and
waste water revenue of more than $7.4 billion after the United Water
acquisition. The company has agreed to assume about $800 million in United Water
debt.

	   MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Communications equipment maker Lucent
Technologies saw quarterly profits plunge 23 percent for 1999's

was up 7/16 at 52 15/16 this morning. Operating income for the
former division of AT&AMP;T totaled $1.18 billion, or 36 cents per
share, during the three months ended Dec. 31, which is the first
quarter of Lucent's fiscal year. In the same period in 1998, Lucent

	   Weak Euro Gets Little Attention
</P>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Europe's common currency neared parity
with the dollar again this week, but its slide has not sounded
alarm bells as concerns turn instead to the strong yen in advance
of tomorrow's G7 meetings. A weak euro has become a fact of life in
economic circles, and many analysts say that is not a bad thing as
long as the U.S. economy stays on the fast track and European
growth continues slowly. The cheaper currency makes Europe's
exports more competitive and contributes to trade-driven growth.
That growth has eased fears over the euro that flared last month,
when the currency dipped below the dollar level for the first time.

    	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley says repeated episodes of
irregular heartbeats in the last month are irrelevant to his Democratic
presidential campaign, and some sympathetic backers appeared willing to give him
the benefit of the doubt.
<P>
	   But they made clear that any health issues must be explained - quickly and
clearly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know some athletes who live to be 100 because they're in such good
shape," said Fred Mathews, of Mount Pleasant. "I would be concerned, but I would
want to hear his explanation."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley didn't address the health question this morning as he rallied 100
supporters in Burlington to build turnout for Monday's caucuses. "If you can
call 10 people, we can do better than people expect, " Bradley told them.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides sought to play down the impact of new disclosures about the
candidate's heart condition so close to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't control what the heart does, so the timing is irrelevant," said
spokesman Eric Hauser. "There's really nothing to deal with."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, minutes before his fourth rally of the day, the 56-year-old
Bradley disclosed to reporters that he has suffered four irregular heartbeat
episodes since revealing the non-life-threatening condition last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tense campaign staffers were waiting to see how the news would play out
after its delivery just four days before Iowa voters make the first statement on
the presidential campaign in precinct caucuses Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   After an impromptu news conference, where he took only a few questions,
Bradley proceeded with the rally Thursday. Afterward, some of those who attended
said they were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have two sons who are doctors, and they don't think that's a problem,"
Mount Pleasant resident Bob Stafford said of Bradley's condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Rich, also of Mount Pleasant, said she suffers a similar condition,
and conceded the emotional impact of admitting a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can be a little scary until you understand it," she said. "I, like a lot
of people, have irregular heartbeats."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest disclosures raise questions about timing and candor as candidates
address health issues. The former New Jersey senator has suffered from the heart
ailment since 1998, but disclosed it last month only after it forced him off the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said Thursday he would only make such episodes public if they
required a doctor's intervention, and he bristled at suggestions that the
condition hampered his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign released the information in response to an inquiry from ABC
News.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't think we needed to disclose it," Bradley said. "If I have to see a
doctor or if there has to be any medical attention given to it you will hear
about it immediately. Otherwise it's just the nature of the particular
situation."
</P>
<P>
	   He vowed to continue the campaign without alteration.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has absolutely no impact on the race or my capacity to have a schedule
or the intensity of campaigning," Bradley said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the episodes are "regular and predictable," although he conceded
that four in a month is more than he's used to. "It's more frequent than I've
had in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   While loyal backers at Thursday's rally were supportive, the timing of the
disclosure was awkward. Bradley's rival, Vice President Al Gore, leads in all
polls in Iowa. It's far from clear how the episode will play out over the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign aide Anita Dunn said Bradley had not seen his doctors, but had
contacted them about the episodes, which began shortly after Christmas, around
Dec. 26-28. The most recent occurrences came on Jan. 6, Jan. 9 and Sunday, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were all of very short duration," Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley takes four doses of an anti-arrhythmic drug called Procanbid twice
daily and the irregular heartbeat almost never occurs when he regularly takes
the medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn said doctors are "not sure why" he's experiencing irregular heartbeats,
but have voiced no concern and have not recommended any change in medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was examined at a California hospital on Dec. 10 for the chronic
condition that he previously has dismissed as "just a nuisance." Doctors found
no other problems.

<HEADLINE> Thailand To Make, Export GM Zafira  </HEADLINE>
    By NINA SUEBSUKCHAROEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- General Motors Corp. said today that its Zafira
car will be exported to Europe and other markets from its new producition site
here -- the first vehicle to be exported to Europe from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   Production of the Zafira, which is a cross between a minivan and a sedan, is
expected to begin in May at the new GM Thailand Assembly Center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zafira will also be exported to Latin America, Asia and Australia,
considerably extending the East Asian markets that most Thai auto production has
served until now.
</P>
<P>
	   Orders have already been placed by European countries, Chile, Hong Kong,
Singapore and the Philippines. GM is also studying the possibility of exporting
the Zafira to countries in Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   The $650 million GM Thailand plant will be the first GM factory outside
Germany to produce the Zafira.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has set a target to manufacture 7,000 to 8,000 Zafiras at the plant this
year, exporting 85 percent. Next year, the production target is 40,000 Zafiras,
with 85 percent to 90 percent being exported.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thailand and Latin America, the vehicle will be sold under the Chevrolet
brand. In Europe, the brands Opel and Vauxhall will be used and the cars will be
sold under the Holden brand in Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   Thailand has turned into an offshore manufacturing platform for many of the
world's biggest automakers from Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Most initially intended to serve the Thai domestic market but have shifted
their strategies toward export after the Asian economic crisis reduced auto
purchases here.

<HEADLINE> No JFK Shirt Material on Bullets  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Material found on the bullet that killed President
Kennedy did not come from the clothing of Kennedy or John B. Connally, according
to tests conducted to shed light on whether a second shooter fired at the
president.
</P>
<P>
	   A scientific panel concluded in a report released today by the National
Archives that material on the nose of a bullet retrieved from Kennedy's
limousine consisted of paper fibers and nontextile material that could not have
come from Kennedy or Connally's shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   If it had, that would have supported theories that a second gunman was
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asked the FBI to test the fragments to determine
whether the materials had any relevance to the Warren Commission's conclusion
that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   Connally, the Texas governor, was riding in Kennedy's limousine in Dallas on
Nov. 22, 1963, when the president was shot and killed. One of three shots hit
Kennedy and then Connally. The Warren Commission, which conducted the official
U.S. government investigation of Kennedy's slaying, concluded that Oswald was
the sole gunman. Connally died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   If the material was from Kennedy's shirt, tie or tie liner, there might have
been a ``different trajectory than that previously identified'' by the
commission, said John Keeney, acting assistant attorney general, in a January
1996 letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh requesting a bureau investigation of the
bullet fragments. The letter was released by the Archives along with the bullet
report.
</P>
<P>
	   The bullet fragments had been stored for years in a metal can lined with
cotton, but tests showed that material found on the bullet was not the same as
the cotton from the can.
</P>
<P>
	   Government scientists also found human skin and tissue on four bullet
fragments, ``but it was not possible to establish the precise body areas of
origin (e.g. scalp, torso, limb),'' the report said. DNA analysis of the
material was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel of scientists from the Archives, the FBI Laboratory, the Armed
Forces Medical Examiner and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory had
considered getting DNA samples from Kennedy and Connally family members for
comparison, but ruled that out after DNA analysis proved inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests were a piece of unfinished business in the investigation of
Kennedy's assassination. The firearms-examination panel of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations had recommended the analysis in 1979, but the
recommendation was left out of the committee's final report and the tests were
never done.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests on the fragments, which are government property, began in
September 1998 and were completed last fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PM-Wall Street 11am,0267
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors continued to transfer
money from industrial companies into technology issues that are leading the red
hot Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 51.81
at 11,299.49, extending Thursday's 138-point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 6.93 at 4,196.44
after closing at record highs Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were barely changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.23 at 1,445.80.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; CO.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no government economic reports to steer the market, and the only
major development among the 30 companies that comprise the Dow was a strong
fourth-quarter report by Caterpillar. However, shares of the heavy equipment
maker slipped 1 1/4 point to 45 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, Sun Microsystems fell 1 11/16 to 84 7/8 despite a
better-than-expected profit report late Thursday by the producer of hardware and
software for the Internet and other computer networks. Sun's stock had rallied
more than 25 percent over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, while gainers led in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 0.15 at 527.43.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 448.51 million shares, up from Thursday's pace.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Members Rebut Helms' Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Security Council members are recoiling from criticism
by Sen. Jesse Helms that the United Nations needs to get its financial house in
order, suggesting the United States is not living up to its own
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the U.N. charter, a member state cannot attach conditions to its
willingness to pay,'' said Peter van Walsum, the representative from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the other members of the United Nations expected the United States to
keep its word,'' agreed Sergey Lavrov, the Russian envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms' demands ``are unlikely to lead to useful results,'' said Robert
Fowler, Canada's representative.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 14 other representatives to the Security Council offered
rebuttal to Helms' accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., who has spent his career blasting the United Nations, carried
his criticism into the Security Council chamber Thursday, telling members
Americans feel ``a lack of gratitude'' and ``a deep frustration with this
institution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative lawmaker also accused the Security Council of being
``paralyzed'' in dealing with Kosovo and said its peacekeeping mission to Bosnia
was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said any attempt by the United Nations ``to impose its presumed
authority on the American people without their consent'' could lead to an
eventual U.S. withdrawal from the world body.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the same kind of salvos Helms has been hurling for years. The only
difference was that he was launching them at U.N. headquarters, the first member
of Congress to address the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms today was to preside over a field hearing of his Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, looking into what the United Nations has done to comply
with structural changes sought by Congress -- including a reduction in the U.S.
share of peacekeeping operations from the present 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was to be the leadoff witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told reporters after Helms' speech that he felt the appearance
would help build better relations between the United Nations and Congress,
despite the blunt words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials suggested that would take a lot of persuasion on Holbrooke's
part, since the conditions demanded by Helms, including the reduction in U.S.
payments, have found little support so far among the 188-member General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, said John Ruggie, a top aide to Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
``everyone would like to get this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good to know there is a firm bottom line and the goal posts aren't
going to be shifting,'' Ruggie said.
</P>
<P>
	   After failing to pay its dues to the United Nations for three years,
Congress last year voted to free up $926 million in back dues and made a $100
million installment.
</P>
<P>
	   But to get the rest, the United Nations must meet a dozen conditions drafted
by Helms and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del, the Foreign Relations Committee's senior
minority member -- including the reduction in future U.S. payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Other conditions call for the United Nations to scale back its bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Online Funds for Poor  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, pursuing his goal of connecting all
Americans to the Internet, will propose federal subsidies to narrow the
``digital divide'' and help millions of low-income families go online,
administration officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft proposal calls for spending as much as $100 million to provide
computers and Internet access in perhaps as many as 9 million households, but
the officials cautioned that Clinton has not settled on the size of his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is expected to announce his proposal in his State of the Union
address Thursday. He says Internet access and usage should be as commonplace as
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Clinton set a national goal of connecting all Americans to
the Internet, not only in schools and libraries but also in homes, small
businesses and community centers. Commerce Secretary William Daley is
spearheading an effort with the private sector to develop a strategy for
achieving Clinton's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, the administration is working with the computer industry,
private foundations, nonprofit organizations and civil rights groups to make the
Internet more accessible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is committed to making sure that all Americans have access
to the best technology,'' White House deputy press secretary Jake Siewert said.
``But we don't have anything specific to announce at this point.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Commerce Department report last July documented a wide digital divide in
America. It found that black and Hispanic households are only two-fifths as
likely to have Internet access as white families. Households with incomes of
$75,000 and above in urban areas are more than 20 times as likely to have
Internet access as households at the lowest income levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says more than 50 percent of America's schools and over
80 percent of its classrooms are wired for the Internet. The goal is to have all
schools connected by the end of this year.

was up 7/16 at 52 15/16 this morning. Operating income for the
former division of AT&AMP;T totaled $1.18 billion, or 36 cents per
share, during the three months ended Dec. 31, which is the first
quarter of Lucent's fiscal year. In the same period in 1998, Lucent
earned $1.52 billion, or 48 cents a share, excluding one-time
events.

	   Weak Euro Gets Little Attention
</P>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Europe's common currency neared parity
with the dollar again this week, but its slide has not sounded
alarm bells as concerns turn instead to the strong yen in advance
of tomorrow's G7 meetings. A weak euro has become a fact of life in
economic circles, and many analysts say that is not a bad thing as
long as the U.S. economy stays on the fast track and European
growth continues slowly. The cheaper currency makes Europe's
exports more competitive and contributes to trade-driven growth.
That growth has eased fears over the euro that flared last month,
when the currency dipped below the dollar level for the first time.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in early

</P>
<P>
	   Soybean prices were under pressure from a private forecast which talked of

reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

was offset by pressure from continued slow export sales.

<HEADLINE> No JFK Shirt Material on Bullets  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Material found on the bullet that killed President
Kennedy did not come from the clothing of Kennedy or John B. Connally, according
to tests that raise doubts about a second gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   A scientific panel concluded in a report released today by the National
Archives that material on the nose of a bullet retrieved from Kennedy's
limousine consisted of paper fibers and nontextile material that could not have
come from Kennedy or Connally's shirt.
</P>
<P>
	   If it had, that would have supported theories that a second gunman was
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asked the FBI to test the fragments to determine
whether the materials had any relevance to the Warren Commission's conclusion
that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   Connally, the Texas governor, was riding in Kennedy's limousine in Dallas on
Nov. 22, 1963, when the president was shot and killed. One of three shots hit
Kennedy and then Connally. The Warren Commission, which conducted the official
U.S. government investigation of Kennedy's slaying, concluded that Oswald was
the sole gunman. Connally died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   If the material was from Kennedy's shirt, tie or tie liner, there might have
been a ``different trajectory than that previously identified'' by the
commission, said John Keeney, acting assistant attorney general, in a January
1996 letter to FBI Director Louis Freeh requesting a bureau investigation of the
bullet fragments. The letter was released by the Archives along with the bullet
report.
</P>
<P>
	   The bullet fragments had been stored for years in a metal can lined with
cotton, but tests showed that material found on the bullet was not the same as
the cotton from the can.
</P>
<P>
	   Government scientists also found human skin and tissue on four bullet
fragments, ``but it was not possible to establish the precise body areas of
origin (e.g. scalp, torso, limb),'' the report said. DNA analysis of the
material was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel of scientists from the Archives, the FBI Laboratory, the Armed
Forces Medical Examiner and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory had
considered getting DNA samples from Kennedy and Connally family members for
comparison, but ruled that out after DNA analysis proved inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests were a piece of unfinished business in the investigation of
Kennedy's assassination. The firearms-examination panel of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations had recommended the analysis in 1979, but the
recommendation was left out of the committee's final report and the tests were
never done.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests on the fragments, which are government property, began in
September 1998 and were completed last fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Three former executives of Japan's failed Nippon Credit Bank
pleaded innocent Friday to charges of covering up losses that led to the bank's
collapse, Japanese media reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hiroshi Kubota, 68, a former chairman, Shigeoki Togo, 56, a former
president, and Tadao Iwaki, 62, a former vice president, are accused of hiding
more than $1.43 billion in losses.
</P>
<P>
	   They entered their pleas at the first hearing of their trial at the Tokyo
District Court, Kyodo News service said. Court officials were not available late
Friday to confirm the reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The executives were arrested last July shortly after the arrest of top
executives at another failed lender, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Kubota ordered bank officials to ask the Finance Ministry to
change the findings of its investigation and ordered them to lie to ministry
inspectors, according to Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
	   Nippon Credit Bank and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan were both taken over
by the government in 1998 after regulators determined that they were
insolvent.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Biden Says U.N. Must Change  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A day after conservative Sen. Jesse Helms upbraided
the United Nations, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
today joined in the criticism and said fundamental structural changes are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it, you know it, we all know it,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other top U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Biden's message was far less harsh than the sharply worded one delivered
Thursday by Helms, R-N.C., the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, in a speech
to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   But Biden said that while he does not share Helms' conservative politics, he
too believes the United Nations must overhaul his practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has imposed a set of conditions on repayment of nearly $1 billion
in delinquent U.S. dues to the world body, conditions that were written by Helms
and Biden. They include a lower U.S. share in running the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fundamental changes have to take place,'' Biden told the U.N. officials.
``The good news is you're in charge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also lending his voice to calls for U.N. overhauls, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Annan that the United
Nations is not high in popularity among Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in history ever got elected by supporting the United Nations,'' he
said. Warner said the United Nations needed to improve its ability to ``come in
behind military operations'' and restore civilian order, as in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments came as Annan met with the full Foreign Relations panel, in
town to hold a hearing later in the day on U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Biden's tough words came as Security Council members recoiled from criticism
by Helms that the United Nations needs to get its financial house in order. The
U.N. members countered that the United States is not living up to its own
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the U.N. charter, a member state cannot attach conditions to its
willingness to pay,'' said Peter van Walsum, the representative from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the other members of the United Nations expected the United States to
keep its word,'' agreed Sergey Lavrov, the Russian envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms' demands ``are unlikely to lead to useful results,'' said Robert
Fowler, Canada's representative.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 14 other representatives to the Security Council offered
rebuttal to Helms' accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, who has spent his career blasting the United Nations, carried his
criticism into the Security Council chamber Thursday, telling members Americans
feel ``a lack of gratitude'' and ``a deep frustration with this institution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative lawmaker also accused the Security Council of being
``paralyzed'' in dealing with Kosovo and said its peacekeeping mission to Bosnia
was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said any attempt by the United Nations ``to impose its presumed
authority on the American people without their consent'' could lead to an
eventual U.S. withdrawal from the world body.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the same kind of salvos Helms has been hurling for years. The only
difference was that he was launching them at U.N. headquarters, the first member
of Congress to address the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms today was to preside over a field hearing of his committee, looking
into what the United Nations has done to comply with structural changes sought
by Congress -- including a reduction in the U.S. share of peacekeeping
operations from the present 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was to be the leadoff witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told reporters after Helms' speech that he felt the appearance
would help build better relations between the United Nations and Congress,
despite the blunt words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials suggested that would take a lot of persuasion on Holbrooke's
part, since the conditions demanded by Helms, including the reduction in U.S.
payments, have found little support so far among the 188-member General
Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved their money
from industrial companies to the technology issues that are leading the Nasdaq
stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 77.87 at
11,273.43, extending Thursday's 138-point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 9.91 at 4,199.42
after closing at record highs Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were barely changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.82 at 1,442.75.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; CO.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no government economic reports to steer the market, and the only
major development among the 30 companies that comprise the Dow was a strong
fourth-quarter report by Caterpillar. Shares of the heavy equipment maker were
unchanged at 47 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 6 5/8 to 106 1/4 amid reports the consumer products
maker is considering buying drugmaker Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems fell 1 9/16 to 85 despite a
better-than-expected profit report late Thursday by the producer of hardware and
software for the Internet and other computer networks. Sun's stock had rallied
more than 25 percent over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Healtheon/WebMD was the big gainer on the Nasdaq, adding 10 1/2 to 61 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, while gainers led in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.20 at 528.48.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume came to 605.9 million shares, up from Thursday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Fails To Make Bond Payment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine failed to make an $18 million payment on bonds
issued through Chase Manhattan Bank Luxembourg SA, but said it was working on a
debt restructuring offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Ukraine's failure to make the payment on the dollar-denominated bonds,
scheduled for Thursday, gave creditors the right to announce a default.
</P>
<P>
	   The Finance Ministry said the bonds would be included in the exchange offer
on the same basis as the country's other outstanding foreign currency bond
issues, according to the London-based investment bank ING Barings that
represents Ukraine as the lead manager of its debt restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt restructuring offer is expected to be disclosed by Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Ukraine's foreign debt amounts to about $12.5 billion, of which more than $3
billion are due in 2000 and about the same amount in 2001, a heavy burden for
the former Soviet republic's battered economy.
</P>
<P>
	   With the National Bank reserves falling to $1.2 billion by the end of 1999,
the new prime minister and former National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko has
pledged to manage foreign debts without the use of bank reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   "The new Ukrainian government is well aware of its current unworkable debt
service situation and is fully committed to carrying out a debt exchange
procedure for all its outstanding bonds," Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov said in
a statement released by ING Barings.

<HEADLINE> Scandinavia Euro Opposition Falls  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Opposition to adopting Europe's single currency
appears to be on the decline in Sweden and Denmark, with recent moves indicating
that it is only a matter of time before they join the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it is likely to take several years for the two nations' governments
to convince the public of the benefits of joining the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party proposed today that this
year's party congress in March endorse adopting the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   And Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has said the nation will face
referendum on the euro before the next parliamentary elections, which will be
held in the spring of 2002 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither government has offered an exact timeframe, and many analysts are
expecting Denmark to get there first.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Denmark, we're looking at the 2002 scenario; in Sweden a 2004 scenario,"
said Klaus Dalsgaard, a senior analyst for Unibank in Copenhagen, Denmark. "In
both countries there's still a lot of uncertainty in the public about what it
will mean to join the EMU."
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven of the 15 European Union countries launched the euro at the beginning
of 1999 for corporate and investment transactions in hopes that the common
currency would increase European integration along with borderless travel and
virtually free trade. Euro coins and bank notes will not be introduced until
Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain, Sweden and Denmark declined to join, while Greece was not allowed
in because of its high inflation and budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Danish government is pro-euro, but Nyrup Rasmussen's main problem is his
own voters: many Social Democrats are skeptical about tighter European
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts by the party leadership to lobby in the euro's favor appear to have
paid off, with recent opinion polls showing a majority of the population,
especially among Social Democrats, in favor of joining the common currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadership of Sweden's Social Democrats said any final decision should
be made with a referendum or general election. The committee also imposed
conditions on membership, including that Sweden's economic cycle and wage
increases should be more or less in line with those in the euro zone, and
Swedish public finances should be strong enough to withstand downturns in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Swedes, who will hold the European Union's rotating presidency from January
to July 2001, were getting encouragement from neighboring Finland, which joined
the euro after a 1994 referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, we enlarged our domestic market 60-fold," said Johnny Akerholm
of the Finnish Finance Ministry. "Now, we are in the core of Europe and can
influence economic decisions and economic cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Earnings Beat Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
    By JAY HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. today reported a 21 percent drop in
quarterly earnings from a year ago, blaming a decrease in sales and prices,
primarily in North America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest maker of construction equipment said its net income for
the October-December period was $239 million, or 67 cents a share, down from
$301 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 64 cents a
share earnings projected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $5.02 billion for the quarter, down from $5.41 billion in the
final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The report sent the Peoria, Ill., company's stock tumbling. At midday,
shares were trading at $45.87 1/2, down $1.25 or about 2.6 percent, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Caterpillar posted a profit of $946 million, or $2.63 per
share, down 37 percent from $1.51 billion, or $4.11 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for 1999 was $19.7 billion, down 6 percent from $20.98 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "Profit in 1999 was significantly lower than we anticipated at the beginning
of the year due to weaker machine demand in the second half and ongoing price
competition," said Glen Barton, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects sales and revenue to increase next year in every
region except North America.

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federally-funded computer database holds a wealth of
information on the nation's 9 million commercial bus and truck drivers, but very
little about the drivers' health, the head of the program said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Jay Maxwell, president of the American Association of Motor Vehicle
Administrators, appeared today at a federal hearing into a charter bus crash on
Mother's Day last year that killed 22 people in New Orleans. The investigation
of the crash showed the driver's health problems played a major role in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   The database, begun in the 1980s, contains information on driving records.
But as for health information, it only indicates whether a driver has a medical
record on file in a particular state, said Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
	   Another problem with the database is difficulty in getting access to it,
said Peter Pantuso, president of the American Bus Association. He said companies
that want to review the material have to go through private contractors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The system is very, very difficult. It's very cumbersome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearings began on Thursday, when the head of the National Transportation
Safety Board said bus drivers and truckers should face the same strict medical
exams that pilots take to avoid being grounded.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You wouldn't want to get on an airplane with a pilot who is unfit,'' said
NTSB chairman James Hall. ``Each and every day we are sharing our highways with
(bus and truck) drivers who are unfit.''
</P>
<P>
	   An NTSB investigation found that driver Frank Bedell had a history of heart
and kidney problems before the crash, but flaws in the licensing system allowed
him to keep on driving.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration program to make sure pilots are healthy
and free of drugs was held up as a model that the U.S. Transportation Department
should adopt to improve bus and truck safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA requires doctors to take a one-week training course before they can
examine pilots, said Dr. Warren Silberman, chief medical officer with the FAA's
pilot medical certification program.
</P>
<P>
	   All results are forwarded to the FAA for possible review. Also provided to
the FAA are results of drug and alcohol tests. Pilots who test positive are
grounded while they undergo treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last year passed laws revamping the federal agency responsible for
bus and truck regulations, requiring employers to report positive drug tests to
state officials and mandating that employers check driver drug test histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet transportation experts testified that commercial drivers with serious
health problems ``doctor shop'' for physicians who give easy exams. Others said
doctors are unaware of rules about driver health and that oversight by federal
officials is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors who perform exams bus drivers and truckers must get every two years
never receive training on how commercial drivers should be assessed. And no one
monitors their performance, said Dr. Natalie Hartenbaum, a Philadelphia
physician who wrote a guide on medical certification for the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To do a complete exam takes 20 minutes. Many of them do it in five,'' Dr.
Hartenbaum testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety advocates attending the hearing said the number of highway deaths
will drop if federal officials do a better job making sure bus drivers and
truckers are healthy and drug-free.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell ``should have been caught before that tragic crash occurred,'' said
Daphne Izer, a founder of Parents Against Tired Truckers, based in Lisbon Falls,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The chartered bus Bedell drove was carrying mostly elderly women on a day
trip to a Mississippi casino when it veered off Interstate 610 and overturned.
Police said Bedell's use of marijuana hours earlier was the main cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell had a history of failing bus company drug tests, but the information
was never passed on to licensing officials because no federal rules required the
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also found that a doctor had diagnosed Bedell with
congestive heart failure in 1998 but signed his medical certificate -- even
though federal law prohibits commercial drivers with the disease from driving.
</P>
<P>
	   And less than 12 hours before the crash, Bedell was treated in a hospital
emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell died in August before giving a detailed statement about his drug use,
health problems or the crash.

<HEADLINE> Summers Urges Japan To Open Economy  </HEADLINE>
    By GARY SCHAEFER Associated Press writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan should open its economy and raise its 1 percent target
for economic growth as the country pulls out of its deepest slump in decades,
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's important that raising the growth and ensuring that it be domestic
demand-led be a priority," said Summers, who is in Japan for a weekend gathering
of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese government has said it expects 1 percent growth for the fiscal
year starting April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   But accepting that target runs the risk that "growth would again be
negative," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Summers said he
believes the world's second-largest economy has yet to achieve its potential,
according to Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the Finance Ministry's international
bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers urged Obuchi to continue efforts to deregulate the Japanese economy,
including the telecommunications sector, to attract foreign investment and
stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Obuchi nor Summers raised the issue that is weighing heavily on the
minds of many global investors and currency traders: the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials worry the yen's 10 percent rise against the U.S. dollar
over the last year threatens to smother the country's nascent economic recovery
by hurting its mainstay export industries.
</P>
<P>
	   The G-7 talks comes at a time when the global economy has been at its
strongest since the outbreak of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Summers told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the challenge now is to come up with a blueprint that would not only
secure the global economy's rebound but also push up the economies of Japan and
Europe to the prosperous levels now enjoyed by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Sen.: No Campaign Finance Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ZUCKERBROD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has led
congressional opposition to overhauling campaign finance laws, vowed Friday to
beat back any attempts in Congress to pass legislation that resembles last
year's failed measure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must never lose soft money,'' McConnell said before a cheering crowd at
the 27th annual Conservative Political Action Conference, referring to unlimited
donations that unions, corporations and some individuals give to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
	   He contends banning such contributions would violate constitutional free
speech protections. And if soft money were prohibited, he said, Democrats would
still get their party message out by other means -- through academia, the press
and Hollywood -- but Republicans would not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't have any well-heeled allies out there,'' he said. ``Our business
friends are not very good at this sort of thing, and they don't like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, for the fourth consecutive time, Congress rejected a bipartisan
bill -- co-sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
-- that would have overhauled the nation's campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination, has been talking
about the issue on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regretfully one of our candidates for president has endorsed the left,''
McConnell said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   A McCain spokeswoman said the rib was unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a shame Mitch McConnell continues to ignore the fact that it's
Republican ideas, not money, that caused Republicans to win back the Senate in
1994 and will propel us to victory in 2000,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Ives.
</P>
<P>
	   McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee that
raises money to help elect GOP Senate candidates -- predicted the issue would be
debated in the next session of Congress, which begins next week.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said legislation would not pass unless it was markedly different from
last year's bill. Among other things, he said the legislation would have to
raise the $1,000 limit on an individual's donation to a single candidate in a
primary or general election.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats boast of a record-setting fund-raising year in 1999, and reported
more than $19 million in the bank as of Jan. 1., much of it soft money.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans will not report their totals until the end of the month, but
have privately circulated the word that they are likely to have several million
dollars less.

<HEADLINE> Court Tackles States Rights Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, taking on another states' rights
battle, today agreed to decide whether state employees are protected by a key
federal anti-bias law, the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, who two weeks ago barred state employees from going into
federal court to sue over age bias, said they will study an appeal in which
Florida officials say Congress likewise exceeded its power by giving state
employees the right to sue in federal court under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the case in April, and a decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's Jan. 11 decision whittled away more of the federal government's
power over states, perpetuating a series of decisions legal scholars say
comprise a states' rights revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   That 5-4 ruling said Congress had exceeded its authority when allowing state
employees to sue their bosses under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
because the law cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued
in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the court ordered lower courts to restudy rulings that
said states and their agencies must abide by a 1963 federal law that requires
employers to give men and women equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
	   In those orders, the justices said federal appeals courts in Illinois and
New York should reconsider their decisions in light of the Jan. 11 decision
barring age-bias lawsuits in federal courts by state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today stems from one of the cases that precipitated the
Jan. 11 ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson sued in federal court after failing
to get a promotion, saying he was discriminated against because of his age and
his heart condition. His lawsuit invoked the two laws aimed at discrimination
based on age and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   An Atlanta-based federal appeals court said his claims under both laws could
proceed to trial, but the Supreme Court reversed that part of the decision
dealing with the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Florida authorities want the justices to also reverse the ADA portion
of the appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Florida Department of Corrections vs. Dickson, 98-829.

<HEADLINE> Justices To Review Open-Primary Law  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether states
can let voters cast their ballots for any candidate in primary elections,
regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said it will hear arguments by four California political parties
that the state's voter-approved ``blanket primary'' law violates their
constitutional right of association.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will hear arguments in the case in April. A decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1996, California allowed only voters who were members of a political
party to vote in that party's primary to nominate candidates for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
	   In March 1996, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that let
voters cast their ballots in primary elections for any candidate of any party.
For example, someone could vote to nominate a Republican candidate for governor,
a Democrat for senator and a Libertarian for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the open primary said it would encourage the nomination of more
moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other states -- Alaska, Louisiana and Washington -- have similar
primary laws. A number of other states have more limited open-primary laws, in
which voters can request the ballot of any political party in a primary
election.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Democratic and Republican parties challenged the California law
along with the state Libertarian Party and the Peace and Freedom Party. They
argued that letting nonparty members help choose their party's nominees violated
their rights to political association.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge ruled against them, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in a Minnesota case that the state
could bar candidates from running in general elections under more than one
party's banner.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today is California Democratic Party vs. Jones, 99-401.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Seize Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Hundreds of Indian protesters occupied the empty
Congress building and declared a new government today after breaking through a
barbed-wire barrier and charging past military guards. There were also violent
protests in Guayaquil, the country's largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   The armed forces command announced its support for the elected government
and demanded that President Jamil Mahuad ``make an urgent decision ... to
preserve the country's internal peace and avoid the nation's international
isolation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said an ``insurrectional movement'' led
by a group of young army colonels was backing the Congress takeover. Television
reports said about 70 colonels and an undetermined number of troops were
involved in the insurrection, which took place while Congress was not in
session.
</P>
<P>
	   An hour after occupying the Congress building, hundreds of Indians pushed
their way into the Supreme Court building across the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Military sharpshooters took up their posts on rooftops looking down on the
two government buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad remained at the presidential palace 20 blocks away but ordered all
employees and officials to evacuate the building, a telephone operator at the
palace said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group of leftist-led
unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations, seized the
provincial government building, local television reported. The news station
broadcast images of students shouting anti-Mahuad slogans from the balcony.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves followed the arrival in Quito early in the week of some 5,000
Indian protesters who demanded the resignation of Mahuad, Congress and the
courts. The protesters contend the government is corrupt and does not serve the
needs of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz called the occupation an ``irresponsible
act'' and urged Ecuadoreans to remain calm. He accused the protesters of trying
to exploit discontent caused by Ecuador's crisis. Last year inflation reached 60
percent, the highest in Latin America, and the economy contracted 7.5 percent.
Only one in three in the labor force has full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's unrest, the protesters had threatened to occupy Congress, and
the government had played down the importance of any building takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seizing a building is not the same as seizing power,'' Alvarez said
Thursday. He said a seizure of Congress would not threaten the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, soldiers in combat uniforms with weapons stepped aside when the
Indians pushed past the barbed wire and into the Congress building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We let them by because we did not want to have a confrontation with the
people,'' said Gen. Carlos Moncayo, the army official in charge of security at
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   At the occupied Congress building, Antonio Vargas, president of the National
Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, appeared at the podium
with an army colonel named Lucio Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, dressed in combat fatigues, and Vargas thrust their arms into the
air in a sign of victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of
Ecuador, who claim to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, said they no longer
recognized the authority of Mahuad, the elected Congress or the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   A former member of Congress, Napoleon Saltos, who belongs to Pachakutik, a
party formed by the Indians in 1995, read a communique saying a three-man
governing council had been formed. He said the three members were Vargas,
Gutierrez and Carlos Solorzano, a former president of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians have been pushing for establishment of a ``popular government''
made up of a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, a representative of
the armed forces and several civilians named by the Indians and their
leftist-led supporters among unions and student groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew the military was with us. That is why the colonel is here,''
Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said late Thursday that authorities would not use force to break up
protests so long as they remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   But the demonstrations turned violent early today, as Indians took to the
streets armed with rocks and clubs, paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians
and passing vehicles in Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

U.S. church delegation left Cuba today bound for New York, where the women will
press for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers are taking the trip to ``make an appeal to the American
people,'' said Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
	   The women kissed and embraced Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, before
boarding the plane. Elian's father remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past 24 hours we have been in delicate and emotional conversations
with Elian Gonzalez's family, a loving family,'' Edgar said before the plane
took off. ``We are very pleased that Elian's grandmothers have agreed to
accompany us to New York City to have an opportunity to speak to the American
public, particularly to ask that Elian Gonzalez come home.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were waiting for them,'' Gonzalez said. But he said the family has had
no contact with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow the women to take
the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem,'' he said. ``The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might help convince U.S. skeptics that the family really does want
the boy back. Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return
is made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's communist
government will hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington had said the grandmothers
were expected to fly to New York and meet with Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of
New York. They said New York was chosen to avoid Miami, where Elian has been
living with his father's uncle for almost two months and where there were
disturbances over earlier proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Cuba's foreign minister visited Paris and accused the United
States of committing a ``very serious'' violation of Elian's human rights by not
returning him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think there is a real danger with regard to the issue because Congress
could give him American citizenship,'' Felipe Perez Roque said.

<HEADLINE> Paris Musical Debuts in Vegas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Known for its showgirls, pop singers and white tigers, the
Las Vegas Strip seems the least likely place for the American debut of a hit
musical from Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   But "Notre Dame de Paris," which opens Saturday, drew cheers from a preview
audience on Thursday night, eliciting a sigh of relief from producer Wayne
Baruch.
</P>
<P>
	   Baruch picked the new Paris Las Vegas hotel-casino, a French-themed resort,
over New York City or Los Angeles for the debut.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm excited about the response," he said. "I never dreamed the audience
would react this way."
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, based on the story of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, opened in
Paris in 1998. Within less than a year, it became the most successful musical in
French history, selling more than 2 million tickets and 7 million CDs in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Biden Says U.N. Must Change  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A day after conservative Sen. Jesse Helms upbraided
the United Nations, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
today joined in the criticism and said fundamental structural changes are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it, you know it, we all know it,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other top U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Biden's message was far less harsh than the sharply worded one delivered
Thursday by Helms, R-N.C., the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, in a speech
to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   But Biden said that while he does not share Helms' conservative politics, he
too believes the United Nations must overhaul his practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has imposed a set of conditions on repayment of nearly $1 billion
in delinquent U.S. dues to the world body, conditions that were written by Helms
and Biden. They include a lower U.S. share in running the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Talking to reporters, Biden scoffed at Helms' assertion that U.S.
sovereignty is threatened by the world body. ``He's absolutely dead wrong. ... I
think it's crazy. I think it has no relevance to reality and I don't think the
American people think that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fundamental changes have to take place,'' Biden told the U.N. officials.
``The good news is you're in charge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also lending his voice to calls for U.N. overhauls, Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Annan that the United
Nations is not high in popularity among Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in history ever got elected by supporting the United Nations,'' he
said. Warner said the United Nations needed to improve its ability to ``come in
behind military operations'' and restore civilian order, as in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments came as Annan met with the full Foreign Relations panel, in
town to hold a hearing later in the day on U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Biden's tough words came as Security Council members recoiled from criticism
by Helms that the United Nations needs to get its financial house in order. The
U.N. members countered that the United States is not living up to its own
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the U.N. charter, a member state cannot attach conditions to its
willingness to pay,'' said Peter van Walsum, the representative from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the other members of the United Nations expected the United States to
keep its word,'' agreed Sergey Lavrov, the Russian envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms' demands ``are unlikely to lead to useful results,'' said Robert
Fowler, Canada's representative.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the 14 other representatives to the Security Council offered
rebuttal to Helms' accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, who has spent his career blasting the United Nations, carried his
criticism into the Security Council chamber Thursday, telling members Americans
feel ``a lack of gratitude'' and ``a deep frustration with this institution.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative lawmaker also accused the Security Council of being
``paralyzed'' in dealing with Kosovo and said its peacekeeping mission to Bosnia
was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said any attempt by the United Nations ``to impose its presumed
authority on the American people without their consent'' could lead to an
eventual U.S. withdrawal from the world body.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the same kind of salvos Helms has been hurling for years. The only
difference was that he was launching them at U.N. headquarters, the first member
of Congress to address the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms today was to preside over a field hearing of his committee, looking
into what the United Nations has done to comply with structural changes sought
by Congress -- including a reduction in the U.S. share of peacekeeping
operations from the present 31 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke was to be the leadoff witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told reporters after Helms' speech that he felt the appearance
would help build better relations between the United Nations and Congress,
despite the blunt words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials suggested that would take a lot of persuasion on Holbrooke's
part, since the conditions demanded by Helms, including the reduction in U.S.
payments, have found little support so far among the 188-member General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Used Donkeys To Aid Afghans  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Using 1,500 donkeys, the United Nations hauled
tons of blankets and food through northern Afghanistan's snow-clogged mountain
passes late last year to reach thousands of Afghans stranded by fighting, U.N.
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The month-long relief operation that ended in December brought food and
blankets to 2,000 families in Dar-e-Souf in Afghanistan's Samangan province, an
area bitterly contested by the Taliban religious army, which governs 90 percent
of the country, and northern-based rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Intense fighting during much of last year forced about 5,000 families to
flee Dar-e-Souf, 120 miles north of the capital, Kabul, according to Michael
Semple, acting U.N. coordinator for humanitarian relief to the Hazarajat region
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew they were there, that they needed help, but it was how to get help
to them,'' said Stephanie Bunker, U.N. spokeswoman in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The operation involved 1,500 donkeys making 6,000 trips over 24 miles of
narrow mountain passes in subzero temperatures. It started in November after an
agreement from both sides earlier that month allowed the aid move through the
area.
</P>
<P>
	   The area of Dar-e-Souf is ``highly inaccessible,'' particularly in cold
weather, Semple said. Land mines along the mountain road made it impossible for
trucks to carry supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred, Semple organized the donkey convoys with the help of Afghans
from nearby villages, loading the animals with bright red blankets and sending
them over the snow-bound passes. On the other side, trucks collected and
distributed the supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Cold weather and land mines weren't the only danger. Packs of wolves,
sometimes traveling eight and nine together, patrolled the passes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan faced considerable skepticism, including from within the United
Nations itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Semple said it was impossible to provide aid to all 5,000 stranded families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we did reach the poorest,'' he said. The others were aided by the
villages in which they sought shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   Semple said that in some houses, five or six families were staying together.
``Some are relatives but some are not,'' he said. ``Rather than see refugees out
in the cold they invite them into their homes.''

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved their money
from industrial companies to the technology issues that are leading the Nasdaq
stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
off 69.18 at 11,282.12, extending Thursday's 138-point drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 44.63 at 4,234.14
after closing at record highs Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were barely changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.91 at 1,446.48.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no government economic reports to steer the market, and the only

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Research Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will ask Congress
for a $2.8 billion boost for basic scientific and medical research to spur
economic growth and enhance longevity and health for Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   He spelled out steps he wants to take and the science investment he seeks to
help America ``accelerate the march of human progress'' in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at the California Institute of Technology, Clinton announced that
his administration's budget for fiscal 2001 will include a major new investment
in a fund aimed at boosting research in several critical fields, including
cancer, diabetes and AIDS, and promoting development of super-fast computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials said that if Congress approves, which they said is
likely, total U.S. spending on basic scientific and technological research would
increase to about $43 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also announced a new initiative in ``nanotechnology,'' the study of
atoms and molecules and how they can be manipulated to vastly improve the memory
of computer information systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imagine putting the contents of the Library of Congress inside a device
the size of a sugar cube,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   While in the Los Angeles area, Clinton also planned to attend two
fund-raising events to benefit the Democratic National Committee. He may also
get in a round or two of golf.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, Clinton, administration officials and allies on Capitol Hill
have been disclosing pieces of the 2001 budget that the president will present
to Congress on Feb. 7. Details of Clinton's research-investment proposal were
made available by White House officials who commented on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton told his Cal Tech audience that a new investment in basic research
of the magnitude he proposes is an important step in assuring U.S. prosperity in
the 21st century and will lead to longer and healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the new proposal include:
</P>
<P>
	   --A $1 billion increase in biomedical research at the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
	   --A $675 million increase in spending for the National Science Foundation. A
White House official said, that if approved, the new spending level will
``double the largest dollar increase ever in the history of the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   --$475 million for the nanotechnology initiative.
</P>
<P>
	   --More than $500 million for information technology research. The White
House official said this could lead to the development of a super-fast super
computer that could predict tornadoes and hurricanes more rapidly and have other
important practical applications.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, pursuing his goal of connecting all
Americans to the Internet, will propose federal subsidies to narrow the
``digital divide'' and help millions of low-income families go online,
administration officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft proposal calls for spending as much as $100 million to provide
computers and Internet access in perhaps as many as 9 million households, but
the officials cautioned that Clinton has not settled on the size of his
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is expected to announce his proposal in his State of the Union
address Thursday. He says Internet access and usage should be as commonplace as
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last year, Clinton set a national goal of connecting all Americans to
the Internet, not only in schools and libraries but also in homes, small
businesses and community centers. Commerce Secretary William Daley is
spearheading an effort with the private sector to develop a strategy for
achieving Clinton's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, the administration is working with the computer industry,
private foundations, nonprofit organizations and civil rights groups to make the
Internet more accessible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is committed to making sure that all Americans have access
to the best technology,'' White House deputy press secretary Jake Siewert said.
``But we don't have anything specific to announce at this point.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Commerce Department report last July documented a wide digital divide in
America. It found that black and Hispanic households are only two-fifths as
likely to have Internet access as white families. Households with incomes of
$75,000 and above in urban areas are more than 20 times as likely to have
Internet access as households at the lowest income levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration says more than 50 percent of America's schools and over
80 percent of its classrooms are wired for the Internet. The goal is to have all
schools connected by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.

<HEADLINE> Court Tackles States Rights Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, taking on another states' rights
battle, today agreed to decide whether state employees are protected by a key
federal anti-bias law, the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, who two weeks ago barred state employees from going into
federal court to sue over age bias, said they will study an appeal in which
Florida officials say Congress likewise exceeded its power by giving state
employees the right to sue in federal court under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the case in April, and a decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's Jan. 11 decision whittled away more of the federal government's
power over states, perpetuating a series of decisions legal scholars say
comprise a states' rights revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   That 5-4 ruling said Congress had exceeded its authority when allowing state
employees to sue their bosses under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
because the law cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued
in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the court ordered lower courts to restudy rulings that
said states and their agencies must abide by a 1963 federal law that requires
employers to give men and women equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
	   In those orders, the justices said federal appeals courts in Illinois and
New York should reconsider their decisions in light of the Jan. 11 decision
barring age-bias lawsuits in federal courts by state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today stems from one of the cases that precipitated the
Jan. 11 ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson sued in federal court after failing
to get a promotion, saying he was discriminated against because of his age and
his heart condition. His lawsuit invoked the two laws aimed at discrimination
based on age and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   An Atlanta-based federal appeals court said his claims under both laws could
proceed to trial, but the Supreme Court reversed that part of the decision
dealing with the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Florida authorities want the justices to also reverse the ADA portion
of the appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Florida Department of Corrections vs. Dickson, 98-829.

<HEADLINE> Britain Returns Egyptian Sculpture  </HEADLINE>
   By SUE LEEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- She came in disguise, but ultimately there was no hiding her
true royal character.
</P>
<P>
	   After painstaking research, Britain on Friday returned a valuable 13th
century B.C. sculpture of the head of an ancient Egyptian queen, stolen a decade
ago by a British antiquities smuggler.
</P>
<P>
	   The marble head of Nefertari, principal queen of Ramses II, was disguised as
a cheap tourist souvenir to smuggle it out of Egypt in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The Egyptian government went to court in Britain to pursue the private
dealer who later bought the piece, but he maintained he didn't have to return it
because it was a fake.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests by the British Museum proved it was genuine and the man relinquished
it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The return of the head today represents a further step'' in the two
countries' efforts to stamp out ``the illegal and sinister trade of cultural
artifacts,'' Egyptian Ambassador Adel El-Gazzar said at the handover at the
museum.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Egypt considers such ancient splendors ``a heritage for all
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
	   British police say the international trade in looted antiquities is worth
$160 million a year, and that many pieces are stolen for the purpose of
laundering money.
</P>
<P>
	   Vivian Davies, curator of the British Museum's Egyptian department, said the
head was ``a substantial Egyptian antiquity'' but would not say how much it is
worth.
</P>
<P>
	   In its original state, it would have had a gilded bronze feather headdress
up to 3 feet high and it would have been set in ``a major temple in Egypt,''
Davies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Briton Jonathan Tokeley-Parry was sentenced to six years in prison in 1997
for smuggling in the piece and other precious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole issue about whether it should be returned to Egypt was pinned on
whether it was an original because its owner claimed that it was a fake,'' said
museum spokeswoman Frances Dunkel. ``We have been able to prove that it was an
original.''
</P>
<P>
	   The owner was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum director Dr. Robert Anderson said the case has no parallels with the
disputed Elgin Marbles, sculptures from the Parthenon in Athens, which Greece
wants the museum to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said the marbles were brought to Britain ``as an act of
preservation'' in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin, the British ambassador
to the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of the Nefertari statue, museum experts using microscopes and
ultraviolet light discovered the face had been covered with stone drilled out of
the core of the piece.
</P>
<P>
	   The new face was painted and artificially ``aged'' to give it a weathered
and damaged appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Under ultraviolet light the lines between bits of stone on the new face
became evident, and the face and neck appeared as a patchwork of stone sections.
Restoration work will be left to experts in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts say the head, with a small section of shoulders and chest, was
broken off from a nearly life-size statue. The head is made of gray and white
marble.
</P>
<P>
	   The smaller temple at Abu Simbel is dedicated to Nefertari, who lived from
around 1300 B.C. to 1250 B.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Her elaborate rock tomb was the largest and most beautifully decorated in
the Valley of the Queens, lined with magnificent wall paintings that have been
restored by the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ruling May Help Investors  </HEADLINE>
    By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- In a positive sign for investors' rights in Russia, foreign
shareholders of the renowned Lomonosov porcelain factory in St. Petersburg have
gained control of the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign investors, who hold 83 percent of the shares in the company,
dismissed the Russian director on Thursday and appointed an American as general
director. The 255-year-old factory, which was founded by a daughter of Peter the
Great and once a maker of fine china for the czars, embodies the problems such
investors confront in Russia's unstable business environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the foreigners' majority, courts had barred holding a shareholders'
meeting for nearly two years. The shareholders, meanwhile, wanted to replace the
company's Soviet-era management.
</P>
<P>
	   Then in October, a court ruled to re-nationalize some of the company's
physical property.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first ruling of its kind since wide privatization began in 1992
and many observers saw it as a precedent that would further discourage
already-leery foreign investors from putting up money that Russia badly needs to
overhaul crumbling factories and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a judge overruled a previous injunction against a shareholders'
meeting. Five minutes later, the shareholders met and immediately dismissed
Russian director Yevgeny Barkov, said Douglas Boyce, who was chosen as the
factory's new general director.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the end of our retreat," he said. But he noted that the issue of
re-nationalization remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
	   The foreign investors' getting the upper hand in the management dispute
solidifies foreign control over what Boyce described as some of the company's
most valuable assets: the contracts with the artists and craftspeople who make
the china.
</P>
<P>
	   Major shareholders include several executives from the U.S. investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, along with the United States-Russia Investment Fund, a
U.S. government investment program aimed at providing assistance for Russia's
stumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The two groups together hold 58 percent of the shares, for which they paid
$8.25 million. Other foreign and offshore funds control another 25 percent, said
Boyce.
</P>
<P>
	   Lomonosov produces fine china tea sets and dishes, some hand-painted and
gilded with precious metals. Homemakers in Russia speak lovingly of Lomonosov
products, which still sell briskly here.
</P>
<P>
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, foreign investors bought about 60
percent of the shares in Lomonosov, which had sales of about $7 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In another case resolved in favor of foreign investors, a Russian paper mill
near St. Petersburg, where workers had clashed with troops in a dispute over
British ownership of the plant, opened its doors to the owners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers at the plant in Vyborg, 60 miles northwest of St. Petersburg,
welcomed officials from Vyborg Cellulose, a unit established by Britain's ALCEM
company which controls 87-percent of the mill's stock, the news agency ITAR-Tass
reported.

<HEADLINE> Pratt &AMP; Whitney Cuts More Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jet engine-maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney is eliminating
1,700 additional jobs, the vast majority of them from its Connecticut-based
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs the company has
been in the process of eliminating since it started a major restructuring and
consolidation effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan today cited a dramatic drop-off in demand for
jet engines over the past three years as the major reason for the downsizing.
The company will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,500 cuts will come from the hourly work force, mostly line workers
in the company's East Hartford and North Haven plants, Sullivan said. The
remaining 200 cuts will come from salaried workers who support those line
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Georgia and Maine, where we also have manufacturing facilities, the
impact will be minimal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company has no news plans to close any manufacturing
facilities. The company had previously announced it would be moving its military
jet engine business and 2,800 jobs from Florida to Connecticut as part of its
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a United Technologies Co. division, designs, manufactures
and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of UTC were trading up 43 3/4 cents to $59.75 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Research Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said today a $2.8 billion boost
in basic scientific and medical research will help Americans live longer,
healthier lives and help continue the current economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not done a good enough job helping all Americans to understand why
we need very, very large investments in science and technology,'' Clinton said
during an address to students and administrators at the California Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House said Clinton's budget for fiscal 2001 would include a major
new investment in a fund aimed at boosting university research in several
critical fields, including cancer, diabetes and AIDS, and promoting development
of super-fast computer technology.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to advances in health and medicine that Americans almost take
for granted now, university research helped propel the growth of the Internet,
which ``has changed everything,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion of information technology and Internet-related businesses is
in large part the reason for the nation's sustained and remarkable economic
growth, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``University-based research provides the kind of fundamental insights that
are most important in any new technology or treatment,'' Clinton said. ``It
helps to produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
and we intend to give university-based research a major lift.''
</P>
<P>
	   While in the Los Angeles area, Clinton also planned to attend two
fund-raising events to benefit the Democratic National Committee. He may also
get in a round or two of golf.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, Clinton, administration officials and allies on Capitol Hill
have been disclosing pieces of the 2001 budget that the president will present
to Congress on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Major elements of the new proposal include:
</P>
<P>
	   --A $1 billion increase in biomedical research at the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
	   --A $675 million increase in spending for the National Science Foundation. A
White House official said, that if approved, the new spending level will
``double the largest dollar increase ever in the history of the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   --$475 million for a nanotechnology initiative. This could lead, the White
House official said, ``to the ability to store the contents of the Library of
Congress in a device the size of a sugar cube.'' Nanotechnology is a new field
that proponents hope will lead to the development of atom-sized devices and
machines.
</P>
<P>
	   --More than $500 million for information technology research. The White
House official said this could lead to the development of a super-fast super
computer that could predict tornadoes and hurricanes more rapidly and have other
important practical applications.

<HEADLINE> Dec. Budget Posts $33B Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government recorded a budget surplus of $33.08 billion
in December helped along by a flow of tax payments, the Treasury Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   That compared with a $5.16 billion deficit posted for December 1998. That
deficit stemmed from two Social Security payments made that month because the
payment date for January fell on a weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for December 1999 totaled $201.2 billion while expenditures came to
$168.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   December's surplus was bigger than the $31 billion many analysts were
anticipating and the $32.5 billion projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first three months of fiscal year 2000, which began Oct. 1, the
government is running a deficit of $20.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   A budget surplus still is expected for all of 2000, however. The Clinton
administration is predicting a $142.5 billion surplus for fiscal 2000, while the
CBO is expecting $161 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the government reported a
record surplus of $124.4 billion, slightly more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 surplus followed a $69.2 billion surplus in 1998, the first time
the government finished in the black since 1969. The back-to-back annual
surpluses were the first since 1956 and 1957 under President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
	   If a surplus materializes for fiscal 2000 as expected, it would be the first
time the government reported three consecutive years of surpluses since 1947,
1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   The government revised November's deficit to $27.03 billion, slightly less
than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the biggest spending categories were: interest on the public
debt, $73.27 billion; Social Security, $37.72 billion; Health and Human Services
Department programs, $36.63 billion; and military spending, $29.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Government revenue from individual income tax payments in December came to
$94.54 billion, compared with $75.99 billion for the same month in 1998.
Corporate income tax payments totaled $44.95 billion in December, up from $42.37
billion in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Upstate braces for weekend cold, but still recovering from Thursday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Still reeling from the fender benders and icy road
conditions following Thursday's snow, upstate New Yorkers were hit Friday by
wind-driven subzero temperatures that were forecast to linger into the weekend.
<P>
	   Temperatures between 5 degrees above to 10 below are expected for Saturday
with a wind-chill of about 40 below zero in the Albany area, according to the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
	   "Upstate New York was lucky during the first part of the winter because most
weather fronts were moving from east to west," Hugh Johnson, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service, said. "Now the weather is moving from the
Northwest - Alaska and parts of western Canada - to the East."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout central and western portions of the state, lows are expected to
dip into the negative digits on Saturday to as low as 15 below with the
possibility of some snow on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, Ron Russeau, the operations manager for Central Service Center
Towing, said that his company had taken about 400 calls a day for the last three
days.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of my people have been working 18 hour shifts, and I've got all of my
18 trucks on the road," Russeau said. "With the weather getting even colder,
we're expecting even more jump starts and tows over the weekend."
</P>
<P>
	   In Syracuse, where thermometers hit zero Friday, schools canceled classes
and local hospitals publicly advised parents to keep their children indoors as
strong winds made it feel more like minus 15 to minus 30.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would really not recommend that children be outside on a day like today,"
said Dr. Deborah Mann at University Hospital. "They are a greater risk of
developing both frostbite and hypothermia. They are not as self-aware as adults
are. They may not come in when they have warning signs."
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Pearson was making a quick dash from his office to an ATM machine down
the street. The block was deserted except for Pearson. He was bundled up to the
neck but wasn't wearing a hat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I left it in the car and I'm paying for it. My ears are freezing. When the
wind blows it hurts," said Pearson, who didn't want to stand around long
talking.
</P>
<P>
	   While mostly everyone was staying out of the flesh-numbing cold, there were
some people who welcomed subzero temperatures. Bill Mikolay was one.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been patiently waiting this winter for Oneida Lake to freeze over to
go ice fishing. The last open water on the lake finally turned to ice this week,
marking the second-latest date in the past 25 winters that the lake has frozen
over for the season, according to the Cornell University Biological Field
Station. The latest date was two years ago when the lake didn't freeze
completely until Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems the longer you wait the better it feels," Mikolay said as he
headed out to his fishing shelter. "Every moment is precious, it seems, across
the lake."
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, temperatures are expected to take a nose dive again, dropping
to zero and below on Saturday. The wind-chill will make it feel even colder.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's cold followed about 7.5 inches of snow at the Greater Rochester
International Airport on Thursday. The snow slowed traffic on area expressways
to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
	   At Fort Drum, near Watertown, Army Cpl. Jeremy W. Peters slid a black wool
Army ski mask over his face Friday morning to block out the 1-degree weather
before running 3 miles with his squad for physical training.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to make sure all exposed skin is covered," said Peters.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers and commanders said they take extra precautions when the
temperatures dip as low as they've been the last few days. Besides his ski mask,
Peters wore three layers of shirts, sweatshirts and thermal underwear beneath
his gray Army jogging suit and a wool cap over the mask. He also had Gortex
gloves.

	   Caterpillar Earnings Beat Forecasts
</P>
<P>
	   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. today reported a 21 percent
drop in quarterly earnings from a year ago. It blamed declines in
sales and prices, especially in North America and Latin America.
The world's largest maker of construction equipment said its net
income for the October-December period was $239 million, or 67
cents a share, down from $301 million, or 83 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue was $5.02 billion for the quarter, down from $5.41
billion in the final quarter of 1998. Caterpillar stock was up  1/8 at

	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Jet engine-maker Pratt &AMP; Whitney is
eliminating 1,700 additional jobs, the vast majority of them from
its Connecticut-based manufacturing plants. The cuts are in
addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs the company has been in
the process of eliminating since it started a major restructuring
and consolidation effort in 1998. Pratt cited a dramatic drop-off
in demand for jet engines over the past three years as the major
reason for the downsizing. Stock in Pratt &AMP; Whitney's parent

recent moves indicating that it is only a matter of time before
they join the euro. Still, it is likely to take several years for
the two nations' governments to convince the public of the benefits
of joining the European Monetary Union. Leaders of Sweden's ruling
Social Democratic Party proposed today that this year's party
congress in March endorse adopting the euro. And Danish Prime
Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has said the nation will face
referendum on the euro before the next parliamentary elections,
which will be held by no later than spring 2002.

payment on bonds issued through Chase Manhattan Bank Luxembourg SA,

failure to make the payment on the dollar-denominated bonds,
scheduled for Thursday, gave creditors the right to announce a

the exchange offer on the same basis as the country's other

London-based investment bank ING Barings that represents Ukraine as
the lead manager of its debt restructuring program. The debt

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Stocks were mixed today as investors again moved their money
from industrial companies to the technology issues that are leading the Nasdaq
stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 87.18 at 11,264.12, extending Thursday's 138-point
drop.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was up 37.95 at 4,227.46
after closing at record highs Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were barely changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength.

	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq also drew some buyers as investors moved money away from older,
cyclical stocks that are sensitive to fluctuations in inflation. A rise in crude
oil prices this week has rekindled fears that burgeoning signs of inflation
could convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more often or more
sharply than currently anticipated.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have surged more than $4 a
barrel in the past week after members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said they wouldn't boost output as expected in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase in oil prices helped Exxon Mobil, which gained 1 to 84 11/16.
Chevron rose 1 3/8 to 88 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no government economic reports to steer the market, and the only
major development among the 30 companies that comprise the Dow was a strong
fourth-quarter report by Caterpillar. Shares of the heavy equipment maker rose 
1/2 to 47 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged 11 3/8 to 101 3/16 amid reports the consumer
products maker is considering buying drugmaker Warner-Lambert. Shares of the
consumer products company have tumbled this week as investors debated how much a
bold move to acquire a leading drug company would hurt its earnings.

<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems fell 1 9/16 to 85 despite a
better-than-expected profit report late Thursday by the producer of hardware and

<HEADLINE> Obstetrician carved his initials in mom's abdomen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan doctor delivered a baby by Caesarian
section, then used his scalpel for the unkindest cut of all: He carved his
initials into the mother's abdomen.
<P>
	   Dr. Allan Zarkin - later dubbed Dr. Zorro - "felt very close to this woman,
but something clicked on and off in his brain," his lawyer, Kenneth Platzer,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Liana Gedz is now suing the 61-year-old obstetrician for $5 million, saying
the 3-by-1 1/2-inch letters "A" and "Z" he left on her skin "makes me feel like
a branded animal."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin cut his initials into his sedated patient an inch above her Caesarian
incision, just after delivering her baby girl on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's acknowledged he did that," Platzer said. But the doctor was mentally
impaired at the time, his attorney said, "and this was a bizarre, unexplainable
event."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, he said, suffers from a "frontal lobe disorder" called Pick's
disease - a progressive form of Alzheimer's-like dementia characterized by
personality changes and inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctor had no ill will, no malice, no intent to harm the patient. I
would call it a cerebral dysfunction brought on by an illness," said Platzer,
adding that his client is being treated by a psychiatrist and a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz, a 31-year-old dentist, said the initials "were carved in such a manner
as to be permanent," according to her lawsuit in Manhattan state Supreme Court,
which was made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt like I was raped," she told the Daily News. And now, with the scar
that has turned into an unsightly welt, "I'm so embarrassed to get undressed in
front of my husband because I have another man's initials on my stomach."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband, Robert Ghalili, an oral surgeon, also is named as a plaintiff.
He's asking $500,000 in personal damages caused by the scarring of his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is also suing Beth Israel Medical Center, where the child was
delivered, and New York Gyn/Ob Associates, Zarkin's medical group.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital suspended Zarkin's right to practice immediately following the
incident and reported him to health authorities. Beth Israel issued a statement
saying it "took action at once when it learned of (Zarkin's) outrageous
actions," reporting the incident to state health officials.
</P>
<P>
	   After the delivery - at which both Gedz's husband and her mother were
present - witnesses in the operating room reportedly told the authorities that
Zarkin announced: "I did such a beautiful job, I'll initial it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital staff later dubbed him Dr. Zorro.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend had recommended the doctor to the pregnant woman, and she was so
pleased with the prenatal care that she and her husband invited Zarkin to visit
them at their Long Island country home. "He became a close friend," she told the
News. "I don't understand why he did this."
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz and Zarkin were not available for comment Friday, according to their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor had never before harmed any other patient, his lawyer said,
though the Manhattan district attorney's office "is investigating a doctor at
the Beth Israel for several incidents involving patients," said Barbara
Thompson, spokeswoman for the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
	   She said no charges have been filed against Zarkin and would not describe
the other incidents. Disfiguring someone with a dangerous instrument is
considered first-degree assault, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Platzer, who specializes in medical malpractice law, insisted his client did
not commit "a criminal act" because he is mentally impaired.
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney Robert Sullivan, who represents Gedz, said the illness "sounds
like a diagnosis for the convenience of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "How could this man with Pick's be performing major surgery for 30 years,
and now, a month after this assault, they send him for tests and he has a
frontal lobe disorder?"

<HEADLINE> Court To Review Open-Primary Law  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether
states can let voters cross party lines in primary elections, even over the
political parties' objections.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear an appeal by four California political parties -- the
Democratic Party, Republican Party, Libertarian Party and Peace and Freedom
Party -- that say the state's ``blanket primary'' law violates their members'
right to choose their own nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think it should be closed or at a minimum the parties should have the
discretion to decide whether to open the primary,'' California Republican Party
lawyer Charles H. Bell Jr. said after the nation's highest court agreed to hear
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties say the blanket primary law, overwhelmingly approved by
California voters in 1996, violates their constitutional right of political
association.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will hear arguments in April, and a decision is expected by
July.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other states -- Alaska, Louisiana and Washington -- have similar
primary laws. A number of other states have more limited open-primary laws, in
which voters can request the ballot of any political party in a primary
election.
</P>
<P>
	   The blanket-primary law does not apply to California's presidential primary
to be held March 7. Only votes cast within a voter's own political party will
count toward choosing presidential convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   But the law does affect nominating votes to be held in March for other
offices such as U.S. Congress and state legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   The law lets voters cast their ballots in primary elections for any
candidate of any party. For example, someone could vote to nominate a Republican
candidate for governor, a Democrat for senator and a Libertarian for attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, California allowed only voters who were members of a political
party to vote in that party's primary to nominate candidates for the general
election.
</P>
<P>
	   California used the blanket-primary system in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the blanket primary said it would encourage the nomination of
more moderate candidates. And that's what upsets some opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It certainly tugs them (candidates) in the direction of campaigning to the
entire electorate in a primary,'' said Bell, the Republicans' lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you campaign to the whole electorate, you don't pin down your base,''
Bell said, adding that some people believe that may have been a factor in
Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren's decisive defeat by Democrat
Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge upheld the California law in 1997, and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal granted Supreme Court review, the four parties' lawyers said
choosing a nominee ``is inextricably linked to defining a party's ideology. By
inviting nonmembers to participate in the primary, (the law) will allow
outsiders to determine a party's ideology.''
</P>
<P>
	   The state's lawyers said the law gives voters more choices and produces
election results ``that are more closely aligned with true voter preferences.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in a Minnesota case that the state could
bar candidates from running in general elections under more than one party's
banner.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By PAISLEY DODDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived today in New York,
where they plan to press for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   A plane carrying the women and a delegation of U.S. church officials arrived
at Kennedy International Airport, and a news conference was planned. A small
welcoming committee was allowed to greet the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Cuba, Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches, said the grandmothers made the trip to ``make an appeal to the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before boarding the plane, the women kissed and embraced Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past 24 hours we have been in delicate and emotional conversations
with Elian Gonzalez's family, a loving family,'' Edgar said before the plane
took off. ``We are very pleased that Elian's grandmothers have agreed to
accompany us to New York City to have an opportunity to speak to the American
public, particularly to ask that Elian Gonzalez come home.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were waiting for them,'' Gonzalez said. But he said the family has had
no contact with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow the women to take
the boy back to Cuba.

<P>
	   ``That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem,'' he said. ``The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might help convince skeptics that the family really does want the
boy back. Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return is
made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's communist
government will hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington had said the grandmothers
were expected meet with Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York. They said
New York was chosen to avoid Miami, where there were disturbances over earlier
proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me `Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, `Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King recused himself
from the case. King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and
a daughter who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

<HEADLINE> Records of dormitory fire drills sought by investigators  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Investigators attempting to determine the
cause of a fire that killed three Seton Hall University freshmen in their
dormitory are seeking records about the building, including reports on whether
required fire drills were conducted, officials said Friday.
<P>
	   Seton Hall students said they cannot recall any drills at Boland Hall, the
six-story dormitory for 640 freshmen where the fire broke out before dawn on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Six of the 58 injured students remained hospitalized Friday, including four
in critical condition with serious burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes at the 10,000-student Roman Catholic school are to resume Tuesday
afternoon, following a memorial service in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Lisa E. Grider said Boland had no drills in the fall
semester.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were fire education programs, where the (resident assistant) posts
the fire evacuation plan and talks in a meeting with students," Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   She could not immediately say how many programs had been conducted, or
whether the school had records on fire drills.
</P>
<P>
	   Two sophomores on the campus Friday were dismissive of university fire
procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have any drills when we lived in Boland last year," said Vordana
Ruggeri, 19, of Somerset, who now lives in Xavier Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Bobb Barber, 19, of Millville, "They don't even wake us up when the
alarm goes off."
</P>
<P>
	   Students have evacuated Boland during the 18 alarms that have rung at the
hall since September, but in only one instance was there a fire, in a nearby
trash bin, Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if the planning sessions and 18 alarms gave students sufficient
emergency practice, Grider said, "Put that information to your readers and let
them decide for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   False alarms are no replacement for organized, planned drills, said William
Cane, director of the state Division of Fire Safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be monitored by the administration, or the fire official, or
both," said Cane.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the fire education programs could be considered part of a drill.
</P>
<P>
	   College dormitories in New Jersey have been required since at least 1995 to
have two fire drills a year and maintain reports about the drills for the local
fire official, under the state Uniform Fire Code, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since January 1999, those reports had to be filed with the local fire
official, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said his office has not yet inspected the university's records
subpoenaed by an Essex County grand jury, so he could not say whether the papers
included reports of drills.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Orange, the fire official is also the fire chief, Jeffrey Markey,
said township attorney Edwin A. Matthews.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews could not immediately say if Markey ever received reports on fire
drills. He declined to make the chief available for an interview, citing
Markey's role in the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The grand jury has subpoenaed fire inspection records and engineering plans
for Boland Hall, said Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant Essex County
prosecutor. She could not discuss the contents of the records.
</P>
<P>
	   No cause has yet been determined for the fire, and no charges or arrests
have been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not know whether investigators had identified or located three
young men who were asked to leave Boland 45 minutes before the fire alarms
sounded. A dorm staffer, realizing they were not residents of Boland Hall,
kicked them out of the lounge.
</P>
<P>
	   Boland Hall is one of two university dormitories without sprinklers. The
fatal fire prompted Gov. Christie Whitman to say she would consider legislation
requiring sprinklers in all college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall is also considering installing sprinklers in Boland, Grider has
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Funerals are scheduled Monday for the three victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of
West Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook.
All were 18-year-old freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   The school postponed athletic events after the fire. The men's basketball
game at No. 6 Syracuse was rescheduled for 7 p.m. Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Essex County prosecutor's office has a toll-free hotline
for anyone with information on the cause of the fire. The 24-hour number is:
1-800-375-3829.

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived in New York
City this afternoon, planning to press their case for the 6-year-old boy's
return to Cuba.
<P>
	   A plane carrying the women and a delegation of U.S. church officials arrived
at Kennedy International Airport at about 3:40 p.m. and a news conference was
planned. A small welcoming committee was allowed to greet the group, but
reporters and other spectators were cleared from the immediate area by Port
Authority officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers - Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez, appeared to wince
from the 16-degree cold as the stepped off the airplane in trench coats.
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Cuba, Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches, said the grandmothers made the trip to "make an appeal to the American
people."
</P>
<P>
	   The women left Elian's father behind in Cuba, where the three parted with
kisses and an embrace.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the past 24 hours we have been in delicate and emotional conversations
with Elian Gonzalez's family, a loving family," Edgar said before the plane took
off. "We are very pleased that Elian's grandmothers have agreed to accompany us
to New York City to have an opportunity to speak to the American public,
particularly to ask that Elian Gonzalez come home."
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were waiting for them," Gonzalez said. But he said the family has had no
contact with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow the women to take the
boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem," he said. "The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might help convince U.S. skeptics that the family really does want
the boy back. Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return
is made under government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's communist
government will hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington had said New York was
chosen as the grandmothers' destination to avoid Miami, where Elian has been
living with his father's uncle for almost two months and where there were
disturbances over earlier proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Cuba's foreign minister visited Paris and accused the United
States of committing a "very serious" violation of Elian's human rights by not
returning him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think there is a real danger with regard to the issue because Congress
could give him American citizenship," Felipe Perez Roque said.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Panel Appointed in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A committee appointed Friday to advise the government on
development and use of genetically engineered crops will include organic
farmers, critics of biotech food, consumer advocates, scientists and executives
of major seed companies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is my hope that this group, which brings together people with a range
of perspectives and experiences, will engage in the kind of thoughtful and civil
debate on biotechnology that our country now needs,'' Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman appointed former Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, as chairman of the
38-member panel. So diverse are the views of the committee's members that USDA
plans to hire a professional facilitator to help Eckart manage the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee includes representatives of the Monsanto Co., General Mills
Inc., the Environmental Defense Fund, Organic Farming Research Foundation,
Consumer Federation of America, Rural Advancement Foundation International,
National Corn Growers Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's first meetings will be March 29-30 in Washington. The panel
is authorized to stay in operation for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman has also asked the National Academy of Sciences to review USDA's
approval process for genetically engineered crops. Critics say the agency has
approved new varieties without adequately testing their potential impact on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA is among several agencies involved in regulating biotech crops. Others
include the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection
Agency.

<HEADLINE> Child Soldiers Released in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Former fighters in Sierra Leone's brutal civil
war have released more than 400 child soldiers this week, aid officials and West
African peacekeepers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The releases followed charges that the former rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front and the former junta soldiers of the Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council, both of which fought the nation's civilian government, had reneged on
promises to free thousands of captive children under a peace deal signed last
July.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels and the junta soldiers are now both part of a fragile
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
	   The first group of 300 child soldiers, held by AFRC soldiers in the northern
town of Kabala, were released to the Catholic relief agency Caritas last
Saturday, said Ibrahim Sesay, the agency's director in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, all of them boys between 7 and 18 years old, would be transferred
to a Caritas-run care center in the Port Loko district, 60 miles west of
Freetown, to receive counseling, Sesay said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the West African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG said an
additional 100 child soldiers had arrived Thursday in Freetown. RUF rebels had
been holding them in Kabala for months.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 10,000-15,000 children, some as young as 6, were kidnapped
during Sierra Leone's eight-year war, most of them used as fighters, concubines
and manual laborers. Only a fraction of child soldiers have been set free, U.N.
and aid officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Sesay said the AFRC soldiers had told him they were still holding 450
children captive, pending instructions from ex-junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn prices rose to a new 3 1/2-month high Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after strong export sales were reported, while other
grains and soybeans were lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn drew support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly report on
export sales which showed higher numbers than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean prices budged only a little in consolidation trading ahead of the
weekend. Private estimates for record U.S. soybean plantings were offset by
mixed forecasts for key growing regions in South America.

	   Wheat recorded small losses despite forecasts for drier weather in the U.S.
winter wheat belt.

<HEADLINE> Obstetrician carved his initials in mom's abdomen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan doctor delivered a baby by Caesarian
section, then used his scalpel for the unkindest cut of all: He carved his
initials into the mother's abdomen.
<P>
	   Dr. Allan Zarkin - later dubbed Dr. Zorro - "felt very close to this woman,
but something clicked on and off in his brain," his lawyer, Kenneth Platzer,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Liana Gedz is now suing the 61-year-old obstetrician for $5 million, saying
the 3-by-1 1/2-inch letters "A" and "Z" he left on her skin "makes me feel like
a branded animal."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin cut his initials into his sedated patient an inch above her Caesarian
incision, just after delivering her baby girl on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's acknowledged he did that," Platzer said. But the doctor was mentally
impaired at the time, his attorney said, "and this was a bizarre, unexplainable
event."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, he said, suffers from a "frontal lobe disorder" called Pick's
disease - a progressive form of Alzheimer's-like dementia characterized by
personality changes and inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctor had no ill will, no malice, no intent to harm the patient. I
would call it a cerebral dysfunction brought on by an illness," said Platzer,
adding that his client is being treated by a psychiatrist and a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz, a 31-year-old dentist, said the initials "were carved in such a manner
as to be permanent," according to her lawsuit in Manhattan state Supreme Court,
which was made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt like I was raped," she told the Daily News. And now, with the scar
that has turned into an unsightly welt, "I'm so embarrassed to get undressed in
front of my husband because I have another man's initials on my stomach."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband, Robert Ghalili, an oral surgeon, also is named as a plaintiff.
He's asking $500,000 in personal damages caused by the scarring of his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is also suing Beth Israel Medical Center, where the child was
delivered, and New York Gyn/Ob Associates, Zarkin's medical group.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital suspended Zarkin's right to practice immediately following the
incident and reported him to health authorities. Beth Israel issued a statement
saying it "took action at once when it learned of (Zarkin's) outrageous
actions."
</P>
<P>
	   After the delivery - at which both Gedz's husband and her mother were
present - witnesses in the operating room reportedly told the authorities that
Zarkin announced: "I did such a beautiful job, I'll initial it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital staff later dubbed him Dr. Zorro.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend had recommended the doctor to the pregnant woman, and she was so
pleased with the prenatal care that she and her husband invited Zarkin to visit
them at their Long Island country home. "He became a close friend," she told the
News. "I don't understand why he did this."
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz and Zarkin were not available for comment Friday, according to their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor had never before harmed any other patient, his lawyer said,
though the Manhattan district attorney's office "is investigating a doctor at
the Beth Israel for several incidents involving patients," said Barbara
Thompson, spokeswoman for the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
	   She said no charges have been filed against Zarkin and would not describe
the other incidents. Disfiguring someone with a dangerous instrument is
considered first-degree assault, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Platzer, who specializes in medical malpractice law, insisted his client did
not commit "a criminal act" because he is mentally impaired.
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney Robert Sullivan, who represents Gedz, said the illness "sounds
like a diagnosis for the convenience of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "How could this man with Pick's be performing major surgery for 30 years,
and now, a month after this assault, they send him for tests and he has a
frontal lobe disorder?"

<HEADLINE> Court To Mull ADA for State Workers  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide by July
whether state employees are protected by a key federal anti-discrimination law,
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 11 days ago, the justices barred all state employees across the nation
from going into federal court to sue over age bias. Now, Florida officials are
urging them to rule that Congress likewise exceeded its power by giving all
state employees the right to sue in federal court over the ADA.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the Florida case in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Its Jan. 11 decision whittled away more of the federal government's power
over states, perpetuating a series of decisions legal scholars say comprise a
states' rights revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   That 5-4 ruling said Congress had exceeded its authority when allowing state
employees to sue their bosses under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
because the law cannot trump states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued
in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the justices ordered federal appeals courts in Illinois and New
York to restudy rulings that said states and their agencies must abide by a 1963
federal law that requires employers to give men and women equal pay for equal
work.
</P>
<P>
	   In those orders, the court said the courts should reconsider their decisions
in light of the Jan. 11 decision barring age-bias lawsuits in federal courts by
state employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida prison guard Wellington Dickson sued in federal court after failing
to get a promotion, saying he was discriminated against because of his age and
his heart condition. His lawsuit invoked the two laws aimed at discrimination
based on age and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   An Atlanta-based federal appeals court said his claims under both laws could
proceed to trial, but the Supreme Court reversed that part of the decision
dealing with the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities want the justices to also reverse the ADA portion of the
appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the complete absence of historical or widespread state violations of
the constitutional rights of the disabled, the broad scope of the ADA, with its
creation of greater rights for disabled persons than the Constitution provides,
clearly is an invalid exercise of Congress' ... power to enforce the 14th
Amendment against the states,'' the state's appeal contended.
</P>
<P>
	   The amendment guarantees equal protection of the laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration told the court that the disabilities law is
``distinctly more detailed and nuanced'' than the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional findings and evidence compiled ``provides a solid foundation
for Congress' conclusion that state and local governments, like private
employers, engage in unconstitutional discrimination against persons with
disabilities and that the problem is sufficiently entrenched and widespread to
require a national response,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In ruling that state employees cannot sue in federal court over age bias,
the court said Congress does not enjoy the same power to enforce the 14th
Amendment when seeking to protect older people as it does when the bias is based
on race or gender.
</P>
<P>
	   Laws and governmental policies that treat older people differently are
upheld as constitutional if courts find they are ``rationally related'' to some
legitimate objective, not a difficult standard to meet.
</P>
<P>
	   But laws and policies that treat someone differently because of race or
gender are subjected to more stringent review by courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices have never said that discrimination based on someone's
disabilities should be subjected to judicial scrutiny more stringent than the
rationality standard.

<HEADLINE> Man wanted for 1979 Florida slaying, arrested in upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Authorities arrested a 55-year-old marina owner
Thursday for the alleged 1979 murder of his wife.
<P>
	   Police found Alan Jeffrey Rhodes living under the name George Wilson in the
town of Glenville in Schenectady County where he has operated a business for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes faces a first-degree murder charge in Lee County on Florida's
southwest coast for the January 1979 stabbing death of his then-19-year-old wife
Shirley Pond Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
	   After he allegedly killed her, Rhodes put a diving weight belt around her
body and dumped her into the Gulf of Mexico, according to police. Her body
washed up on a beach on Sanibel Island on March 6, 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergeant Charles Ferranti of the Lee County Sheriff's Department's Fugitive
Squad says he tracked Rhodes to upstate New York by tracing a phone call made
from Florida after the recent death of Rhodes' father on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   When captured late Thursday night at his business, Ferranti said Rhodes
appeared as "though he was going to faint."
</P>
<P>
	   Police in Glenville say Rhodes owned and operated Wilson's Marina on the
Mohawk River for the past 20 years. They say people who know Rhodes can't
believe he's wanted for murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most people don't believe it," said Glenville Detective Sgt. Karl
Batzinger. "He's kind of laid back up here. He's been running his business for
20 years and is a good marine mechanic."
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes has been arraigned on a fugitive from justice charge and is being
held in Schenectady County Jail pending extradition.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Without Water in San Juan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- At least 500,000 residents were without water
Friday because of a failure the day before at a main pumping station.
</P>
<P>
	   If repairs continue at the current rate, only half of them would see service
restored by Sunday evening, Secretary of State Angel Morey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The station also provides drinking water to 52 hospitals, 278 schools and 52
hotels in the teeming capital city and surrounding towns of Carolina and
Trujillo Alto. Hotels and hospitals have switched to stored water, while the
University of Puerto Rico has canceled classes Friday for its 67,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders accustomed to storing water during the June-to-November hurricane
season in case of emergency were largely caught off guard by the sudden January
drought.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has set up tanker trucks to supply free drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Obstetrician carved his initials in mom's abdomen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan doctor delivered a baby by Caesarian
section, then used his scalpel for the unkindest cut of all: He carved his
initials into the mother's abdomen.
<P>
	   Dr. Allan Zarkin - later dubbed Dr. Zorro - "felt very close to this woman,
but something clicked on and off in his brain," his lawyer, Kenneth Platzer,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Liana Gedz is now suing the 61-year-old obstetrician for $5 million, saying
the 3-by-1 1/2-inch letters "A" and "Z" he left on her skin "makes me feel like
a branded animal."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin cut his initials into his sedated patient an inch above her Caesarian
incision, just after delivering her baby girl on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's acknowledged he did that," Platzer said. But the doctor was mentally
impaired at the time, his attorney said, "and this was a bizarre, unexplainable
event."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, he said, suffers from a "frontal lobe disorder" called Pick's
disease - a progressive form of Alzheimer's-like dementia characterized by
personality changes and inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctor had no ill will, no malice, no intent to harm the patient. I
would call it a cerebral dysfunction brought on by an illness," said Platzer,
adding that his client is being treated by a psychiatrist and a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz, a 31-year-old dentist, said the initials "were carved in such a manner
as to be permanent," according to her lawsuit in Manhattan state Supreme Court,
which was made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt like I was raped," she told the Daily News. And now, with the scar
that has turned into an unsightly welt, "I'm so embarrassed to get undressed in
front of my husband because I have another man's initials on my stomach."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband, Robert Ghalili, an oral surgeon, also is named as a plaintiff.
He's asking $500,000 in personal damages caused by the scarring of his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is also suing Beth Israel Medical Center, where the child was
delivered, and New York Gyn/Ob Associates, Zarkin's medical group.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital suspended Zarkin's right to practice immediately following the
incident and reported him to health authorities. Beth Israel issued a statement
saying it "took action at once when it learned of (Zarkin's) outrageous
actions."
</P>
<P>
	   After the delivery - at which both Gedz's husband and her mother were
present - witnesses in the operating room reportedly told the authorities that
Zarkin announced: "I did such a beautiful job, I'll initial it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hospital staff later dubbed him Dr. Zorro.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend had recommended the doctor to the pregnant woman, and she was so
pleased with the prenatal care that she and her husband invited Zarkin to visit
them at their Long Island country home. "He became a close friend," she told the
News. "I don't understand why he did this."
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz and Zarkin were not available for comment Friday, according to their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor had never before harmed any other patient, his lawyer said,
though the Manhattan district attorney's office "is investigating a doctor at
the Beth Israel for several incidents involving patients," said Barbara
Thompson, spokeswoman for the DA's office.
</P>
<P>
	   She said no charges have been filed against Zarkin and would not describe
the other incidents. Disfiguring someone with a dangerous instrument is
considered first-degree assault, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Platzer, who specializes in medical malpractice law, insisted his client did
not commit "a criminal act" because he is mentally impaired.
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney Robert Sullivan, who represents Gedz, said the illness "sounds
like a diagnosis for the convenience of litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "How could this man with Pick's be performing major surgery for 30 years,
and now, a month after this assault, they send him for tests and he has a
frontal lobe disorder?"

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager to accompany their grandson back to his native
Cuba, the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez arrived Friday in New York
intent on appealing directly to the American people for his return.
<P>
	   The grandmothers, accompanied by a three-member U.S. church delegation,
opted to fly over the boy's temporary Miami home and instead bring their message
to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Their grandson, the subject of both a personal battle for custody between
family members and a political tug-of-war between the Castro regime and
expatriate Cubans, is living in Florida with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carrying Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez arrived in New York
shortly after 3:30 p.m., about three hours after it took off from their
homeland. A news conference was scheduled for Friday afternoon; it was not
immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' arrival may
convince skeptics of the family's sincerity. Some anti-Castro activists
suggested the Cuban government pressured the women into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, before boarding the plane without him. They left for New
York after meeting over 24 hours with representatives of the National Council of
Churches, which favors the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's
grandmothers. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mrs. Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could fly back with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot
power boat, became an international cause celebre when he was found Nov. 25
while floating on an inner tube two miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother and 10 other Cubans died when the ill-fated boat capsized on its
way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no plans to allow a New York reunion between the boy and his
grandmothers, although the women were welcome in Miami, said Elian's great-uncle
Delfin Gonzalez, who wants the boy to stay in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the 6-year-old in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez said the visit by the grandmothers will not affect his resolution
to keep Elian in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
But attorneys for the family in Florida accused the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Talks Between Korean Rivals Set  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With North Korea showing interest in abandoning its
self-imposed isolation, the communist regime will hold talks with State
Department officials starting Saturday on the possibility of dispatching a
senior envoy to Washington for a groundbreaking visit.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said Friday the administration is eagerly looking forward to
North Korea reciprocating a visit to Pyongyang by former Defense Secretary
William Perry, who traveled there last May in his capacity as presidential
emissary.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea has been among the world's most reclusive countries but lately
it has reached out diplomatically to Italy, Australia and Japan -- all military
allies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Last September, the United States lifted some sanctions that had been in
place against North Korea after Pyongyang agreed to forgo a test of a long-range
missile capable of reaching U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea conditioned the concession on U.S. willingness to continue
bilateral discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   They will resume on Saturday in Berlin with Ambassador Charles Kartman, the
State Department's chief Korea specialist, heading the U.S. delegation and Vice
Foreign Minister Gye Gwan representing North Korea. The location of the talks in
Berlin has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Berlin has been used before as a site for discussions, partly because both
sides find it mutually convenient.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim has visited Washington as part of the official dialogue. North Korea has
not indicated whom it might send to Washington to reciprocate the Perry visit
but speculation has centered on Kang Sok Ju, a Foreign Ministry official who
outranks Kim. Kang was Perry's main contact during the talks last May in
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its outreach policy, North Korea established diplomatic relations
with Italy on Jan. 1 and may do the same with Japan. Next month, a delegation
from Australia will visit Pyongyang for the first time since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and North Korea agreed in principle to open offices in
each other's capital five years ago, but the process has been bogged down by
technical issues such as how the respective missions will be resupplied.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea watcher at the American Enterprise Institute,
said the friendlier face that the Koreans are showing should not signal a change
in objectives.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea still wants to reunify the Korean Peninsula on its own terms but
needs the help of the West, particularly western financial institutions, to
revitalize its failing economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea wants to have good relations with the West and at the same time
do as it pleases, namely, develop weapons of mass destruction in order to
intimidate the south, Eberhardt said.

<HEADLINE> Digging for Mass Graves Ends  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN GUGGENHEIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) -- The only signs that La Campana ranch was
recently a focus of world attention are discarded foam coffee cups, spent
batteries and a few bored soldiers standing guard outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The digging has stopped, and there is no more talk of finding the bodies of
100 Mexicans and Americans in mass graves just over the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
	   What remains are questions: Were the expectations of finding so many bodies
in mass graves overblown? And, if the 100 people missing in the Juarez area
aren't in the mass graves, where are they?
</P>
<P>
	   The end of the digging was casually announced Thursday by Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo during a news conference. The two-month, joint Mexican-FBI
investigation had turned up nine bodies and a drug laboratory at three sites.
</P>
<P>
	   It was an anticlimactic ending to a sensational story that grabbed headlines
worldwide, with talk of a killing field right across the border from El Paso,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the titillation factor of wanting to see the border as a grade-B
movie about the drug trade,'' said John Amastae, director of the Center for
Inter-American and Border Studies at the University of Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
	   The news broke Nov. 29, with U.S. law enforcement officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, telling reporters that an informant had said as many as
100 bodies might be buried in Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the head of the Mexican attorney general's organized crime unit, Jose
Larrieta Carrasco, told The Associated Press on Thursday that no informant had
ever used that figure to either Mexican or U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Madrazo had acknowledged that 100 people were missing in the Juarez area,
but repeatedly said he did not know how many might be buried in the graves. The
FBI also did not give a figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The FBI never speculated,'' spokesman Jim Davis said. ``The notion that
the FBI was shooting its mouth off just isn't accurate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. and Mexican officials did little at first to counter speculation
that so many bodies might be found. Madrazo, for example, said in a television
interview on Nov. 30 that ``there is a list of 22 U.S. citizens that could be
... in those sites that we are now searching.''
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't until two days later that Madrazo expressed concern in an
interview about the ``enormous speculation'' and ``frankly extravagant
numbers,'' which he described as ``very far from reality.''
</P>
<P>
	   The scope of the investigation also indicated that authorities were looking
for something big. Hundreds of Mexican police worked with dozens of FBI agents
in a rare joint operation. FBI director Louis Freeh visited one of the sites and
held a joint news conference with Madrazo. And President Clinton spoke of the
mass graves as a ``horrible example of drug violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The comments made by both U.S. and Mexican authorities were totally
removed from reality,'' Ciudad Juarez Mayor Gustavo Elizardo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the same investigation could have been conducted by far fewer people
with a much lower profile. Publicity from the digging has hurt tourism and
investment in Ciudad Juarez, he said. The city has suffered years of bad press
because of a series of killings of young women and because the Juarez drug
organization was based there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that both authorities -- Mexican and U.S. -- ought to be more
careful in their declarations to avoid the psychosis they caused in the city and
the alarm throughout the world,'' Elizardo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both U.S. and Mexican officials say they're not disappointed with the
results of the investigation. Mexican authorities say seven bodies have been
identified and appear to be victims of the Juarez-based drug organization of the
Carrillo Fuentes family. Five suspects have been detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the many disappearances in the Juarez area remain unresolved. Official
figures put the number of people missing at 100; some private groups say it is
more than 200.	   ``They have to be somewhere,'' said Guadalupe Ramirez of the
Independent Chihuahua State Committee for the Defense of Human Rights. ``They
couldn't have just disappeared.''

<HEADLINE> Snow Blocking East European Roads  </HEADLINE>
   By MIHAELA ARMASELU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- An avalanche blocked the entrances to a uranium
mine Friday in western Romania, trapping 120 people below ground after as much
as eight feet of snow blanketed Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 feet of snow also covered the machines needed to clear the
entrances, said Lt. Col. Petru Catana of the Civilian Protection Corps in the
city of Oradea.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Baita-Plai mine were able to communicate with the 120
trapped workers by telephone. The miners said they had enough water and heat,
but had run out of food, Catana said. Several specialists were dispatched from
Oradea to help free the miners.
</P>
<P>
	   Drifting snow also collapsed more than 100 homes in northern Romania on
Friday and forced police to close checkpoints on the borders with Hungary and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mediafax news agency reported that more than 100 Gypsy families were
moved onto a stationary train after their homes in Targu Lapus collapsed. A
dozen houses also collapsed under the weight of the snow around the village of
Coroieni, 270 miles northwest of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowstorms also blocked traffic on several roads, mainly in central and
northern Romania, isolating dozens of villages in the counties of Bihor, Satu
Mare, Cluj, Salaj and Mures, Romania's traffic police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Near the borders with Hungary and Ukraine, ``the snow blanket reached (eight
feet) and we lost contact with our people ... along the border,'' said Col.
Petru Tiplea, spokesman for Romania's border police. He said the borders were
declared closed after contact was lost and many border officers could not reach
their checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm also cut water and electricity to 50,000 people in Miercurea
Ciuc city, 140 miles north of Bucharest, civil defense authorities said. More
than 500 villages across the country were without electricity, the national
electric company, Conel, reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Czech Republic, a state of emergency was declared in one of the
country's eastern districts after it was paralyzed by snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've called the army to help us cope with the calamity,'' said Frantisek
Jonas from the district council in Trebic, 125 miles southeast of Prague. He
said traffic was blocked due to snow and several cars were stuck on the roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic on the main D-1 highway, linking the country with Slovakia and
Austria, was ``hopelessly blocked with hundreds of cars in each direction,
waiting for snowplows to make the road passable,'' a highway police spokesman
said. In several sections of the highway, traffic jams stretched for six miles.
</P>
<P>
	   The engine of a local passenger train derailed in the south of the country
on a railway line covered with snow, blocking rail traffic for the entire day,
Czech rail authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency also was declared in several regions of northeastern
Slovakia, after snowfall stalled traffic, media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   An avalanche blocked a railway line connecting the northern towns of
Kralovany and Trstena, interrupting train service for the day, and avalanche
warnings were issued for mountainous regions of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miskolc, 100 miles east of Budapest, heavy snowfall, accompanied by
lightning, thunder and 60-mph winds walloped the city, the state news agency MTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds of up to 95 mph were clocked overnight in Austria. Heavy snowfall
hindered traffic in the central part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Blamed on Basque Separatists  </HEADLINE>
   By MAR ROMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Hopes for an end to Basque separatist violence in
Spain vanished Friday when two car bombs exploded in a Madrid neighborhood,
killing an army officer and ending a 19-month lull in such attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Police immediately blamed the bombings on the Basque separatist group ETA,
which ended a cease-fire last month after failing to win government concessions.
Investigators said the attacks had all the hallmarks of the ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility, police reported
last month that they had intercepted two ETA-linked cars carrying 3,300 pounds
of explosives to Madrid. The group often waits weeks before claiming
responsibility for an attack. The last attack attributed to the ETA was the
killing of a governing party official on June 25, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar condemned Friday's attack and vowed the
government would not yield in its fight against ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When ETA announced it was ending the pause in its terrorist activity, I
said ETA was making a mistake,'' Aznar said in a television broadcast. ``Now is
the time to show ETA the consequences of its error.''
</P>
<P>
	   As darkness fell, more than 3,000 people gathered in downtown Madrid's
Puerta del Sol plaza to protest the bombings. The rally was supposed to start
with a silent vigil, but there were spontaneous outbursts as some in the crowd
shouted ``ETA are murderers!'' and ``We want justice!'' Protesters carried
banners that read, ``Basques, yes; ETA, no''.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar rallies drawing several thousand people were held in the Basque
cities of Bilbao, San Sebastian and Vitoria, and smaller ones took place in
Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza and Valladolid. A major rally is scheduled for
Sunday in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
	   The party seen as ETA's political wing, Euskal Herritarrok, did not condemn
the attack, saying only it ``lamented'' the killing and blamed both sides for
failing to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
	   The party held rallies attended by several hundred people in San Sebastian
and Vitoria Friday night. Riot police with shields and clubs deployed to
separate them from those attending the peace demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than a week ago, tens of thousands of Basque citizens in Bilbao
attended the latest in a series of rallies to demand that the ETA not break the
cease-fire. Many Basques want more autonomy, but oppose the ETA's methods and
wanted talks to continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationalist president of the Basque country, Juan Jose Ibarretxe,
condemned Friday's bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I express my most complete, unequivocal condemnation of the crime,''
Ibarretxe said. ``Unfortunately ETA ignored once again the call of Basque
society that has shown itself overwhelmingly in favor of peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first car blew up shortly after 8 a.m. outside an apartment building in
a neighborhood full of military families. About 30 minutes after police and
rescue workers arrived, a second car exploded about 400 yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very angry,'' said Josefa Espinoza, 65, who works in a nearby bakery.
``I had a bad feeling that the people of this neighborhood were going to be the
first victims.''
</P>
<P>
	   National Police chief Juan Cotino said the car bombs were set off by
remote-control and that the victim, Col. Pedro Antonio Blanco Garcia, 47, was
the target. He worked in the economic section of army headquarters in Madrid and
was married with two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Eduardo Serra visited the officer's wife, who reportedly
learned of her husband's death by watching television news with her son. ``She
is as can be expected after a killing like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were treated for shock after the bombings, and a 14-year-old
girl suffered cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The ETA wants to establish a Basque nation in northern Spain and southern
France, where the Basques have a separate language and cultural identity. The
group's initials stand for the Basque words for Basque Homeland and Freedom. In
its campaign for independence, the ETA has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   Aznar himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1995. After his
conservative Popular Party came to power in 1996, the ETA changed strategy and
began targeting the party's town councilors.
</P>
<P>
	   The ETA called a cease-fire in September 1998. But while the government
wanted peace talks limited to disarmament and possible early releases or lenient
treatment for some 500 ETA suspects in Spanish jails, the ETA demanded
negotiations for a separate Basque nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has said it will not negotiate with the group until it
renounces violence. On Dec. 3, the ETA declared the end of a 14-month truce,
citing lack of progress in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain received condolences from several European governments Friday, in
messages that uniformly condemned the bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, the French government noted that it has traditionally worked with
Spain to root out ETA operatives. ``It's clear, now more than ever, that
cooperation between our two countries is indispensable,'' Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said.

<HEADLINE> German Party Withdraws Hitler Ad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- A German opposition party said Friday it was
halting plans for a campaign poster showing Adolf Hitler after protests from its
members.
</P>
<P>
	   The poster by the Free Democrats, intended to warn of the evils of
extremism, was unveiled last week as the opening shot in a campaign for more
teachers in North Rhine-Westphalia, which holds state elections in May.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hitler will now be replaced by an image of a neo-Nazi, said Juergen
Moellemann, the center-right party's gubernatorial candidate. ``We knew this was
a provocation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some activists had refused to put up the poster, and Burkhard Hirsch, a
senior state party official, called it ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Leftist parties had accused the Free Democrats of breaking a postwar taboo,
saying it would encourage neo-Nazis even though its purpose was the opposite.
</P>
<P>
	   The Free Democrats, a part of most German governments after World War II,
have been losing voters for years and are now struggling for survival. The party
has a long tradition of defending civil rights, but recently has focused almost
entirely on an anti-tax platform.

<HEADLINE> Mayor, Lautenberg push to close small Atlantic City airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Loved by private pilots but hated by city
officials, a little-used general aviation airport located in the shadow of the
casinos may be closing - and not because of the snow.
<P>
	   Mayor James Whelan and U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who favor closing Bader
Field, were to meet Friday with representatives of the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is the future of the field, located adjacent to The Sandcastle
baseball stadium and Flyers' Skate Zone on U.S. 40. It serves private pilots
only; charter jets and commercial airlines operate from Atlantic City
International Airport, 12 miles west of the city in Egg Harbor Township.
</P>
<P>
	   Whelan has long wanted to close the facility, saying there are better uses
for the land.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's only a handful of pilots who use it," Whelan said Friday. "We don't
think general aviation is the best use of that real estate. Given the needs we
have in the city for park space and better use of it, we'd like to make it a
park or recreation area, something that benefits all of south Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   The city has already moved in that direction. In 1998, it opened The
Sandcastle as the home of the minor-league Atlantic City Surf. Last year, the
Skate Zone, an ice hockey and ice skating facility, opened next door.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city's acceptance of more than $5 million in Federal Aviation
Administration airport improvement grants over the years has obligated it to
keep the facility open through 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   The city wants FAA permission to close Bader Field and serve private pilots
through Woodbine Municipal Airport in Cape May County.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're saying let us work with Woodbine to bring Woodbine up the level it
can be," Whelan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private pilots, however, want none of that.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the world's largest
civil aviation organization, complained to the FAA last year that the city was
purposely letting the airport deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Normally, when you go into an airport, there's a terminal building, a
decent place to tie down the airplane where it's not going to get hit by errant
foul balls, a restroom, a telephone," said Warren Morningstar, the group's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disingenuous of the city to neglect the airport, to turn it into a
less-than-desirable facility and then turn around and say 'It's run-down.' It's
a self-fulfilling prophecy."
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Weck, 65, of Paulding, Ohio, a private pilot who was preparing to take
off from the airport Friday, said he sees why Whelan wants to close it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can understand that," said Weck, dusting the snow off the wings of his
Seneca Piper. "I'm not for privileged use. Atlantic City International is close
enough. But as long as it's here, I'll use it."

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived in New York
City this afternoon, planning to press their case for the 6-year-old boy's
return to Cuba.
<P>
	   A plane carrying the women and a delegation of U.S. church officials arrived
at Kennedy International Airport at about 3:40 p.m. A small welcoming committee
was allowed to greet the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers - Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez - appeared to wince
in the windy, 16-degree cold as they stepped off the airplane in trench coats.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside the hangar, U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano told reporters he would act as an
adviser during the women's visit. He also noted that if Elian is returned to
Cuba, the boy will grow up just as other children there do.
</P>
<P>
	   "We return kids to Haiti, to the Dominican Republic, on a daily basis, and
we don't make political pawns out of them," Serrano said. "He's the only person
I've ever heard of who has not been allowed to mourn his mother."
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Cuba, Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches, said the grandmothers made the trip to "make an appeal to the American
people."
</P>
<P>
	   The women left Elian's father behind in Cuba, where the three parted with
kisses and an embrace.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Elian's paternal grandmother, Ms. Quintana, had said she would go to
the United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle, Delfin Gonzalez, said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were waiting for them," Gonzalez said. The family has had no contact
with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow them to take the boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem," he said. "The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might show U.S. skeptics how much the family wants the boy back.
Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return is made under
government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear Congress might hinder his return
to Cuba by forcing him to appear before lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   New York was chosen as the grandmothers' U.S. destination to avoid Miami,
where Elian has been living with relatives and where thousands have rallied to
keep him in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered him
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Cuba's foreign minister visited Paris and accused the United
States of committing a "very serious" violation of Elian's human rights by not
returning him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think there is a real danger with regard to the issue because Congress
could give him American citizenship," Felipe Perez Roque said.

<HEADLINE> Another Fen-Phen Drug Suit Filed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MACON, Miss. (AP) -- On the heels a successful damage suit trial in Fayette
against fen-phen maker American Home Products, attorneys are again turning to a
Mississippi court with claims of health damage caused by the diet drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest legal action was filed with Noxubee County Circuit Court on
behalf of six women.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit comes only four weeks after a Jefferson County jury awarded about
$400 million to plaintiffs who made similar claims against American Home
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Wilbur O. Colom of Columbus said the latest lawsuit seeks a larger
award, which he said should send diet pill manufacturers a strong message.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe we can produce a multibillion verdict in Noxebee County," Colom
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home, pharmaceutical companies Wyeth-Ayerst and SmithKline Beecham
and Savon Drug Stores are among the 12 defendants named in the new lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Colom said a trial date would be set for some time in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Colom said his firm and partners in an Alabama law firm plan additional diet
drug suits in Mississippi, including in Jefferson, Holmes and Claiborne
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical relative
called Redux.
</P>
<P>
	   About 6 million people took the mix of fenfluramine and phentermine after it
came out in the mid-1990s. American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the
market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal
heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home agreed earlier this year to pay up to $4.83 billion in a
settlement that could cover all 6 million users. The deal would pay claimants
anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1.5 million, though thousands of suits
remain.

<HEADLINE> Jet engine maker announces 1,700 job cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Faced with a shrinking demand for jet
engines, Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials said Friday they must cut 1,700 more jobs by
the end of the year, mostly from the company's Connecticut manufacturing plants.
<P>
	   The cuts are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs the company has
been eliminating since it started a major restructuring and consolidation effort
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan blamed a dramatic drop-off in jet engine sales
during the past three years as the major reason for the downsizing. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998, he said.
Some of the work load will be moved to overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,500 cuts will come from the hourly work force, mostly line workers
in the company's East Hartford and North Haven plants, Sullivan said. The
remaining 200 cuts will come from salaried workers who support those line
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Georgia and Maine, where we also have manufacturing facilities, the
impact will be minimal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Parent, a chief spokesman for the Machinists Union, was surprised by the
number of new cuts, and had not expected that 400 positions would be moved
overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This announcement stinks," Parent said. "We knew we had a volume problem,
but the worst part is that they're going to move some of the work to Taiwan,
China, Korea, Japan, Norway and Israel."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the union will begin meeting with the company next week to see if
any of the jobs can be saved.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pratt wants to cut the jobs by the end of 2000, Parent said the
workers' contract says there can't be any layoffs for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
	   East Hartford Mayor Tim Larson called the cuts "a difficult pill to
swallow."
</P>
<P>
	   "Luckily, the economy is strong and there seem to be jobs out there," he
said. "We'll see what we could do to help people find jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   While the cuts will hurt workers, analysts say they'll help the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you have people that you don't need, you're going to lose money,"
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with the Newport, R.I.-based JSA Research Inc. "I
suspect they're adjusting their workforce to the work they do. If they don't
they can't survive."
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said state officials have
been talking to union and Pratt officials about ways to preserve jobs. He said
those talks will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Melody Currey, D-East Hartford, said she'll push for job retraining
programs in the Legislature and encourage other area employers to hire laid off
Pratt workers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be difficult for some of these people to find jobs, but
hopefully the businesses that are looking for help will be able to hire these
qualified workers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company has no new plans to close any manufacturing
facilities. The company had previously announced it would be moving its military
jet engine business and 2,800 jobs from Florida to Connecticut as part of its
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company also plans to hire technical staff in Connecticut.
Once the restructuring is complete, Sullivan said the net workforce in
Connecticut will remain at about 13,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a United Technologies Co. division, designs, manufactures
and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kosovo Rebels in Kosovo Corps  </HEADLINE>
   By GJERAQINA TUHINA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dozens of former rebels were inducted Friday as
the first leaders of the Kosovo Protection Corps, a group charged with
conducting rescue missions and helping rebuild the province's tattered
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 44 members of the Corps -- many of whom were members of the
formally disbanded rebel Kosovo Liberation Army -- were sworn in by the top
international civilian and military officials in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO set up the corps last fall, hoping that a multiethnic organization
would help heal the divisions in the province by bringing together
representatives of all of Kosovo's ethnic groups working together for a common
purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   The first group of inductees was made up of ethnic Albanians, including one
woman, but Gen. Agim Ceku, who heads the corps, appealed to ethnic minorities to
join.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their participation in KPC at this moment shows an act of maturity and it
is the only proof for them to show that they are ready to take the
responsibility for the creation of peace and stability in Kosovo,'' Ceku said.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbs claim the corps is little more than an extension of the KLA, which
fought for Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, head of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo,
reminded corps members that they are to play no role in maintaining law and
order.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am confident that you will approach your new mission as a
multidisciplinary, multiethnic, civil emergency service with the same dedication
and commitment you demonstrated in your fight for a fair and equal Kosovo,''
Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
	   By September, the corps is to consist of 3,000 active members and 2,000
reservists.

<HEADLINE> Native American Art Hits France  </HEADLINE>
   By MARILYN AUGUST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- From a million-dollar basket to an eight-foot tall Cheyenne
war bonnet, France's biggest retrospective ever on native American art is sure
to thrill a country long fascinated by primitive craft.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, which began Friday, features 120 artifacts crafted by native
American Indians, including a child's miniature beaded saddle and colorful
drawings from imprisoned Indian warriors depicting their exploits in battle.
</P>
<P>
	   Organized to highlight the finest examples of sophisticated workmanship by
region and tribe, ``The Art of North American Indians,'' is aimed at a culture
long entranced by primitive art -- particularly from Africa and Oceania. It runs
through March 18 at the Mona Bismarck Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The show features a fraction of the prized collection of Eugene and Clare
Thaw, retired New York art dealers who specialized in Old Masters. They embraced
native American art after settling in Sante Fe, N.M. in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Their collection of some 800 pieces -- from peace pipes and picturesque
ceremonial robes sewn from rawhide to Navajo blankets and war drums -- is
considered one of the world's finest. The couple donated the entire collection
to the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., where it is on permanent
display.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the highlights is ``Beacon Light'' by Louisa Keyser, also known as Dat
So La Lee, a Washoe Indian from the Great Basin on the border between Nevada and
California, widely regarded as the greatest basket weaver of the century.

	   ``The basket is absolute perfection. It took more than one year to make.
There are more than 80,000 stitches and not a single mistake,'' Thaw said,
adding that it would fetch more than a million dollars at auction.
</P>
<P>
	   It sold for $1,400 in 1914, just as the popularity of native American
artifacts peaked, since most collectors believed that Indians were a dying race,
Thaw said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Closes in on $30 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   As crude oil prices roared toward $30 a barrel this week, reaching levels
last seen on the brink of the Persian Gulf War, airlines were adding surcharges
to ticket prices and consumers were worrying about heating bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet inflation remains tame and the U.S. economy has barely blinked.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason: Oil simply doesn't lubricate the new, tech-savvy economy the way
it once did.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil's overall impact on the economy is vastly reduced" from years past,
said William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services.
"That's due to the increased energy efficiency of companies that use oil heavily
and the increased importance of industries that are not heavily dependent on
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for crude have jumped nearly $5 a barrel in the past week. Heating
oil, spurred not only by oil's surge but a Northeastern cold snap, has risen 50
percent in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with energy products pushing to a series of new nine-year highs,
many Americans keep shelling out undaunted for gasoline and other petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't deter me," motorist Chip Tuttle said at a Boston gas station
Friday as he paid $43 to fill his sport-utility vehicle, despite gas prices that
are the highest they've been there since Christmas 1990. "The economy is good."
</P>
<P>
	   The era of cheap oil began ending last March when the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day. The
oil producers were determined to end a world oil glut and push up prices that
fell as low as $11.37 a barrel in February.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC, an often undisciplined cartel, was able to hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. oil supplies now are at their lowest level in several years and the
International Energy Agency warned Thursday that markets "are tight and getting
tighter."
</P>
<P>
	   Since March, crude prices have more than doubled, reaching a nine-year high
in November that was smashed again this week. Oil for February delivery rose as
high as $29.95 during trading Thursday before the contract expired. In trading
Friday, the March contract briefly rose above $29 before giving up some ground.
The new near-term contract still managed to finish the day with a gain of 23
cents to close at $28.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Two decades ago, a similarly huge spike in oil prices caused gas lines and
sent the U.S. economy into shock. But in 1999, while fuel oil and gasoline
prices climbed sharply, the "core" rate of inflation -- excluding the volatile
energy and food sectors -- rose at its smallest rate in 34 years, just 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   What happened to inflation? Where's the recession?
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists are still warning of dire consequences, especially if oil's
rise continues unabated. Phil Verleger, economist for the Brattle Group, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., sees oil headed to $40 by year's end,
prompting several interest rate increases and a recession before the year is
out.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it went to $40 a barrel, it would be disruptive," said Bruce Steinberg,
chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "You can't keep going up endlessly without
having an effect."
</P>
<P>
	   But America has built up a much better resistance to energy shocks. The oil
price explosions of the mid- and late-1970s helped spawn a new energy
consciousness and the giant steps taken by technology steered the economy away
from manufacturing and toward services and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil expenditures, which accounted for 8.5 percent of gross domestic product
in 1981, have fallen to about 3 percent, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil is still probably the single most important price that affects the
well-being of Americans," said Cheney. "When the price goes up ... America is in
a sense a little poorer. But we are much better at adapting to it now."
</P>
<P>
	   Adjusting or not, consumers are being increasingly squeezed by oil's rise.
Among the latest consequences of the increase in prices:
</P>
<P>
	   --The nation's top airlines said this week they are adding a $20 surcharge
to round-trip tickets because of jet fuel costs that have more than doubled in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Trucking companies are hiking rates by 5 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --Business owners are beginning to pass on to consumers the new, higher
prices charged by shippers ranging from the United Parcel Service to the post
office.
</P>
<P>
	   --U.S. gasoline prices are rising again after dipping since hitting a 3
1/2-year high of almost $1.35 a gallon last month. Signs announcing hikes of as
much as 15 cents a gallon have been posted this week at gas stations in the
Minneapolis area.
</P>
<P>
	   American consumers, particularly motorists, are griping more about OPEC
these days.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Brown, a cook with a gas-guzzling 1976 Pontiac Catalina, paid $1.45
per gallon for regular unleaded Friday for his commute across Boston and vowed
he'll find another way to get to work if it goes above $1.50.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it goes absolutely berserk, if it just goes through the roof, I won't
drive," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, however, motorists are not staying off the roads, and
they're not losing sleep about the specter of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it really has anything to do with it," said Berry Emerson of
Anoka, Minn., on Friday as he waited for mechanics to fix his car in
Minneapolis. "Other parts of the economy -- the construction industry,
especially -- also drive that, and there's a lot of room for growth."

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Seize Congress  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Hundreds of Indian protesters occupied the empty
Congress building and declared a new government today after breaking through a
barbed-wire barrier and charging past military guards. They demanded the
resignation of all three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
	   The armed forces high command called on President Jamil Mahuad to resign to
avoid ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in a nationwide television broadcast, Mahuad refused. ``I am not going
to abandon you,'' Mahuad said in his first appearance since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, the armed forces command had expressed its support for the elected
government and called on Mahuad to ``make an urgent decision ... to preserve the
country's internal peace and avoid the nation's international isolation.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gen. Carlos Mendoza, the country's defense minister, said the armed
forces later decided to call for Mahuad's resignation because ``we are conscious
that we must maintain order and discipline in the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said an ``insurrectional movement'' led
by a group of young army colonels was backing the Congress takeover. Television
reports said about 70 colonels and an undetermined number of troops were
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   An hour after occupying the Congress building, hundreds of Indians pushed
their way into the Supreme Court building across the street.
</P>
<P>
	   Military sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops looking down on the two
government buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad remained at the presidential palace 20 blocks away but ordered all
employees and officials to evacuate the building, a telephone operator at the
palace said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group of leftist-led
unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations, seized the
provincial government building, local television reported. The news station
broadcast images of students shouting anti-Mahuad slogans from the balcony.
</P>
<P>
	   About 5,000 Indian protesters arrived in Quito earlier in the week,
demanding the resignation of Mahuad, Congress and the courts. The protesters
contend the government is corrupt and does not serve the needs of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz called the occupation an ``irresponsible
act'' and urged Ecuadoreans to remain calm. He accused the protesters of trying
to exploit discontent caused by Ecuador's economic crisis. Last year inflation
reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and the economy contracted 7.5
percent. Only one in three in the labor force has full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   Before today's unrest, the protesters had threatened to occupy Congress, and
the government had played down the importance of any building takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Seizing a building is not the same as seizing power,'' Alvarez said
Thursday. He said a seizure of Congress would not threaten the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, soldiers in combat uniforms with weapons stepped aside when the
Indians pushed past the barbed wire and into the Congress building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We let them by because we did not want to have a confrontation with the
people,'' said Gen. Carlos Moncayo, the army official in charge of security at
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   At the occupied Congress building, Antonio Vargas, president of the National
Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, appeared at the podium
with an army colonel named Lucio Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez, dressed in combat fatigues, and Vargas thrust their arms into the
air in a sign of victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters from the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of
Ecuador, who claim to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, said they no longer
recognized the authority of Mahuad, the elected Congress or the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   A former member of Congress, Napoleon Saltos, who belongs to Pachakutik, a
party formed by the Indians in 1995, read a statement saying a three-man
governing council had been formed. He said the three members were Vargas,
Gutierrez and Carlos Solorzano, a former president of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians have been pushing for establishment of a ``popular government''
made up of a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, a representative of
the armed forces and several civilians named by the Indians and their
leftist-led supporters among unions and student groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said late Thursday that authorities would not use force to break up
protests so long as they remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
	   But the demonstrations turned violent early today, as Indians took to the
streets armed with rocks and clubs, paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians
and passing vehicles in Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of Ecuador's Indians live in the Andean highlands and
speak Quichua, a dialect of the language spoken by the Incas.

<HEADLINE> Lobstermen ask commerce secretary for help with lobster die-off in  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Lobstermen devastated by the die-off of lobsters
in Long Island Sound Friday asked for help from U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley.
<P>
	   In a private conference call from the New Haven office of U.S. Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, they requested Daley declare an emergency in the Long Island Sound
lobster fishery.
</P>
<P>
	   If an emergency, called a "fishery failure" is declared, lobstermen would be
eligible for financial aid, possibly including loans and grants to help them get
through the crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLauro, a Democrat, said other federal agencies and the Clinton
administration would review the situation to determine if other aid is available
if the declaration is made.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision from Daley may come as soon as next week, said Morrie Goodman,
a spokesman for the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is going to look at the entire package of trouble and see what the
government can do about it," Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lobstermen's livelihoods have been threatened by the recent mysterious
deaths of thousands of lobsters in the sound.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Coviello, a lobsterman from Norwalk who fishes in the Greenwich
area, said his catch has diminished from about 38,000 pounds of lobster in 1997
to 8,700 pounds in 1998 and only 610 pounds last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists have determined a tiny organism called a paramoeba is infecting
the lobsters, but they are still trying to figure out if contamination or
environmental problems are working with the paramoeba to kill the lobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lobstermen suspect pesticides, pollution, the gasoline additive MTBE,
sewage or other contaminants in the sound may be contributing to the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A fishery failure designation can be declared if the disaster is due to
natural causes, undetermined causes or man-made causes that are beyond the
control of fishery regulators to correct.
</P>
<P>
	   Coviello said lobstermen need aid to sustain their businesses, preferably in
the form of a grant, until the lobster situation is figured out.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't want loans. Everyone's got plenty of loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department declared a fishery failure for West
Coast fishermen from California to Washington because of a steep decline in
rockfish.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends off 99.59; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell for a fourth straight session as
investors, fearing a rise in inflation, moved money away from industrial
companies and into the technology issues that have pushed the Nasdaq stock
market higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 99.59 to 11,251.71.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 45.39 to close at
4,234.90, extending the record it set yesterday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were little changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength. the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.21 to
1,441.36.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,746 down, 1,326 up and 468 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.21 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.10 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.47 to 532.75.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose on the strength of industry leaders like Cisco Systems and
newer companies like Healtheon/WebMD, an online health care information company
that is the subject of takeover rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq also drew some buyers as investors moved money away from older,
cyclical stocks that are sensitive to fluctuations in inflation. A rise in crude
oil prices this week has rekindled fears that inflation could revive and prompt
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than than the market has been
expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have surged more than $4 a
barrel in the past week after members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said they wouldn't boost output as expected in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase in oil prices helped companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
Airlines, however, which could face sharply higher expenses because of rising
fuel prices, saw their stocks tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged amid reports it may buy drugmaker Warner-Lambert.
Shares of the consumer products company have tumbled this week as investors
debated how much the company's earnings would be hurt by a bold move to acquire
a leading drug company.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Dow's weakness has been concentrated in a handful of stocks that had a
bad week, and Procter &AMP; Gamble certainly did," said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. "Wall Street believes that
there's a deal in the works and isn't sure of the benefits."
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings reports once again drove market activity. Lucent Technologies fell
in heavy trading after the company said late Thursday that profits plunged 23
percent in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent's earnings narrowly missed Wall Street forecasts that were already
slashed after a warning two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems fell despite a better-than-expected profit
report late Thursday by the producer of hardware and software for the Internet
and other computer networks. Sun's stock had rallied more than 25 percent over
the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Pratt &AMP; Whitney Cuts More Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By ADAM GORLICK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Faced with a shrinking demand for jet engines,
Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials are cutting 1,700 more jobs by the end of the year,
mostly from the company's Connecticut manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The cuts announced Friday are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs
the company has been eliminating since it started a major restructuring and
consolidation effort in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan blamed a dramatic drop-off in jet engine sales
during the past three years as the major reason for the downsizing. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998. Some of the
work load will be moved to overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,500 cuts will come from the hourly work force, mostly line workers
in the company's East Hartford and North Haven plants, Sullivan said. The
remaining 200 cuts will come from salaried workers who support those line
operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Georgia and Maine, where we also have manufacturing facilities, the
impact will be minimal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Parent, a chief spokesman for the Machinists Union, was surprised by the
number of new cuts, and had not expected that 400 positions would be moved
overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This announcement stinks," Parent said. "We knew we had a volume problem,
but the worst part is that they're going to move some of the work to Taiwan,
China, Korea, Japan, Norway and Israel."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pratt wants to cut the jobs by the end of 2000, Parent said the
workers' contract says there can't be any layoffs for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you have people that you don't need, you're going to lose money,"
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with the Newport, R.I.-based JSA Research Inc. "I
suspect they're adjusting their work force to the work they do. If they don't
they can't survive."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be difficult for some of these people to find jobs, but
hopefully the businesses that are looking for help will be able to hire these
qualified workers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company has no new plans to close any manufacturing
facilities. The company had previously announced it would be moving its military
jet engine business and 2,800 jobs from Florida to Connecticut as part of its
restructuring.
</P>
<P>

and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.

<HEADLINE> Russia Orders Polish Diplomats Out  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- In one of the biggest spying scandals of the post-Soviet era,
Russia on Friday ordered nine Polish Embassy employees to leave the country,
issuing the order one day after Poland expelled nine Russian diplomats for
espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither country gave details of how the alleged spying was conducted or what
information may have been compromised. Still, the expulsion orders were sure to
complicate already-strained relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has watched with anger and anxiety as its onetime Warsaw Pact ally
moves closer to the West. Poland joined NATO last year, pushing the Western
alliance's reach to the border of Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave where much of
its western naval fleet is based.
</P>
<P>
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said Polish Ambassador Andrzej Zalucki
was informed late Friday that the nine embassy employees must leave by Jan. 28
``because of activities not in accordance with their diplomatic status.'' Polish
Embassy spokesman Jacek Niedzielski said the ambassador regarded the Russian
order as ``unfriendly and ungrounded.''
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came a day after Poland declared nine Russian diplomats
personae-non-grata and ordered them to leave, saying it had proof that they were
spying ``against Poland's vital interests.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jozef Gruszka, the head of the Polish parliament's secret service committee,
said the alleged spying involved mostly economic and political areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov promised that ``the
strictest identical measures'' would be taken in response.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's Federal Security Service, the main successor to the KGB, has
evidence supporting the contention that the Poles were spying, the service said
in a statement quoted by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian newspapers on Friday offered various theories as to what was behind
Poland's move. The newspaper Kommersant said the roots of the incident may reach
back to two years ago, when several Russian newspapers published an alleged list
of Polish special agents working in the Polish Embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The daily Segodnya saw Poland's NATO membership at the root. ``The expulsion
of Russian 'spies' was the best way to earn the trust of the North Atlantic
bloc,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow strongly opposed Poland's joining NATO, claiming expansion of the
alliance posed a danger to Russia's security. Poland meanwhile has warned that
the large concentration of arms in Kaliningrad, as well as fears of unrest in
the low-paid Russian army, is a potential threat.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second notable spy scandal involving Russia in about a month. In
early December, the United States ordered the expulsion of Stanislav Gusev,
described by U.S. agents as an employee of Moscow's SVR foreign intelligence
agency, after an eavesdropping device was found in a State Department conference
room. The previous week, Russia ordered U.S. diplomat Cheri Leberknight to leave
the country, accusing her of attempting to obtain secret military information
from a Russian citizen.

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez arrived in New York
City this afternoon, planning to press their case for the 6-year-old boy's
return to Cuba.
<P>
	   A plane carrying the women and a delegation of U.S. church officials arrived
at Kennedy International Airport at about 3:40 p.m. A small welcoming committee
was allowed to greet the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers - Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez - appeared to wince
in the windy, 16-degree cold as they stepped off the airplane in trench coats.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, told reporters
waiting inside a hangar.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano said he would act as an adviser during the women's
visit. He also noted that if Elian is returned to Cuba, the boy will grow up
just as other children there do.
</P>
<P>
	   "We return kids to Haiti, to the Dominican Republic, on a daily basis, and
we don't make political pawns out of them," Serrano said. "He's the only person
I've ever heard of who has not been allowed to mourn his mother."
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving Cuba, Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches, said the grandmothers made the trip to "make an appeal to the American
people."
</P>
<P>
	   The women left Elian's father behind in Cuba, where the three parted with
kisses and an embrace.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Elian's paternal grandmother, Ms. Quintana, had said she would go to
the United States only if she could bring him back with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found floating at sea Nov. 25 after the boat on which he was
heading for Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be refugees.
His relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United States
and have raised legal action to keep him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle, Delfin Gonzalez, said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were waiting for them," Gonzalez said. The family has had no contact
with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow them to take the boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem," he said. "The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind."
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the visit by the grandmothers would not affect the proceedings in federal
court to determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' presence in the
United States might show U.S. skeptics how much the family wants the boy back.
Some anti-Castro activists claim the appeal for the boy's return is made under
government pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear Congress might hinder his return
to Cuba by forcing him to appear before lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   New York was chosen as the grandmothers' U.S. destination to avoid Miami,
where Elian has been living with relatives and where thousands have rallied to
keep him in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the National Council of Churches, the largest organization of
Protestant churches in the United States, have strongly advocated Elian's return
to Cuba and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered him
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has trapped the boy in a political battle between President
Fidel Castro's government and Cuban exiles in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "He asked me 'Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, 'Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, 'No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside. U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King has a son with
political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a daughter who works for the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, Cuba's foreign minister visited Paris and accused the United
States of committing a "very serious" violation of Elian's human rights by not
returning him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think there is a real danger with regard to the issue because Congress
could give him American citizenship," Felipe Perez Roque said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Finish Round of Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- Top U.S. and Russian officials ended nuclear disarmament
talks Friday with Russia refusing to modify a key anti-ballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   No new agreements were announced, but the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass
quoted diplomatic sources as saying the talks were constructive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian side underlined the tight interrelatedness between the process
of reducing strategic arms and the (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty of 1972,''
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials declined to comment on the substance of the talks. They said
only that the two sides had continued their discussions in ``an open,
businesslike'' atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks were conducted between the countries' top disarmament specialists:
John Holum of the State Department and Yuri Kapralov, the acting head of the
Russian Foreign Ministry's arms control department. Their meeting was intended
to revive deep cuts in each side's nuclear arsenals and to work out differences
over the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington wants to change the ABM treaty so it can develop a limited
nuclear missile defense to ward off attacks from rogue nations. It says that
would pose no threat to Russia, which has the capacity to overwhelm a limited
defense system.
</P>
<P>
	   But the U.S. plan has met strong opposition from the Kremlin, as well as
China and other countries which say the ABM treaty is a cornerstone on which
other treaties depend. Moscow says changes would upset the strategic balance and
launch a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
	   The other order of business this week was the long-delayed START II accord,
intended to halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads
each.
</P>
<P>
	   START II was signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996. But the
Russian parliament has refused to approve it so far. Both governments have long
urged the parliament to ratify the accord so the two sides can begin negotiating
further cuts, known as START III.
</P>
<P>
	   The series of talks was begun after an agreement that President Clinton and
former Russian president Boris Yeltsin reached last June. This week's Geneva
round has demonstrated that acting Russian President Vladimir Putin will
continue the discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   Though no results were announced, both sides often leave it to national
leaders to reveal developments from such talks or put the finishing touches on
agreements. Officials have noted that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
be in Moscow at the end of this month, leaving open the possibility of further
developments.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager to accompany their grandson back to his native
Cuba, the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez arrived Friday in New York
and appealed directly to the American people for his return.
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter will be in peace, and
she will not be in peace until Elian is home," the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, said through a translator at a packed news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   She addressed reporters after a similar plea by the boy's paternal
grandmother, Mariela Quintana, at a question and answer session which was
broadcast live on several national cable networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana told reporters waiting inside a hangar at
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, accompanied by a three-member U.S. church delegation,
opted to fly over the boy's temporary Miami home and instead bring their message
to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Their grandson, the subject of both a personal battle for custody between
family members and a political tug-of-war between the Castro regime and
expatriate Cubans, is living in Florida with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carrying Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez arrived in New York
shortly after 3:30 p.m., about three hours after it took off from their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of U.S. Customs officials and
police, winced from the cold as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree
temperature for their short walk into a terminal at Kennedy International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S.,
although trip organizers said it will only be a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' arrival may
convince skeptics of the family's sincerity. Some anti-Castro activists
suggested the Cuban government pressured the women into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, before boarding the plane without him. They left for New
York after meeting over 24 hours with representatives of the National Council of
Churches, which favors the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's
grandmothers. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mrs. Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could fly back with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot
power boat, became an international cause celebre when he was found Nov. 25
while floating on an inner tube two miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother and 10 other Cubans died when the ill-fated boat capsized on its
way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no plans to allow a New York reunion between the boy and his
grandmothers, although the women were welcome in Miami, said Elian's great-uncle
Delfin Gonzalez, who wants the boy to stay in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the 6-year-old in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez said the visit by the grandmothers will not affect his resolution
to keep Elian in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
But attorneys for the family in Florida accused the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Bus safety questioned with Amtrak high-speed train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) - Some school bus drivers in southeastern
Connecticut are questioning the safety of railroad crossings as Amtrak prepares
to start high-speed rail service from Boston to New York.
<P>
	   Officials from Amtrak and the state Department of Transportation tried
Friday to reassure drivers and parents that drivers will have plenty of time to
cross the tracks when the electrified Acela trains start rolling.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Thursday night, veteran Stonington school bus driver Marian
Oates told transportation officials that sometimes she barely has time to get
her bus over the tracks near the Mystic railroad station before a train comes.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been times when the rear end of the bus is over just by the skin
of the teeth," Oates said. "I'm scared to death. What if I stall? What if I spin
out? Twenty seconds is not enough time to unload my children and myself."
</P>
<P>
	   State law requires railroads to warn motorists at least 29 seconds before a
train is coming. Amtrak and the DOT said the 29-second warning will remain in
effect even after high-speed train service comes to Connecticut. In many states,
the warning time is only 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Devices that detect trains and start signals at railroad crossings were
moved farther down the tracks as necessary to accommodate faster trains and
still maintain the 29-second warning, said Gilbert Smart, who monitors railroad
crossing regulations for the DOT.
</P>
<P>
	   While the electrified trains can travel up to 150 mph, they will travel much
slower in Connecticut, said Russ Hall, a spokesman for Amtrak. At railroad
crossings, the speed will be about 60 mph, the same as it is now, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The grade crossings are not changing at all," Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oates said that when she complained of the problem, she was told to move
students to the front of the bus, since a train crash would likely occur at the
rear, but the bus company, Amtrak and the DOT denied advising bus drivers that.
</P>
<P>
	   Smart suggested Oates could drive a shorter bus, since they are quicker and
easier to maneuver through the crossing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now, it's safe to cross that crossing with a large school bus.
Obviously, the driver's uncomfortable with that situation. I can understand
that. What I suggested is maybe it would be helpful to go through that area with
a shorter school bus," Smart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Castelli, the regional manager for Ryder Student Transportation, said
his company, the bus drivers, Amtrak and the state have been working for about a
year to make sure the crossings are safe once the high-speed trains start.
</P>
<P>
	   "The train hasn't started running yet," Castelli said. "If they travel over
100 mph, then we need to talk about it now."
</P>
<P>
	   As an added safety precaution, eight crossings in Groton, New London and
Stonington are getting new gates that make it harder for drivers to get around
the gates when a train is coming.
</P>
<P>
	   Railroad crossings have been at issue for years in Eastern Connecticut
shoreline towns. Bus drivers get intensive training on how to handle the
crossings.
</P>
<P>
	   Oates said she follows the rules, but she does not have a clear line of
sight at one crossing that is on a curve in the track and at a higher elevation.
With the bus running, Oates said her ability to hear a train is limited.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can stop, but I can't look or listen," she said. "I can't do my job
properly."

<HEADLINE> Citrus Trees Burned To Kill Canker  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A bonfire of lime trees infected with citrus
canker went up in smoke Friday along with the hopes of some growers who thought
they were on the verge of recovering from Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant disease, which is contagious and also poses a threat to oranges
and grapefruit, has invaded commercial groves for the first time in South
Florida, forcing growers to destroy the blighted trees in hopes of stopping the
spread. The canker not only is endangering the crop but also a way of life.
</P>
<P>
	   "My wife shed enough tears already," said LimeCo owner Herbert Yamamura, who
will lose a 290-acre grove to bulldozers Saturday. "It makes me cry when she
cries. I try to be strong."
</P>
<P>
	   At 66, Yamamura was persuaded by the corky brown bumps in his Persian lime
grove to pack it in as a Florida citrus grower and switch entirely to importing
fruit, now less than a quarter of his business.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant disease is believed to have spread by winds, jumping about 30
miles from backyard citrus trees in suburban Miami, where it was first spotted
five years ago, to commercial groves to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe at least a third of the $15 million lime crop has been lost
in Miami-Dade County, but the overwhelming concern is for the bulk of the $8
billion citrus industry sitting as little as 90 miles north.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, all but 20 acres of the 677 acres checked tested positive for the
canker or had been exposed to the disease, officials said. The four-mile square
test site is in the Florida City area, near the tip of the Florida peninsula and
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Citrus fruit and plant material cannot be moved out of quarantined areas in
South Florida that now total 500 square miles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody has their fingers crossed that we're going to be able to contain
what we've got there," said Tom Kirby, executive director of the Dade County
Farm Bureau. "Given the fact that it travels by wind, I personally am not very
hopeful."
</P>
<P>
	   The farm labor market will feel some affects. Some migrant laborers who came
to the region to work winter crops became full-time residents by also working
the lime groves from May to October.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumers should not notice any shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the destruction of groves by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, most of the
U.S. lime supply comes from Mexico. Miami-Dade growers had been counting on
groves planted since then to boost their 10 percent market share. Two more windy
tropical storms, Irene in October and Harvey in November, are blamed for the
latest canker spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Key lime pie eaters don't have to worry about their flavorful source drying
up. True key limes, smaller than a walnut, are a cottage industry. Most pies are
made with juice from other limes and lemons.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese New Year's shoppers may be the first to see any market impact. They
spend $3 to $5 on a single pumelo, an oversized, avocado-shaped grapefruit
variety bought for decoration and good luck.
</P>
<P>
	   Doused with diesel and ignited with propane, a bulldozed row of pumelos next
to the original lime infestation also was ignited Friday, the first fires set to
kill the canker since its farm discovery Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hate to do it. I was born here," said Roger Harden of H&AMP;H Land Clearing
and Demolition, who was hired to knock down infected trees.
</P>
<P>
	   And once a grove is destroyed to fight the canker, citrus cannot be planted
on the cleared acreage for at least 18 months. It would take years more to
develop a new crop, leading growers to hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the 3,000 acres of limes disappear due to canker, we're going to have
600 more five-acre homesites available real quickly," said Pal Brooks,
third-generation owner of Brooks Tropical, a diversified grower, farm manager,
packer, shipper and importer. Limes are his second-biggest crop.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than 40 years, Yamamura has lost his taste for growing. He plans
to sell his land and use his crop insurance covering less than half of the cost
of his trees to pay his debts.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year was finally the year that I was going to be able to get my
maintenance costs back plus a little bit of profit," he said. "This time,
canker's going to take it all."

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers arrived in New York today to
press for the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba, saying they wanted to ``finish
this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez appeared to wince in the windy,
16-degree cold as they stepped off an airplane in trench coats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as

an interpreter inside a hangar.
</P>
<P>
	   Before boarding the plane in Cuba, the women kissed and embraced Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   He has said he does not want to have to visit the United States to get his

hinder his return to Cuba with a subpoena to appear before Congress.

	   In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family has no plans
to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his grandmothers, but said they were
welcome to come to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were waiting for them,'' Gonzalez said. But he said the family has had
no contact with the grandmothers and does not plan to allow the women to take
the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That has to go to court so that justice and the law of this country can
resolve this problem,'' he said. ``The boy is going to be raised here with a
healthy and clean mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's grandmothers on
Thursday. Supporters of his return to Cuba hope the women will help convince
skeptics that the family really does want the boy back. Some anti-Castro
activists claim the appeal for the boy's return is made under government
pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, congressional sources in Washington said New York was chosen
for the visit to avoid Miami, where there were disturbances over earlier
proposals to send him home.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jose Serrano of New York said he would act as an adviser during the
women's visit. He also repeated his assertion that Elian should be returned to
his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We return kids to Haiti, to the Dominican Republic, on a daily basis, and
we don't make political pawns out of them,'' Serrano said. ``He's the only
person I've ever heard of who has not been allowed to mourn his mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez told local television in Miami that he
does not want to return with his grandmothers to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He asked me `Are they coming to pick me up?' And I said, `Well, they are
here to see you, do you want to leave with them?' and he said, `No, I want to
tell them that I don't want to go back over there.'''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Immigration and Naturalization Service ordered Elian returned,
attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, another of the boy's great-uncles, filed a
lawsuit accusing the agency of violating Elian's due process rights. The suit
asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge James Lawrence King recused himself from the case
today. King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King, once hired Armando
Gutierrez -- a man now working as spokesman for the boy's relatives in Miami --
to help in his re-election bid. King also has a daughter who is a federal
prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn prices rose to a new 3 1/2-month high Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after strong export sales were reported, while other
grains and soybeans were lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn drew support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly report on
export sales which showed higher numbers than expected.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Harvard Closing Institute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Harvard University said Friday it was closing the
Harvard Institute for International Development, which had been tainted by a
scandal involving insider trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute's projects will be integrated into other Harvard schools, such
as the Kennedy School of Government, the School of Public Health and the School
of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   A faculty task force had recommended shutting down the institute, which
provides policy advice, technical assistance, training and applied research on
issues of international development. The panel said the institute was too large.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard denied the closing of the institute had anything to do with a recent
Justice Department investigation into allegations that two former staffers who
took part in a federally funded program to establish capitalism in Russia
profited from stock investments there at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard's provost, Harvey V. Fineberg, informed faculty of the decision in a
letter delivered Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute, with 159 employees, currently has 41 active projects in 11
countries, studying areas that include the environment, macroeconomics, public
finance, health, education and social development.
</P>
<P>
	   The projects will continue to operate as they have been for the rest of the
academic year. Fineberg did not give a specific timetable for the transition to
be completed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do not underestimate the difficulty of this transition, either
institutionally or individually," Fineberg wrote. "I am convinced that the cost
of near-term disruption will be more than offset by a sounder, long-term
academic foundation for the field of development studies at Harvard."
</P>
<P>
	   Former Harvard lawyer Jonathan Hay is under U.S. federal investigation to
determine whether he profited from stock investments while working for the
Harvard Institute, which was paid $43 million by the U.S. Agency for
International Development to advise Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his
economists.
</P>
<P>
	   USAID's own investigation already concluded that Hay and colleague Andrew
Shleifer, an economics professor, gained influence over Russian capital markets
they were helping establish, and had "abused the trust of the United States
government by using personal relationships ... for private gain."
</P>
<P>
	   Hay and Shleifer denied the charges but were dismissed from their posts at
the institute.

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers fly into NYC, appeal for his release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager to accompany their grandson back to his native
Cuba, the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez arrived Friday in New York
and appealed directly to the American people for his return.
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter will be in peace, and
she will not be in peace until Elian is home," the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, said through a translator at a packed news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   She addressed reporters after a similar plea by the boy's paternal
grandmother, Mariela Quintana, at a question and answer session which was
broadcast live on several national cable networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana told reporters waiting inside a hangar at
Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," she said later. "He
was born in Cuba. He is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, accompanied by a three-member U.S. church delegation,
opted to fly over the boy's temporary Miami home and instead bring their message
to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Their grandson, the subject of both a personal battle for custody between
family members and a political tug-of-war between the Castro regime and
expatriate Cubans, is living in Florida with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carrying Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodriguez arrived in New York
shortly after 3:30 p.m., about three hours after it took off from their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of U.S. Customs officials and
police, winced from the cold as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree
temperature for their short walk into an airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S.,
although organizers said it will only be a few days and the grandmothers' visas
were good for two months. The pair planned to have dinner in New York and rest
before resuming their efforts to reclaim their grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' arrival may
convince skeptics of the family's sincerity. Some anti-Castro activists
suggested the Cuban government pressured the women into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to Elian's
grandmothers. Elian's paternal grandmother, Mrs. Quintana, had said she would go
to the United States only if she could fly back with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot
power boat, became an international cause celebre when he was found Nov. 25
while floating on an inner tube two miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother and 10 other Cubans died when the ill-fated boat capsized on its
way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no plans to allow a New York reunion between the boy and his
grandmothers, although the women were welcome in Miami, said Elian's great-uncle
Delfin Gonzalez, who wants the boy to stay in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the 6-year-old in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez said the visit by the grandmothers will not affect his resolution
to keep Elian in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
But attorneys for the family in Florida accused the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum
hearing.

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Surface in Islamic Case  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police unearthed four bodies in the basement of a
house Friday, raising to 17 the number of corpses recovered this week of people
believed slain by Islamic militants, the Anatolia news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police officers digging through the basement of a house in the central
Anatolian city of Konya recovered the bodies of three men and one woman,
Anatolia reported. The agency suggested the victims may have been tortured and
then buried alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe the dead were victims of the militant Hezbollah group, an
Islamic organization that aims to form a Muslim state in Turkey's
Kurdish-dominated southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's discovery was just the latest in a series of grisly finds
authorities believe are related to Hezbollah. On Thursday, police found three
bodies, with the hands and feet bound, in a coal shed of an Ankara home. Police
found 10 bodies Wednesday in the coal bin and in the garden of an Istanbul
house.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers on Friday lashed out at the state, which is thought to have
helped support Hezbollah when it was formed in the late 1980s. The Islamic group
killed scores of supporters of the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party, then the
state's chief adversary in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish authorities ``seem to have created a monster which is more vicious''
than the Kurdish rebels, wrote Ilnur Cevik, editor in chief of the Turkish Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
	   Police apparently were directed to the houses by the confessions of scores
of Hezbollah militants. The militants were captured following a Monday shootout
in Istanbul that killed the leader of Hezbollah's most radical wing.
</P>
<P>
	   A computer in the safehouse used by that leader, Huseyin Velioglu, yielded a
1,500-name hit list that included the names of businessmen, artists and
journalists, the daily Hurriyet newspaper reported Friday. Police also found
videotapes of people being interrogated and tortured, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah, which is Arabic for ``Party of God,'' is not related to the
Lebanese organization of the same name. It is blamed for the murders of hundreds
of people, almost all rivals of the group.

<HEADLINE> Jet engine maker announces 1,700 job cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Faced with a shrinking demand for jet
engines, Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials said Friday they must cut 1,700 more jobs by
the end of the year, mostly from the company's Connecticut manufacturing plants.
<P>
	   The cuts are in addition to the approximately 3,500 jobs the company has
been eliminating since it started a major restructuring and consolidation effort
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan blamed a dramatic drop-off in jet engine sales
during the past three years as the major reason for the downsizing. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in 1998, he said.
Some of the work load will be moved to overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,500 cuts will come from the hourly work force, mostly line workers
in the company's East Hartford, North Haven and Middletown plants, Sullivan
said. The remaining 200 cuts will come from salaried workers who support those
line operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Georgia and Maine, where we also have manufacturing facilities, the
impact will be minimal," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Parent, a chief spokesman for the Machinists Union, was surprised by the
number of new cuts, and had not expected that 400 positions would be moved
overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This announcement stinks," Parent said. "We knew we had a volume problem,
but the worst part is that they're going to move some of the work to Taiwan,
China, Korea, Japan, Norway and Israel."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the union will begin meeting with the company next week to see if
any of the jobs can be saved.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Pratt wants to cut the jobs by the end of 2000, Parent said the
workers' contract says there can't be any layoffs for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
	   East Hartford Mayor Tim Larson called the cuts "a difficult pill to
swallow."
</P>
<P>
	   "Luckily, the economy is strong and there seem to be jobs out there," he
said. "We'll see what we could do to help people find jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   While the cuts will hurt workers, analysts say they'll help the company.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you have people that you don't need, you're going to lose money,"
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with the Newport, R.I.-based JSA Research Inc. "I
suspect they're adjusting their workforce to the work they do. If they don't
they can't survive."
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said state officials have
been talking to union and Pratt officials about ways to preserve jobs. He said
those talks will continue.
</P>
<P>
	   And Rep. Melody Currey, D-East Hartford, said she'll push for job retraining
programs in the Legislature and encourage other area employers to hire laid off
Pratt workers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be difficult for some of these people to find jobs, but
hopefully the businesses that are looking for help will be able to hire these
qualified workers," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt employs 31,000 people worldwide and about 13,000 in the state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company has no new plans to close any manufacturing
facilities. The company had previously announced it would be moving its military
jet engine business and 2,800 jobs from Florida to Connecticut as part of its
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said the company also plans to hire technical staff in Connecticut.
Once the restructuring is complete, Sullivan said the net workforce in
Connecticut will remain at about 13,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a United Technologies Co. division, designs, manufactures
and services jet engines, space propulsion systems and industrial gas turbines.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says ISS Project a Priority  </HEADLINE>
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's space agency said Friday that the International
Space Station remains its main priority even though it may struggle to replace
rockets that will now be used to extend the lifetime of the Mir station.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no alternative to the ISS for Russia,'' said agency head Yuri
Koptev. ``I would like once again to confirm Russia's adherence to this
project.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Russia decided to keep the troubled Mir in orbit at least
through August by using booster rockets and spaceships that had been intended
for the 16-nation ISS. The government will now have to pay for construction of
new ships and rockets for the international station.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has long urged Russia to abandon the 14-year-old Mir and
commit its resources to the ISS, which is far behind schedule due to Russian
failure to finance construction of some elements.
</P>
<P>
	   Koptev said Russia would launch the long-delayed crew module to the ISS from
the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakstan in late July, to be followed by a piloted
spaceship and two cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest delay in the module's launch has been caused by two crashes of
Proton booster rockets -- the same type that would be used for the module.
Investigation has revealed that the crashes last year resulted from a
manufacturing flaw in one specific series of rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
	   Koptev insisted that all necessary steps have been taken to avoid any
malfunctions in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Koptev admitted that building three more ships for the ISS to fill the gap
caused by allocating hardware to the Mir would be difficult for the
cash-strapped government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no problem whatsoever to manufacture these rockets, the essential
thing is financial resources,'' Koptev said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mir has been flying without a crew since August, and heavily indebted Russia
has been looking for funding from private investors to keep it operating rather
than abandoning it.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-controlled RKK Energia company, which owns Mir, said this month
that it had found a foreign investor who has already transferred $7 million of a
promised initial investment of $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Energia officials refused to give details on the company. Jeffrey Manber,
president of Bermuda-registered MirCorp, told The Associated Press that he is
negotiating with Energia to lease Mir's resources. Manber said that his company
has already transferred money to Energia, but refused to say how much.

</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal did not impress the lead attorney for the boy's Florida
relatives. Spencer Eig said the grandmothers' knowledge was based entirely on
information provided by the Cuban government since Elian was found off the
Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree," said
Eig, repeating the U.S. relatives' invitation for a Miami reunion and nixing any
New York get-together. "If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it
might relieve all their anxiety."

campaign seemed ready to concede Iowa's caucuses and polls showed slippage in
New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts. Those early voting states are central
in Bradley's strategy to upset Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's having a rough time, and it's a bad time to have a rough time," said
Democratic consultant Ray Strother of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   His hand forced by a reporter's question, the former New Jersey senator
confirmed days before Iowa's caucuses that an irregular heartbeat had recurred
four times since he first revealed the condition in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the condition would have no impact on his campaign and tried to
change the topic to his get-out-the vote effort. "You can't control what a heart
does, so the timing is irrelevant," said spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing was relevant to Iowa Democrats who were talking about Bradley's
health - not his health care plan - three days before the first contest of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he has a problem and it's something that won't go away, I think maybe in
the long run he ought to say, 'I've got other things to do. I don't need the
stress of being president,"' Joyce Brown, a 59-year-old Democrat, said between
sips of coffee at a Colfax diner.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue consumed Bradley's campaign Friday. Reporters shouted questions at
a jam-packed news conference and during a walking tour of heavily Republican
Muscatine.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a friendly audience of 50 backers yielded a question that went right to
the heart of the matter: What's this we hear about your health?
</P>
<P>
	   "Several million Americans have it," Bradley replied. "It's a common
condition. It's a nuisance for me and it shouldn't be a concern for you."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted him to reassure me," said crowd member Bonnie Weeks. "I feel
reassured."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's advisers and non-allied Democrats said they expect most voters to
shrug off the news - but only after the campaign takes another hit. "I still
think it's a one-day story," Strother said. "But he's got other problems."
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Bradley's campaign has little chance of winning Monday's caucuses
and aides now fear a blowout.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, a tracking poll gave Gore a nine-point lead and the vice
president's own surveys showed him leading Bradley for the first time in weeks.
A Time/CNN poll showed Gore ahead by 7 percentage points - just outside the
margin of error - more than a month after the group's last survey had the pair
in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns still expect the Feb. 1 primary to be a tossup, but Bradley
doesn't want Gore to leave Iowa with momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   In the political community, activists who glowed about Bradley's insurgent
campaign weeks ago are now wondering whether his team can handle the pressure of
a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley himself has yet to prove he can retain his political base in New
Hampshire - a state that traditionally takes a second and third look at the
field in the frenzied final week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he may be suffering from overexposure," Strother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, including Bradley backers, trace his political troubles to a
string of attacks on Gore that seemed out of character for a candidate who
pledged not to play by the old rules of politics. A fumbled debate question
about agriculture also staggered his Iowa campaign for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   Though still professing confidence about New Hampshire, Bradley's campaign
is hedging its bets by looking ahead to a batch of March 7 primaries - several
of which are in Northeast states that could favor the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
	   "Iowa and New Hampshire are important," campaign chairman Doug Berman said.
"Given the changing calendar of 2000, however, we've always looked at them as
the first step to the national primary between March 7 through March 21."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, must weather the latest questions about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Democrats who shrugged off the condition said it might tip the scales
in a close race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it starts to be debilitating, it would be an issue," said Mike Winnike
of West Point, Iowa. "But this is something he's lived with for a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   Former White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater recalled that his boss,
former President Bush, had a similar condition during his first term and "nobody
really tried to make an issue out of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush benefited by his reputation for being physically active. Bradley, a
Hall of Fame basketball player, may get the same benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Bradley has made a mistake here it might be that he wasn't a little more
forthcoming about what he had," Fitzwater said. "Our experience was when people
understand the illness they accept it because they understand modern medicine's
ability to deal with these things."

<HEADLINE> Japan Robot for Consumers Debuts  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PRIDEAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- It missed its cue to go on stage, but robot Tmsuk IV debuted
Friday on the Japanese consumer market, ready to give back massages and run
simple errands.
</P>
<P>
	   The 4-foot robot comes with a $47,600 price tag, but its manufacturer
Thames, in southwestern Japan, said it plans to sell 10 of them in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   People can control the 220 pound robot by using handheld remote-control and
foot pedals to send electronic signals via a computer and mobile telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   A company videotape showed a boy using the robot to give his grandmother in
a distant city a back massage.
</P>
<P>
	   Tmsuk IV, whose name is loosely based on its manufacturer's name, has
appeared on national TV riding a train and shaking hands with people. It has a
protruding camera for eyes and a microphone for ears. A sweeping, round outer
shell covering its wheels makes it resemble a woman in a ballroom gown.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it hopes to create improved models of the robot in the
future for dangerous tasks such as defusing land mines, working in nuclear
reactors and confronting terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tasks may still be a bit too challenging for Tmsuk IV.
</P>
<P>
	   After a musical fanfare with smoke and bright lights at an unveiling
ceremony in Tokyo, the robot missed its cue because its mobile phone link was
cut off. It also needed human help to get a good grip on a paper cup.

	   Dow Ends off 99.59; New Nasdaq High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)-- Blue-chip stocks fell for a fourth straight
session as investors, fearing a rise in inflation, moved money away
from industrial companies and into the technology issues that have
pushed the Nasdaq stock market higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 99.59 to 11,251.71. The technology-dominated Nasdaq
composite index rose 45.39 to close at 4,234.90, extending the
record it set yesterday. Broader stock indicators were little
changed, although smaller-company shares were showing some
strength. ``There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after
day the Nasdaq goes up,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment officer
of Josephthal &AMP; Co. The Nasdaq rose on the strength of industry
leaders like Cisco Systems and newer companies like
Healtheon/WebMD, an online health care information company that is
the subject of takeover rumors.

	   Caterpillar Earnings Beat Forecasts
</P>
<P>
	   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. today reported a 21 percent
drop in quarterly earnings from a year ago. It blamed declines in
sales and prices, especially in North America and Latin America.
The world's largest maker of construction equipment said its net
income for the October-December period was $239 million, or 67
cents a share, down from $301 million, or 83 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue was $5.02 billion for the quarter, down from $5.41
billion in the final quarter of 1998. Caterpillar stock was up  1/4 at

	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Faced with a shrinking demand for
jet engines, Pratt &AMP; Whitney officials are cutting 1,700 more jobs
by the end of the year, mostly from the company's Connecticut
manufacturing plants. The cuts are in addition to the approximately
3,500 jobs the company has been eliminating since it started a
major restructuring and consolidation effort in 1998. The company
will deliver less than 600 engines in 2000, compared to 800 in
1998. Some of the work load will be moved to overseas operations.

	   Scandinavia Euro Opposition Falls
</P>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Opposition to adopting Europe's single
currency appears to be on the decline in Sweden and Denmark, with
recent moves indicating that it is only a matter of time before
they join the euro. Still, it is likely to take several years for
the two nations' governments to convince the public of the benefits
of joining the European Monetary Union. Leaders of Sweden's ruling
Social Democratic Party proposed today that this year's party
congress in March endorse adopting the euro. Danish Prime Minister
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has said the nation will face referendum on
the euro before the next parliamentary elections, which will be
held by no later than spring 2002.

	   Hi-Tech Revolution Hits Car Dealers
</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Not so long ago, car dealerships seemed like the
next business dinosaur headed for extinction in an Internet world.
Hidebound and mistrusted by many consumers, car dealers were not
ready for the wicked efficiencies of the Internet. But the 22,000
car dealers have proven to be tough competitors. As they gather for
their annual convention this weekend in Orlando, Fla., there will
be more talk about how dealers will use the Internet instead of how
the Internet will use them. The Internet has become the front lines
in fighting for auto consumers. Studies from J.D. Power and
Associates have found that about 5 million new car buyers last year
-- about 40 percent of all retail car buyers -- used the Internet to
at least research their choices. But only 2.7 percent of buyers
purchased their vehicles online.

	   Corruption in Union Reported
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest union of government
workers said internal policing and cooperation with outside
authorities helped uncover substantial financial losses from
corruption that the union reported to its insurers last year.
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees
president Gerald W. McEntee said the union has a ``zero tolerance
policy toward wrongdoers.'' ``That wrongdoers have been identified
and justice pursued is simply evidence of that,'' McEntee said in a
written statement. Today, AFSCME officials confirmed the existence
of a document summarizing the union's losses to fraud after the New
York Times reported that the document listed $4.6 million in claims
the union made to its insurance company in November. The union was
seeking reimbursement under a policy covering fraud by union
officials.

	   Summers Urges Japan To Open Economy

percent target for economic growth as the country pulls out of its
deepest slump in decades, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
said today. Summers, in Japan for the weekend meeting of the Group

<HEADLINE> U.N. Used Donkeys To Aid Afghans  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Using 1,500 donkeys, the United Nations hauled
tons of blankets and food through northern Afghanistan's snow-clogged mountain
passes over the last couple months to reach thousands of Afghans stranded by
fighting, U.N. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The relief operation that started in November and ended this month brought
food and blankets to 2,000 families in Dar-e-Souf in Afghanistan's Samangan
province, an area bitterly contested by the Taliban religious army, which
governs 90 percent of the country, and northern-based rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Intense fighting during much of last year forced about 5,000 families to
flee Dar-e-Souf, 120 miles north of the capital, Kabul, according to Michael
Semple, acting U.N. coordinator for humanitarian relief to the Hazarajat region
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew they were there, that they needed help, but it was how to get help
to them,'' said Stephanie Bunker, U.N. spokeswoman in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The operation involved 1,500 donkeys making 6,000 trips over 24 miles of
narrow mountain passes in subzero temperatures. An agreement between the two
warring sides in November allowed the aid to move through the area.
</P>
<P>
	   The area of Dar-e-Souf is ``highly inaccessible,'' particularly in cold
weather, Semple said. Land mines along the mountain road made it impossible for
trucks to carry supplies, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred, Semple organized the donkey convoys with the help of Afghans
from nearby villages, loading the animals with bright red blankets and sending
them over the snow-bound passes. On the other side, trucks collected and
distributed the supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Cold weather and land mines weren't the only danger. Packs of wolves,
sometimes traveling eight and nine together, patrolled the passes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan faced considerable skepticism, including from within the United
Nations itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Semple said it was impossible to provide aid to all 5,000 stranded families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we did reach the poorest,'' he said. The others were aided by the
villages where they sought shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   Semple said that in some houses, five or six families were staying together.
``Some are relatives but some are not,'' he said. ``Rather than see refugees out
in the cold they invite them into their homes.''

<HEADLINE> Grandmas Important in Elian's Life  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The Cuban women who flew to the United States on Friday to
plead for the return of their grandson played a major role in raising 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian spent much of his life in the houses of his maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, and his paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana. Relatives and
neighbors have told reporters that two women were friendly despite the divorce
of their children.
</P>
<P>
	   Both families have long lived in Cardenas, a city on Cuba's north coast
about 90 miles east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Miguel Gonzalez and Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's parents, had been
teen-age sweethearts. They separated several years ago, but they apparently
remained friendly after their divorce, appearing together at birthday parties
and school events for their son.
</P>
<P>
	   After the divorce, Elisabeth moved with Elian into her mother's house. Elian
remained there for a time even after Elisabeth moved out with her new boyfriend,
Lazaro Munero, who apparently had clashed with the grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   With Elisabeth working as a waitress during the week, Elian also spent much
of the week at the house of his father and paternal grandparents. Juan Gonzalez,
his grandfather, worked in the Interior Ministry, which handles internal
security in Cuba. Quintana worked for the Justice Ministry. Both are considered
loyal members of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, in late November, Lazaro and Elisabeth took Elian along with them on
their ill-fated journey from Cuba to Florida. Lazaro and Elisabeth died when the
boat Lazaro had arranged for the trip sank. Nine other people also perished, but
Elian was plucked from the sea alive.
</P>
<P>
	   As the debate over Elian's future has grown into a major political battle
between Cuba and anti-Castro Cubans abroad, the two grandmothers occasionally
have appeared together at demonstrations to insist on the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 11 interview with Cuban state television, Quintana recalled
speaking with the boy by telephone and hearing him ask for a new desk in his
room where he could do homework.
</P>
<P>
	   Visibly fighting back tears, she mentioned those in Miami who say her
daughter would have wanted Elian to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am her mother,'' Quintana said of Elisabeth. ``Her last wish on dying,
the most normal thing would be that the child was with his father, with his
maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they are saying is a lie,'' she said. ``They did not know anything
about her ... they never knew her. They are violating her memory.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Research Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he wants to add
nearly $3 billion to federal science and technology research, a broad effort
that he said has already fostered amazing changes in American life and national
wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase in next year's budget would add nearly $1 billion to
information technology-related computer research.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he struggles with computer technology himself, Clinton speaks with
enthusiasm about the wonders technology has wrought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is changing everything about the way we work and live and relate to
each other,'' Clinton said of the Internet, saying the computer network is a
major reason for the nation's continued economic growth, which is on pace to
break all previous records next month.
</P>
<P>
	   His own administration also should get credit for managing a changing
economy well, Clinton told students and faculty at the California Institute of
Technology. But he acknowledged that to a degree, what the government did best
was stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real reason this thing keeps going on and on and on is all we did in
the government was to set the conditions and provide the tools for the American
people to succeed,'' Clinton said in his address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real reason is the exponential growth in information technology and
how it is rifling through every other sector of our economy,'' creating jobs no
one had heard of a few years ago and reinforcing other scientific advances, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also cautioned of the dark side of scientific and
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The same genetic revolution that can offer new hope for millions of
Americans could also be used to deny people health insurance, clone a human
being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists and public servants must make sure that science serves humanity
and not the other way around, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton came to Southern California, a major recipient of federal research
dollars, to detail his plan to add $2.8 billion to the federal budget for
science and technology research -- benefiting studies of cancer, diabetes and
AIDS as well as computer technology, among others. California, with about 12
percent of the nation's population, draws 20 percent of federal research
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also planned a round or two of golf in the sunny weather, and
two rounds of Democratic fund raising among Hollywood supporters. Clinton was
staying at the home of film producer David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, administration officials said Clinton, pursuing his goal of
connecting all Americans to the Internet, will propose federal subsidies to
narrow the ``digital divide'' and help millions of low-income families go
online. He has said Internet access and usage should be as commonplace as the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft proposal calls for spending as much as $100 million to provide
computers and Internet access in perhaps as many as 9 million households.
Clinton has not yet determined the exact size of the proposal, said
administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is expected to announce the proposal in his State of the Union
address Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That speech is also likely to mention some details of the package he
announced Friday, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The National Institutes of Health would get an extra $1 billion on top of
an existing budget of nearly $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --The 56-year-old National Science Foundation would get a 17 percent
increase -- its largest budget boost ever. The $675 million would augment an
existing budget of $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress, the new money would increase total U.S. spending on
basic scientific and technological research to about $43 billion in 2001, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   University research spending is popular in Congress, in part because it
spreads dollars outside Washington. But Republicans are already warning that
ambitious new spending packages face rough sledding this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP-controlled House Budget Committee estimated that before the latest
science and technology proposals, the White House had called attention to about
50 new initiatives costing nearly $29 billion that it plans to include in the
upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton university research plan reflects an emphasis on biomedical and
so-called lifestyle research as opposed to more traditional basic research into
mathematics and physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``University-based research provides the kind of fundamental insights that
are most important in any new technology or treatment,'' Clinton said. ``It
helps to produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
and we intend to give university-based research a major lift.''

<HEADLINE> Tribune Earns Jump 19 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co., the parent company of the Chicago Tribune and
the Chicago Cubs, reported a 19 percent increase in profits for the final
quarter of 1999 Friday amid continued growth in its television business.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribune earned $116 million, or 43 cents a share, up from $97 million, or 36
cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results mirrored Wall
Street expectations, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 8 percent to $828 million from $765 million in the same period
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's broadcasting and entertainment division led the way with an 18
percent increase in operating profit, to $113 million from $96 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribune officials continued to attribute much of those revenues to nightly
showings of the syndicated television show "Friends" on its stations in Boston,
Chicago and New York. The company also owns a 25 percent stake in the WB
network, which airs such popular shows as "Dawson's Creek" and "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer."
</P>
<P>
	   Operating profit for Tribune's publishing operations rose 8 percent to $108
million, while the company's education unit reported an operating loss of $11
million, compared with a $2 million profit in the same period in 1998. Tribune
officials attributed the education unit losses to a decline in retail sales,
increased marketing costs and a one-time inventory-related charge.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, earnings rose 18 percent to $415 million, or $1.54 a share,
from $351 million, or $1.27 a share in 1998. Full-year revenues rose 8 percent
to $3.22 billion from $2.98 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribune shares rose 50 cents to $49.06 1/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Earnings Beat Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
    By JAY HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. on Friday reported a 21 percent drop
in quarterly earnings from a year ago, blaming a decrease in sales and prices,
primarily in North America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest maker of construction equipment said its net income for
the October-December period was $239 million, or 67 cents a share, down from
$301 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 64 cents a
share earnings projected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $5.02 billion for the quarter, down from $5.41 billion in the
final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of the Peoria, Ill.-based company rose 25 cents to $47.37 1/2 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Caterpillar posted a profit of $946 million, or $2.63 per
share, down 37 percent from $1.51 billion, or $4.11 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for 1999 was $19.7 billion, down 6 percent from $20.98 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "Profit in 1999 was significantly lower than we anticipated at the beginning
of the year due to weaker machine demand in the second half and ongoing price
competition," said Glen Barton, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects sales and revenue to increase this year in every
region except North America.

<HEADLINE> Europe Invests Big in Latin America  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- European companies led by Spanish firms have surpassed
the United States as the main source of direct foreign investment in Latin
America and the Caribbean, at reaching record levels compared with the early
1990s, a U.N.-World Bank report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey also said expansion of multinational corporations is gaining
momentum as the world economy becomes increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
	   The 223-page report, produced by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean, covers 1998, the last year for which complete figures
are available.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Mortimore, the main author, said the region's foreign investment
would be "reaching unimaginable levels at the end of 1999, nearing $86 billion
compared to $18 billion from 1990 to 1994."
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Latin America and the Caribbean have almost closed the gap
with Asia as a destination for investment funds. One factor in the late-century
growth spurt was the Asian financial crisis that started in mid-1997 and sent
investment dollars to the apparently safer Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
	   And even though the crisis spread to Brazil last year, the survey said, that
country, with Latin America's biggest economy, continued as the region's
principal destination for foreign investment, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said Argentina would pass Mexico to claim second place in foreign
investment thanks mainly to the sale of Argentina's oil firm Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales to the Spanish petroleum company Repsol.
</P>
<P>
	   Chile would double its investment inflows in 1999, largely because of
purchases of energy and electric companies by the Spanish electricity giant
Endesa-Espana.
</P>
<P>
	   Mortimore said these Spanish companies and others are becoming "the new kids
on the block" in Latin American economies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Traditionally the United States has been the most important source of
funds," Mortimore said. "But in 1998 Europe passed the United States, primarily
because of the huge increase in investment by Spanish companies."
</P>
<P>
	   He cited Spain's Telefonica, the world's 12th largest telecommunications
company, which has invested more than $10 billion in Latin America and Central
America to become the leading global operator in the region's communications.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the future, Telefonica is going to invest another $20 billion, with $6
billion of that destined for Brazil," Mortimore said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Closes in on $30 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   As crude oil prices roared toward $30 a barrel this week, reaching levels
last seen on the brink of the Persian Gulf War, airlines were adding surcharges
to ticket prices and consumers were worrying about heating bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet inflation remains tame and the U.S. economy has barely blinked.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason: Oil simply doesn't lubricate the new, tech-savvy economy the way
it once did.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil's overall impact on the economy is vastly reduced" from years past,
said William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services.
"That's due to the increased energy efficiency of companies that use oil heavily
and the increased importance of industries that are not heavily dependent on
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for crude have jumped nearly $5 a barrel in the past week. Heating
oil, spurred not only by oil's surge but a Northeastern cold snap, has risen
nearly 50 percent in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   But even with energy products pushing to a series of new nine-year highs,
many Americans keep shelling out undaunted for gasoline and other petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't deter me," motorist Chip Tuttle said at a Boston gas station
Friday as he paid $43 to fill his sport-utility vehicle, despite gas prices that
are the highest they've been there since Christmas 1990. "The economy is good."
</P>
<P>
	   The era of cheap oil began ending last March when the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day. The
oil producers were determined to end a world oil glut and push up prices that
fell as low as $11.37 a barrel in February.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC, an often undisciplined cartel, was able to hold down production.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. oil supplies now are at their lowest level in several years and the
International Energy Agency warned Thursday that markets "are tight and getting
tighter."
</P>
<P>
	   Since March, crude prices have more than doubled, reaching a nine-year high
in November that was smashed again this week. Oil for February delivery rose as
high as $29.95 during trading Thursday before the contract expired. In trading
Friday, the March contract briefly rose above $29 before giving up some ground.
The new near-term contract still managed to finish the day with a gain of 23
cents to close at $28.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Two decades ago, a similarly huge spike in oil prices caused gas lines and
sent the U.S. economy into shock. But in 1999, while fuel oil and gasoline
prices climbed sharply, the "core" rate of inflation -- excluding the volatile
energy and food sectors -- rose at its smallest rate in 34 years, just 1.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   What happened to inflation? Where's the recession?
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists are still warning of dire consequences, especially if oil's
rise continues unabated. Phil Verleger, economist for the Brattle Group, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., sees oil headed to $40 by year's end,
prompting several interest rate increases and a recession before the year is
out.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it went to $40 a barrel, it would be disruptive," said Bruce Steinberg,
chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "You can't keep going up endlessly without
having an effect."
</P>
<P>
	   But America has built up a much better resistance to energy shocks. The oil
price explosions of the mid- and late-1970s helped spawn a new energy
consciousness and the giant steps taken by technology steered the economy away
from manufacturing and toward services and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil expenditures, which accounted for 8.5 percent of gross domestic product
in 1981, have fallen to about 3 percent, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil is still probably the single most important price that affects the
well-being of Americans," said Cheney. "When the price goes up ... America is in
a sense a little poorer. But we are much better at adapting to it now."
</P>
<P>
	   Adjusting or not, consumers are being increasingly squeezed by oil's rise.
Among the latest consequences of the increase in prices:
</P>
<P>
	   --The nation's top airlines said this week they are adding a $20 surcharge
to round-trip tickets because of jet fuel costs that have more than doubled in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Trucking companies are hiking rates by 5 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --Business owners are beginning to pass on to consumers the new, higher
prices charged by shippers ranging from the United Parcel Service to the post
office.
</P>
<P>
	   --U.S. gasoline prices are rising again after dipping since hitting a 3
1/2-year high of almost $1.35 a gallon last month. Signs announcing hikes of as
much as 15 cents a gallon have been posted this week at gas stations in the
Minneapolis area.
</P>
<P>
	   American consumers, particularly motorists, are griping more about OPEC
these days.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Brown, a cook with a gas-guzzling 1976 Pontiac Catalina, paid $1.45
per gallon for regular unleaded Friday for his commute across Boston and vowed
he'll find another way to get to work if it goes above $1.50.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it goes absolutely berserk, if it just goes through the roof, I won't
drive," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the most part, however, motorists are not staying off the roads, and
they're not losing sleep about the specter of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it really has anything to do with it," said Berry Emerson of
Anoka, Minn., on Friday as he waited for mechanics to fix his car in
Minneapolis. "Other parts of the economy -- the construction industry,
especially -- also drive that, and there's a lot of room for growth."

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers fly into NYC, appeal for his release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager to accompany their grandson back to his native
Cuba, the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez arrived Friday in New York
and appealed directly to the American people for his return.
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter will be in peace, and
she will not be in peace until Elian is home," the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, said through a translator at a packed news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   She addressed reporters after a similar plea by the boy's paternal
grandmother, Mariela Quintana, at a question and answer session which was
broadcast live on several national cable networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana said in Spanish to reporters waiting inside a
hangar at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," she said later. "He
was born in Cuba. He is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal did not impress the lead attorney for the boy's Florida
relatives. Spencer Eig said the grandmothers' knowledge was based entirely on
information provided by the Cuban government since Elian was found off the
Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree," said
Eig, repeating the U.S. relatives' invitation for a Miami reunion and nixing any
New York get-together. "If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it
might relieve all their anxiety."
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, accompanied by a three-member U.S. church delegation,
opted to fly over the boy's temporary Miami home and instead bring their message
to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Their grandson, the subject of both a personal battle for custody between
family members and a political tug-of-war between the Castro regime and
expatriate Cubans, is living in Florida with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carrying the grandmothers arrived in New York shortly after 3:30
p.m., about three hours after it took off from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of U.S. Customs officials and
police, winced from the cold as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree
temperature for their short walk into an airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S.,
although organizers said it will only be a few days and the grandmothers' visas
were good for two months. The pair planned to have dinner in New York and rest
before resuming their efforts to reclaim their grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides were considering a
request that she meet with the grandmothers, Justice spokesman Myron Marlin
said. The request was made on their behalf by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.,
through Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' arrival may
convince skeptics of the family's sincerity. Some anti-Castro activists
suggested the Cuban government pressured the women into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot
power boat, became an international cause celebre when he was found two months
ago floating on an inner tube two miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother and 10 other Cubans died when the ill-fated boat capsized on its
way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the 6-year-old in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
But attorneys for the family in Florida accused the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Leader Clings To Power  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- When President Jamil Mahuad took power, Ecuadoreans
were hopeful that he would bring a new style of governing to this small Andean
nation, submerged for years in economic stagnation and deeply rooted government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   He had the right credentials: a master's degree in public administration
from Harvard, six years as a successful mayor of Quito, the image of a youthful,
honest public servant with fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   But barely 17 months into office, Mahuad confronts demands from a radical
Indian movement and the armed forces to step down and relinquish power.
</P>
<P>
	   For months he has been under fire from political rivals on both the left and
right, as well as business and labor leaders who say he has displayed
irresponsible incompetence in handling Ecuador's worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression. They accuse him of vacillating and delaying for months in
making crucial decisions as Ecuador sank deeper into a social and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to resign,'' a weary-looking Mahuad said in an interview
Thursday evening at the national palace in Quito's colonial downtown. ``I am the
head of the government and what we need is to consolidate democratic stability.
Beginning in 1930, Ecuador had 16 governments in 10 years and that solved
absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he spoke, helmeted riot police and soldiers with automatic rifles guarded
barbed wire perimeters around the palace to hold back protesters who have been
demonstrating for the past two weeks, demanding his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad blamed much of the criticism against him on Ecuador's ``cannibalistic
politics,'' saying that even in a time of crisis, the country's political
parties do not act in the best interests of the nation but instead seek to
exploit a government's weaknesses to expand their own political power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have seen those American football games where the players all pile on
the one carrying the ball so that he will drop it? That is Ecuador,'' Mahuad
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 9, in what he described as a bid to halt spiraling inflation and
stabilize the economy, Mahuad announced plans to make the U.S. dollar Ecuador's
official currency, making Ecuador the first country in South America to abandon
its own currency.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters called it a bold move, but skeptics characterized it as a
desperate measure whose consequences had not been thought out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was more a political measure than an economic measure,'' said political
scientist Simon Patina. ``He made the decision as the only way to save his
government.''

<HEADLINE> Spain Ice Blamed on Weird Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Scientists who spent days studying chunks of ice that
have been dropping on Spain said Friday that most were practical jokes but some
were the result of a freak weather phenomenon miles above the Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Spain has been captivated by the phenomenon, which began Jan. 8 when
the first of some 30 projectiles, some the size of basketballs, came crashing
down in southern Seville province. Since then, ice chunks have been found all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The enigma grew to acquire front-page status for virtually every newspaper,
with varying degrees of tongue-in-cheek coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Hypotheses as to the origin of the ice ranged from comets to human urine
expelled from airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   At least a preliminary verdict came Friday at a packed news conference led
by Jesus Martinez Frias, the head of the group of scientists assembled to come
up with an explanation.
</P>
<P>
	   While many chunks were most likely planted in the streets by pranksters,
Martinez said at least some of the ice pieces had probably been formed through
sudden temperature drops in the stratosphere, which begins about seven miles
above Earth and extends to about 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   Martinez said similar cases had been reported in China and Brazil in 1995,
with even bigger pieces of ice -- up to 440 pounds. Still, he called the
phenomenon ``very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said that while this was the most likely explanation, they
were still unsure and would continue their study.
</P>
<P>
	   In previous days, chemists at the University of Valencia had ruled out the
possibility the chunks were frozen human waste from airplanes because there was
no evidence of microorganisms that would be present in urine.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, questions remained. Fernando Lopez, a professor at Madrid's
Autonomous University questioned how ice could form in the stratosphere because
that layer has very little moisture.
</P>
<P>
	   And, he added, once a piece starts forming, how does it remain suspended
long enough to grow to weigh nearly 9 pounds, as some of the Spanish chunks did?

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a Senate race likely to pit two abortion rights
supporters against one another, Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to outdo Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani Friday on an issue that may have helped tilt the 1998 Senate
election.
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor's name, Mrs. Clinton suggested at a lunch
commemorating the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
that she would be a more vehement abortion-rights advocate in the Senate than
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would want New Yorkers to know that I wouldn't only vote right, but I
would be a strong voice, and I would attempt to organize as much as I could to
make sure that I defended a woman's right to choose," Mrs. Clinton told
reporters after speaking at a National Abortion &AMP; Reproductive Rights Action
League luncheon.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, an abortion rights supporter who has spoken in the past at the
annual NARAL event, was invited this year, said NARAL director Kelli Conlin, but
he did not attend.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor's position on choice is well known and it has not changed," said
Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton may have trouble winning votes on the issue, since she and
Giuliani are both strong supporters of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1998's Senate race, abortion rights advocates were galvanized by the
murder shortly before the election of Dr. Bernard Slepian, a Buffalo doctor who
performed abortions. Charles Schumer, a Democratic supporter of abortion rights,
defeated anti-abortion Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in an extremely close election,
largely on the strength of his three-to-two advantage among female voters.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, with two candidates who support abortion rights, the issue may be
less prominent. Although Mrs. Clinton was received warmly by NARAL leaders at
the Harvard Club lunch, the group did not endorse her.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a celebration of Roe vs. Wade, that's what this is all about,"
Conlin said when asked if NARAL was supporting Mrs. Clinton. Saturday is the
27th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conlin said it was too early to say whether NARAL would make an endorsement
in the Senate race. If the group is satisfied with both candidates' support for
abortion rights, it may remain neutral, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been under pressure from Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long to support a ban on late-term abortions, but has so far refused to drop his
opposition to such a ban. No Republican has won a statewide race in New York in
25 years without Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to give a lot of credit to the mayor, because he's stood up to
Michael Long and he's really defended the principles," Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said that with the U.S. Supreme Court preparing to hear
arguments on the late-term procedure opponents call "partial-birth abortion,"
the Senate's role in safeguarding abortion rights will be increasingly
important.
</P>
<P>
	   "For women, the Senate will be our court of last resort," she said. "It will
not be enough for any senator simply to cast the right vote and sit down.
Because this is going to be a struggle that will be particularly difficult if we
do not, for reasons that I hope will not come to pass, hold the White House."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked after the lunch about her feelings when a radio interviewer inquired
several days ago whether she had been faithful to her husband, Mrs. Clinton said
was not bothered and would not let such questions distract her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew that when I entered this race that there would be people who might
ask inappropriate questions, but that's not going to deter me," she said. "None
of that concerns me in the least, because I think there's a lot at stake in this
election."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, she took another jab at Giuliani, promising a conference of
city educators that she would offer public schools support, not blame.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm committed to working with you and to building up our schools, not
tearing them down or pointing fingers at those of you who make them work," Mrs.
Clinton told a meeting of the New York City Association for Supervision and
Curriculum Development. "We cannot help our children if we're only interested in
placing blame."
</P>
<P>
	   She never mentioned Giuliani's name, but seemed to be making a clear
reference to the mayor's public criticism of former Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
and his opposition to the Board of Education's choice for Crew's temporary
replacement.

<HEADLINE> No JFK Shirt Material on Bullets  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Testing of microscopic fibers found on a fragment of the
bullet that killed President Kennedy revealed that the material didn't come from
his clothing, according to a report released Friday by the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
	   Some assassination researchers say the finding supports the conclusion that
Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman in the Nov. 22, 1963, shooting of Kennedy
in Dallas. Others say the results are not significant because the fragments have
been contaminated over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the fibers had come from Kennedy's shirt, then it would mean that the
fragments came from another bullet, not the one that struck his head. That would
suggest another bullet was fired, possibly by a second shooter, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   A panel of scientists from the FBI and several government laboratories who
examined the fibers concluded that they were from paper, not cloth. .
</P>
<P>
	   Four other bullet fragments examined were found to contain human skin and
other tissue. Scientists couldn't determined what body parts the tissue came
from. DNA analysis of the material was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests, which were concluded last fall, were a piece of unfinished
business in the investigation of JFK's death. A firearms panel of the House
Select Committee on Assassinations recommended the analysis in 1979, but the
committee left the suggestion out of its final report.
</P>
<P>
	   Second shooter theories have abounded. Assassination buffs have questioned
whether a single bullet -- the so-called ``magic bullet'' -- could have hit
Kennedy, then passed through him and wounded Texas Gov. John B. Connally, who
was riding in a limousine with Kennedy at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The five fragments examined were from the nose portion of another bullet --
the one that tore through Kennedy's head and caused the fatal injury. One of the
fragments had fibrous material stuck to it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a theory that those little strands were possibly from Kennedy's
tie or Connally's shirt,'' said John Tunheim, former chairman of the
government's Assassination Records Review Board, a now-defunct federal panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The report released Friday bolstered the Warren Commission's conclusion that
Oswald acted alone, Tunheim said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jim Lesar, president of the private Assassination Archives and Research
Center, questioned the finding. ``I don't know that this tells us anything. The
integrity of the chain of possession of the fragments was abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bullet fragments had been stored for years in a metal cannister lined
with cotton, but tests showed that material found on the bullet was not the same
as the cotton from the can.
</P>
<P>
	   A letter released by the archives shows that the Justice Department wanted
the fragments examined to test the ``assassination conspiracy theory'' of John
Orr, chief of the antitrust division's Atlanta field office.
</P>
<P>
	   If the material was from Kennedy's shirt, tie or tie liner, there might have
been a ``different trajectory than that previously identified -- according to
Mr. Orr's observations,'' John Keeney, acting assistant attorney general, wrote
in a January 1996 letter to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Orr had a ``narrow theory
that this matter should be tested further.'' He couldn't specify what the theory
was and said Orr would not comment.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Rise As Inflation Worry Eases  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose Friday, recouping losses from Thursday's
session and ending a roller coaster week on a high note.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed 17/32 point, or $5.31 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.70
percent from 6.74 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The spike in the value of the benchmark 30-year bond helped carry the rest
of the Treasurys market higher as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said prices increased on a day that saw no new signs of rising
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, most market observers believe Federal reserve policy-makers will
increase interest rates to slow the roaring U.S. economy at their next meeting
in February.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, bond prices dropped after several government reports indicated
the economy is strengthening, causing concern that the Fed will act to raise
short-term rates to slow growth before it leads to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher rates on new fixed-rate securities, such as government bonds, would
hurt the value of already purchased ones.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose by
between 1/16 point and 3/32 point, and intermediate maturities rose 3/32 point
to  1/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.45 percent as the discount
remained unchanged at 5.30 percent. Six-month yields were 5.80 percent, as the
discount rose 0.01 at 5.56 percent. One-year yields were 6.08 percent as the
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 5.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
traded at 5.38 percent from 5.50 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal funds rose 1/32 to 91 5/32 point. The
yield was unchanged at 6.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Said Willing To Cut Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- OPEC members are willing to extend production
cuts beyond March as a way of maintaining high international prices, a top
Venezuelan official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC countries will formalize their desire to extend current output accords
at a March 24 meeting in Vienna, Austria, Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero
said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The countries first agreed to cut production to bolster prices in 1998, and
again in March of last year. The cuts have achieved their desired goal, with the
international price of oil rising to about 28 per barrel, a nine-year high.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC and one of the world's top oil
exporters, saw the price of its oil rise more than $3 a barrel this week alone
-- to $24.83 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   "The idea is to keep prices at acceptable levels for consuming and producing
nations," Valero said. "The results have been good, look at the oil prices for
example."
</P>
<P>
	   Valero also said that OPEC countries had agreed on a September date for
their first summit involing the heads of state in more than two decades. The
meeting will take place in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Valero added that major independent oil producing nations Norway, Russia,
Oman and Mexico also will be invited to attend the summit, which he said will
take place at the end of September. The exact date has not been finalized, he
added.

<HEADLINE> FDA Concerns Spark Supplement Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Florida company is recalling 5,000 bottles of a product
called Zen that it sold as a dietary supplement, but which the government says
contains a dangerous and illegal drug called BD.
</P>
<P>
	   BD is chemically related to the illegal ``party drugs'' and sleep aids GHB
and GBL.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration considers the drugs significant health
hazards, because they have been associated with at least three deaths and 119
other serious side effects, including comas, breathing difficulty, vomiting and
seizures. They are particularly dangerous when used with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   BD, also sold as an industrial solvent, became notorious three years ago
when more than 100 New Year's partygoers in Los Angeles became sick after
consuming drinks containing the chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA last year began hunting for companies that sell the chemicals under
the guise of dietary supplements, in a renewed attempt to get them off the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Science Enhancement Systems of Delray Beach, Fla., said it had
agreed to recall 5,400 bottles of Zen distributed in 24 states since last April.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers should not drink Zen, but return it to the place of purchase for a
refund, the company said. Consumers with questions may call the company at
561-707-1001.
</P>
<P>
	   Zen is a liquid sold in 35-ounce bottles that list the ingredient Sucol B,
which is really BD, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends off 99.59; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell for a fourth straight session Friday
as investors found many reasons to move money away from industrial companies and
toward the technology issues that once again pushed the Nasdaq composite to a
new closing high.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 99.59 to 11,251.71. The blue-chip
index tumbled every day in the holiday-shortened week, finishing 471.27 points
below last Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 45.89 to close at
4,235.40, extending the record it set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were little changed, although smaller-company
shares were showing some strength. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 4.21 to
1,441.36 and the Russell 2000 index rose 6.66 to 533.94, its fifth consecutive
closing high.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a panic to own Nasdaq stocks because day after day the Nasdaq goes
up," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer of Josephthal &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose on the strength of industry leaders like Cisco Systems and
newer companies like Healtheon/WebMD, an online health care information company
that is the subject of takeover rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   Cisco rose 2 7/8 to 115 1/4 and Healtheon rose 8 15/16 to 59 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq also drew some buyers as investors moved money away from older,
cyclical stocks that are sensitive to fluctuations in inflation. A rise in crude
oil prices this week has rekindled fears that inflation could revive and prompt
the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than than the market has been
expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange have surged more than $4 a
barrel in the past week after members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said they wouldn't boost output as expected in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase in oil prices helped companies like Exxon Mobil, which rose 1
5/16 to 85, and Chevron, which gained 1 1/16 to 88 9/16. Airlines, however,
which could face sharply higher expenses because of rising fuel prices, saw
their stocks tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 2 to 58 7/16, while Delta
Air Lines fell 2 to 46 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble plunged 9 7/8 to 102 11/16 amid reports it may buy
drugmaker Warner-Lambert. Shares of the consumer products company have tumbled
this week as investors debated how much P&AMP;G's earnings would be hurt by a bold
move to acquire a leading drug company.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Dow's weakness has been concentrated in a handful of stocks that had a
bad week, and Procter &AMP; Gamble certainly did," said Barry Hyman, senior equity
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. "Wall Street believes that
there's a deal in the works and isn't sure of the benefits."
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings reports once again drove market activity. Lucent Technologies ended
a volatile session up  1/4 at 52 3/4 after the company said late Thursday that
profits plunged 23 percent in the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent's earnings narrowly missed Wall Street forecasts that were already
slashed after a warning two weeks ago, but the company's chief executive
expressed optimism about future results.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems fell 2 1/8 to 84 7/16 despite a
better-than-expected profit report late Thursday by the company, which produces
hardware and software for the Internet and other computer networks. Sun's stock
had rallied more than 25 percent over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE consolidated volume totaled 1.46 billion shares, compared
with 1.35 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.68 percent. Most European
indexes also closed lower. Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.70 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.17 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.18 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By PAISLEY DODDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to New York from Cuba on
Friday to appeal for his return, saying the boy's late mother will not ``rest in
peace'' until the 6-year-old boy is back in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Respect the memory of my daughter,'' said the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   She and the boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, flew with a church
delegation that has supported Elian's return over the objections of Cuban
immigrants and the boy's relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The women chose to avoid Miami, at least for now, and take their message to
the nation's media capital. It was not immediately clear how long they were
staying in the United States; people who organized the trip said it will only be
a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides were considering a request that
she meet with the grandmothers, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said.
The boy's relatives in Florida invited the grandmothers to visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat on which he was heading for the United States capsized,
killing his mother and 10 other people. He has been living with relatives in
Miami, who say he would have a better life in the United States. They are
challenging a government ruling that he must go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that many say that it was Elian's mother's will that the child
remain here,'' Ms. Rodriguez said in Spanish. ``I speak for her because I was
her mother, I know what she thought and how she acted. She came here because her
husband was very violent and threatened her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask and beg those who are interested in helping us, to do everything
possible so that the child will be handed over to us, his grandmothers, so that
my daughter may rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of Customs officials and police,
winced as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree cold for their short walk
into a terminal at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen. He was born in Cuba.
He is a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
The boy's Miami relatives claim the boy has said he wants to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives' lead attorney, Spencer Eig, said he was not impressed
by the grandmothers' emotional appeal. Eig said the women's information about
the case came almost entirely from the communist government.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig repeated the Miami relatives' invitation to the grandmothers to come to
Miami for a reunion and said his clients would not go to New York to meet with
the women.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree,''
Eig said. ``If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it might relieve
all their anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned to his
father. But attorneys for the family in Florida have asked a federal judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   A senator from Florida is sponsoring legislation that would allow Elian to
have U.S. citizenship. The bill by GOP Sen. Connie Mack will be filed Monday and
could come up for a vote as soon as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent,'' Lott said during an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One'' to
be aired Sunday on PBS. ``It would not allow the administration to blow back and
forth depending on what Castro says, but it would allow the courts to determine
custody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the federal judge who was to hear the lawsuit by the boy's
Miami relatives withdrew from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge James Lawrence King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King,
once hired Armando Gutierrez -- a man now working as spokesman for the boy's
relatives in Miami -- to help in his re-election bid. King also has a daughter
who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

Mercantile Exchange as a two-week rally which had accelerated after frigid
weather struck the Northeast exploded into panic buying.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil, meanwhile, continued its march upward at a less frenzied pace,
rising 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, corn prices hit a new 3 1/2-month high and cocoa rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices, which traditionally increase at this time of year when
demand grows, have rocketed upward on a tide of emotion in the trading pits at
the New York Merc as investors react to the weather, the bull market for
petroleum products and the fast-increasing price.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil for February delivery, after rising as high as 97.74 cents a
gallon, settled 7.04 cents higher for the day at 93.50 cents -- a gain of 44
percent in two weeks, including 27 percent this week alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst Tim Evans called it a "market on the edge of a nervous breakdown."
As evidence that the buying spree was out of control, he noted that the March
and April contracts, which respond to the same fundamentals, declined
significantly for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   "The spike that we've seen this week has been way out of proportion with the
amount of cold weather that we have in the Northeast," said Evans, senior energy
analyst for the Pegasus Econometrics Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading volume for the past two frenzied days has been relatively small, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   "This spike has carried well beyond anybody's expectation, and has gotten
such an extreme level that a lot of people have just completely backed away from
trading it at all," Evans said, suggesting that a steep fall in the price may be
likely soon.
</P>
<P>
	   West Texas intermediate crude oil for March delivery rose 23 cents to $28.20
a barrel amid increasing expectations that the $30 level is imminent. The
expiring February contract had climbed as high as $29.95 a barrel on Thursday.

	   Corn, continuing a rally, rose to its latest high on the Chicago Board of
Trade on support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's weekly report on
export sales, which showed higher numbers than expected. March corn rose 2 cents
to $2.22 3/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Mayor, Lautenberg push to close small Atlantic City airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Loved by private pilots but hated by city
officials, a little-used general aviation airport located in the shadow of the
casinos may be closing - and not because of the snow.
<P>
	   Mayor James Whelan and U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who favor closing Bader
Field, met Friday with representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration to
pitch a plan under which the airport's operations would be transferred to
Woodbine Municipal Airport in Cape May County.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA officials listened to the proposal but made no commitment, according to
Lautenberg, D-N.J. The agency's representatives left the City Hall meeting
before reporters were allowed in.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport would then be converted into a park, conceivably with soccer and
softball fields and some much-needed green space, Whelan said. "We have the
beach in Atlantic City, frankly, and not much else," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bader Field, located adjacent to The Sandcastle baseball stadium and Flyers'
Skate Zone on U.S. 40, serves private pilots only; charter jets and commercial
airlines operate from Atlantic City International Airport, 12 miles west of the
city in Egg Harbor Township.
</P>
<P>
	   Whelan has long wanted to close the facility, saying there are better uses
for the land.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's only a handful of pilots who use it," Whelan said Friday. "We don't
think general aviation is the best use of that real estate. Given the needs we
have in the city for park space and better use of it, we'd like to make it a
park or recreation area, something that benefits all of south Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   The city has already moved in that direction. In 1998, it opened The
Sandcastle as the home of the minor-league Atlantic City Surf. Last year, the
Skate Zone, an ice hockey and ice skating facility, opened next door.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city's acceptance of $6.4 million in FAA airport improvement grants
over the years has obligated it to keep the facility open through 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   The city wants FAA permission to close Bader Field and has worked with
Woodbine officials on a plan to spend $10.6 million to add a terminal, an apron,
taxiways, a business park and a golf course. Of the $10 million, $4.4 million
would come from unspecified private investment, $3 million from the state or
federal government, $2 million from unspecified "other funding" and $1.1 million
from the state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Sending private aviators to Woodbine would help boost that airport and Cape
May County as a whole but keep them within a 35-minute drive of Atlantic City's
casinos, Whelan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Private pilots, however, want none of that.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the world's largest
civil aviation organization, complained to the FAA last year that the city was
purposely letting the airport deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
	   "Normally, when you go into an airport, there's a terminal building, a
decent place to tie down the airplane where it's not going to get hit by errant
foul balls, a restroom, a telephone," said Warren Morningstar, the group's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's disingenuous of the city to neglect the airport, to turn it into a
less-than-desirable facility and then turn around and say 'It's run-down.' It's
a self-fulfilling prophecy."
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Weck, 65, of Paulding, Ohio, a private pilot who was preparing to take
off from the airport Friday, said he sees why Whelan wants to close it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can understand that," said Weck, dusting the snow off the wings of his
Seneca Piper. "I'm not for privileged use. Atlantic City International is close
enough. But as long as it's here, I'll use it."

<HEADLINE> Dec. Budget Posts $33B Surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government recorded a budget surplus of $33.08 billion
in December helped along by a flow of tax payments, the Treasury Department said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   That compared with a $5.16 billion deficit posted for December 1998. That
deficit stemmed from two Social Security payments made that month because the
payment date for January fell on a weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for December 1999 totaled $201.2 billion while expenditures came to
$168.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   December's surplus was bigger than the $31 billion many analysts were
anticipating and the $32.5 billion projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The latest financial numbers from the Department of Treasury indicate that
we are on track this year to reach a third consecutive annual budget surplus,''
President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   If a surplus materializes for fiscal 2000 as expected, it would be the first
time the government reported three consecutive years of surpluses since 1947,
1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first three months of fiscal year 2000, which began Oct. 1, the
government is running a deficit of $20.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   A budget surplus still is expected for all of 2000, however. The Clinton
administration is predicting a $142.5 billion surplus for fiscal 2000, while the
CBO is expecting $161 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the government reported a
record surplus of $124.4 billion, slightly more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 surplus followed a $69.2 billion surplus in 1998, the first time
the government finished in the black since 1969. The back-to-back annual
surpluses were the first since 1956 and 1957 under President Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
	   The government revised November's deficit to $27.03 billion, slightly less
than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the biggest spending categories were: interest on the public
debt, $73.27 billion; Social Security, $37.72 billion; Health and Human Services
Department programs, $36.63 billion; and military spending, $29.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Government revenue from individual income tax payments in December came to
$94.54 billion, compared with $75.99 billion for the same month in 1998.
Corporate income tax payments totaled $44.95 billion in December, up from $42.37
billion in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed Vs. Major Currencies  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar was mixed in currency trading Friday, rising
against the euro and the British pound as technology stocks on the rise helped
draw investors into the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dollar fell against the yen as traders seemed convinced that the
Group of Seven industrialized nations would not support a weakened yen when
finance ministers meet this weekend in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0092, down from $1.0166
Thursday, and the dollar was quoted at 104.83 Japanese yen, down from 105.29.
The British pound fell to $1.6496 from $1.6545.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq Stock Market rose Friday to another record high, even as
blue-chip stocks fell. Without other data from Europe or the United States to
guide them, investors shuffled their money into the dollar to buy technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, interest rates on U.S. bonds provided appealing yields versus
those of German bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything else being equal ... it looks a little more attractive to go
into the United States (securities and currency)," said Jay Bryson, an
international economist at First Union Capital Markets in Charlotte, N.C.. "That
would cause the dollar to strengthen."
</P>
<P>
	   The yen's rise against the dollar was helped by the release of new data
indicating a stronger Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said that its Tertiary Industry Index, which covers real
estate, communications and other services operations, rose stronger than
expected and "that tends to support the yen," Bryson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5961 Swiss francs, up from 1.5848, and
1.4388 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4469.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's
rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9379 German marks, up from 1.9236; 6.4995 French
francs, up from 6.4515; and 1,918.52 Italian lire, up from 1.904.37.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Denounces Cut in U.N. Dues  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
backed Sen. Jesse Helms' demand for structural U.N. overhaul Friday but said
slashing the U.S. contribution to the level now paid by Japan ``will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not the only ones who want to lower our assessment,'' Holbrooke told
a special hearing in New York of Helms' Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told the conservative committee chairman he shared many of his
frustrations with the United Nations, its bureaucracy and its peacekeeping
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Bosnia peacekeeping operation still troubled, and even larger
problems now facing U.N. peacekeepers in Kosovo, ``The U.N. will not get a third
chance if it blows it this time,'' Holbrooke said. ``We've got to get
peacekeeping right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said in some endeavors, including operations in Somalia and
Rwanda, the United Nations was ``an abysmal failure.'' But however flawed, he
said, the organization remains indispensable.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., convened the committee hearing in the Grand Hall of the New
York Bar Association's headquarters. The hall is a half-mile from U.N.
headquarters, where Helms lambasted the organization's practices and finances in
a Thursday lecture to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on Helms'
committee, told the council he agrees with many of Helms' criticisms.
</P>
<P>
	   Both in remarks at the hearing and earlier, meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Biden said fundamental change is inevitable in the
United Nations, including in its billing rates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know it. You know it. We all know it,'' Biden told Annan and other top
U.N. officials at the meeting in Annan's 38th-floor office.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has imposed conditions on payment of almost $1 billion in
delinquent U.S. dues that include a lower U.S. share of the United Nations'
operational budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Also lending his voice to calls for U.N. overhaul was Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who came to New York to
sit in on Helms' meetings. Warner told Annan the organization needs to improve
its ability to ``come in behind military operations'' and restore civilian
order, as in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he considers the United Nations' Kosovo operation ``on the brink of
failure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Annan's reaction to the criticism leveled by Helms and others, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said, ``He feels it's a positive step to open this
dialogue. He feels we've turned the corner in the relationship between the U.S.
and the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the ``conditions'' enacted by Congress are reduction in the U.S. share
of peacekeeping operations from the present 31 percent to 25 percent. The U.S.
share of the regular operating budget also would be lowered, in steps, from the
current 25 percent to 22 percent and then to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20 percent would put the U.S. share roughly at par with Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be tough'' to persuade other nations, particularly Japan, to go
along, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Japan, which now pays 19 percent, would likely spring its own
legislation modeled after the Helms-Biden measure demanding a reduced share if a
serious effort is made to lower the U.S. contribution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're watching you, Mr. Chairman. You're their hero,'' Holbrooke told a
clearly bemused Helms.
</P>
<P>
	   But Holbrooke promised to work hard for U.N. approval of a lower U.S. rate.
He said the U.N. assessment table has not been changed since 1973, and since
then ``some countries have gotten richer, some have gotten poorer.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said that, whatever the final rate, the United States, as the world's
biggest power, with its largest economy, should continue to pay the largest
share.

<HEADLINE> Heart condition complicates Bradley's woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley's latest revelation about his heart
condition is one more setback for an underdog campaign that can't afford to skip
a beat.
<P>
	   His medical condition - which is not life-threatening - flared up as polls
showed him far behind just before Iowa's caucuses and slipping in New Hampshire,
New York and Massachusetts. Those early voting states are central in Bradley's
strategy to upset Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's having a rough time, and it's a bad time to have a rough time," said
Democratic consultant Ray Strother of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   His hand forced by a reporter's question, the former New Jersey senator
confirmed days before Iowa's caucuses that an irregular heartbeat had recurred
four times since he first revealed the condition in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the condition would have no impact on his campaign and tried to
change the topic to his get-out-the vote effort. "You can't control what a heart
does, so the timing is irrelevant," said spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing was relevant to Iowa Democrats who were talking about Bradley's
health - not his health care plan - three days before the first contest of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he has a problem and it's something that won't go away, I think maybe in
the long run he ought to say, 'I've got other things to do. I don't need the
stress of being president,"' Joyce Brown, a 59-year-old Democrat, said between
sips of coffee at a Colfax diner.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue consumed Bradley's campaign Friday. Reporters shouted questions at
a jam-packed news conference and during a walking tour of heavily Republican
Muscatine.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a friendly audience of 50 backers yielded a question that went right to
the heart of the matter: What's this we hear about your health?
</P>
<P>
	   "Several million Americans have it," Bradley replied. "It's a common
condition. It's a nuisance for me and it shouldn't be a concern for you."
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted him to reassure me," said crowd member Bonnie Weeks. "I feel
reassured."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's advisers and non-allied Democrats said they expect most voters to
shrug off the news - but only after the campaign takes another hit. "I still
think it's a one-day story," Strother said. "But he's got other problems."
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Bradley's campaign has little chance of winning Monday's caucuses
and aides now fear a blowout. Polls have consistently shown him 20 points or
more behind.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, a tracking poll gave Gore a nine-point lead and the vice
president's own surveys showed him leading Bradley for the first time in weeks.
A Time/CNN poll showed Gore ahead by 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns still expect the Feb. 1 primary to be a tossup, but Bradley
doesn't want Gore to leave Iowa with momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   In the political community, activists who glowed about Bradley's insurgent
campaign weeks ago are now wondering whether his team can handle the pressure of
a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley himself has yet to prove he can retain his political base in New
Hampshire - a state that traditionally takes a second and third look at the
field in the frenzied final week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he may be suffering from overexposure," Strother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, including Bradley backers, trace his political troubles to a
string of attacks on Gore that seemed out of character for a candidate who
pledged not to play by the old rules of politics. A fumbled debate question
about agriculture also staggered his Iowa campaign for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   Though still professing confidence about New Hampshire, Bradley's campaign
is hedging its bets by looking ahead to a batch of March 7 primaries - several
of which are in Northeast states that could favor the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
	   "Iowa and New Hampshire are important," campaign chairman Doug Berman said.
"Given the changing calendar of 2000, however, we've always looked at them as
the first step to the national primary between March 7 through March 21."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, must weather the latest questions about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Democrats who shrugged off the condition said it might tip the scales
in a close race.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it starts to be debilitating, it would be an issue," said Mike Winnike
of West Point, Iowa. "But this is something he's lived with for a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   Former White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater recalled that his boss,
former President Bush, had a similar condition and "nobody really tried to make
an issue out of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush benefited by his reputation for being physically active. Bradley, a
Hall of Fame basketball player, may get the same benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Bradley has made a mistake here it might be that he wasn't a little more
forthcoming about what he had," Fitzwater said. "Our experience was when people
understand the illness they accept it because they understand modern medicine's
ability to deal with these things."

	   He said Japan, which now pays 19 percent, would likely spring its own
legislation modeled after the Helms-Biden measure demanding a reduced share if a
serious effort is made to lower the U.S. contribution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're watching you, Mr. Chairman. You're their hero,'' Holbrooke told a
clearly bemused Helms.
</P>
<P>
	   But Holbrooke promised to work hard for U.N. approval of a lower U.S. rate.
He said the U.N. assessment table has not been changed since 1973, and since
then ``some countries have gotten richer, some have gotten poorer.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said that, whatever the final rate, the United States, as the world's
biggest power, with its largest economy, should continue to pay the largest
share.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley soften criticism, play down heart concern  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Vice President Al Gore eased up on rival Bill
Bradley Friday. Gone was the fiery rhetoric about "shredding the social safety
net," replaced by a concession that Bradley's health plan is based on "a
respectable theory not to be dismissed out of hand."
<P>
	   "Although I do dismiss it," Gore added, apparently unable to pull every
punch as his aides had advised on a day of fresh questions about Bradley's heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore campaigned at full speed all around the snow-crusted
state. "There are three days left and we have a lot of work to do. We have some
unfinished business," Bradley told about 100 cheering backers in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, on a Perry farm, looked ahead to another daybreak-to-midnight schedule
and said he felt "like a guy working with every ounce of breath I have to get
one more vote than the other guy."
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to raise the stakes of Monday's Iowa caucus for Bradley, saying the
former New Jersey senator has "bet everything on this and New Hampshire."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, reporters asked Gore during a Des Moines hospital tour whether he
was worried about Bradley after Thursday's disclosure that his rival had had
four recent episodes of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   "My understanding is that it's nothing serious," Gore said as he knelt with
Mercy Medical Center asthma patient Shelby Claflin, 2, and her twin stuffed
bunnies. To WHO-TV, Gore said Bradley "is in great health. It shouldn't be an
issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Peppered with reporters' questions about his heart, Bradley said, "No I'm
not worried about it. This is a common condition, millions of Americans have
it."
</P>
<P>
	   He speculated the problem might be due to elevated caffeine consumption
after he switched soft drinks to cream soda. "I have curtailed all of my cream
soda," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he should have mentioned the heartbeat episodes earlier, he said
no.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not a factor in the campaign or in conduct in office," he said. "If
I'm sick at my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick at my stomach?"
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he was taking energy from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   "This room has a certain feel about it," Bradley said. "This campaign is
based on the radical premise that you can go out and tell people what you
believe and you can win. If you lead, you have to lay out something specific."
</P>
<P>
	   In Des Moines, Gore and Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is popular among Iowa
Democrats, jointly showcased the vice president's health care proposal in a
noontime forum with hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Health reform - with Bradley proposing universal access to health insurance,
and Gore pushing a more limited approach - has been at the red-hot center of
their rival campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore saved his fire Friday for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm proud that in the Democratic caucus contest, we are having an in-depth
and full debate about how to expand health care to every American," Gore said.
"In the Republican contest, they're debating how to blow the entire surplus on a
risky tax scheme that would benefit the wealthy."
</P>
<P>
	   As for Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid, the government health program for
the poor, Gore dropped all previous talk of Bradley vouchers and caps -
distortions that had gotten under his rival's skin for months - and called it a
"mainstreaming proposal" offering subsidies for the purchase of health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's soft-mitten touch was especially notable because just the night
before he tried at every stop to stir Iowa opposition against Bradley for
calling the state's precinct caucuses an exercise that favors Gore's "entrenched
power."
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is sensitive about not appearing to pile on Bradley or exploit
questions about his minor heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when both sides are trying to make sure their supporters turn out
at the caucuses, Gore hoped his appearance with Vilsack would be seen as a
quasi-endorsement from the officially neutral governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Vilsack did not tip his hand as he stood at Gore's side. "We appreciate the
fact that you and Senator Bradley have brought this issue of health care to the
forefront," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody knows who's going to show up in the Iowa caucuses Monday night,"
Bradley told 100 people at a breakfast rally in Burlington. "If you can call 10
people, we can do better than people expect."

<HEADLINE> Secret Nuke Documents Made Public  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 1,000 documents containing nuclear weapons secrets
were mistakenly declassified and made available to the public under an openness
campaign begun five years ago, the Energy Department told Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   While the documents were opened to researchers, only one of the files was
actually examined by any outsiders before the mistakes were discovered, the
department said in a report. That document involved nuclear weapons deployment
to foreign countries in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were among millions of pages of papers declassified between
1995 and 1998 under an executive order from President Clinton directing federal
agencies to lift the veil of secrecy from papers that contain historical
material and are more than 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   The declassification effort, which is expected to continue for a few more
years, involves papers on everything from 1950s and 1960s nuclear bomb test to
the war in Vietnam, UFO research and the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   A classified report sent recently by the Energy Department to Congress
details the findings of a DOE audit of some 948,000 pages of nuclear
weapons-related documents that had been part of the three-year declassification
effort.
</P>
<P>
	   During the review, auditors found that 14,890 pages containing secret
weapons information had been mistakenly declassified and made available for
public view at the National Archives, according to an unclassified summary of
the report sent to the armed services committees of both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The material covers ``about 1,000 documents,'' many of which originated in
the old Atomic Energy Commission but had been transferred to other agencies and
declassified there, said a DOE official, who spoke on condition of not being
identified further.
</P>
<P>
	   Although none was declassified by the Energy Department, the mistakes were
found in DOE audits of the declassification process required by a law passed by
Congress in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 14,890 pages was information on nuclear bomb tests in the
1950s and 1960s ``that provided insight ... in weapons design technology'' as
well as yields on specific weapon and their deployment and storage, according to
the unclassified summary.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter accompanying the report, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson cited
``the gravity of these inadvertent releases'' and said he was increasing the
number of auditors and expanding training programs for those conducting
declassification at the other agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   While the documents contained information that was in some cases 30 to 40
years old, the report said it still could be useful to someone seeking to build
a crude nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
	   Such information, because it is technically less sophisticated, ``can
provide useful design parameters to emerging (nuclear) proliferant nations and
to terrorist groups,'' said the DOE report.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were erroneously declassified for a variety of reasons, the
DOE official said. In some cases, reviewers were not adequately trained and did
not recognize the material and in other cases, documents dating back decades
were misfiled or incorrectly labeled, said the official.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Aftergood, who directs the Project on Government Secrecy at the
Federation of American Scientists, said that while the government should pursue
``a vigorous and successful declassification program, nobody wants to see
sensitive nuclear weapons information disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the fact that DOE is conducting audits that discovered the
declassification mistakes ``suggests the DOE is finding a balance which will
allow declassification to proceed without risking unintentional disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aftergood's organization obtained a copy of the unclassified portions of the
DOE report to Congress and made it available.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Forbes Outspending Others  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes have outspent the
front-runners on TV advertising in Iowa, but hundreds of commercials haven't
been enough to catch the leaders in the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Bradley also is outspending Vice President Al Gore. On the
Republican side, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has spent more than Sen. John McCain,
his closest challenger.
</P>
<P>
	   Precisely how much each candidate is spending is not entirely clear. In the
sometimes puzzling world of politics, each campaign has an interest in
suggesting that its opponents are spending more. That helps pump up expectations
for the other guy, making it more likely that he will fail to meet those higher
expectations -- on Monday in Iowa and on Feb. 1 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Forbes, a multimillionaire, has spent far more than anyone -- about
$3.2 million, according to aides from the Forbes and Bush campaigns, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. That's more than Bush has spent, though it's unclear
how much more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides say their campaign has spent about $1.6 million in Iowa; the
Forbes camp puts the figure at $2.3 million. Either way, it's more than a
million dollars less than Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve Forbes needs to do very well in Iowa. Otherwise, it raises serious
questions about his ability to rally voters behind his candidacy and his
message,'' said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' campaign manager Bill Dal Col says they have to spend more because
there are several other candidates competing for the conservative vote. No one
should expect a victory, he says.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Iowa, we're going to be a solid second,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls put Forbes in second place, but nearly 20 percentage points behind
Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes has spent enough money so that the average Iowa TV viewer has seen
more than 160 of his ads. The typical viewer has seen more than 100 Bush ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats have spent about the same amount in Iowa. The Bush and Gore
campaigns say Bradley will spend $1.9 million by Monday, though Bradley's aides
put it closer to $1.5 million -- just above Gore's $1.4 million. Gore has
maintained a solid lead of about 20 points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
	   But in New Hampshire, where the race is tight, Bradley is spending much more
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bush aides say Bradley is spending some $3 million there, though
Bradley's camp puts it at $2.5 million. In any case, it's more than the $1.8
million that Gore will have spent by next week.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush leads the spending. He will have spent at least
$2.7 million by primary day, officials said. McCain's total is just under $2
million, and Forbes has spent about $1.6 million, including a half million
dollars for commercials last summer, before most voters were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a budget. We strategically place it,'' Dal Col said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Attacks Unlimited Web Access  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK PRATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Libraries and schools that offer unlimited Internet
access to children should not receive federal money, Republican presidential
candidate John McCain told a town meeting at the Greenville Public Library
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The library ran afoul of the Arizona senator last month when he learned its
computers were often used by a group of adults, including a convicted sex
offender, to gain access to sexually explicit material in the presence of
children -- and that there were no restrictions on what sites children could
reach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That this scourge can exist in this beautiful, religiously grounded,
family-friendly town points out the enormity of the crisis,'' he said. ``If you
walk into any library and ask for a Hustler magazine the library will tell you
it's not available because it's inappropriate. Yet a child can log on to the
library computer and surf the Web for some of the most degrading and shocking
pornography available.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain disagreed with the American Library Association's assertion that
unlimited Internet access was free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested libraries use Web filtering devices to limit access to sexually
explicit material.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When a mother or father drops their child off at the library they are
entrusting the welfare of their child with the librarian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina Republican Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, as well as
state legislators accompanied McCain in the sweltering basement auditorium built
to accommodate 250 people but packed with an estimated 500. At least one person
passed out from the heat, but was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's visit coincided with a poll conducted by the Strom Thurmond
Institute at Clemson University that showed him well behind Texas Gov. George W.
Bush but making up ground in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Trey Walker, McCain's national field director, said, ``We have to do exactly
what we did in this room today. The more people who find out what John McCain's
about the better we'll do.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Want New Government  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The military asked President Jamil Mahuad to resign
Friday after Indian protesters, joined by mid-level officers, stormed an empty
Congress building. Mahuad refused to step down, saying anyone who wanted to
overthrow him would have to do it by force.
</P>
<P>
	   Military guards stepped aside when Indians and other leftist groups stormed
the building, seized the podium and vowed to name a new government called, ``The
Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito was in chaos -- with Indians armed with rocks and clubs
paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- the rest of the country and much
of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad said in a nationwide television
broadcast Friday. Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and
was being protected by several military officers. His whereabouts were unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours earlier, he spoke in a nationwide television broadcast from the
palace, characterizing the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities -- which
led the rebellion -- as a small minority among 12 million Ecuadoreans. Other
government leaders said the protesters were attempting to exploit discontent
caused by the Latin American nation's deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What future awaits the country, the next president? Will he be a hostage
of this kind of movement? The next time that he makes a decision, whatever it
is, that the Indian movement does not like, will it announce a march on Quito
and take control of the city?'' Mahuad said. ``That is not what Ecuador needs.
That is not the way out for the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, it was unclear who would
take power even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians have proposed a new government to be led by an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the call by the armed forces high command for Mahuad's
resignation -- it was not clear whether most military leaders would support the
triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to decide how to handle the Indian rebellion,
which was part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted
takeover mainly to keep peace, said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint military
commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group of leftist-led
unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations seized the
provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz called the occupation an ``irresponsible
act'' and accused the protesters of exploiting Ecuador's grim economic
situation. Last year inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America,
and the economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in three in the labor force has
full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Ex President Attacks Iran Reformists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A former president said Friday that reformists are
humiliating Iran in their attempts to win votes in next month's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In his prayer sermon at Tehran University, which was broadcast live on
state-run radio, Hashemi Rafsanjani said it was ``unjust'' to question such
things as Iran's performance during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and the principles
of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to win votes, you should choose other ways and not humiliate
your nation,'' said Rafsanjani, who leads a council that advises Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on major issues. ``Why do American and Israeli
radio stations repeatedly quote your comments?''
</P>
<P>
	   The Feb. 18 elections are shaping up as a showdown between candidates
backing reformist President Mohammad Khatami and calling for more openness, and
those who fear the Islamic roots of Iran's 1979 revolution are being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafsanjani, who is running, was once identified with reform but has been
leaning toward the hard-liners who enjoy a slight majority in the outgoing
legislature. He is widely believed to be aiming for the position of speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Many pro-reform newspapers and politicians still hold Rafsanjani responsible
for Iran's social and economic problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who say every dam Iran built had a hole in it are committing
treason,'' said Rafsanjani, adding that 60 dams were built during his 1989-98
presidency. ``To whom are you selling the honors of your country and at what
cost?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Killing people's confidence is more dangerous than AIDS,'' he said. ``Give
up controversy, abandon the practice of eliminating each other. Foreigners will
swallow you both, right and left, if you don't unite.''

<HEADLINE> Elian Citizenship Could Be Considered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida Republicans intend to introduce legislation Monday
to grant U.S. citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., could be brought up for a
vote by midweek, Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent,'' Lott said during an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' to
be aired Sunday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, companion legislation will be introduced by Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., among others. Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey of Texas said
House GOP leaders had made no decision on how swiftly to push for passage.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., indicated some Democrats will
support the bill. ``I doubt that we'll have a party position on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has been at the center of an international custody dispute since
November, when his mother died and he was found on Thanksgiving Day floating in
an inner tube off Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   His father in Cuba has demanded that he be sent back to Cuba, and his two
grandmothers flew to New York Friday to press the case at a news conference.
Relatives in Miami and others among that city's Cuban-Americans, many vehemently
opposed to Cuban President Fidel Castro, want the boy to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides were considering a request Friday
that she meet with the grandmothers, Justice spokesman Myron Marlin said. Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif., made the request on their behalf through Immigration
Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled that the boy should go
back to Cuba, but Reno has extended the INS deadline to allow his Miami
relatives to sue. The judge appointed to hear the lawsuit withdrew Friday, and
it was reassigned.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has not said whether he would sign citizenship
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauricio Tamargo, a spokesman for Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said
there also is a possibility that legislation would be introduced to establish
permanent residency for the boy. He said either measure would ``probably
accomplish the objective, which is to move the boy from INS control and have the
opportunity to have his case heard in judicial court.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Case Brought Vs. Alleged Pimp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A man accused of luring underage girls into a life of
prostitution is being tried in federal court by prosecutors who say a state
court might be too lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracey James Barnes, 30, of Seattle, faces 25 years in prison on the federal
charge of illegally transporting people across state lines for the purpose of
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Florida law, prostituting a person under the age of 18 is punishable
by up to 15 years in prison, and the maximum sentence is five years in jail if
the prostitute is an adult. Last year, a similar federal case in Florida sent a
pimp to prison for 15 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   This case is unusual, in part, because it is being prosecuted by the civil
rights division of the U.S. Attorney's Office -- a departure from their usual
caseload of discrimination, hate crime and other civil rights disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutor Jennifer Prior said state prosecution is ineffective
because many defendants often leave the state, and state sentences are lenient.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there weren't children involved in this case, it would never have been
brought in federal court,'' Ms. Prior said. ``This man is a trafficker in little
girls' bodies. He sells girls' flesh.''
</P>
<P>
	   One former prostitute, Jessica Kathleen Stump, 19, testified Thursday that
she began her life with Barnes when she was 16 and was often beaten.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was raped and robbed,'' Ms. Stump said. ``I left Florida with scars on
my body. I had pistols pulled on me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The defense claims the women acted on their own accord and for the money.
Defense attorneys also say the case does not merit the federal government's
attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The Marine commander of Camp Lejeune on Friday
ordered a court-martial for the captain who oversaw a hike last summer in which
a reservist died from heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Gen. Ronald Richard reversed a judge's recommendation from earlier this
month that had called the case against Capt. Victor Arana a leadership issue
rather than a criminal one.
</P>
<P>
	   Arana, 28, has been charged with negligent homicide, violating a lawful
order and dereliction of duty in connection with the July 7 death of Lance Cpl.
Giuseppe Leto. The charges carry a possible penalty of three and a half years in
prison. Arana also could be dismissed from the corps.
</P>
<P>
	   Arana was accused of marching his unit too fast with not enough time for
breaks during an eight-mile hike. Investigators said his handling of the unit
violated training guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Leto, 21, died of heat stroke. His body was found two hours after the hike
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Arana's defense attorney, Mark Stevens, has said that commanders did not
give Arana guidance. The company of 180 marines was on its 16th day of training,
and it was Arana's first command assignment.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Indians Want New Government  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The military asked President Jamil Mahuad to resign
Friday after Indian protesters, joined by mid-level officers, stormed an empty
Congress building. Mahuad refused to step down, saying anyone who wanted to
overthrow him would have to do it by force.
</P>
<P>
	   Military guards stepped aside when Indians and other leftist groups stormed
the building, seized the podium and vowed to name a new government called, ``The
Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito was in chaos -- with Indians armed with rocks and clubs
paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- the rest of the country and much
of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said in a nationwide
television broadcast Friday. Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close
aides and was being protected by several military officers. His whereabouts were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   A few hours earlier, he spoke in a nationwide television broadcast from the
palace, characterizing the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities -- which
led the rebellion -- as a small minority among 12 million Ecuadoreans. Other
government leaders said the protesters were attempting to exploit discontent
caused by the Latin American nation's deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What future awaits the country, the next president? Will he be a hostage
of this kind of movement? The next time that he makes a decision, whatever it
is, that the Indian movement does not like, will it announce a march on Quito
and take control of the city?'' Mahuad said. ``That is not what Ecuador needs.
That is not the way out for the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, it was unclear who would
take power even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians have proposed a new government to be led by an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the call by the armed forces high command for Mahuad's
resignation -- it was not clear whether most military leaders would support the
triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to decide how to handle the Indian rebellion,
which was part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted
takeover mainly to keep peace, said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint military
commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group of leftist-led
unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations seized the
provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz called the occupation an ``irresponsible
act'' and accused the protesters of exploiting Ecuador's grim economic
situation. Last year inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America,
and the economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in three in the labor force has
full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidians Remains Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel re-investigating the government's
conduct during the 1993 Branch Davidian siege asked a federal judge Friday to
grant him temporary custody of tissue and bone samples.
</P>
<P>
	   The human remains are needed ``to verify the toxicological work previously
performed and stated in the autopsy reports,'' Special Counsel John Danforth's
office said in a filing in federal court in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The samples are in the custody of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, which
earlier tested the remains for drugs, carbon monoxide, cyanide and benzene. No
traces of drugs were found in any of the bodies; while carbon monoxide,
generated by fire, and cyanide, a byproduct of the massive quantities of tear
gas pumped into the Davidians' compound, were found in some of the remains.
</P>
<P>
	   This isn't the first time the special counsel has sought independent
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth, a former Missouri senator appointed last September by Attorney
General Janet Reno to resolve unanswered questions about the final hours of the
51-day standoff, previously moved to gain custody of 12 bullet shell casings
found at the scene. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith granted Danforth's request
for independent testing of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Danforth also weighed in last November on the side of the Davidian
plaintiffs whose wrongful-death lawsuit against the government goes to trial in
mid-May, joining their request for a field test that could resolve the question
of whether federal agents fired shots into the Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs contend aerial infrared surveillance videos taken by the FBI
prove government agents fired into the retreat as it burned. The judge has
ordered a re-creation, with the same camera the FBI used, to determine whether
gunshots are captured on the infrared as bursts of light similar to those that
show up on the 1993 videos.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials have long maintained no shots were fired by federal agents
on April 19, 1993, when the compound was consumed by fire during the FBI's
tear-gas assault. Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished,
some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds the government insists were
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Davidians' lawyers wrapped up a second round of depositions in
Washington this week, interviewing FBI operatives who were in Waco. After a few
more depositions, Davidian lawyer Michael Caddell said he hopes to depose Reno
and the FBI commanders who supervised the operation in Washington and Waco.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, lawyers for the Davidians released the depositions of two U.S.
Army Delta Force technicians who were present on the final day. They testified
that they had no direct knowledge of any Delta Force participation in the final
assault or any gunfire from government positions. The third Delta Force
operative who was present has yet to be deposed, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has acknowledged some military personnel were in Waco during
the standoff, but said they were only observers. Federal law bars the military
from active participation in civilian law enforcement operations.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Leader Clings To Power  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- When President Jamil Mahuad took power, Ecuadoreans
were hopeful that he would bring a new style of governing to this small Andean
nation, submerged for years in economic stagnation and deeply rooted government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   He had the right credentials: a master's degree in public administration
from Harvard, six years as a successful mayor of Quito, the image of a youthful,
honest public servant with fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   But barely 17 months into office, Mahuad, 50, confronts demands from a
radical Indian movement and the armed forces to step down and relinquish power.
</P>
<P>
	   For months he has been under fire from political rivals on both the left and
right, as well as business and labor leaders who say he has displayed
irresponsible incompetence in handling Ecuador's worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression. They accuse him of vacillating and delaying for months in
making crucial decisions as Ecuador sank deeper into a social and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to resign,'' a weary-looking Mahuad said in an interview
Thursday evening at the national palace in Quito's colonial downtown. ``I am the
head of the government and what we need is to consolidate democratic stability.
Beginning in 1930, Ecuador had 16 governments in 10 years and that solved
absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he spoke, helmeted riot police and soldiers with automatic rifles guarded
barbed wire perimeters around the palace to hold back protesters who have been
demonstrating for the past two weeks, demanding his resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad blamed much of the criticism against him on Ecuador's ``cannibalistic
politics,'' saying that even in a time of crisis, the country's political
parties do not act in the best interests of the nation but instead seek to
exploit a government's weaknesses to expand their own political power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have seen those American football games where the players all pile on
the one carrying the ball so that he will drop it? That is Ecuador,'' Mahuad
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 9, in what he described as a bid to halt spiraling inflation and
stabilize the economy, Mahuad announced plans to make the U.S. dollar Ecuador's
official currency, making Ecuador the first country in South America to abandon
its own currency.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters called it a bold move, but skeptics characterized it as a
desperate measure whose consequences had not been thought out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was more a political measure than an economic measure,'' said political
scientist Simon Patina. ``He made the decision as the only way to save his
government.''

<HEADLINE> Letterman Beats Leno in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's a get-well gift for David Letterman: His first
weekly ratings victory against Jay Leno in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS "Late Show" host underwent emergency heart surgery on Jan. 14, two
days after his much-anticipated interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton. The show
with Mrs. Clinton earned Letterman his biggest audience since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The show will consider bringing in guest hosts during Letterman's absence,
said executive producer Rob Burnett. He already has been flooded with offers
from people including Howard Stern and Regis Philbin, to whom Letterman revealed
his heart problems on the air last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a million ideas," Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman hadn't beaten Leno, host of NBC's "Tonight Show," in the ratings
with first-run programming since the week of May 22, 1995. Letterman's average
audience last week was 5.9 million to Leno's 5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was driven almost entirely by Mrs. Clinton's appearance, which
drew 11.2 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's staff made a special point of noting that Mrs. Clinton's guest
shot drew higher ratings than Leno's first post-arrest interview with actor Hugh
Grant. The 1995 Grant interview cemented NBC's late-night dominance for the last
half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, CBS said it would run "Late Show" reruns during Letterman's
absence. That's what they've done this week, and next week the show airs the
best of its "on the road" broadcasts from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami,
London and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, Burnett said CBS is considering several options, including more
reruns, guest hosts and a mix of repeats with some live celebrity cameos.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said he has talked to Letterman frequently since his surgery, but
not about the show. It was unclear when Letterman will return to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we can't make these huge decisions without him, but it's still
too early to go to him with questions about it," Burnett said. "A lot will
depend on how long he's going to be out."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS can only hope Letterman returns to work sometime in February, a ratings
"sweeps" month. The network expects a big audience for his return.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people have floated the notion that our audience will erode while he's
away," Burnett said. "I couldn't disagree more."

<HEADLINE> Mrs Clinton Pushes Abortion Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to outdo Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani Friday in pushing for abortion rights, an issue that may have helped
tilt the 1998 Senate election.
</P>
<P>
	   Without mentioning the mayor's name, Mrs. Clinton suggested at a lunch
commemorating the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion
that she would be a more vehement abortion-rights advocate in the Senate than
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would want New Yorkers to know that I wouldn't only vote right, but I
would be a strong voice, and I would attempt to organize as much as I could to
make sure that I defended a woman's right to choose,'' Mrs. Clinton told
reporters after speaking at a National Abortion &AMP; Reproductive Rights Action
League luncheon.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, an abortion rights supporter who has spoken in the past at the
annual NARAL event, was invited this year, said NARAL director Kelli Conlin, but
he did not attend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mayor's position on choice is well known and it has not changed,''
said Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton may have trouble winning votes on the issue, since she and
Giuliani are both strong supporters of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1998's Senate race, abortion rights advocates were galvanized by the
murder shortly before the election of Dr. Bernard Slepian, a Buffalo doctor who
performed abortions. Charles Schumer, a Democratic supporter of abortion rights,
defeated anti-abortion Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in an extremely close election,
largely on the strength of his three-to-two advantage among female voters.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, with two candidates who support abortion rights, the issue may be
less prominent. Although Mrs. Clinton was received warmly by NARAL leaders, the
group did not endorse her.
</P>
<P>
	   Conlin said it was too early to say whether NARAL would make an endorsement
in the Senate race. If the group is satisfied with both candidates' support for
abortion rights, it may remain neutral, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been under pressure from Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long to support a ban on late-term abortions, but has so far refused to drop his
opposition to such a ban. No Republican has won a statewide race in New York in
25 years without Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have to give a lot of credit to the mayor, because he's stood up to
Michael Long and he's really defended the principles,'' Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said that with the U.S. Supreme Court preparing to hear
arguments on the late-term procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion,''
the Senate's role in safeguarding abortion rights will be increasingly
important. Saturday is the 27th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For women, the Senate will be our court of last resort,'' she said. ``It
will not be enough for any senator simply to cast the right vote and sit down.
Because this is going to be a struggle that will be particularly difficult if we
do not, for reasons that I hope will not come to pass, hold the White House.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, she took a jab at Giuliani, promising a conference of city
educators where she would offer public schools support, not blame.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm committed to working with you and to building up our schools, not
tearing them down or pointing fingers at those of you who make them work,'' Mrs.
Clinton told a meeting of the New York City Association for Supervision and
Curriculum Development. ``We cannot help our children if we're only interested
in placing blame.''
</P>
<P>
	   She never mentioned Giuliani's name but seemed to be referring to the
mayor's public criticism of former Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and his
opposition to the Board of Education's choice for Crew's temporary replacement.

<HEADLINE> Silent Screen Actress Dies At 95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -- Maxine Elliott Hicks, who appeared in more than
200 silent films, then left the industry for half a century before re-emerging
in the 1980s television sitcom ``Just the 10 of Us,'' died at age 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Hicks, billed in recent years as Maxine Elliott, most recently appeared
in the movies ``Defending Your Life'' and ``Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
	   She died Jan. 10, said her son, Walt Dodge.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver native began appearing in plays in New York when she was 5. At
the suggestion of filmmaker Preston Kendall, her family moved west to get the
talented youngster into films.
</P>
<P>
	   During the age of the silent film, Ms. Hicks won such choice roles as the
daughter of Ethel Barrymore in ``The Eternal Mother'' and the bratty Susie May
Squoggs, nemesis of America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford, in ``Poor Little Rich
Girl.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although she moved successfully into talkies, she left acting in the 1930s
following a dispute between her mother and Jack Warner of Warner Bros., Dodge
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Ease Up on Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore eased up on rival Bill
Bradley Friday. Gone was the fiery rhetoric about ``shredding the social safety
net,'' replaced by a concession that Bradley's health plan is based on ``a
respectable theory not to be dismissed out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I do dismiss it,'' Gore added, apparently unable to pull every
punch as his aides had advised on a day of fresh questions about Bradley's heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore campaigned at full speed all around the snow-crusted
state. ``There are three days left and we have a lot of work to do. We have some
unfinished business,'' Bradley told about 100 cheering backers in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, on a Perry farm, looked ahead to another daybreak-to-midnight schedule
and said he felt ``like a guy working with every ounce of breath I have to get
one more vote than the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to raise the stakes of Monday's Iowa caucus for Bradley, saying the
former New Jersey senator has ``bet everything on this and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, reporters asked Gore during a Des Moines hospital tour whether he
was worried about Bradley after Thursday's disclosure that his rival had had
four recent episodes of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is that it's nothing serious,'' Gore said as he knelt
with Mercy Medical Center asthma patient Shelby Claflin, 2, and her twin stuffed
bunnies. To WHO-TV, Gore said Bradley ``is in great health. It shouldn't be an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peppered with reporters' questions about his heart, Bradley said, ``No I'm
not worried about it. This is a common condition, millions of Americans have
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He speculated the problem might be due to elevated caffeine consumption
after he switched soft drinks to cream soda. ``I have curtailed all of my cream
soda,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he should have mentioned the heartbeat episodes earlier, he said
no.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a factor in the campaign or in conduct in office,'' he said.
``If I'm sick at my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick at my stomach?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he was taking energy from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This room has a certain feel about it,'' Bradley said. ``This campaign is
based on the radical premise that you can go out and tell people what you
believe and you can win. If you lead, you have to lay out something specific.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to maintain momentum, Gore released two new television ads and a
pair of radio spots Friday. The TV ads mention a panoply of issues -- Medicare,
Medicaid, education, the environment. One makes a backhand swipe at Bradley,
whose campaign has focused on a few important ideas. ``I wouldn't just pay
attention to one or two things,'' Gore says in his new ad.
</P>
<P>
	   The radio ads feature a pair of supporters. One has Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin
saying Gore was there for the state when it needed him. The other has Robert
Kennedy Jr. touting Gore's commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Des Moines, Gore and Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is popular among Iowa
Democrats, jointly showcased the vice president's health care proposal in a
noontime forum with hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Health reform -- with Bradley proposing universal access to health
insurance, and Gore pushing a more limited approach -- has been at the red-hot
center of their rival campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore saved his fire Friday for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm proud that in the Democratic caucus contest, we are having an in-depth
and full debate about how to expand health care to every American,'' Gore said.
``In the Republican contest, they're debating how to blow the entire surplus on
a risky tax scheme that would benefit the wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid, the government health program for
the poor, Gore dropped all previous talk of Bradley vouchers and caps --
distortions that had gotten under his rival's skin for months -- and called it a
``mainstreaming proposal'' offering subsidies for the purchase of health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's soft-mitten touch was especially notable because just the night
before he tried at every stop to stir Iowa opposition against Bradley for
calling the state's precinct caucuses an exercise that favors Gore's
``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is sensitive about not appearing to pile on Bradley or exploit
questions about his minor heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when both sides are trying to make sure their supporters turn out
at the caucuses, Gore hoped his appearance with Vilsack would be seen as a
quasi-endorsement from the officially neutral governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Vilsack did not tip his hand as he stood at Gore's side. ``We appreciate the
fact that you and Senator Bradley have brought this issue of health care to the
forefront,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody knows who's going to show up in the Iowa caucuses Monday night,''
Bradley told 100 people at a breakfast rally in Burlington. ``If you can call 10
people, we can do better than people expect.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- A car filled with young adults slammed into an
overpass early Friday killing all five people inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe the four men and one woman were on their way back from a
night across the border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, when the car crashed at about
1:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Lozano, 20, hit a concrete retaining wall and lost control of the car,
which crossed the median and crashed into the base of an overpass, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lozano, Ana Patricia Romero, 19, and Joshua Ramos, 19, died at the scene.
Jose Luis Aquino, 19, and Paul David Valdez, 18, were pronounced dead at
Thomason Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   All were from El Paso except Ramos, who was from neighboring Santa Teresa,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now we believe speed is a factor,'' El Paso police spokesman Sgt. Al
Velarde said. He said authorities had not determined how fast the car was going,
but the area speed limit is 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Velarde said police are awaiting autopsy results to determine if alcohol was
a factor.

<HEADLINE> Whitman unveils $100 million FamilyCare insurance for adults  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman in her upcoming budget will
put $100 million into a statewide effort to put a dent into the number of
residents who go through life without doctors and basic medical benefits.
<P>
	   More than a million adults in New Jersey have no insurance, most of them
working at jobs that either offer no benefits or charge too much to make them
affordable for lower income employees. As a result, these people are without
access to routine care and must rely on hospital treatment free-of-charge for
major illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's poor and welfare families qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman's program, dubbed "FamilyCare," will attempt to provide coverage to
125,000 of these adults who earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty
guideline, which for a couple without children is $22,160 a year. The guideline
is due to be updated next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Human Services Commissioner Michele Guhl said a key element to the program
will be to subsidize the working poor who have access to health insurance at
work so they can afford the copayments.
</P>
<P>
	   The state will also extend Medicaid coverage to poorer families.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of FamilyCare is forecast to reach about $200 million a year,
according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The state plans to pay $100 million using cash Whitman expects to get from
the national tobacco settlement, and this spending would in turn qualify for $48
million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Margaret Murray, medical assistance chief for the Department of Human
Services, said the remaining $52 million or more is expected to come from
employers who will be willing to absorb some of the costs of health premiums to
meet the state halfway in buying coverage for low-income employees.
</P>
<P>
	   In part, the FamilyCare recruitment effort will piggyback on existing state
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   KidCare provides free and low-cost insurance for some 53,000 children, and
about half of those families fall within the FamilyCare guidelines. Guhl said
the state can work quickly to enroll the adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "Providing FamilyCare will help both parents and kids. Research shows that
parents who have health insurance are more likely to get their kids
immunizations and regular checkups," Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Guhl said FamilyCare could provide insurance coverage to 23,000
childless adults who receive welfare under the General Assistance program.
</P>
<P>
	   Guhl said enrollment will begin next fall. The proposed budget for the
2000-2001 fiscal year begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
	   A large motivator behind FamilyCare is to help hospitals, which have faced
growing financial pressures and which must provide free "charity care" treatment
to people who have no insurance and cannot pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said the design of FamilyCare, with its use of federal funds, will
bring an extra $80 million to hospitals each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Whitman on Friday announced her upcoming budget proposal would
increase annual state aid to hospitals to $350 million, up from the current
level of $320 million.

<HEADLINE> P. Hollywood Emerges From Ch. 11  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE SCHNEIDER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday approved Planet Hollywood
International Inc.'s bankruptcy plan, three months after the company sought
protection from creditors during a reorganization.
</P>
<P>
	   Founder Robert Earl will keep his job as the company's CEO under an order
that was signed by U.S. District Chief Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. in Wilmington,
Del., where the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval will allow Planet Hollywood to operate with court protection
while it restructures and sheds debt that it cannot repay, without totally
liquidating the business.
</P>
<P>
	   "For us, it means that we can get back to business as usual," Earl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earl and several other major investors are injecting $30 million in new
capital into the company, which was started 8 1/2 years ago with actors
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger as
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Holders of $250 million in bonds will walk away with a combination of new
bonds and a minority equity stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood is planning several new initiatives to jump-start the
company. Most importantly, the company hopes its common stock can become traded
on the Nasdaq Stock Market within a month, Earl said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since it filed for bankruptcy in October, the company has been traded
over-the-counter in privately negotiated transactions. The company previously
had traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood next month plans to announce a new set of celebrity
investors, who hopefully will appeal to the youth market in their pitches to buy
Planet Hollywood clothing and memorabilia, said Earl, who wouldn't be more
specific
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood also has embarked on a national television campaign, a
first for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   The company projected in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing
that its financial losses could continue until 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood closed nine poorly performing restaurants throughout the
country just before entering bankruptcy. It later closed one in Holland.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will have 21 company-owned restaurants in the United States and
10 company-owned restaurants overseas.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Asked To Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The military asked President Jamil Mahuad to resign
Friday after Indian protesters, joined by midlevel officers, stormed an empty
Congress building. Mahuad refused to step down, saying anyone who wanted to
overthrow him would have to do it by force.
</P>
<P>
	   Military guards stepped aside when Indians and other leftist groups stormed
the building, seized the podium and announced that they had created their own
Congress, ``The Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito was in chaos -- with Indians armed with rocks and clubs
paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the country and much of
the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said in a nationwide
television broadcast Friday, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through force,''
he said directing his comments to the military high command, which only a few
minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broadcast, he characterized the Confederation of Indigenous
Nationalities -- which led the rebellion -- as a small minority among 12 million
Ecuadoreans. Other government leaders said the protesters were attempting to
exploit discontent caused by the Latin American nation's deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What future awaits the country, the next president? Will he be a hostage
of this kind of movement? The next time that he makes a decision, whatever it
is, that the Indian movement does not like, will it announce a march on Quito
and take control of the city?'' Mahuad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers. His destination was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, it was unclear who would
take power even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians appointed a new governing council, made up of an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the military's call for Mahuad's resignation -- it was
not clear whether most military leaders would support the triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, rioters took
to the downtown streets, burning two vehicles, beating a bystander and hurling
rocks at passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, a group of leftist-led unions, student
organizations and neighborhood associations seized the provincial government
building.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz accused the protesters of exploiting
Ecuador's grim economic situation. Last year inflation reached 60 percent, the
highest in Latin America, and the economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in
three in the labor force has full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Flowers Includes Hillary in Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT MACY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Gennifer Flowers, the woman who claimed to have a 12-year
affair with President Clinton, says in a lawsuit that first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton ran a ``war room'' to attack her husband's opponents in the 1992
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   Flowers on Thursday amended a libel and slander lawsuit she filed in U.S.
District Court last November to include Mrs. Clinton along with previously named
administration figures James Carville and George Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a publicity stunt and wholly without merit,'' Mrs. Clinton's
Washington, D.C., lawyer, David Kendall, said Friday. ``We'll move to dismiss it
at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Flowers is represented by Judicial Watch, a conservative legal watchdog
group based in Washington. Larry Klayman, the group's general counsel, said
Friday that Mrs. Clinton was added as a defendant ``because of additional
material that has surfaced.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Judicial Watch statement said Mrs. Clinton was the ``mastermind in a
scheme to destroy or, in Hillary Rodham Clinton's words, 'crucify' Gennifer
Flowers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The amended lawsuit contends the ``war room'' was organized by Mrs. Clinton,
with Carville and Stephanopoulos among those carrying out her orders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mrs. Clinton thus conceived of, ran and used the war room to smear,
defame, and harm perceived adversaries such as plaintiff, in order that her
husband, Bill Clinton, and she could attain the benefits and trappings of the
office of the President of the United States and first lady respectively,'' the
lawsuit contends.
</P>
<P>
	   When the original lawsuit was filed in November, Carville called it ``a pack
of whatever'' and Stephanopoulos declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news release at the time, Judicial Watch said Flowers -- who moved to
Las Vegas to further a singing career -- was responding ``after years of being
disparaged, vilified and defamed by the president and his men.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $75,000 and calls for a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton initially denied having an affair with Flowers, but he later
acknowledged the relationship during the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.

<HEADLINE> Witness: Camden Mayor Milton Milan leaked police information to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - As investigators closed in on the biggest cocaine
cartel in Camden's history, Mayor Milton Milan tipped off reputed drug lords
about raids, a federal witness testified Friday.
<P>
	   In the latest testimony in a drug conspiracy trial of two alleged kingpins,
a government informant again linked Milan to a multimillion dollar ring that
authorities say used violence and murder to control a lucrative drug trade.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony Friday by Juan Marquez, however, was the first time that
allegations have been made that Milan associated with the accused dealers after
being elected mayor in May 1997. Milan took office in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan, 37, a first term Democrat, has repeatedly denied any involvement with
the drug ring and has not been charged with any wrongdoing. His attorney denied
the latest allegations made in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations implicating Milan are surfacing at the trial of Jose "J.R."
Rivera, the accused financier of the drug organization, and Luis "Tun Tun"
Figueroa, the alleged enforcer.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials have said the organization was the most entrenched
and significant drug cartel in Camden's history until it was broken up in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Marquez, 36, once a prominent drug ring member, agreed to wear a wire after
his arrest and record conversations with Rivera and other alleged drug dealers
between 1996 and 1998. He has spent three days on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   In one conversation with Marquez on July 3, 1997, Rivera explained why
another alleged drug dealer, Saul Febo, fled the area. Federal authorities
toppled the organization seven months later.
</P>
<P>
	   "Man, he ran cause he had a connection inside, told him what's up, that's
why," Rivera said on the tape. "Told him that they were going to lock him up."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Smith who was the connection who gave
that information to Febo, Marquez said from the witness stand Friday: "Milton
Milan."
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's attorney, Carlos Martir, noted that Marquez identified Milan as the
"snitch" who provided the information to Febo only when questioned in court
Friday. Milan's name is not mentioned on tape in connection with that incident,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is a person wearing a wire is orchestrating conversations,"
said Martir, who also represents Figueroa. "He gives what the government wants
to hear. These conversations don't say what he has testified to."
</P>
<P>
	   In another conversation in June 1997, Marquez - referring to Milan - said,
"Milton, picked an area to hit." Marquez said the comment was a reference to a
pending raid on a drug set.
</P>
<P>
	   "We already know where he gonna hit at," Rivera replied.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the ring had connections in the police department that
allowed it to keep a step ahead of investigators. Police officers were known to
frequent Rivera's gym in Camden and escort him to the bank to make large
deposits.
</P>
<P>
	   In another recording made by Marquez on June 4, 1997, Camden Police Officer
Michael Hearns is heard giving advice to Rivera against cooperating with a
narcotics probe. Hearns said he had inside information from an investigator
identified only as "Cherry."
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Rivera was worried because another alleged dealer, Kenneth
Waller, had just been arrested. Police seized a boat from Waller's home that was
registered in Rivera's name.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't do nothing," Hearns told Rivera. "Don't approach them at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Hearns, reached at the police department Friday, declined comment. No law
enforcement officer has been charged in connection with the allegations made at
the trial, but prosecutors are investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   In another secretly recorded conversation also played in court Friday,
Marquez said Milan - prior to becoming mayor - begged Rivera to loan him $25,000
to land a city housing contract. At the time, Milan was a construction
contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   "In three months I made like, $15,000. That's good," Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith asked Marquez: "who did he make that $15,000 from?"
</P>
<P>
	   "Milton Milan. That's what he gave him," Marquez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two convicted drug dealers have testified at the trial that some of the drug
ring's cocaine was sold to Milan in 1993. Milan angrily denied those
allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera's attorney, Marc Neff, downplayed the recordings of his client,
including one conversation in which Rivera threatened to kill the sister and
mother of an admitted ring leader whom he suspected of informing on him.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody actually believes this stuff," Neff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa are the only two among 14 defendants in the case to
stand trial; the others have pleaded guilty. Both face life in prison if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony in the trial resumes Monday.

<HEADLINE> Digging for Mass Graves Ends  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN GUGGENHEIM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) -- The only signs that La Campana ranch was
recently a focus of world attention are discarded foam coffee cups, spent
batteries and a few bored soldiers standing guard outside.
</P>
<P>
	   The digging has stopped, and there is no more talk of finding the bodies of
100 Mexicans and Americans in mass graves just over the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
	   What remains are questions: Were the expectations of finding so many bodies
in mass graves overblown? And, if the 100 people missing in the Juarez area
aren't in the mass graves, where are they?
</P>
<P>
	   The end of the digging was casually announced Thursday by Mexican Attorney
General Jorge Madrazo during a news conference. The two-month, joint Mexican-FBI
investigation had turned up nine bodies and a drug laboratory at three sites.
</P>
<P>
	   It was an anticlimactic ending to a sensational story that grabbed headlines
worldwide, with talk of a killing field right across the border from El Paso,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the titillation factor of wanting to see the border as a grade-B
movie about the drug trade,'' said John Amastae, director of the Center for
Inter-American and Border Studies at the University of Texas-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
	   The news broke Nov. 29, with U.S. law enforcement officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, telling reporters that an informant had said as many as
100 bodies might be buried in Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the head of the Mexican attorney general's organized crime unit, Jose
Larrieta Carrasco, told The Associated Press on Thursday that no informant had
ever used that figure to either Mexican or U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Madrazo had acknowledged that 100 people were missing in the Juarez area,
but repeatedly said he did not know how many might be buried in the graves. The
FBI also did not give a figure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The FBI never speculated,'' spokesman Jim Davis said. ``The notion that
the FBI was shooting its mouth off just isn't accurate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. and Mexican officials did little at first to counter speculation
that so many bodies might be found. Madrazo, for example, said in a television
interview on Nov. 30 that ``there is a list of 22 U.S. citizens that could be
... in those sites that we are now searching.''
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't until two days later that Madrazo expressed concern in an
interview about the ``enormous speculation'' and ``frankly extravagant
numbers,'' which he described as ``very far from reality.''
</P>
<P>
	   The scope of the investigation also indicated that authorities were looking
for something big. Hundreds of Mexican police worked with dozens of FBI agents
in a rare joint operation. FBI director Louis Freeh visited one of the sites and
held a joint news conference with Madrazo. And President Clinton spoke of the
mass graves as a ``horrible example of drug violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The comments made by both U.S. and Mexican authorities were totally
removed from reality,'' Ciudad Juarez Mayor Gustavo Elizondo.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the same investigation could have been conducted by far fewer people
with a much lower profile. Publicity from the digging has hurt tourism and
investment in Ciudad Juarez, he said. The city has suffered years of bad press
because of a series of killings of young women and because the Juarez drug
organization was based there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that both authorities -- Mexican and U.S. -- ought to be more
careful in their declarations to avoid the psychosis they caused in the city and
the alarm throughout the world,'' Elizondo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both U.S. and Mexican officials say they're not disappointed with the
results of the investigation. Mexican authorities say seven bodies have been
identified and appear to be victims of the Juarez-based drug organization of the
Carrillo Fuentes family. Five suspects have been detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the many disappearances in the Juarez area remain unresolved. Official
figures put the number of people missing at 100; some private groups say it is
more than 200.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have to be somewhere,'' said Guadalupe Ramirez of the Independent
Chihuahua State Committee for the Defense of Human Rights. ``They couldn't have
just disappeared.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Asked To Resign  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The military asked President Jamil Mahuad to resign
Friday after Indian protesters, joined by midlevel officers, stormed an empty
Congress building. Mahuad refused to step down, saying anyone who wanted to
overthrow him would have to do it by force.
</P>
<P>
	   Military guards stepped aside when hundreds of Indians stormed the building,
seized the podium and announced that they had created their own Congress, ``The
Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito was in chaos -- with Indians armed with rocks and clubs
paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the country and much of
the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said in a nationwide
television broadcast Friday, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broadcast, he characterized the Confederation of Indigenous
Nationalities -- which led the rebellion -- as a small minority among 12 million
Ecuadoreans. Other government leaders said the protesters were attempting to
exploit discontent caused by the Latin American nation's deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What future awaits the country, the next president? Will he be a hostage
of this kind of movement? The next time that he makes a decision, whatever it
is, that the Indian movement does not like, will it announce a march on Quito
and take control of the city?'' Mahuad said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers. His destination was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's 4 million Indians, it was unclear who would
take power even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians appointed a new governing council, made up of an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the military's call for Mahuad's resignation -- it was
not clear whether most military leaders would support the triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, rioters took
to the downtown streets, burning two vehicles, beating a bystander and hurling
rocks at passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, a group of leftist-led unions, student
organizations and neighborhood associations seized the provincial government
building.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz accused the protesters of exploiting
Ecuador's grim economic situation. Last year inflation reached 60 percent, the
highest in Latin America, and the economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in
three in the labor force has full-time work.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By DIEGO IBARGUEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to New York from Cuba on
Friday to appeal for his return, saying the boy's late mother will not ``rest in
peace'' until the 6-year-old boy is back in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Respect the memory of my daughter,'' said the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   She and the boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, flew with a church
delegation that has supported Elian's return over the objections of the boy's
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Those relatives have invited the grandmothers to visit. But at least for
now, the women have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants staged massive
protests after the Immigration and Naturalization Service said he must go back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the women took their message to the nation's media capital. It was
not immediately clear how long they were staying in the United States; people
who organized the trip said it will only be a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and her aides were considering a request that
she meet with the grandmothers, Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat on which he was heading for the United States capsized,
killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who say he would have a better
life in the United States. Attorneys for the family in Florida have asked a
federal judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that many say that it was Elian's mother's will that the child
remain here,'' Ms. Rodriguez said in Spanish. ``I speak for her because I was
her mother, I know what she thought and how she acted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mother's boyfriend arranged the journey, and Ms. Rodriguez said Elian's
mother went along only because she was forced to by ``the man she was with,''
who she said was violent and threatened her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask and beg those who are interested in helping us, to do everything
possible so that the child will be handed over to us, his grandmothers, so that
my daughter may rest in peace,'' Ms. Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of Customs officials and police,
winced as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree cold for their short walk
into a terminal at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen. He was born in Cuba.
He is a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
The boy's Miami relatives claim the boy has said he wants to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand by our position,'' Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said in
Miami after the grandmothers arrived in New York. ``Now that they are here in
the United States I invite them to come to my house so they can see the child.
To see that we are not hiding him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never talk bad about the family in Cuba to the child. Not about the
grandparents and not about the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives' lead attorney, Spencer Eig, added that the women's
information about the case came almost entirely from Cuba's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree,''
Eig said. ``If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it might relieve
all their anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
	   A senator from Florida is sponsoring legislation that would allow Elian to
have U.S. citizenship. The bill by GOP Sen. Connie Mack will be filed Monday and
could come up for a vote as soon as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent,'' Lott said during an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One'' to
be aired Sunday on PBS. ``It would not allow the administration to blow back and
forth depending on what Castro says, but it would allow the courts to determine
custody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the federal judge who was to hear the lawsuit by the boy's
Miami relatives withdrew from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge James Lawrence King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King,
once hired Armando Gutierrez -- a man now working as spokesman for the boy's
relatives in Miami -- to help in his re-election bid. The federal judge also has
a daughter who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

<HEADLINE> Whitman seeks to boost hospital aid by $30 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Whitman administration on Friday said the
governor will seek an extra $30 million in state aid to hospitals in her
forthcoming budget with a special focus on helping suburban and small-city
institutions that get little cash now.
<P>
	   Combined with the new FamilyCare health insurance program Gov. Christie
Whitman unveiled Friday, the new aid could increase hospital funding by $110
million a year in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals currently get $320 million a year as reimbursement for the free
charity care treatment they provide to people who have no insurance and who
cannot pay the bills. New Jersey has no public hospitals, so under state law
every hospital must accept any patient for treatment regardless of ability to
pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly half the state aid comes from federal Medicaid and similar programs.
</P>
<P>
	   A Health Department panel in November found that financial burdens like
charity care treatment were a growing threat to New Jersey's 82 hospitals. It
recommended increased state funding, especially to hospitals that so far have
not qualified for any charity care payments because of their limited number of
such cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The charity care announcement Friday came as part of a news release about
the FamilyCare program Whitman discussed during a visit to Morris County. More
details on the budget plan for the 2000-2001 fiscal year will be made public
Saturday during news briefings and Monday in Whitman's annual budget address.
</P>
<P>
	   The $30 million increase in charity care will draw $15 million in state
funds and be matched by $15 million in federal money. It will be permanent,
bringing annual charity care aid to $350 million, according to a senior staff
member in the Whitman administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital advisory commission, which researched the issue most of last
year under Health Department auspices, concluded an increase of $45 million was
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the administration staff member said $30 million should be adequate when
combined with other improvements in hospital funding like the FamilyCare
program, which will reduce the number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of hospitals that provide charity care treatment now get minimal
reimbursements or nothing at all because the $320 million is focused on urban
medical centers that provide the bulk of the free care.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Morristown Memorial, Overlook Hospital in Summit, Mountainside
Hospital in Montclair and Passaic General Hospital provide a total of $40
million in free treatment a year but receive only $150,000 in state
reimbursement, according to Peter Lillo, lobbyist for the New Jersey Hospital
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The four hospitals are joined in the same health care system.
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said the added $30 million would make sure that
hospitals with a certain minimum level of charity care would be reimbursed for
50 percent of that cost.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Victim Sought Restraining Order  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Sandra Berfield was so afraid of someone who had been
stalking her that she slept with a knife and installed a surveillance camera in
her apartment, according to newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield may have let her guard down when she opened a package left on
her doorstep Thursday in the Boston suburb of Everett. The bomb inside exploded,
killing her.
</P>
<P>
	   Police searched the home of her alleged stalker, Steven Caruso, 44, but
authorities refused to name him -- or anyone else -- as a suspect Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield, 32, first sought a restraining order against Caruso in October
1998. In court documents, she wrote that she believed he had slashed her car's
tires and poured antifreeze in the gas tank. And she accused him of stalking her
at home and the restaurant where she worked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was told that I wouldn't wait on him anymore ... because he was scaring
me and making me uncomfortable,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso denied the allegations, saying they arose from ``hysteria.'' But he
was ordered to stay away from her home as well as where she worked, Bickford's
restaurant in Medford and Josie's Bar in Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso was charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to
Ms. Berfield's car. Before his trial, his bail was revoked after Ms. Berfield
said he was lurking outside the restaurant. He was convicted last May and
sentenced to six months in jail, plus a year's probation, but was released in
July.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield's friends said she was always looking over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You could see it,'' said Daniel Menendez, the general manager at
Bickford's. ``You could see it in her eyes, the way she speaks, the way she
acts, the way she walks.''
</P>
<P>
	   She would go to the restaurant's windows to see if her alleged stalker was
there, Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe reported that Ms. Berfield had installed a video camera in
her apartment in an attempt to catch Caruso in front of her building after her
car had been vandalized. The Boston Herald reported that she slept with a knife.
Prosecutors wouldn't comment on either report.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso wasn't at his home in the suburb of Medford on Friday, and his
whereabouts were unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and co-workers described Ms. Berfield as giving and kind.
</P>
<P>
	   At Bickford's, where she waited tables for 12 years, she befriended a
homeless man and would buy him meals out of her tips on a regular basis,
Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She would do things that people wouldn't even think of doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield lived alone. She had a 12-year-old daughter who died about
three years ago from spina bifida. She often participated in fund-raisers for
the disease, including a local walk-a-thon.

<HEADLINE> Man Writes Anti-Handicapped E-mail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- A California State University employee is in trouble
with the university for posting a computer message urging opponents of
handicapped parking to do ``something nasty'' to people who use wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anybody wants to start up an anti-handicapped parking coalition let me
know,'' Jody Dunkel wrote in a message posted on a university bulletin board
Jan. 6. ``You vow to yourself that the next cripple in a wheelchair you see
you're going to do something nasty and annoying to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dunkel, 22, said Friday that the message wasn't meant to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wrote it to be controversial and stir things up,'' he said. ``It was
extreme humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said a disabled person who was offended by the message sent it to
university officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunkel has worked as a Web page designer at the school's Monterey Bay campus
since he graduated last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   University President Peter Smith would not say how Dunkel was being
disciplined, citing employee confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunkel also wouldn't say what his punishment was, but he said he still works
at the university.
</P>
<P>
	   The message frightened some of the university's 100 disabled students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be a joke, but subtle things like that hurt just as much as overt
statements,'' said Greg Lukas, 52, who uses a wheelchair.

<HEADLINE> Snow Blocking East European Roads  </HEADLINE>
   By MIHAELA ARMASELU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- An avalanche blocked the entrances to a uranium
mine Friday in western Romania, trapping 120 people below ground after heavy
snows blanketed Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow piles up to 20 feet high covered the entrances of the Baita-Plai mine,
and machines needed to clear the entrances also were buried, said Lt. Col. Petru
Catana of the Civilian Protection Corps in the city of Oradea.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the mine were able to communicate with the trapped workers by
telephone. The miners said they had enough water and heat, but had run out of
food, Catana said. Several specialists were dispatched from Oradea to help free
the miners.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, drifting snow collapsed more than 100 homes in northern Romania
on Friday and forced police to close checkpoints on the borders with Hungary and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Petru Tiplea, spokesman for Romania's border police, said that near the
borders, ``the snow blanket reached 2.5 meters (more than eight feet) and we
lost contact with our people.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the borders were declared closed after many border officers could
not reach their checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mediafax news agency reported that more than 100 Gypsy families were
moved onto a stationary train after their homes in Targu Lapus collapsed. A
dozen houses also collapsed under the weight of snow around the village of
Coroieni, 270 miles northwest of Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowstorms also blocked traffic on several roads, mainly in central and
northern Romania, isolating dozens of villages in the counties of Bihor, Satu
Mare, Cluj, Salaj and Mures, Romania's traffic police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The snowstorm also cut water and electricity to 50,000 people in Miercurea
Ciuc city, 140 miles north of Bucharest, civil defense authorities said. More
than 500 villages across the country were without electricity, the national
electric company, Conel, reported.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Czech Republic, a state of emergency was declared in one of the
country's eastern districts after it was paralyzed by snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've called the army to help us cope with the calamity,'' said Frantisek
Jonas from the district council in Trebic, 125 miles southeast of Prague. He
said traffic was blocked due to snow and several cars were stuck on the roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic on the main D-1 highway, linking the country with Slovakia and
Austria, was ``hopelessly blocked with hundreds of cars in each direction,
waiting for snowplows to make the road passable,'' a highway police spokesman
said. In several sections of the highway, traffic jams stretched for six miles.
</P>
<P>
	   The engine of a local passenger train derailed in the south of the country
on a railway line covered with snow, blocking rail traffic for the entire day,
Czech rail authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   A state of emergency also was declared in several regions of northeastern
Slovakia after falling snow stalled traffic, media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   An avalanche blocked a railway line connecting the northern towns of
Kralovany and Trstena, interrupting train service for the day, and avalanche
warnings were issued for mountainous regions of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miskolc, 100 miles east of Budapest, heavy snowfall accompanied by
lightning, thunder and 60-mph winds walloped the city, the state news agency MTI
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds of up to 95 mph were clocked overnight in Austria. Heavy snowfall
hindered traffic in the central part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Rail Fire Causes Evacuation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A train car filled with propane caught fire in a rail
yard early Friday, spewing flames and threatening to ignite other cars nearby.
The danger forced officials to close schools and order hundreds of people from
their homes for fear of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't known what sparked the fire. The train was passing through the CSX
yard when a railroad employee spotted flames about 3:45 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses described the flames shooting from a valve on the tanker much like
a massive gas stove.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 600 people were displaced, and Flint Fire Battalion Chief Paul
Plunkey said residents likely wouldn't be allowed back to their homes until
Saturday afternoon or later. A section of Interstate 475 also was closed.
</P>
<P>
	   CSX has agreed to pay for the inconvenience to area residents, said CSX
spokeswoman Kathy Burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials initially feared the fire could set off as much as a
half-million gallons of propane in nearby train cars. Crews managed to uncouple
the other cars midmorning and pull them away from the burning tank. The tank
contained about 33,000 gallons of propane.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Burns said fire officials would start a controlled burn early Saturday
to extinguish the fire. Explosives would be used to blow a hole in the top of
the car to release pressure and then in the bottom of the car to release gas
into the pit that would be dug under the car. The gas then would be ignited to
burn it off, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an environmentally friendly way to resolve this,'' Ms. Burns said.
``It's one of the quicker ways to resolve this.''

<HEADLINE> Increase in Bradley's heartbeat problems doesn't mean he's sicker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Doctors say Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley's repeated episodes of irregular heartbeat do not imply his condition is
worsening - atrial fibrillation tends to come in unexpected bursts.
<P>
	   Stress - a constant in political campaigns - fatigue, lots of caffeine, even
over-the-counter decongestants, a little alcohol or breathing other people's
cigarette smoke can trigger the irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   But repeated episodes can signal a patient may not be on the best
medication, or the best dose, to control the condition, said Dr. David A.
Meyerson, a Johns Hopkins University cardiologist and a spokesman for the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley takes Procanbid, a fairly old medication that helps some people, but
"there are perhaps more effective and simpler medications to take that might be
of extreme value to him," Meyerson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley disclosed on Dec. 10 that he has had atrial fibrillation since 1996,
saying that day was his seventh episode. But Bradley said Thursday he has since
experienced four more episodes of the irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, he said he had skipped a dose of his medication. But Bradley has
not missed any doses since then, spokeswoman Anita Dunn said Friday, adding that
there have been no recent changes in his treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent increase "doesn't mean he's any sicker," said Dr. Cynthia
Tracy, arrhythmia chief at Georgetown University Medical Center. "People can
have them out of the blue."
</P>
<P>
	   "It does not in any way imply his heart disease is worsening," agreed
Meyerson, pointing to a list of possible reasons, from the need for a different
medication to lots of caffeine or stress. "One would say that campaigning is a
stress test in and of itself."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyerson cautioned that he has never examined Bradley, but said reports
suggest he probably has a mild form of atrial fibrillation, the heart rhythm
disorder that affects some 2 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Some never experience symptoms - a doctor just spots the condition during an
exam. But if the irregular heartbeat gets too fast, patients feel an
uncomfortable flutter in their chests.
</P>
<P>
	   Often the heart kicks itself back into a regular rhythm in a few minutes, as
Bradley's latest episodes did. But if the irregular heartbeat continues for
long, doctors must electrically jolt the heart back into rhythm, something
Bradley has said he has undergone three times since 1996. In the worst cases,
patients need a pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Untreated, atrial fibrillation does increase patients' risk of a stroke.
Consequently, most are put on blood-thinning medication such as aspirin or
Coumadin.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients with severe cases feel weak, faint or breathless, as their heart
struggles to pump blood properly.
</P>
<P>
	   But with appropriate medication, "the vast majority of people with atrial
fibrillation can be totally productive and not have to substantially change
either their lifestyle or their responsibilities," Meyerson said. "I have, as a
cardiologist, no reason to believe this would impair his (Bradley's) ability to
govern."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign issued a statement Friday from one of his cardiologists,
Robert Heissenbuttel, who said the episodes of irregular heartbeats "have not in
any way interfered with his busy schedule."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley "has been advised to continue all normal activity without
limitations," the doctor said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Ordered Away From Clinics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven abortion protesters, including the director of
Operation Rescue National, were ordered Friday by a federal court not to
obstruct access to reproductive health care clinics in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler came in response to
lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department in June 1998. The judge issued a
permanent injunction against the seven defendants, prohibiting them from coming
within 20 feet of all reproductive health facilities within the Capitol Beltway,
a highway encircling the nation's capital that includes some suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleged that the seven defendants, including Operation Rescue
National Director Philip Benham and Christian Defense Coalition Director Patrick
Mahoney, violated the Freedom of Clinic Entrances Act when they obstructed the
entrances of an abortion clinic in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An injunction is necessary in this case to ensure that (the act) is not
further violated by these defendants, to protect women's right to safely and
freely obtain reproductive health services, and to preserve the public order,''
Kessler said in her ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling came as activists on both sides of the issue planned
demonstrations for Monday, the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe v.
Wade, which made abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney said the ruling ``is nothing more than harassment and intimidation
on the part of the Justice Department to chill and restrict peaceful activities
on the part of pro-life activists.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said abortion protesters ``will not be bullied'' by the Clinton
administration, that the ruling will be appealed and that abortion protesters
would ``show our outrage at the injustice and tyranny of this injunction'' by
tearing the injunction in half at a demonstration Saturday morning.

<HEADLINE> Rio Oil Spill Hits Nature Preserve  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER MUELLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Biologist Mario Moscatelli sat on the bank of
the Surui River and cried. Black scum from a massive oil spill covered the
rocks, sand and mangrove roots of an ecological preserve deep in Rio de
Janeiro's Guanabara Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Surui River is practically dead,'' said Moscatelli, who works for the
Rio de Janeiro state Environmental Affairs Department. ``If this isn't an
environmental crime, I tear up my biologist's certificate,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Three days after a pipeline at the Reduc refinery belonging to federal
petroleum giant Petrobras spilled more than 300,000 gallons of crude oil into
the bay, the ecological disaster continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   By Friday, the oil slick spread through the Guapimirim mangrove swamp, a
protected area and an important spawning ground for fish, birds and crustaceans.
The swamp is home to endangered species such as the yellow-throated alligator
and the blue egret. Dead sea birds coated in oil floated in the tide. Many of
them were diving cormorants, but the carcasses also included a rare marabu
egret.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscatelli said it would take decades for nature to undo the damage.
Environmentalists call it the worst ecological disaster to hit Rio de Janeiro
state in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The company could face a fine of up to $2,750 per animal killed, according
to the Environment Ministry. State environmental officials said the leak was
caused by an old and poorly maintained pipeline. They are still investigating
the exact cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds and tides carried the oil toward the mouth of the bay and the open
sea. The beaches of Paqueta Island, a popular tourist resort, were covered with
black muck.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the drift seaward, the state environmental office said it was
unlikely the oil would reach ocean beaches such as Copacabana or Ipanema.
</P>
<P>
	   As the spill widened over 16 square miles, hundreds of workers with rakes
and pitchforks took to the beaches of Mage, hit directly by the spill, and other
affected areas. They mopped up the oil with hay and dumped it into steel drums,
while biologists washed off oil-blackened birds and crabs.
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras published an ad in major newspapers Friday admitting its
responsibility for the disaster. The company also estimated Friday that 338,000
gallons of oil had spilled -- not 130,000 gallons, as it had been saying since
the disaster occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Petrobras has no excuse,'' the newspaper ad read over a picture of an
agonizing, oil-covered egret. ``It has an obligation to recover the confidence
of Brazilian society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, many think that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Environment Minister Jose Sarney Filho, who flew over the bay with Petrobras
President Henri Philipe Reichstul on Friday, said the company could be fined up
to $27.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be rigorous,'' Sarney Filho said. ``As a state company,
(Petrobras) should set an example. They will be punished in exemplary fashion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The minister said he would require all oil refineries to present plans for
preventing environmental damage. Rio state authorities said the Reduc refinery
had presented a similar leak in 1997 and was operating without a required
license.
</P>
<P>
	   The Inter-American Development Bank reportedly offered to provide funds and
a U.S. specialist in environmental disasters to help in the cleanup.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Challenge Tabloid Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of newspapers filed a federal lawsuit Friday
seeking to block publication of a new daily tabloid that is to be available for
free at Philadelphia-area transit stops, where other daily papers can't be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers that challenged the new tabloid include the Philadelphia
Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer, which contend that the transit stop
paper would have an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert Kelly refused to grant a request for a temporary
restraining order against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, meaning the tabloid Metro could be published and distributed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Metro, however, agreed temporarily not to distribute any newspapers in areas
where SEPTA regulation prohibit other papers from being sold. Kelly scheduled a
hearing for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   SEPTA, the nation's fifth-largest transit agency, is sponsoring the new
paper as part of a contract with Transit Publications Inc., which will print
Metro.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a five-year contact, Metro is to be distributed at more than 800
locations in the five-county area serviced by SEPTA. The contract guarantees
SEPTA an initial $30,000-a-month share of advertising revenues, projecting that
its share may approach $300,000 a month in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract also states that commuters will receive "an objective and
nonpartisan newspaper" and that "each issue should provide SEPTA with
significant editorial coverage and must conform to SEPTA's editorial standards
for content."
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll pick the contents of our page; they'll pick the contents of the rest
of the paper," SEPTA spokesman Jim Whitaker said. "We will have no control over
anything else that is published in the paper."
</P>
<P>
	   The publication is Metro's first attempt to take its successful European
concept to the United States. Launched six years ago in Stockholm, Sweden, the
company now publishes free daily transit system newspapers in 13 European
cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The color-splashed newspapers are filled with graphics and photos and offer
dozens of brief stories designed to be read in a 25-minute commute. The papers
offer no editorials and contain mostly stories from other news organizations,
including The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., Gannett Satellite Information Network Inc.,
and The New York Times Co. are challenging the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "The issue really is an issue of preferential treatment," said Pamela
Browner, vice president of public affairs for Philadelphia Newspapers,
publishers of the Inquirer and the Daily News. "SEPTA has approximately 500,000
riders every day and essentially what Metro gets is a captive audience."
</P>
<P>
	   "As a government agency, they are prevented by the First Amendment of the
Constitution from entering into the newspaper business," Ms. Browner added.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Roberts, managing director and publisher of Metro, said the move was
from an "establishment trying to defend its territory against innovation and
change."
</P>
<P>
	   "We find it ironic that three such respected news organizations, whose very
existence flows from the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment, are trying to
use those protections to prevent another newspaper from reaching its audience,"
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   SEPTA attorneys also noted that the two Philadelphia newspapers chose not to
bid on the contract that Metro was awarded.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Court Rejects Holocaust Suit  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARE NULLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's supreme court on Friday rejected
an Auschwitz survivor's claim that the government should be held responsible for
handing him over to the Nazis, but awarded him $63,000 in damages anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Spring, then 16, was arrested as he tried to enter neutral
Switzerland from Nazi-occupied France in 1943. Spring was turned over to German
guards, an action his lawyers said amounted to complicity with genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Tribunal ruled Friday that Swiss authorities did nothing illegal
in the case. Still, by a 3-2 majority the judges said Spring, now 73, should be
awarded the amount of money he had requested on ethical grounds and to cover his
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Spring, who sat impassively with his hands folded in his lap for most of the
seven hours of deliberations, said he was disappointed by the judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted to win and I didn't win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the money will be spent in any case,'' he added with a laugh. ``I'm
not bitter and life goes on.'' He planned to return to his home in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Paul Rechsteiner, said the court had awarded the money as a
``sign of a bad conscience.'' Swiss Finance Ministry spokesman Daniel Eckmann
said the ruling was an ``equitable and just solution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Surrounded by Germany, Nazi-occupied France and Nazi-allied Italy, neutral
Switzerland took in nearly 30,000 Jews during World War II. But it expelled an
equal number.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemotional legalistic debate in the majestic oak-paneled courtroom
contrasted sharply with the heart-wrenching personal tragedy recounted by the
bespectacled, gray-haired Spring.
</P>
<P>
	   On Nov. 13, 1943, he and his two cousins, 14-year-old Sylver and 21-year-old
Henri Henenberg, tried to make a midnight crossing into the safety of
Switzerland over a mountain border crossing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because Henri was seriously ill with tuberculosis and Sylver and I were
still minors, we thought that the border guards might make an exception and let
us in,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were sent back to France. Two days later they tried again. That
time they were arrested and handed over to German guards, along with identity
papers proving they were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
	   After three weeks in prison, the young men were sent to Auschwitz, where
they were separated. Henri joined the line of the sick, followed by his younger
brother. Spring went with the healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last time that I saw Henri and Sylver was when Sylver threw my portion
of our bread ration to me,'' Spring said. ``An SS man closed the door to the gas
chamber behind them and they perished along with many others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, four of the five judges said the complaint should be rejected on
strictly legal grounds. They argued that the Swiss had adhered to the narrow
definition of refugees at that time, which didn't include those persecuted on
grounds of race. They also said too much time had lapsed for Spring to have a
valid claim against the government.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tribunal president Alain Wurzburger said regardless of legal arguments,
the court should award Spring what he asked for either on ethical grounds or,
failing that, to cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, two of the other judges backed Wurzburger's view.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Lawyer Says He Was Threatened  </HEADLINE>
   By PAGE IVEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A lawyer representing black workers at a federal
nuclear complex who are suing over alleged racial discrimination says he was hit
by a car and threatened during a trip to South Carolina to meet with his clients
last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ivan D. Smith of New York told the CBS newsmagazine program ''60
Minutes'' about the threats for a story scheduled to air Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith represents workers at the Savannah River Site near Aiken who say,
among other things, that they were given jobs that exposed them to radiation
hazards more often than other workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said in a deposition that when he visited South Carolina in June 1999
to meet with his clients, he ``was hit by a car driven by a white man who
shouted at me 'Nigger get out' as I bounced off the hood of his car.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said his nose was broken and he suffered other injuries from being hit.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said he also received threats at his New York home. He said he never
reported them to police for fear other potential attackers would learn where he
was staying.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed in 1997, accuses Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which
runs the former weapons complex for the U.S. Energy Department, of
discriminating against blacks in raises and promotions. It also says the company
failed to stop the use of racial epithets and intimidation of black employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Also named in the lawsuit were subcontractors Bechtel Savannah River Inc.,
Babcock &AMP; Wilcox Savannah River Co. and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Savannah
River Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The workers seek back pay, compensatory and punitive damages and changes in
how promotions and pay raises are made. Federal law prohibits such suits from
seeking a specific monetary sum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not tolerate discrimination against any group, or against any
individual,'' Westinghouse SRS spokesman Will Callicott said Friday. ``We regret
that this case has resulted in litigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 90 employees are represented in the suit. Smith wants to turn it into
a class action representing all black employees of the companies.

<HEADLINE> Heart Complicates Bradley Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley's latest revelation about his heart
condition is one more setback for an underdog campaign that can't afford to skip
a beat.
</P>
<P>
	   His medical condition -- which is not life-threatening -- flared up as polls
showed him far behind just before Iowa's caucuses and slipping in New Hampshire,
New York and Massachusetts. Those early voting states are central in Bradley's
strategy to upset Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's having a rough time, and it's a bad time to have a rough time,'' said
Democratic consultant Ray Strother of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   His hand forced by a reporter's question, the former New Jersey senator
confirmed days before Iowa's caucuses that an irregular heartbeat had recurred
four times since he first revealed the condition in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the condition would have no impact on his campaign and tried to
change the topic to his get-out-the vote effort. ``You can't control what a
heart does, so the timing is irrelevant,'' said spokesman Eric Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing was relevant to Iowa Democrats who were talking about Bradley's
health -- not his health care plan -- three days before the first contest of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he has a problem and it's something that won't go away, I think maybe
in the long run he ought to say, 'I've got other things to do. I don't need the
stress of being president,''' Joyce Brown, a 59-year-old Democrat, said between
sips of coffee at a Colfax diner.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue consumed Bradley's campaign Friday. Reporters shouted questions at
a jam-packed news conference and during a walking tour of heavily Republican
Muscatine.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a friendly audience of 50 backers yielded a question that went right to
the heart of the matter: What's this we hear about your health?
</P>
<P>

condition. It's a nuisance for me and it shouldn't be a concern for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted him to reassure me,'' said crowd member Bonnie Weeks. ``I feel
reassured.''
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, the Bradley campaign offered official reassurance from one of
his cardiologists. In a statement, the doctor said that it's natural for Bradley
to experience a ``sporadic increase in frequency of episodes, which does not
indicate any change in heart status.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been advised to continue all normal activity without limitations,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's advisers and non-allied Democrats said they expect most voters to
shrug off the news -- but only after the campaign takes another hit. ``I still
think it's a one-day story,'' Strother said. ``But he's got other problems.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, Bradley's campaign has little chance of winning Monday's caucuses
and aides now fear a blowout. Polls have consistently shown him 20 points or
more behind.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, a tracking poll gave Gore a nine-point lead and the vice
president's own surveys showed him leading Bradley for the first time in weeks.
A Time/CNN poll showed Gore ahead by 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns still expect the Feb. 1 primary to be a tossup, but Bradley
doesn't want Gore to leave Iowa with momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   In the political community, activists who glowed about Bradley's insurgent
campaign weeks ago are now wondering whether his team can handle the pressure of
a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley himself has yet to prove he can retain his political base in New
Hampshire -- a state that traditionally takes a second and third look at the
field in the frenzied final week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he may be suffering from overexposure,'' Strother said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts, including Bradley backers, trace his political troubles to a
string of attacks on Gore that seemed out of character for a candidate who
pledged not to play by the old rules of politics. A fumbled debate question
about agriculture also staggered his Iowa campaign for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   Though still professing confidence about New Hampshire, Bradley's campaign
is hedging its bets by looking ahead to a batch of March 7 primaries -- several
of which are in Northeast states that could favor the former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iowa and New Hampshire are important,'' campaign chairman Doug Berman
said. ``Given the changing calendar of 2000, however, we've always looked at
them as the first step to the national primary between March 7 through March
21.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, must weather the latest questions about his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Democrats who shrugged off the condition said it might tip the scales
in a close race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it starts to be debilitating, it would be an issue,'' said Mike Winnike
of West Point, Iowa. ``But this is something he's lived with for a long time.''
</P>
<P>

former President Bush, had a similar condition and ``nobody really tried to make
an issue out of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush benefited by his reputation for being physically active. Bradley, a
Hall of Fame basketball player, may get the same benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Bradley has made a mistake here it might be that he wasn't a little
more forthcoming about what he had,'' Fitzwater said. ``Our experience was when
people understand the illness they accept it because they understand modern
medicine's ability to deal with these things.''

<HEADLINE> Heart condition complicates Bradley's woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley's latest revelation about his heart
condition is one more setback for an underdog campaign that can't afford to skip
a beat.
<P>
	   His medical condition - which is not life-threatening - flared up as polls
showed him far behind just before Iowa's caucuses and slipping in New Hampshire,
New York and Massachusetts. Those early voting states are central in Bradley's
strategy to upset Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's having a rough time, and it's a bad time to have a rough time," said
Democratic consultant Ray Strother of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Killer of Five  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK BABINECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man who killed his lover and four neighbors was
executed Friday, ending a case that death penalty opponents used as a test of
Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Keith Robison shot, stabbed and decapitated his homosexual lover, then
shot and stabbed four other people in 1982. The 42-year-old Air Force veteran
had said for the past several months that he was ready to die so he could leave
death row.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've never denied my part in it, or tried to excuse myself or avoid the
responsibility,'' Robison said in an interview last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Robison had been scheduled to die in July. Death penalty opponents lobbied
Bush to grant him a one-time reprieve because of his mental illness and called
it a test of Bush's presidential campaign theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   But a Texas appeals court spared Bush from making the decision by canceling
the execution and ordering a competency exam. Robison was ruled competent and
the execution was rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Robison's lover, Rickey Lee Bryant, 31, was shot, decapitated, stabbed and
mutilated in a Lake Worth cottage. Robison, in search of a getaway vehicle, went
next door and killed Bruce Gardner, 33; Georgia Ann Reed, 34; Earline Barker,
55; and Ms. Reed's 11-year-old son, Scott.
</P>
<P>
	   Robison, who was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, pleaded innocent by
reason of insanity but was convicted. The verdict was overturned, but the 1987
retrial also ended with a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Four relatives of the victims who were at the prison Friday when Robison was
given a lethal injection released a statement:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Larry Robison has paid with his life for the 17-year nightmare of trauma
and heartache he caused for the families of his victims. The laws of God and man
were broken. Justice has been done. May they all rest in peace.''

<HEADLINE> Cruel Choice Comes With Gas Additive  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- It smells like turpentine and spreads through
water so quickly and thoroughly that a scant spoonful can foul an Olympic-sized
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, a widely used gasoline additive that makes cars burn cleaner, has
posed a cruel dilemma: It's making the air cleaner, but it's polluting the
water.
</P>
<P>
	   A suspected animal carcinogen with unknown health effects on humans, MTBE
has become the curse of water officials from California to New England.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaking from gas stations' underground fuel tanks, it has forced wells to
close, run up millions of dollars in cleanup costs, sparked Fsuits and prompted
state, local and federal investigations into a petrochemical that is still
something of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a diabolical chemical. It moves up, it moves down, it moves
everywhere. Our feeling is that as long as MTBE is in gasoline, our groundwater
is in jeopardy,'' said Dennis Cocking of the South Tahoe Public Utility
District, where 12 of 34 wells were closed because of MTBE.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE has two critical characteristics -- its ability to spread quickly,
caused by its high solubility, and its permanency. Even in its tiniest
proportions, five parts per billion, MTBE has an easily detectable smell.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The stuff moves like wildfire. It increases exponentially. Once you find
out you have a problem, you have a big problem. And once it's in, how do you get
it out?'' said Doug Marsano of the Denver-based American Water Works
Association, a consortium of water agencies that has urged President Clinton to
ban MTBE.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Marsano, the chemical has been detected in varying amounts in
all 50 states. Significant MTBE contamination also has been found in such
pastoral areas as Ronan, Mont., and Spring Green, Wis., as well as in major
cities like Dallas, Denver and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see it in a contiguous line from California to the East Coast. One
of the great questions here is why a chemical that we don't have a lot of
information about is being used in such a widespread manner,'' Marsano said.
``At this point, we think it is a problem in every state, but just how
significant a problem we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
	   A European study in the mid-1990s linked MTBE to liver and kidney tumors in
mice. The danger to humans is unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the levels we're seeing in drinking water, there is no direct human
study that shows cause and effect. The studies being used to assess risk are
essentially studies being done on animals,'' said California's top drinking
water official, Dr. Dave Spath of the Department of Health Services. ``But the
problem with MTBE is whether there is a significant future threat because of all
these tanks that have leaked over many years.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, California -- the nation's No. 1 user of MTBE, with about 11
percent of all fuel containing the substance -- has banned it by the end of
2002, and other states are expected to follow suit. Eight Northeastern states
from New Jersey to Maine joined to ask Congress to allow them to decide whether
MTBE or similar clean-air additives should be put in their gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   And an Environmental Protection Agency panel has recommended strengthening
programs to reduce MTBE's presence in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   The MTBE industry defends the additive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of cleaner-burning gasoline with MTBE, cities like Los Angeles are
enjoying their best air quality in 50 years,'' said Terry Wigglesworth,
executive director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association. ``MTBE has not only met,
but exceeded expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, called an oxygenate because it adds oxygen to gasoline, was developed
by oil companies in the 1970s to boost octane and replace lead. Smog fighters
noticed that MTBE improved gasoline combustion and dramatically reduced tailpipe
pollution, in some cases up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990, federal authorities
ordered the phase-in of oxygenates in gasoline sold in the nation's smoggiest
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE became the oxygenate of choice. The other best-known oxygenate,
ethanol, is a type of alcohol made from corn and is used widely in the Midwest.
Supporters of ethanol see it as safer; MTBE backers dispute that.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is now found in the fuel consumed by
70 percent of the nation's cars. About 4.5 billion gallons of the additive are
manufactured annually.
</P>
<P>
	   In Santa Monica, hit first and hardest by major MTBE contamination in 1995,
the substance leaked into the water supply from the underground tanks of at
least a dozen gas stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The city of 92,000 has shut down at least half of its wells and is now
importing most of its water from Southern California's main wholesaler. The city
believes the cleanup could cost $100 million,
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was quite astounding,'' said Assistant City Attorney Joe Lawrence. ``It
went from a low of 20 ppb to a high of 600 ppb. Once it leaked out, it created
havoc with the drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glennville, a scenic mountain town of 300 in the Sierra Nevada, was
devastated by the MTBE that spread into its water supply from a single leaking
underground tank. The contamination registered 20,000 ppb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even the ice had a strange odor,'' Lori Jauch said. ``In the very
beginning, when they came up and told us what was happening, I think everybody
in the community was shocked. They had one meeting, and everybody was upset.''
</P>
<P>
	   The town's water supply was shut down, and water is now trucked in from
Bakersfield, an hour to the west.

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers fly into NYC, appeal for his release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Eager to accompany their grandson back to his native
Cuba, the grandmothers of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez arrived Friday in New York
and appealed directly to the American people for his return.
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter will be in peace, and
she will not be in peace until Elian is home," the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez, said through a translator at a packed news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   She addressed reporters after a similar plea by the boy's paternal
grandmother, Mariela Quintana, at a question and answer session which was
broadcast live on several national cable networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana said in Spanish to reporters waiting inside a
hangar at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," she said later. "He
was born in Cuba. He is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal did not impress the lead attorney for the boy's Florida
relatives. Spencer Eig said the grandmothers' knowledge was based entirely on
information provided by the Cuban government since Elian was found off the
Florida coast on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree," said
Eig, repeating the U.S. relatives' invitation for a Miami reunion and nixing any
New York get-together. "If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it
might relieve all their anxiety."
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers, accompanied by a three-member U.S. church delegation,
opted to fly over the boy's temporary Miami home and instead bring their message
to the nation's media capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Their grandson, the subject of both a personal battle for custody between
family members and a political tug-of-war between the Castro regime and
expatriate Cubans, is living in Florida with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carrying the grandmothers arrived in New York shortly after 3:30
p.m., about three hours after it took off from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of U.S. Customs officials and
police, winced from the cold as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree
temperature for their short walk into an airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long they were staying in the U.S.,
although organizers said it will only be a few days and the grandmothers' visas
were good for two months. The pair planned to have dinner in New York and rest
before resuming their efforts to reclaim their grandson.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, were to meet with the two grandmothers
Saturday at the Justice Department, said Maria Cardona, INS spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said the grandmothers requested the meeting and that the
administration wants to hear what they have to say. The request was made on
their behalf by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., through Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters of the boy's return to Cuba hope the grandmothers' arrival may
convince skeptics of the family's sincerity. Some anti-Castro activists
suggested the Cuban government pressured the women into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot
power boat, became an international cause celebre when he was found two months
ago floating on an inner tube two miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother and 10 other Cubans died when the ill-fated boat capsized on its
way to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the 6-year-old in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered Elian returned.
But attorneys for the family in Florida accused the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked a judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum
hearing.

<HEADLINE> Exclusion Zone Ordinance Struck Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- A law that barred drug dealers and prostitutes from
high-crime neighborhoods is unconstitutional because it criminalizes ``conduct
that clearly ought to be legal,'' a federal judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Susan J. Dlott struck down the city's ``exclusion
zones'' ordinance, which was adopted in 1996 to curb repeat offenses in certain
areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Dlott ruled Thursday that the law unconstitutionally interferes with
travel and free association rights and violates double-jeopardy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio filed the lawsuit in 1998 on
behalf of several people, including Patricia Johnson, who was arrested for
allegedly selling marijuana and was banned from the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood
near the city's central business district.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Johnson was not indicted on the drug charge, but the 90-day ban
remained. She was accused of entering the exclusion zone and charged with
criminal trespass, a charge that was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   Councilman Phil Heimlich, who proposed the ban, said he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Over-the-Rhine laws were effective for fighting drug and prostitution
crimes in Over-the-Rhine,'' Heimlich said. ``Similar parks laws were effective
at keeping sex offenders out of the park. ... So there's a lot at stake here.''

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore eased up on rival Bill
Bradley Friday. Gone was the fiery rhetoric about ``shredding the social safety
net,'' replaced by a concession that Bradley's health plan is based on ``a
respectable theory not to be dismissed out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I do dismiss it,'' Gore added, apparently unable to pull every
punch as his aides had advised on a day of fresh questions about Bradley's heart
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore campaigned at full speed all around the snow-crusted
state. ``There are three days left and we have a lot of work to do. We have some
unfinished business,'' Bradley told about 100 cheering backers in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, on a Perry farm, looked ahead to another daybreak-to-midnight schedule
and said he felt ``like a guy working with every ounce of breath I have to get
one more vote than the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to raise the stakes of Monday's Iowa caucus for Bradley, saying the
former New Jersey senator has ``bet everything on this and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, reporters asked Gore during a Des Moines hospital tour whether he
was worried about Bradley after Thursday's disclosure that his rival had had
four recent episodes of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is that it's nothing serious,'' Gore said as he knelt
with Mercy Medical Center asthma patient Shelby Claflin, 2, and her twin stuffed
bunnies. To WHO-TV, Gore said Bradley ``is in great health. It shouldn't be an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peppered with reporters' questions himself, Bradley said, ``No I'm not
worried about it. This is a common condition, millions of Americans have it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He speculated the problem might be due to elevated caffeine consumption
after he switched soft drinks to cream soda. ``I have curtailed all of my cream
soda,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he should have mentioned the heartbeat episodes earlier, he said
no.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a factor in the campaign or in conduct in office,'' he said.
``If I'm sick at my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick at my stomach?''
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, the Bradley campaign issued a statement by one of his
cardiologists who said it was natural for him to experience sporadic increases
in irregular heartbeat episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He only notes irregularity of the pulse and has no other symptoms,'' said
the statement by Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel. `And the rhythm spontaneously
reverts to regular. He has been advised to continue all normal activity without
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, on the campaign trail, said he was taking energy from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This room has a certain feel about it,'' Bradley said. ``This campaign is
based on the radical premise that you can go out and tell people what you
believe and you can win. If you lead, you have to lay out something specific.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to maintain momentum, Gore released two new television ads and a
pair of radio spots Friday. The TV ads mention a panoply of issues -- Medicare,
Medicaid, education, the environment. One makes a backhand swipe at Bradley,
whose campaign has focused on a few important ideas. ``I wouldn't just pay
attention to one or two things,'' Gore says in his new ad.
</P>
<P>
	   On radio ad features Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin saying Gore was there for the
state when it needed him and a second has Robert Kennedy Jr. touting Gore's
commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Des Moines, Gore and Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is popular among Iowa
Democrats, jointly showcased the vice president's health care proposal in a
noontime forum with hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Health reform -- with Bradley proposing universal access to health
insurance, and Gore pushing a more limited approach -- has been at the red-hot
center of their rival campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   On Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid, the government health program for the
poor, Gore dropped all previous talk of Bradley vouchers and caps -- distortions
that had gotten under his rival's skin for months -- and called it a
``mainstreaming proposal'' offering subsidies for the purchase of health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's soft-mitten touch was notable because just the night before he tried
to stir Iowa opposition against Bradley for calling the precinct caucuses an
exercise that favors Gore's ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is sensitive about not appearing to pile on Bradley or exploit
questions about his minor heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore warmed up again to the political fight as the day wore on, telling a
standing-room-only crowd at the Boone Elks Lodge, ``Sen. Bradley is a good man
with a bad plan'' for Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore are trying to make sure their supporters turn out at
the caucuses. After his evening speech, Gore asked people to linger at the Elks
Lodge. ``If you have to leave, I'll understand, but I'd like to greet you
personally and personally ask for your support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley asked 100 people at a breakfast rally in Burlington to gather up
friends. ``Nobody knows who's going to show up in the Iowa caucuses Monday
night. If you can call 10 people, we can do better than people expect.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Land in NYC  </HEADLINE>
   By DIEGO IBARGUEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to New York from Cuba on
Friday to appeal for his return, saying the boy's late mother will not ``rest in
peace'' until the 6-year-old boy is back in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Respect the memory of my daughter,'' said the boy's maternal grandmother,
Raquel Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   She and the boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, flew with a church
delegation that has supported Elian's return over the objections of the boy's
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Those relatives have invited the grandmothers to visit. But at least for
now, the women have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants staged massive
protests after the Immigration and Naturalization Service said he must go back
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the women took their message to the nation's media capital. On
Saturday they were to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno, who has said Elian
belongs with his father. U.S. officials said that the grandmothers requested the
meeting and that the Clinton administration wants to hear what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long the women will stay in the United
States; people who organized the trip said it will only be a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat on which he was heading for the United States capsized,
killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who say he would have a better
life in the United States. Attorneys for the family in Florida have asked a
federal judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that many say that it was Elian's mother's will that the child
remain here,'' Ms. Rodriguez said in Spanish. ``I speak for her because I was
her mother, I know what she thought and how she acted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mother's boyfriend arranged the journey, and Ms. Rodriguez said Elian's
mother went along only because she was forced to by ``the man she was with,''
who she said was violent and threatened her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask and beg those who are interested in helping us, to do everything
possible so that the child will be handed over to us, his grandmothers, so that
my daughter may rest in peace,'' Ms. Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women, greeted by a small party of Customs officials and police,
winced as they endured a whipping wind and 16-degree cold for their short walk
into a terminal at Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen. He was born in Cuba.
He is a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
The boy's Miami relatives claim the boy has said he wants to remain in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand by our position,'' Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez said in
Miami after the grandmothers arrived in New York. ``Now that they are here in
the United States I invite them to come to my house so they can see the child.
To see that we are not hiding him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never talk bad about the family in Cuba to the child. Not about the
grandparents and not about the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives' lead attorney, Spencer Eig, added that the women's
information about the case came almost entirely from Cuba's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned that they're being taken advantage of to some degree,''
Eig said. ``If they got a chance to see how well he is doing, it might relieve
all their anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
	   A senator from Florida is sponsoring legislation that would allow Elian to
have U.S. citizenship. The bill by GOP Sen. Connie Mack will be filed Monday and
could come up for a vote as soon as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent,'' Lott said during an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One'' to
be aired Sunday on PBS. ``It would not allow the administration to blow back and
forth depending on what Castro says, but it would allow the courts to determine
custody.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the federal judge who was to hear the lawsuit by the boy's
Miami relatives withdrew from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge James Lawrence King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King,
once hired Armando Gutierrez -- a man now working as spokesman for the boy's
relatives in Miami -- to help in his re-election bid. The federal judge also has
a daughter who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

<HEADLINE> Britain Seeks Details on Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The government said Friday it has asked for more information
from the parties in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's extradition case before a decision
is made about whether to free the former Chilean dictator.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties have until Monday to respond, after which British Home Secretary
Jack Straw will make his decision ``as soon as possible,'' a Home Office
spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new request is the latest development in the case of Pinochet, 84, who
has spent 15 months under detention in Britain. He is fighting a Spanish judge's
efforts to extradite him to Madrid to face charges of the systematic torture of
political opponents throughout his 1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   After an independent team of doctors found Pinochet unfit to stand trial,
Straw said last week that he was inclined to let the general return to Chile.
But he allowed Pinochet's opponents until Jan. 18 to send him petitions before a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The Home Office said Friday that Straw has now written to lawyers for
Pinochet and for Amnesty International and the Spanish government, asking them
for more information. A department spokeswoman said Straw wanted them to clarify
certain points in their petitions, but did not explain exactly what extra
information he required.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet is said to suffer from diabetes, depression and the effects of two
minor strokes last fall, but the report compiled by the doctors who examined him
has not been released. Calls have been growing for Straw to release the reports,
but he has refused, citing patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people died or disappeared during
Pinochet's 17-year dictatorship, which started when he ousted elected Marxist
President Salvador Allende in a military coup.

<HEADLINE> Contract manager: State was warned in about problems in emissions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state was directly warned that long waiting
lines were likely at car inspection stations once a private company began a
tougher emissions test, and that this would prompt "extreme public criticism,"
according to an October letter from a consultant hired to manage the $400
million contract.
<P>
	   The project manager, Parsons Brinckerhoff, on Friday denied charges leveled
by Gov. Christie Whitman and Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein that it
had "sanitized" a series of reports from a subcontractor that correctly
predicted disaster at inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
	   A letter to the state from Parsons Brinckerhoff in October - two months
before the enhanced inspection tests began - raised several concerns about the
project. In many cases, the letter includes, word-for-word, warnings made in an
earlier memo by its subcontractor, Sierra Research of Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman on Thursday ordered state Attorney General John Farmer to
investigate why Sierra's blunt warnings were not heeded. The enhanced emissions
system has been plagued by long lines and waiting times since it began on Dec.
13, forcing officials to delay inspection deadlines. Because of the DMV
disarray, Whitman announced Friday that police will not pull over motorists
because of expired inspection stickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Soriano, office manager for Parsons Brinckerhoff's Princeton operation,
said Friday the company regularly informed state officials of reports by its
subcontractors, and that this included concerns that the private vendor's
program would prompt motorist delays. The private vendor running the lanes is
Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, which is not related to Parsons
Brinckerhoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident that the Attorney General's review will show that Parsons
Brinckerhoff and its subcontractors carried out all of their responsibilities
under their oversight contract," Soriano said.
</P>
<P>
	   An Oct. 6, 1999 letter from Parsons Brinckerhoff project manager Bruce E.
Podwall to Carl Passeri, the Division of Motor Vehicles official in charge of
the program, warned that there was "no evidence" that the program "will prevent
excess wait times," and that if wait times are not improved, "extreme public
criticism" was imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter advances warnings subcontractor Sierra had made about a wide
range of issues. It disputed Parsons Infrastructure's contention that lines
could be cut by extending hours at centralized inspection stations, said the
higher cost of inspections at garages would prompt more motorists to get free
inspections at centralized lanes, and questioned the company's plans to train
its employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter also noted that "time is running out" on making sure the system's
computer system was glitch-free. It warned that Parsons Infrastructure needed to
be "fully prepared" to respond to equipment failures, including those caused by
bad weather. Problems with staffing, computer glitches, and freezing equipment
have dogged the system.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was not among the documents released Thursday when Whitman and
Weinstein leveled their charges that Parsons Brinckerhoff had sanitized the
reports. The state on that day released the memos by subcontractor Sierra and a
series of project update reports from Parsons Brinckerhoff. The October letter,
however, was not written in the same form as the project update reports and
directly passed on the subcontractor's concerns in plain language.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Berzok, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said he did
not have the October letter on Thursday, and only released it to the media after
it was provided to the state by Parsons Brinckerhoff late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Berzok said Passeri was not available for comment, and that the department
would not respond to questions "because of the attorney general's review."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman spokesman Pete McDonough said the letter "only shows that in one
instance there was no sanitizing going on."
</P>
<P>
	   "Neither the governor or the commissioner said every single memo, every
single instance was sanitized," McDonough said. "But the level of alarm and
concern expressed in the Sierra memos was rarely if ever in the communications
from Parsons Brinckerhoff."
</P>
<P>
	   McDonough insisted that Whitman and Weinstein "didn't point fingers" at
Parsons Brinckerhoff, stressing that Farmer's probe will also look into whether
or not state officials adequately told their superiors of the subcontractor's
concerns. The Sierra memos mention officials from DMV and the Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman and Weinstein, however, maintain they knew nothing about these
concerns until earlier in the week, after the Star-Ledger of Newark requested
copies of the memos.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure who got them, when they got them, and whether the issues
brought up in those memos were not addressed," Whitman said Friday. "We need to
know who knew about it, and if the discussion wasn't full and frank, why wasn't
it full and frank."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor on Friday said she expects the three-member panel to be named
by the middle of next week, and that she wants a preliminary report within 60
days.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also said the state would deduct about $4 per inspection from
Parsons Infrastructure's pay because of the firm's performance. Whitman says
more than $600,000 will be deducted from the company's payments because of the
long lines; Parsons Infrastructure said the state is partly to blame because it
kept changing computer software requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco on Friday joined Assembly Speaker Jack
Collins' call to suspend the emissions system. DiFrancesco intends to hold
hearings on the issue. Democratic lawmakers say an independent body should
investigate.

<HEADLINE> Lott says Elian citizenship could be considered in days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Florida Republicans intend to introduce legislation
Monday to grant U.S. citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott said Friday.
<P>
	   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., could be brought up for a
vote by midweek, Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent," Lott said during an interview on "John McLaughlin's One on One," to be
aired Sunday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, companion legislation will be introduced by Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., among others. Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey of Texas said
House GOP leaders had made no decision on how swiftly to push for passage.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., indicated some Democrats will
support the bill. "I doubt that we'll have a party position on that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has been at the center of an international custody dispute since
November, when his mother died and he was found on Thanksgiving Day floating in
an inner tube off Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   His father in Cuba has demanded that he be sent back to Cuba, and his two
grandmothers flew to New York Friday to press the case at a news conference.
Relatives in Miami and others among that city's Cuban-Americans, many vehemently
opposed to Cuban President Fidel Castro, want the boy to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, will meet with the two grandmothers
Saturday at the Justice Department, said Maria Cardona, INS spokeswoman. Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif., requested the meeting on the grandmothers' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should go back to Cuba, but Reno has extended
the INS deadline to allow his Miami relatives to sue. The judge appointed to
hear the lawsuit withdrew Friday, and it was reassigned.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has not said whether he would sign citizenship
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauricio Tamargo, a spokesman for Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said
there also is a possibility that legislation would be introduced to establish
permanent residency for the boy. He said either measure would "probably
accomplish the objective, which is to move the boy from INS control and have the
opportunity to have his case heard in judicial court."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Citizenship Sought for Elian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida Republicans intend to introduce legislation Monday
to grant U.S. citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., could be brought up for a
vote by midweek, Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only
intent,'' Lott said during an interview on ``John McLaughlin's One on One,'' to
be aired Sunday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, companion legislation will be introduced by Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., among others. Majority Leader Rep. Dick Armey of Texas said
House GOP leaders had made no decision on how swiftly to push for passage.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., indicated some Democrats will
support the bill. ``I doubt that we'll have a party position on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has been at the center of an international custody dispute since
November, when his mother died and he was found on Thanksgiving Day floating in
an inner tube off Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   His father in Cuba has demanded that he be sent back to Cuba, and his two
grandmothers flew to New York Friday to press the case at a news conference.
Relatives in Miami and others among that city's Cuban-Americans, many vehemently
opposed to Cuban President Fidel Castro, want the boy to remain in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, commissioner of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, will meet with the two grandmothers
Saturday at the Justice Department, said Maria Cardona, INS spokeswoman. Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif., requested the meeting on the grandmothers' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should go back to Cuba, but Reno has extended
the INS deadline to allow his Miami relatives to sue. The judge appointed to
hear the lawsuit withdrew Friday, and it was reassigned.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has not said whether he would sign citizenship
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauricio Tamargo, a spokesman for Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said
there also is a possibility that legislation would be introduced to establish
permanent residency for the boy. He said either measure would ``probably
accomplish the objective, which is to move the boy from INS control and have the
opportunity to have his case heard in judicial court.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Admits Botched FBI Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Highway Patrol acknowledges
botching its investigation into a deadly head-on collision caused by a drunken
FBI agent driving the wrong way on Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers misinterpreted physical evidence, ignored conflicting statements
from witnesses and asked leading questions of agent David R. Farrall about the
crash, which killed two brothers, the patrol said in an internal report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, three hours after the FHP publicly faulted the
brothers for the crash, Broward County Medical Examiner Dr. Joshua Perper
questioned the information and said ``the FHP needs to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the findings, the patrol concluded no troopers should be
disciplined, saying mistakes were not ``malicious'' or ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Nov. 23 crash killed Maurice Williams, 23, a youth minister, and Craig
Chambers, 19, a student at Florida Atlantic University.
</P>
<P>
	   A month later, the FHP reversed its identification of the wrong-way driver
and apologized to the brothers' family.
</P>
<P>
	   Farrall is charged with vehicular homicide and drunken driving manslaughter.
He could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel's Confession Tapes Released  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- On grainy police videotape, a red-haired boy in
handcuffs stands in the school cafeteria just six hours after shooting two
fellow students dead and wounding 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Blood is smeared across the white tile floor, and a body, covered in a white
sheet, lies near a long table. Next to it are a pair of headphones. Books,
backpacks -- even shoes -- lie abandoned by students who raced from Kip Kinkel's
gun fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why did you do this?'' Detective Al Warthen asks the 15-year-old in the
May 1998 videotape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had no other choice,'' Kinkel says quickly, his head hung low.
</P>
<P>
	   The video shows Kinkel, who earlier killed his parents, as police brought
him back to Thurston High School to show him the carnage and ask him why he did
it.
</P>
<P>
	   Springfield police released the raw videotape just days after the airing of
a PBS documentary about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinkel, now 17, was sentenced to 112 years in prison for the murders.
</P>
<P>
	   In the videotape, Kinkel is in handcuffs with a police jacket slung over his
shoulders. His plastic, police-issue sandals shuffle along the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   He nods and murmurs one-word answers to Warthen's questions as they retrace
Kinkel's steps from a spot near the tennis courts where he parked his mother's
Ford Explorer, through the school's hallways, to the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
	   As they stopped in the breezeway, Kinkel tells Warthen he didn't focus on
faces as he pulled the trigger, and wasn't targeting anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a blur,'' he says. ``I told one kid he should probably leave.''
</P>
<P>
	   Warthen asks, ``Did any of these students make you upset or hurt you or
anything?''
</P>
<P>
	   While his eyes shift back and forth across the cafeteria, Kinkel answers:
``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was in the cafeteria that Kinkel killed two students and wounded the
others.
</P>
<P>
	   In a barely audible voice, the teen tells Warthen that he had a 50-round
clip in his .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle when he walked into the cafeteria in
a long trenchcoat and began shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinkel's quiet, videotaped answers starkly contrast with his stuttering,
boyish sobs as he confesses to killing his parents in an audiotaped interview
with Warthen three hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, Kinkel had gotten in trouble for bringing a gun on campus.
Facing expulsion, he was sent home early with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Some time after they returned, the teen shot his father, Bill, in the back
of the head, dragged his body into the bathroom and covered it with a sheet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't want to,'' he says on the videotape when Warthen asks him about
that shooting. ``I loved my dad,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He shot his mother, Faith, several times in the garage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dad kept saying how embarrassed she was going to be (about his
expulsion) and how horrible I was. I couldn't let my mom feel like that,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinkel said he turned on the television to ``keep me company,'' but stayed
up all night, talking to some of his friends and trying to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I tried so hard to kill myself,'' he said. ``But I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Moments before the audiotaped interview, Kinkel lunged at Warthen with a
knife that he had taped to his ankle. Officers missed it when searching him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wanted you to shoot me,'' Kinkel told the detective during the
interview. ``I just want to die.''

<HEADLINE> Dorm Fire Drill Records Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Investigators attempting to determine the cause
of a dormitory fire that killed three university freshmen are seeking records
about the building, including reports on whether required fire drills were
conducted, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Seton Hall University students said Friday that they couldn't recall
any drills at Boland Hall, the six-story dormitory where the fire began before
dawn Wednesday. Six of the 58 injured students remained hospitalized Friday.
Four were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We didn't have any drills when we lived in Boland last year,'' said
Vordana Ruggeri, 19.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't even wake us up when the alarm goes off,'' said Bobb Barber,
19.
</P>
<P>
	   College dormitories in New Jersey have been required since at least 1995 to
have two fire drills a year and maintain reports about the drills for local fire
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Lisa E. Grider said Boland Hall had no drills during
the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were fire education programs, where the (resident assistant) posts
the fire evacuation plan and talks in a meeting with students,'' Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   An Essex County grand jury has subpoenaed fire inspection records and
engineering plans for Boland Hall, said Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant
prosecutor. She would not discuss the contents of the records.
</P>
<P>
	   Many students left Boland Hall during 18 alarms since September. Only one
was set off by a fire, in a nearby trash bin, Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   False alarms are no replacement for organized, planned drills, said William
Cane, director of the state Division of Fire Safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be monitored by the administration, or the fire official, or
both,'' Cane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Funerals are scheduled Monday for the three victims. Classes at the
10,000-student Roman Catholic school resume Tuesday afternoon, following a
memorial service.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the school said it was establishing a memorial fund to help
Boland Hall residents who need money for medication, clothes and other aid. By
the end of the day, $28,500 had been pledged, said Mari McKeon, director of
development for the university.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's National Palace Taken Over  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of protesters stormed Ecuador's national
palace on Friday night, hours after a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the
military forced Ecuador's unpopular president to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad had abandoned the palace where he worked and lived in
the afternoon after refusing a request from the military high command to resign.
His destination was unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some by waving the red
flag of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering followed a day of political chaos, with Indians demanding
Mahuad's resignation and forcing their way into Congress and the Supreme Court.
After first backing Mahuad, the military later in the day decided to support the
protest, saying it was the only way to prevent ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad refused to step down, saying during a nationwide television broadcast
that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it by force.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual uprising. Last
year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only one
in three in the labor force has full-time work. A vast majority of the nation's
4 million Indians live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, military guards stepped aside when hundreds of Indians
stormed an empty Congress building, seized the podium and announced that they
had created their own ``Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito during the day was in chaos -- with Indians armed with
rocks and clubs paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the
country and much of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention
of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said in a nationwide
television broadcast Friday, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broadcast, he characterized the Confederation of Indigenous
Nationalities -- which led the rebellion -- as a small minority among 12 million
Ecuadoreans. Other government leaders said the protesters were attempting to
exploit discontent caused by the Latin American nation's deep economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers. His destination was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's Indians, it was unclear who would take power
even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians appointed a new governing council, made up of an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the military's call for Mahuad's resignation -- it was
not clear whether most military leaders would support the triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As night fell in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, rioters took
to the downtown streets, burning two vehicles, beating a bystander and hurling
rocks at passing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, a group of leftist-led unions, student
organizations and neighborhood associations seized the provincial government
building.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Safety Board Explains F-15 Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A midair collision that caused an F-15 fighter jet to crash
last summer happened when one of the pilots failed to say over his radio that he
had lost sight of the other, a safety board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Missouri Air National Guard F-15s clipped wings Aug. 19 during a
training mission in the skies over Salem, Mo. One of the pilots, Capt. Richard
W. Wedan, was forced to eject and suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The primary cause of the mishap was Captain Wedan's failure to announce he
had lost sight of his opponent during the engagement, and his continuing to
maneuver while remaining silent, even after his opponent had declared his own
loss of sight,'' said a report released by a five-member Accident Investigation
Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the other pilot, Major Brian J. Kamp, contributed to the
collision by maneuvering his F-15 without an accurate assessment of Wedan's
flight path. Kamp was able to land safely at St. Louis' Lambert Airport, where
his 131st Fighter Wing squad is based.
</P>
<P>
	   Telephone calls to the 131st Fighter Wing squad were not returned Friday
night.

<HEADLINE> Group Sues To Block Internet Primary  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT THOMSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A Virginia-based voting group filed a federal lawsuit Friday
in an attempt to block Arizona's Democrats from holding the nation's first
Internet presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed by the Voting Integrity Project, alleges that voting by
computer would hurt minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A large number of voters, especially minority voters, lack computers or
access to the Internet,'' said one of the plaintiffs, Arizona Democrat Olivia
Lizarraga-Bussey. ``Our voices will not be heard like others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Democrats are scheduled to hold their presidential primary March 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Online voting from personal computers at home, work or elsewhere is planned
from 12:01 a.m. March 7 until 11:59 p.m. March 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditional paper ballots and computer terminals will be available at each
of the 50 polling places statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Deborah Phillips, president of the Voting Integrity Project, said people who
don't have access to a personal computer may have to travel long distances to
vote because so few polling places will be available.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Democratic Party Chairman Mark Fleisher said he has worked with
minority legislators and the state's Indian tribes regarding polling place
locations to make sure those groups can participate. Fleisher said the party
will fight the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Party and computer industry officials have said that this would be the
nation's first binding election for public office to be conducted over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic officials have said that online voting could increase voter
participation and reduce costs.

<HEADLINE> Citrus Trees Burned To Kill Canker  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORIDA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A bonfire of lime trees infected with citrus
canker went up in smoke Friday along with the hopes of some growers who thought
they were on the verge of recovering from Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant disease, which is contagious and also poses a threat to oranges
and grapefruit, has invaded commercial groves for the first time in South
Florida, forcing growers to destroy the blighted trees in hopes of stopping the
spread. The canker not only is endangering the crop but also a way of life.
</P>
<P>
	   "My wife shed enough tears already," said LimeCo owner Herbert Yamamura, who
will lose a 290-acre grove to bulldozers Saturday. "It makes me cry when she
cries. I try to be strong."
</P>
<P>
	   At 66, Yamamura was persuaded by the corky brown bumps in his Persian lime
grove to pack it in as a Florida citrus grower and switch entirely to importing
fruit, now less than a quarter of his business.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant disease is believed to have spread by winds, jumping about 30
miles from backyard citrus trees in suburban Miami, where it was first spotted
five years ago, to commercial groves to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts believe at least a third of the $15 million lime crop has been lost
in Miami-Dade County, but the overwhelming concern is for the bulk of the $8
billion citrus industry sitting as little as 90 miles north.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, all but 20 acres of the 677 acres checked tested positive for the
canker or had been exposed to the disease, officials said. The four-mile square
test site is in the Florida City area, near the tip of the Florida peninsula and
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Citrus fruit and plant material cannot be moved out of quarantined areas in
South Florida that now total 500 square miles.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody has their fingers crossed that we're going to be able to contain
what we've got there," said Tom Kirby, executive director of the Dade County
Farm Bureau. "Given the fact that it travels by wind, I personally am not very
hopeful."
</P>
<P>
	   The farm labor market will feel some affects. Some migrant laborers who came
to the region to work winter crops became full-time residents by also working
the lime groves from May to October.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumers should not notice any shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the destruction of groves by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, most of the
U.S. lime supply comes from Mexico. Miami-Dade growers had been counting on
groves planted since then to boost their 10 percent market share. Two more windy
tropical storms, Harvey in September and Irene in October, are blamed for the
latest canker spread.
</P>
<P>
	   Key lime pie eaters don't have to worry about their flavorful source drying
up. True key limes, smaller than a walnut, are a cottage industry. Most pies are
made with juice from other limes and lemons.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese New Year's shoppers may be the first to see any market impact. They
spend $3 to $5 on a single pumelo, an oversized, avocado-shaped grapefruit
variety bought for decoration and good luck.
</P>
<P>
	   Doused with diesel and ignited with propane, a bulldozed row of pumelos next
to the original lime infestation also was ignited Friday, the first fires set to
kill the canker since its farm discovery Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hate to do it. I was born here," said Roger Harden of H&AMP;H Land Clearing
and Demolition, who was hired to knock down infected trees.
</P>
<P>
	   And once a grove is destroyed to fight the canker, citrus cannot be planted
on the cleared acreage for at least 18 months. It would take years more to
develop a new crop, leading growers to hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the 3,000 acres of limes disappear due to canker, we're going to have
600 more five-acre homesites available real quickly," said Pal Brooks,
third-generation owner of Brooks Tropical, a diversified grower, farm manager,
packer, shipper and importer. Limes are his second-biggest crop.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than 40 years, Yamamura has lost his taste for growing. He plans
to sell his land and use his crop insurance covering less than half of the cost
of his trees to pay his debts.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year was finally the year that I was going to be able to get my
maintenance costs back plus a little bit of profit," he said. "This time,
canker's going to take it all."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Dept. Store Leaving Hawaii  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- A major Japanese retailer said Saturday it will withdraw from
Hawaii because of poor sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyu Department Store Co. will sell all three Shirokiya stores in Hawaii,
spokesman Kazuomi Obushi said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 people work at the stores, which are operated by Tokyu subsidiary
Shirokiya Inc. in Ala Moana Center, Pearlridge Center and Kaahumanu Center on
Maui.
</P>
<P>
	   Shirokiya was a charter tenant of Ala Moana when the shopping mall opened in
1959. The Maui store opened in 1973, followed by the Pearlridge store in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the stores in Hawaii, Tokyu now runs only one overseas outlet, in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had nine overseas outlets at its peak in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyu has struggled with declining sales at home and abroad in recent years,
especially after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The retailer suffered a net loss of $594 million on $4.64 billion in sales
for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Columbine Starts Library Fund Raiser  </HEADLINE>
   By AARON J. LOPEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Buoyed by a $250,000 donation and the support of
the school board, a group of Columbine High School parents on Friday officially
began a fund-raising campaign to replace the library where 10 students were
murdered last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   The group wants to raise $3.1 million before the one-year anniversary of the
nation's worst school shooting. The Jefferson County School Board late Thursday
approved tearing down the library and building a new library wing.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve students and a teacher died after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
armed with guns and homemade bombs, opened fire at Columbine on April 20. The
gunmen killed eight students and themselves inside the library.
</P>
<P>
	   The library never reopened, and its doors were walled off with lockers. A
temporary library was set up in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know what would be incredible is to stand up on April 20 and say,
'We've got $3.1 million,''' said Dawn Anna, whose daughter Lauren Townsend was
killed in the rampage.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest donation so far, $250,000, came from Sharon Magness, whose late
husband Bill Magness co-founded cable giant TeleCommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents group, Healing of People Everywhere, also has received more
$30,000 from Public Service Co. and from the Denver Rocky Mountain News.
</P>
<P>
	   The group estimates it will need $300,000 to begin the design process,
$777,500 to raze the library and $2 million to build a new 14,000- to
15,000-square foot library, which it hopes to have open by the 2001-02 school
year.

<HEADLINE> Oneok Rejects Southwest Gas Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- The board of directors of Oneok Inc., the parent
company of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., voted Friday to terminate a planned merger
with Southwest Gas Corp. because of financial concerns about the Las Vegas-based
company.
</P>
<P>
	   A provision in the termination agreement permitted any party to terminate if
certain conditions were not fulfilled by Dec. 14, 1999, officials said. Oneok
notified Southwest Gas of the termination Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We worked very hard to make this deal happen," said Larry Brummett, Oneok's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the bottom line is that even if we assume that all regulatory approvals
could be received in a timely manner, there is simply too much financial risk
associated with Southwest Gas right now and we have a responsibility to protect
our shareholders from excessive risk."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Southwest Gas couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the deal gone through, the merger between Oneok and Southwest would have
created the nation's largest stand-alone gas distribution company.
</P>
<P>
	   In the $866 million deal announced in December 1998, Oneok would have paid
$28.50 a share for Southwest Gas, while also assuming nearly $1 billion in debt.
The merged company would have served 2.6 million customers in Arizona,
California, Kansas, Nevada and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of both companies have dropped since the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 14, 1998, shares of Southwest Gas closed at $23.75 and shares of
Oneok closed at $33.50.
</P>
<P>
	   In Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange before the news was
announced, shares of Southwest Gas rose 18 3/4 cents to $22.31 1/4, while shares
of Oneok rose $1.25 to $27.56 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Pending claims against Southwest in a lawsuit filed by Southern Union
troubled company officials, Brummett said. Southern Union is an Austin, Texas,
natural gas distributor that also tried to acquire Southwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern Union's $750 million civil lawsuit alleges that Southwest and Oneok
conspired with an Arizona Corporation commissioner and a former commission staff
member to scuttle Southern Union's bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Arizona Corporation Commission staff issued a report
opposing the deal, citing, among other things, Oneok's integrity, safety record
and history of consumer complaints. Oneok said Arizona's regulatory staff was
concerned about the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger had received unanimous regulatory approval in Nevada and had been
recommended by the regulatory staff of the Public Utility Commission for
approval in California, Oneok officials said.

Government Withdraws Controversial Aid Offer to NHL Teams
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Industry Minister John Manley did his best spin-o-rama at
center ice as he bowed to public pressure and withdrew a three-day-old federal
subsidy offer for Canada's NHL teams on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one of Canada's six teams had appeared to immediately qualify for
assistance under the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Bryden, owner of the Ottawa Senators and the key NHL pitchman in the
campaign for federal help, responded to Manley's deft about-face with caution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact is if this team has a sound chance -- if well managed -- to break
even, it's going to stay,'' he told reporters at the Corel Centre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it doesn't have a sound chance to break even, even if well-managed,
it's going to leave.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bryden stated last month the team was for sale to U.S. interests because
he'd been unable to lower the money-losing club's tax burden.
</P>
<P>
	   After the federal program was announced, Bryden said the team was no longer
for sale. He was not prepared to state Friday that the team is back on the
market.

	   ------ Bloc Quebecois Demands Retraction From National Post
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- The Bloc Quebecois said it will launch a $1 million lawsuit
against the National Post unless it gets a front-page retraction over a
published report involving allegations of the misuse of public funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Gauthier, former leader of the Bloc, said he wants the retraction in
today's newspaper, but the Post said it had no intention of doing that.
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthier, who remains a Bloc MP, vigorously denied Friday that public money
was funneled into the party's coffers through a polling firm set up for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   Gauthier said the Bloc commissioned Sondages Polystat Inc. and paid it
$41,730 to conduct polls in 1996. Polystat in turn subcontracted out to the
Leger and Leger polling firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Post story on Friday said there was no evidence that Polystat
had any polling operations. But Leger and Leger is a well-known Quebec polling
firm.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Whyte, editor-in-chief of the National Post, said the paper had no
plans to retract the story.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we need from the Bloc is some documentation about how this money was
used. If they provide that, we'll run a story about that too,'' Whyte said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------ Tory MP Charlie Power Resigns Amid Allegations
</P>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Another political grenade was lobbed in the
lap of Conservative Leader Joe Clark on Friday with the sudden and very ugly
resignation of Tory MP Charlie Power.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's fisheries critic joins a growing list of senior party members
who have said they can't abide by Clark's position in the national unity debate.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked why he was leaving public life, Power first cited personal
reasons and then delivered a harsh critique of the party's direction.
</P>
<P>
	   Power is one of five Conservative MPs who have broken ranks with their
leader over the clarity bill, the federal government's legislation that sets out
the rules for provincial secession.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The clarity bill was part of the whole problem,'' Power said in St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Being in a party where there is a real serious difference of opinion
between myself and the leader is an uncomfortable situation. It was a factor
that I felt very strongly about.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark, who flew into Calgary late Thursday, said he was surprised Power had
quit. ``But we're getting on with life and preparing for the byelection.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------ Blizzards Wallop Maritimes for Second Time in Five Days
</P>
<P>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Winter delivered a knockout blow to the
Maritimes on Friday, pounding the region with heavy snow for the second time in
five days and whipping the ocean into frothing surges that threatened some
coastal homes.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 families were evacuated in the western P.E.I. communities of
Tignish Shore and Tignish Run early in the evening as storm surges sent ocean
waves over 990 feet inland, Emergency Measures Organization officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight other communities along the province's north shore were on alert as
high tides and winds gusting to over 62 miles per hour caused flooding in
low-lying areas. There were no immediate reports of damage to homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Businesses, banks, schools and sections of highway were closed in many
places throughout the region as wind gusts turned falling snow into a wintry
wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Environment Canada called for snowfall amounts of 12 inches in many areas --
and up to 24 inches for southern New Brunswick's notorious snowbelt, including
Moncton.
</P>
<P>
	   ------ Nova Scotia Minister Meets With Steelworkers
</P>
<P>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Steelworkers filed into a somber Cape Breton
meeting hall Friday to begin discussions on what many fear will bring about an
end to their faltering industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the United Steelworkers met with Nova Scotia's minister in charge
of Sydney Steel, one day after the government announced it was calling in a
receiver to either sell or liquidate the Crown corporation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the beginning of negotiations and we expect them to be long and
hard,'' said Sheldon Aucoin, who's worked at Sysco for 30 years and is now
considering what to do if the plant closes.
</P>
<P>
	   The province issued a statement early Thursday evening stating that it was
bringing in Ernst and Young to either find a buyer for the ailing plant or sell
its assets.
</P>
<P>
	   It said it was terminating an agreement with a U.S. consortium interested in
buying Sydney Steel, also known as Sysco.

Child-Rights Activist's Libel Suit Is Settled
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Child-rights activist Craig Kielburger said he felt
vindicated Friday as Saturday Night magazine ended a three-year legal battle by
settling a libel lawsuit with the teen.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine will pay Kielburger $319,000 after an article raised questions
about his fund-raising activities for the organization Free the Children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This judgment serves as vindication,'' Kielburger, 17, said after an
Ontario judge approved the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight-page article by Isabel Vincent in the November 1996 issue dubbed
Kielburger ``the most powerful 13-year-old in the world'' and cast aspersions
about his fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Kielburger gained international attention in January 1996 after he held a
news conference with two child workers in New Delhi while Canadian reporters
waited for Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
	   He has since met world leaders, been profiled on the TV show 60 Minutes, and
appeared before two U.S. congressional committees.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Abandons Palace  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of protesters surrounded Ecuador's national
palace on Friday night, hours after a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the
military forced Ecuador's unpopular president to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the
palace where he worked and lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from
the military high command to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some by waving the red
flag of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering followed a day of political chaos, with Indians demanding
Mahuad's resignation and forcing their way into Congress and the Supreme Court.
After first backing Mahuad, the military later in the day decided to support the
protest, saying it was the only way to prevent ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad refused to step down, saying during a nationwide television broadcast
that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it by force. Late
Friday, Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said in a television interview that
``the president has no intention of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian uprising.
Last year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only
one in three in the labor force has full-time work. A vast majority of the
nation's 4 million Indians live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Ecuador's ambassador, Patricio Vivanco, said Mahuad had abandoned
the presidential palace in Quito and taken refuge at a military base in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS later unanimously adopted a resoluting condemning the attempt to
overthrow the government and expressed full support for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   South American leaders also lined up in support of Mahuad, issuing
statements condemning attempts to oust him. A statement issued by the U.S.
Embassy in Lima, Peru, urged Ecuador's armed forces and police to uphold Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever regime arises from this unconstitutional process will confront
political and economic isolation, bringing more misery to the Ecuadorean
people,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Quito, military guards stepped aside when hundreds of
Indians stormed an empty Congress building, seized the podium and announced that
they had created their own ``Parliament of the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito during the day was in chaos -- with Indians armed with
rocks and clubs paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the
country and much of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention
of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said in a nationwide
television broadcast earlier Friday, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's Indians, it was unclear who would take power
even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians appointed a new governing council, made up of an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the military's call for Mahuad's resignation -- it was
not clear whether most military leaders would support the triad.
</P>
<P>
	   Military leaders said 120 officers were involved in the rebellion, along
with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed and eight were wounded by gunfire during protests and
looting in Quito, Guayaquil, and two smaller cities, the Red Cross said. The two
men who were killed were shot by merchants while allegedly looting a public
market in Portoviejo.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group
of leftist-led unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations
seized the provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of Ecuador's Indians live in the Andean highlands and
speak Quechua, a dialect of the language spoken by the Incas.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall
said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can

	   Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on condition

mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted,'' Hall
said Friday in a statement. ``There is much that still needs to be done before a
determination of cause can be reached.'' The AP story did not report that any
hypothesis had been officially adopted by the safety agency.
</P>
<P>
	   One official told AP that the Boeing 767 showed no signs of mechanical
problems and that ``it was doing what it was supposed to,'' before the crash.
Asked about Hall's statement, the official said Friday night that he stood by
his original account.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into
a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport. Attempts to
contact those two officials Friday night for comment on Hall's statement were
not successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall said the NTSB and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority had agreed this
week to continue studying the accident, including the voice and data recorders.
The investigators will be examining the plane's elevator system, hydraulic
components and engine pylons, he said. They also plan to conduct flight
simulations at Boeing facilities in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No decision has been reached at this point as to whether further wreckage
recovery will ultimately be necessary,'' Hall said. ``Both agencies agree that
additional work needs to be accomplished before a final decision can be made.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 70 percent of the plane's wreckage was recovered from the ocean floor,
following the jet's plunge off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket on Oct. 31.
The jet crashed 40 minutes into its 11-hour flight, killing all 217 aboard.

<HEADLINE> Russell 2000 Surges  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Once again, the small ones are sweeter.
</P>
<P>
	   After six years of lagging behind the broader market, the Russell 2000, the
bastion of small-capitalization stocks, is racking up better returns than any
other major stock index. While the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq
composite index have pitched and swooned so far this year, the Russell 2000 has
marched to new closing records, including one each day for the past five
sessions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say investors who poured money into the largest, priciest
technology shares in 1999 are now on a hunt for bargain stocks that just might
turn into the next Microsoft or Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been a search for underappreciated value in the small-cap stocks,"
said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's. "That's why we're seeing
such good results from the Russell 2000."
</P>
<P>
	   In the year to date, the Russell 2000 is up 5.6 percent, compared with a 4.1
percent gain for the Nasdaq, a 2.1 percent loss for the Dow and a 1.9 percent
loss for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
	   That's a major reversal from 1999. The Russell 2000 languished for most of
the year before a late rally helped it to a highly respectable 19.6 percent
gain, but it looked like a laggard compared with the Nasdaq, which lists many of
the same companies and posted an astonishing 85.6 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
	   So what's changed? For one thing, the Nasdaq's sizzling performance in 1999
was driven mostly by a small number of very large, widely held stocks, like
Microsoft, Cisco and Sun Microsystems that are not part of the Russell 2000. The
steep run-up in their prices left them unaffordable to many investors, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, investors are now snapping up shares of companies like Etec
Systems, which makes equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries,
and Coherent Inc., which makes lasers and other optical equipment. Etec
currently trades around $87 per share, while Coherent is about $47 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies in the Russell 2000 aren't exactly tiny. The index is actually a
subset of the Russell 3000 index, which measures the performance of the 3,000
largest U.S. companies based on market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 measures the 2,000 smallest of those companies. The largest
company in the index -- Broadvision -- has a market capitalization of roughly
$12.3 billion. The average market capitalization is about $526.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not Microsoft, but it's not Joe's Pizza, either.
</P>
<P>
	   The constitution of the Russell 2000 changes every year as Frank Russell
Co., the Tacoma, Wash.-based company that runs the indexes, removes companies
that have grown too large or have gone out of business.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last annual overhaul, completed in July, ETrade and Lycos were
bounced from the list while BarnesandNoble.com and Bebe Stores were added.
</P>
<P>
	   The last rebalancing, which added more technology companies to the index,
helped position the Russell 2000 for a solid advance, argues Chris Wolfe, equity
market strategist for private clients at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a number of years, the Russell 2000 was a repository of deteriorating
companies as they shrank in market capitalization," he said. Now, with Internet
and other high-tech companies dominating the ranks, investors are finding far
better potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Brad Lawson, senior research analyst at the Frank Russell Co., said
technology stocks haven't been the only star performers this year. Instead, the
health care sector of the Russell 2000 is up 26.1 percent for the year while
technology is up 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market isn't all about tech this year," Lawson said. "A broader range
of stocks are doing very well."
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 set its fifth straight record on Friday, rising 6.66 to
close at 533.94. For the week, the index rose 26.38 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq also set a new closing record on Friday, rising 45.89 to
4,235.40. The index gained 171.13 points over the course of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was, by far, the worst-performing major
index, tumbling 471.27 points during the week. A loss of 99.59 on Friday left
the Dow at 11,251.71.
</P>
<P>
	   The S&AMP;P 500 fell 23.79 for the week, losing 4.21 points on Friday to finish
at 1,441.36.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, which represents the combined market
value of all NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues, ended the week at $13.79
trillion, off $1.91 billion from last week. A year ago, the index was $11.29
trillion.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Abandons Palace  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of protesters surrounded Ecuador's national
palace on Friday night, hours after a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the
military forced Ecuador's unpopular president to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the
palace where he worked and lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from
the military high command to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some by waving the red
flag of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering followed a day of political chaos, with Indians demanding
Mahuad's resignation and forcing their way into Congress and the Supreme Court.
After first backing Mahuad, the military later in the day decided to support the
protest, saying it was the only way to prevent ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad refused to step down, saying during a nationwide television broadcast
that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it by force. Late
Friday, Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said in a television interview that
``the president has no intention of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian uprising.
Last year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only
one in three in the labor force has full-time work. A vast majority of the
nation's 4 million Indians live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Ecuador's ambassador, Patricio Vivanco, said Mahuad had abandoned
the presidential palace in Quito and taken refuge at a military base in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the attempt to overthrow
the government and expressed full support for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   South American leaders also lined up in support of Mahuad, issuing
statements condemning attempts to oust him. A statement issued by the U.S.
Embassy in Lima, Peru, urged Ecuador's armed forces and police to uphold Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever regime arises from this unconstitutional process will confront
political and economic isolation, bringing more misery to the Ecuadorean
people,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Quito, guards stepped aside when hundreds of Indians
accompanied by an unknown number of military officers stormed an empty Congress
building, seized the podium and announced that they had created their own
``Parliament of the People.'' Military leaders said 120 officers were involved
in the rebellion, along with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito during the day was in chaos -- with Indians armed with
rocks and clubs paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the
country and much of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention
of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said his nationwide
television broadcast, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's Indians, it was unclear who would take power
even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians appointed a new governing council, made up of an Indian, an army
colonel and a former Supreme Court chief.
</P>
<P>
	   However -- despite the military's call for Mahuad's resignation -- it was
not clear whether most military leaders would support the triad.
</P>
<P>
	   The participation of the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed and eight were wounded by gunfire during protests and
looting in Quito, Guayaquil, and two smaller cities, the Red Cross said. The two
men who were killed were shot by merchants while allegedly looting a public
market in Portoviejo.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group
of leftist-led unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations
seized the provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation and borrow money at lower, U.S. interest
rates, thereby shoring up its battered image with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of Ecuador's Indians live in the Andean highlands and
speak Quichua, a dialect of the language spoken by the Incas.

<P>
	   MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- Greg Anderson, whose interceptions and kick returns
sparked Montana's football teams during the mid-1970s, died Jan. 8 of a heart
attack. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, a defensive back, played four years for the Grizzlies. He was a
Little All-American in 1976 and all-Big Sky Conference for three years. He was
the league's most valuable player on defense in 1976, as a senior free safety.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football
League, and one in Montreal with the Canadian Football League.

Juggy Gayles
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Juggy Gayles, a music promoter whose career stretched from
the Lindy Hop to hip-hop, died Monday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the songs he plugged was Irving Berlin's ``White Christmas,'' which
became the second best-selling single in the history of recording. He placed
songs with Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra, and in the 1940s he started United
Music, a publishing company that had a major hit with ``The Hucklebuck.''
</P>
<P>
	   He went on to work as a promoter for Carlton Records and Atlantic records,
helping gain exposure for performers from Otis Redding to Led Zeppelin. He later
promoted hits for Herb Alpert and Silver Convention.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1983, Gayles joined Sleeping Bag Records, and later in its subsidiary,
Fresh. Sleeping Bag discovered the hip-hop group EPMD.
Jester Hairston
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jester Hairston, who appeared on radio and TV's ``Amos
'n' Andy,'' but who was likely best known to a younger generation of fans as the
wise old church member Rolly on the sitcom ``Amen,'' died Tuesday. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Amen,'' with a black cast, was the first hit TV show based on religion
when it debuted on TV in 1986. It aired until 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Within the entertainment industry itself, Hairston may have been best known
as a choral music director. He composed or arranged more than 300 spirituals
used in such films as ``Red River'' and ``She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.''
</P>
<P>
	   His best known music was his arrangement of ``Amen,'' which he dubbed for
Sidney Poitier in the 1963 film, ``Lilies of the Field.''
Maxine Elliott Hicks
</P>
<P>
	   SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) -- Maxine Elliott Hicks, who appeared in more than
200 silent films, then moved to movies and later appeared in television sitcoms,
including ``Frasier,'' died Jan 10. She was 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Hicks recently appeared in the movies ``Defending Your Life'' and
``Beethoven.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the age of the silent film, Ms. Hicks won such choice roles as the
daughter of Ethel Barrymore in ``The Eternal Mother'' and the bratty Susie May
Squoggs, nemesis of America's sweetheart, Mary Pickford, in ``Poor Little Rich
Girl.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although she moved successfully into talkies, she left acting in the 1930s
following a dispute between her mother and Jack Warner of Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
	   She later returned to acting, and when she was in her 80s, she co-starred as
Sister Ethel on the ABC sitcom ``The Ten of Us,'' set at a Catholic all-boys
school.
</P>
<P>
	   The role led to parts in the movies ``Defending Your Life'' and
``Beethoven'' and the television show ``Frasier.''

</P>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- J. Hardin Peterson Jr., who gave former Gov.
Lawton Chiles his first job out of law school and later became the late
governor's top attorney, died Friday. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of death was not released.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiles persuaded Peterson to leave his practice and become his general
counsel in 1991. Peterson retired after Chiles' first term but then returned to
the position from 1997 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In between his two stints in the governor's office, Peterson led a legal
delegation to Macedonia to help that country draft a new constitution and
establish its legal system.
Saeb Salam
</P>
<P>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Saeb Salam, who served as prime minister five times
and was the last surviving statesmen who fought for Lebanon's independence from
France, died Friday at age 95.
</P>
<P>
	   Salam began his political career in 1943 and ended in 1992, when his eldest
son, Tamam, succeeded him in the Beirut parliamentary seat he had held for
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Salam served as prime minister and Cabinet minister in his 50-odd years in
politics. He last held the premiership in 1972, when he quit following an
Israeli commando raid in Beirut that left three Palestinian guerrilla leaders
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   He relentlessly advocated peaceful Muslim-Christian coexistence following
the outbreak of Lebanon's ruinous 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Salam was one of a few Muslim Lebanese leaders who publicly supported a
controversial peace accord signed by Lebanon and Israel in 1983 to secure an
Israeli withdrawal from a border strip in southern Lebanon.
G. Ledyard Stebbins Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- G. Ledyard Stebbins Jr., a pioneer in the study of
plant evolution, died Wednesday. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
	   Stebbins was a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   He helped create the idea of evolutionary plant biology by incorporating the
study of fossils, genetics, cells and evolutionary history with the theories of
Charles Darwin.
</P>
<P>
	   In his book, ``Variation and Evolution in Plants,'' published in 1950, he
argued in detail that plants were subject to the same evolutionary processes as
animals. His theory is now commonly accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   Stebbins became president of the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1948.
In 1952, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1979, he won a
National Medal of Science.

	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Leo Taylor, a math instructor who counted Johnny Carson
among his pupils, died Wednesday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his teaching career at age 16 in a one-room school house in
north-central Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor's career eventually took him to Norfolk, where the future talk show
host was among his students. He taught Carson and others math, history, business
law and geography.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent 18 years at Omaha North High School before retiring.
Russell L. Wenkstern

<P>
	   SPRING PARK, Minn. (AP) -- Russell L. Wenkstern, the former chief executive
of Tonka Toys who helped develop the popular yellow Mighty Dump truck, died
Tuesday. He was 87.

company's annual sales from $400,000 to $80 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1952, he became secretary of the board and production manager for Mound
Metal Craft, which later became Tonka Toys. Nine years later, Wenkstern moved
into the top position at Minnesota-based Tonka.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Wenkstern was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> Key Facts About Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Key facts about Ecuador, where the armed forces demanded President Jamil
Mahuad's resignation Friday after Indian protesters and some military officers
stormed the Congress building and declared a new government
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   LAND: Located at the equator and wedged between Colombia and Peru on the
northwest shoulder of South America. Roughly the size of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   PEOPLE: Most of the 12 million inhabitants are of mixed native Indian and
Spanish heritage. The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador has
gained considerable political power over the past decade. In 1990, in what the
Indians called an ``indigenous uprising,'' hundreds of thousands of Indians from
remote hamlets in the Andean highlands and the Amazon jungle barricaded highways
for days to demand government services.
</P>
<P>
	   OFFICIAL LANGUAGE: Spanish, although Quichua is the first language of most
of the nation's 4 million Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   RELIGION: Mainly Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   HISTORY: Mahuad assumed office in August 1998, taking over from Fabian
Alarcon. He is Ecuador's sixth president since 1996 and the ninth since
democratic elections were re-established. The last military coup in Ecuador
occurred in 1972, and military rule followed until 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   POLITICS: Mahuad's government has been mired in savage political infighting
since he took office. Demonstrations by students, transportation workers and
rural Indian groups to protest Mahuad's economic policies often have turned
violent.
</P>
<P>
	   ECONOMY: Ecuador has been struggling with its worst economic crisis since
the Great Depression, brought on by $2.6 billion in damage caused by El
Nino-generated flooding in 1997-1998 and the collapse in the price of oil,
Ecuador's main export, in 1998. Inflation last year topped 60 percent, the
highest in Latin America, and the economy shrank 7.5 percent. Only one in three
people in the workforce has a full-time job. Seven million Ecuadoreans live in
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Ex Disney Exec Cleared of Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed a child pornography charge
against a former Disney Internet executive Friday, ruling jurors may have relied
on a law ruled unconstitutional the day after his conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick J. Naughton of Seattle, a former executive with the Disney Go
Network, still faces a March 21 retrial on two previously dismissed charges:
seeking sex with a minor over the Internet and interstate travel to have sex
with a minor. The jury was unable to reach a verdicts on those charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also plan to retry the dismissed pornography conviction,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Donahue said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Naughton was convicted on the pornography count Dec. 16. The next day, a
federal appeals court ruled in another case that it was a violation of free
speech to ban ``cyber porn,'' images of children generated by computer that
don't use minors.
</P>
<P>
	   Naughton, who co-wrote the Java computer language, also wrote programs for
the Go Network designed to screen out foul language and pornographic images.
</P>
<P>
	   He was fired after he was arrested in September at the Santa Monica Pier,
where he allegedly arranged to meet a 13-year-old girl he met in an Internet
chat room. The teen-ager turned out to be an undercover police officer. At
trial, Naughton testified that he thought he was corresponding with a woman
posing as a juvenile as part of a sexual fantasy.
</P>
<P>
	   After the judge dismissed the pornography charge Friday, Naughton's
attorney, Donald Marks, said: ``We are very grateful, very happy and very
relieved.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Ease Up on Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore eased up on rival Bill
Bradley Friday. Gone was the fiery rhetoric about ``shredding the social safety
net,'' replaced by a concession that Bradley's health plan is based on ``a
respectable theory not to be dismissed out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I do dismiss it,'' Gore added, apparently unable to pull every
punch as his aides had advised on a day of fresh questions about Bradley's heart
condition.

<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore campaigned at full speed all around the snow-crusted
state. ``There are three days left and we have a lot of work to do. We have some
unfinished business,'' Bradley told about 100 cheering backers in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, on a Perry farm, looked ahead to another daybreak-to-midnight schedule
and said he felt ``like a guy working with every ounce of breath I have to get
one more vote than the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before a rowdy college crowd of about 1,000 packing Iowa State University's
Great Hall, Gore finished the day by biting into the full slate of Republican
presidential candidates for opposing affirmative action and for not opposing the
flying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're fearful that those among their constituents will turn away from
them unless they humor the bigotry,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, he tried to raise the stakes of Monday's Iowa caucus for Bradley,
saying the former New Jersey senator has ``bet everything on this and New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, reporters asked Gore during a Des Moines hospital tour whether he
was worried about Bradley after Thursday's disclosure that his rival had had
four recent episodes of an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My understanding is that it's nothing serious,'' Gore said as he knelt
with Mercy Medical Center asthma patient Shelby Claflin, 2, and her twin stuffed
bunnies. To WHO-TV, Gore said Bradley ``is in great health. It shouldn't be an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Peppered with reporters' questions himself, Bradley said, ``No I'm not
worried about it. This is a common condition, millions of Americans have it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He speculated the problem might be due to elevated caffeine consumption
after he switched soft drinks to cream soda. ``I have curtailed all of my cream
soda,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he should have mentioned the heartbeat episodes earlier, he said
no.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a factor in the campaign or in conduct in office,'' he said.
``If I'm sick at my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick at my stomach?''
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, the Bradley campaign issued a statement by one of his
cardiologists who said it was natural for him to experience sporadic increases
in irregular heartbeat episodes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He only notes irregularity of the pulse and has no other symptoms,'' said
the statement by Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel. `And the rhythm spontaneously
reverts to regular. He has been advised to continue all normal activity without
limitations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, on the campaign trail, said he was taking energy from the crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This room has a certain feel about it,'' Bradley said. ``This campaign is
based on the radical premise that you can go out and tell people what you
believe and you can win. If you lead, you have to lay out something specific.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking to maintain momentum, Gore released two new television ads and a
pair of radio spots Friday. The TV ads mention a panoply of issues -- Medicare,
Medicaid, education, the environment. One makes a backhand swipe at Bradley,
whose campaign has focused on a few important ideas. ``I wouldn't just pay
attention to one or two things,'' Gore says in his new ad.
</P>
<P>
	   On radio ad features Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin saying Gore was there for the
state when it needed him and a second has Robert Kennedy Jr. touting Gore's
commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Des Moines, Gore and Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is popular among Iowa
Democrats, jointly showcased the vice president's health care proposal in a
noontime forum with hospital workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Health reform -- with Bradley proposing universal access to health
insurance, and Gore pushing a more limited approach -- has been at the red-hot
center of their rival campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   On Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid, the government health program for the
poor, Gore dropped all previous talk of Bradley vouchers and caps -- distortions
that had gotten under his rival's skin for months -- and called it a
``mainstreaming proposal'' offering subsidies for the purchase of health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's soft-mitten touch was notable because just the night before he tried
to stir Iowa opposition against Bradley for calling the precinct caucuses an
exercise that favors Gore's ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is sensitive about not appearing to pile on Bradley or exploit
questions about his minor heart condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore warmed up again to the political fight as the day wore on, telling a
standing-room-only crowd at the Boone Elks Lodge, ``Sen. Bradley is a good man
with a bad plan'' for Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Bradley and Gore are trying to make sure their supporters turn out at
the caucuses. After his evening speech, Gore asked people to linger at the Elks
Lodge. ``If you have to leave, I'll understand, but I'd like to greet you
personally and personally ask for your support.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley asked 100 people at a breakfast rally in Burlington to gather up
friends. ``Nobody knows who's going to show up in the Iowa caucuses Monday
night. If you can call 10 people, we can do better than people expect.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley soften criticism, play down heart concern  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Vice President Al Gore eased up on rival Bill
Bradley Friday. Gone was the fiery rhetoric about "shredding the social safety
net," replaced by a concession that Bradley's health plan is based on "a
respectable theory not to be dismissed out of hand."

<HEADLINE> Bank Chiefs Gather for G7 Meeting  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIC TALMADGE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world's
leading industrial nations gathered Saturday to discuss issues expected to
include curbing the yen's strength and Japan's efforts to keep the country's
economy growing.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to the meeting which began Saturday afternoon, Japanese officials
stressed their concern over the yen. It has risen 10 percent against the U.S.
dollar, to around 105 yen per dollar, over the past year. Officials here are
worried that the yen's rise will smother the country's nascent economic recovery
by hurting its mainstay export industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo, however, has had some difficulty generating much concern over the yen
among the other leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Some market watchers expect G7 leaders to say they share Japan's concern
while stopping short of a commitment to intervention. That language would be
similar to what the officials said when they last gathered in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The strength of the yen was not among the topics raised Friday, when Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi had a brief meeting here with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers. Instead, Summers urged Tokyo to continue efforts to deregulate
the Japanese economy, including the telecommunications sector, to attract
foreign investment and stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Friction between the two countries has been mounting recently over the issue
of access to Japan's telecommunications market. The market is dominated by
Nippon Telephone and Telephone Corp., a former state monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   On another issue, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is expected to
give a short overview of economic conditions in his country toward the end of
Saturday's G7 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials say it is unlikely the meeting will take up who should succeed
Michel Camdessus as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
Summers and Japanese officials have acknowledged the issue will be raised during
bilateral meetings and in the corridors of the G7 gathering, but they say it
will not be an official topic and will not likely be resolved.

it's polluting the water. A suspected animal carcinogen with unknown health
effects on humans, MTBE has become the curse of water officials from California
to New England. Leaking from gas stations' underground fuel tanks, it has forced
wells to close and run up millions of dollars in cleanup costs. "It's a
diabolical chemical. It moves up, it moves down, it moves everywhere. Our
feeling is that as long as MTBE is in gasoline, our groundwater is in jeopardy,"

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Rebellion Denounced  </HEADLINE>
   By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meeting in emerging session, the 34-nation Organization
of American States Friday night unanimously condemned a military-backed
rebellion against Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   In their resolution the OAS representatives, meeting at Ecuador's request,
expressed ``full and firm'' support for Mahaud and warned there would be ``grave
consequences in any attempt to destabilize the democratic system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The consequences could include suspension of bilateral aid from the United
States and other governments, a halt to loans from international lending
institutions such as the World Bank and expulsion from the OAS.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Luis J. Lauredo said private investors would boycott
Ecuador, fearing contracts would not be honored, if there was no constitutional
government, and this would reduce jobs available to Ecuadorian citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   He said shippers would steer clear of an unstable government, making trade
more difficult and touching off a wave of price increases for food and other
goods that would hit the poor hardest.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauredo said a meeting to be held in Paris next week to pledge $1 billion to
help Ecuador's crippled economy already had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call on all Ecuadorians to use debate within their assembly as a means
to express opinion instead of threatening unconstitutional moves against an
elected government,'' Lauredo said.
</P>
<P>
	   OAS ambassadors heard an impassioned plea from Ecuador's representative,
Patricio Vivanco, ``to help save democracy in my country, which is in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS ``must face up to its obligations to provide support for democracy
in this hemisphere. I hope my country will not be forced to leave'' the OAS,
Vivanco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates from Argentina, Mexico and other countries said stronger action
than the resolution condemning the rebellion may be needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The council decided to closely monitor developments before deciding to call
a meeting of OAS foreign ministers to decide what the next steps should be.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Damage Estimated at $10B  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela needs between $10 billion and $30
billion to repair the damage from December's massive floods and landslides, and
much of the money will have to come from other countries, a top official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The figures are astronomic because a substantial part of the national
infrastructure has been destroyed,'' Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Valero's statement is the first official estimate of the damage since
avalanches of mud, water and boulders came crashing down the mountain that
separates the capital, Caracas, from the Caribbean Sea on Dec. 15. Much of the
Caribbean coastline north of Caracas was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists had estimated the damage at up to $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Valero said a meeting will be held Feb. 21 in Madrid to discuss additional
financing to rebuild areas hit by the disaster. At the meeting, the Venezuelan
government will present a master plan to reconstruct the affected areas, he
said. He said members of the European community, the United Nations and
multilateral organizations will attend.
</P>
<P>
	   The landslides killed between 5,000 and 30,000 people and left another
100,000 homeless. In addition to the foreign aid requests, Venezuela is
considering issuing debt to pay for new housing and agricultural aid, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a recent surge in the price of oil, Venezuela's main export product,
the economy remains in recession. It shrank 7.2 percent in 1999.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Roman Turek stopped 11 shots for his fourth shutout of the
season as the St. Louis Blues beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-0 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Reirden, Pavol Demitra and Mike Eastwood scored goals to help St.
Louis, the NHL's top defensive team, move past Detroit for first place in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blackhawks tied a team record for fewest shots in a game, set April 18,
1998, in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues, who launched 37 shots on Jocelyn Thibault, narrowly missed
setting a team record for fewest shots allowed. The record is nine, set March 4,
1999, against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Reirden opened the scoring at 3:15 of the first period, the defenseman's
second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis outshot Chicago 13-3 in the first period, with the Blackhawks
failing to a shot in the first 13:24.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues outshot the Blackhawks 11-3 in the scoreless second period. St.
Louis' Pierre Turgeon fooled Thibault at 9:00, but the shot bounced off the
post.
</P>
<P>
	   Demitra made it 2-0 with 4:23 left in the third when his shot from the side
of the net banked in off Thibault's pad. Eastwood completed the scoring with a
short-handed empty-net goal with 8.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the Blackhawks best scoring chances -- and seventh shot -- came six
minutes into the third period when Turek stopped Doug Gilmour on a 3-on-2 break.
Turek also was forced to make glove saves on Tony Amonte and Doug Gilmour later
in the period.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes-Flyers Mull Primeau Trade  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Trade talks began Friday that could send disgruntled
Keith Primeau of the Carolina Hurricanes to the Philadelphia Flyers for Rod
Brind'Amour, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Primeau, the former captain of the Hurricanes and a restricted free agent,
has missed the team's first 47 games of the season because of a contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   Primeau, an All-Star center last season, has turned down various contract
offers from Carolina since becoming a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
	   It is believed to be the fourth time the Hurricanes have tried to deal
Primeau, the team's leading scorer last season who has said he will never play
for Carolina again.
</P>
<P>
	   Brind'Amour, an 11-year NHL veteran, had played in 484 straight games before
missing the first 34 games this season with a broken left foot. Since returning
to the lineup, the 6-foot-1, 200-pound center has eight points in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said talks would likely
resume Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Primeau is a restricted free agent, he would have to be signed by
the Hurricanes and then traded. Apparently the negotiations got close at one
point, but the two teams and Primeau could not agree on contract terms by late
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Primeau had been seeking about $4.5 million a season from the Hurricanes. He
made $2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Don and Todd Reynolds, Primeau's co-agents, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolina officials also had no comment on the trade talks.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Supreme Court abortion ruling 'usurped legislatures'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLFAX, Iowa (AP) - Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
said Friday "it should be up to each state legislature" to decide what limits to
place on abortions, adding that the Supreme Court erred by issuing a ruling on
the issue 27 years ago.
<P>
	   But Bush, an anti-abortion two-term Texas governor, did not directly call
for the outright repeal of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortions, and his comments, in the closing days of the Iowa caucus campaign,
drew a taunting reply from GOP rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Come on, even if people disagree with you, they'll respect you for having a
firm stand and believing in principle," Forbes said. "But he ducked it."
</P>
<P>
	   The volatile issue has flared in recent days, as anti-abortion forces gird
for their annual march in Washington on the anniversary of the Court's ruling,
and as Iowa prepares to inaugurate the 2000 presidential campaign with its
kickoff caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is campaigning as a compassionate conservative, opposes abortion
except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is at stake.
But he doesn't emphasize the issue. Forbes does, and hopes to parlay his stand
into a second-place finish in next Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Fielding questions on abortion for the second day, Bush was asked to clarify
his statement Thursday that the 1973 decision legalizing abortion "was a
stretch." The Texas governor and GOP presidential front-runner replied: "I felt
like it was a case where the court took the place of what the legislatures
should do in America."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked further what he thought the state legislatures should do, Bush said,
"It should be up to each legislature."
</P>
<P>
	   His answer remained basically the same each time Bush was asked if he though
Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. "This is a case where the court stepped
across its bounds and usurped the right of the legislatures."
</P>
<P>
	   Aides later said Bush believes states should have the right to impose strict
anti-abortion laws, as they could before Roe vs. Wade. Here in Iowa, Roe vs.
Wade overturned just such a law.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush's remarks were consistent with his
longstated view that the Supreme Court should strictly interpret the
Constitution in all cases including abortion, and that such issues should be
left to state legislatures and Congress to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ultimate goal is a constitutional amendment banning abortion - except
in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life - which state
legislatures as well as Congress would have to approve. Bush has said the
country is not ready to pass such a sweeping amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a critical issue in the caucuses in Iowa where social
conservatives will make up a large chunk of the vote Monday night. One in 10
Republican likely to attend the caucuses say a candidates' "pro-life" views are
most important.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking a politically safe way to couch his views, Bush has settled on
criticizing the Supreme Court ruling without directly saying that Roe vs. Wade
should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   His challenge is to appease conservatives in the primary campaign without
alienating swing voters before the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got some unexpected support from rival John McCain. The Arizona senator
said he opposes abortion but would accept it in cases of rape, incest or where
the mother's life is in danger. Bush holds the same view.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe that Roe v. Wade was a flawed decision, yes, and overreached and
that's why I think it should be repealed," McCain said in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   With the first voting of the 2000 election set to begin Monday, Bush and his
rivals are crisscrossing Iowa in search of votes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got a good chance, but people should not be complacent," Bush said as
he strolled down the street in Grinnell. "That's why I'm working so hard right
now, to make sure people hear the call."
</P>
<P>
	   In other campaign developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
	   -Bush toured the Teen Challenge of the Midlands in Colfax, a center
sponsored by religious groups that provides alcohol and drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing three men talk about their efforts to overcome their problems,
Bush stood before the entire group and said: "I used to drink too much. I quit
drinking, and I believe it was because (the Rev.) Billy Graham planted a seed in
my heart. ... I want you to know that your life's walk is shared by a lot of
other people - even some who wear suits."
</P>
<P>
	   -The 30-member Republican Governors Association endorsed Bush's tax-cut
plan. The same group recently endorsed Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   -New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg began appearing in an ad praising Bush's tax
plan. Gregg said: "Now some say Bush's plan to cut taxes is too much. They
believe if you leave money in Washington, it will not be spent. We know better."

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Rebellion Denounced  </HEADLINE>
   By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meeting in emerging session, the 34-nation Organization
of American States Friday night unanimously condemned a military-backed
rebellion against Ecuador's President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   In their resolution the OAS representatives, meeting at Ecuador's request,
expressed ``full and firm'' support for Mahaud and warned there would be ``grave
consequences in any attempt to destabilize the democratic system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The consequences could include suspension of bilateral aid from the United
States and other governments, a halt to loans from international lending
institutions such as the World Bank and expulsion from the OAS.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Luis J. Lauredo said private investors would boycott
Ecuador, fearing contracts would not be honored, if there was no constitutional
government, and this would reduce jobs available to Ecuadorian citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   He said shippers would steer clear of an unstable government, making trade
more difficult and touching off a wave of price increases for food and other
goods that would hit the poor hardest.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauredo said a meeting to be held in Paris next week to pledge $1 billion to
help Ecuador's crippled economy already had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call on all Ecuadorians to use debate within their assembly as a means
to express opinion instead of threatening unconstitutional moves against an
elected government,'' Lauredo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department issued a statement Friday calling the actions of those
occupying the National Congress of Ecuador ``unacceptable and contrary to the
firm and united position of OAS member nations against unconstitutional changes
of government.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement also said the people of Ecuador and the international
community expect the armed forces and police to maintain order and defend the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   While the State Department said they had no reports of Americans being
affected, they did warn U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Ecuador to avoid
protest areas and to consider leaving if the situation deteriorates.
</P>
<P>
	   At the OAS meeting, the ambassadors heard an impassioned plea from Ecuador's
representative, Patricio Vivanco, ``to help save democracy in my country, which
is in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS ``must face up to its obligations to provide support for democracy
in this hemisphere. I hope my country will not be forced to leave'' the OAS,
Vivanco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates from Argentina, Mexico and other countries said stronger action
than the resolution condemning the rebellion may be needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The council decided to closely monitor developments before deciding to call
a meeting of OAS foreign ministers to decide what the next steps should be.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Abandons Palace  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of protesters surrounded Ecuador's national
palace on Friday night, hours after a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the
military forced Ecuador's unpopular president to flee.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the
palace where he worked and lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from
the military high command to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some by waving the red
flag of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   The military high command was meeting at the national palace with a
three-man governing council named by Indian protesters, apparently to determine
the final makeup of the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   The gathering at the place followed a day of political chaos, with Indians
demanding Mahuad's resignation and forcing their way into Congress and the
Supreme Court. After first backing Mahuad, the military later in the day decided
to support the protest, saying it was the only way to prevent ``a social
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad refused to step down, saying during a nationwide television broadcast
that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it by force. Late
Friday, Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said in a television interview that
``the president has no intention of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian uprising.
Last year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only
one in three in the labor force has full-time work. A vast majority of the
nation's 4 million Indians live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Ecuador's ambassador, Patricio Vivanco, said Mahuad had abandoned
the presidential palace in Quito and taken refuge at a military base in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the attempt to overthrow
the government and expressed full support for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   South American leaders also lined up in support of Mahuad, issuing
statements condemning attempts to oust him. A statement issued by the U.S.
Embassy in Lima, Peru, urged Ecuador's armed forces and police to uphold Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever regime arises from this unconstitutional process will confront
political and economic isolation, bringing more misery to the Ecuadorean
people,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Quito, guards stepped aside when hundreds of Indians
accompanied by an unknown number of military officers stormed an empty Congress
building, seized the podium and announced that they had created their own
``Parliament of the People.'' Military leaders said 120 officers were involved
in the rebellion, along with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito during the day was in chaos -- with Indians armed with
rocks and clubs paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the
country and much of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention
of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said his nationwide
television broadcast, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers.
</P>
<P>
	   With no real agreement between the military and the Indian confederation,
which claims to represent Ecuador's Indians, it was unclear who would take power
even if Mahuad agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions by the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed and eight were wounded by gunfire during protests and
looting in Quito, Guayaquil, and two smaller cities, the Red Cross said. The two
men who were killed were shot by merchants while allegedly looting a public
market in Portoviejo.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group
of leftist-led unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations
seized the provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation, bring down interest rates to U.S. levels
and spur investment to end the country's deep recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of Ecuador's Indians live in the Andean highlands and
speak Quichua, a dialect of the language spoken by the Incas.

<HEADLINE> Two Arrested in Bishop Death  </HEADLINE>
   By ALFONSO ANZUETO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A Guatemalan army captain and his father were
arrested Friday for the 1998 slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop whose office had
issued a human rights report critical of the military.
</P>
<P>
	   National Civil Police arrested Capt. Byron Lima Oliva and his father,
retired Col. Disrael Lima Estrada, and took them under heavy guard to a
Guatemala City prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Gerson Lopez said police also re-arrested a church cook,
Margarita Lopez, who had been jailed by investigators for five days in July
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Lima and his father are accused of killing Bishop Juan Gerardi. Lopez was
re-arrested as part of the investigation, but it was unclear what charges she
might face.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, 1998, two days
after he presented a report blaming the military and pro-government death squads
for most of the deaths during Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   The case drew international attention as the first slaying of a religious
figure and political activist since the government and leftist guerrillas signed
peace accords two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's arrests come one week after President Alfonso Portillo took office.
Portillo, a former Marxist scholar with ties to a right-wing former dictator,
had promised to resolve the Gerardi slaying. The Human Rights Office of the
Archbishop, formerly led by Gerardi, had given him six months to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the church's human rights office long have accused army
officers of involvement in the killing. They say a car seen near the crime scene
was linked to the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators, however, initially insisted Gerardi was killed by a fellow
priest, the Rev. Mario Orantes. Orantes spent seven months in jail but was
released after church leaders and observers protested that investigators had
overlooked possible military involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether authorities would seek to arrest Orantes again.
Orantes' lawyer, Jose Toledo, said armed police visited the priest's mother
Friday at her home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They wanted to talk with him but didn't explain the reason for the visit
or show any type of judicial order,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Orantes fled Guatemala in October after Toledo said he had received
threatening calls. The lawyer declined to say whether the priest had returned to
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Father Orantes was already investigated,'' Toledo said. He said that to
re-arrest him would be ``unjust.''

<HEADLINE> Bishops Urge Gradual Change in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Celebrating the second anniversary of Pope John Paul II's
visit to Cuba, the island's Roman Catholic bishops on Friday called for
spiritual and social renewal, discouraged emigration and urged peaceful, gradual
change on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   The 13-page document, ``A New Heaven and a New Earth,'' reviewed papal
teachings during John Paul's historic 1998 visit. It avoided blunt language in
most of its criticisms both of Cuban society and the country's critics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Moderation, dialogue and gradualness are the guarantee of peaceful
solutions and the gestation of a new civilization of truth, justice and love,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the document referred to several areas of continuing disagreement
between the Cuban state and church, calling for officials to permit greater
ideological diversity in this one-party state and urging greater freedom for the
church to distribute charity and take part in education.
</P>
<P>
	   The message exhorted Catholics to openly profess and practice their faith,
partly by taking part in open-air masses and other religious celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Such events have been allowed on a limited basis for the last several years.
The change was partly a product of the papal visit and partly of greater
official acceptance of religion after 1991, when the fall of the Soviet Union
led Cuba to rethink its ideology and cast aside officially mandated atheism.
</P>
<P>
	   The bishops' message discouraged emigration from Cuba as a solution for
Cubans of faith.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In leaving the country behind there is little we can do to solve its
problems. We believe that within our island it is possible to find solutions,''
the document said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also repeated the pope's criticism of the U.S. economic embargo,
referring to ``restrictive economic measures imposed from outside the country''
and calling them ``unjust and ethically unacceptable.''

<HEADLINE> New Orleans TV Reporter Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A longtime television reporter who frequently covers
crime was arrested Friday after authorities seized videotapes allegedly showing
him having sex with more than 20 boys and young men.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Longman, a reporter for WVUE-TV, was also seen using what detectives
believe were illegal drugs on the videotapes, said Police Chief Richard
Pennington. He said drug paraphernalia confiscated from Longman's house tested
positive for cocaine residue.
</P>
<P>
	   Longman, 43, in a brief press conference at his lawyer's office before he
surrendered to police, said he will plead innocent when he is arraigned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never knowingly harmed or hurt anyone,'' Longman said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on the accusations but said he had taken a leave of
absence from his job and would enter a treatment program for alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Longman was released on $20,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
	   He was charged with aggravated crime against nature, carnal knowledge of a
juvenile, contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile, possession of drug
paraphernalia and possession of cocaine residue. The sex-related charges carry
maximum penalties that range from 10 years in prison to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation began Jan. 3 after the director of a New Orleans group
home for abused teen-agers told police that a 15-year-old resident said he had
had sex with Longman.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Keith Esparros, WVUE vice president of news, praised Longman
as a talented journalist. But, he added, ``As a citizen of New Orleans and
especially as a parent, I understand how reprehensible and repugnant these
charges are.''

<HEADLINE> Student To Be Cited for Swim Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Va. (AP) -- A college student deliberately drove her car into a
campus security office and pulled a knife on a resident adviser, who wrestled
the knife from her, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Renee Swann, 21, was charged with felony property damage and wreckless
driving after crashing into the security office at Virginia Intermont College.
She is being evaluated at a psychiatric hospital, Bristol Police Sgt. Wayne
Thurston said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses told police that Ms. Swann was sitting in her car laughing and
gunning the engine before the crash Thursday evening, Thurston said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Swann told police during questioning that she had taken an overdose of
tranquilizers and aspirin, Thurston said. Her stomach was pumped at Bristol
Regional Medical Center and she was transferred voluntarily to Woodridge
Hospital in Johnson City, Tenn., for evaluation, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thurston said she was angry because her boyfriend was in trouble with campus
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Swann, who was to graduate in May, has been expelled, college
spokeswoman Laura Mondul said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Orders Protection for Reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's government granted protection Friday to a Colombian
journalist who fled his country after receiving death threats for his coverage
of the Colombian civil war, a press watchdog group said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Pulgarin left Colombia on Dec. 8 and sought refuge with the help of
the Institute of Press and Society of Peru. But soon after his arrival in Lima,
Pulgarin started receiving death threats on an answering machine at the
institute's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, the government is ``actively assuming guarantees for his
personal protection,'' said Jorge Salazar, the institute's director.
</P>
<P>
	   Salazar said the government protection was granted after meetings with
government officials, Peru's human rights ombudsman and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pulgarin was based deep in paramilitary-controlled territory in Colombia's
northwestern city of Monteria. He began receiving death threats last June after
writing about bungled military operations and the killing of indigenous people
by paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The threats continued even after he moved to another city.

<HEADLINE> Suns 101, Nuggets 99  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Jason Kidd scored 12 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter
and the Phoenix Suns handed the Denver Nuggets their sixth straight loss, 101-99
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd and Cliff Robinson, who also had 24 points, hit key shots down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta added 21 points and 15 rebounds for Phoenix, and Kidd had 12
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver was led by Antonio McDyess with 26 points and Raef LaFrentz with 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-rested Suns, who hadn't played since beating the Nuggets 113-100 in
Phoenix on Sunday, led 93-86 with 4:05 left after Robinson's 3-pointer and
Kidd's layup.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver's Bryant Stith countered with a 3-point basket and a layup, cutting
the deficit to 93-91.
</P>
<P>
	   After a second critical offensive foul against McDyess, Kidd bowled over
Nick Van Exel on a drive to the baseline and hit a 15-footer with 57 seconds to
go.
</P>
<P>
	   After one free throw by McDyess, Robinson hit a 17-footer from the corner
for a 97-92 lead with 28 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz had a 3-pointer and George McCloud three free throws, but Kidd was
4-for-4 from the line in the last 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns hit 21 of 22 free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson had nine points in the first quarter, helping fuel a 12-1 run that
gave the Suns a 21-12 lead. Denver committed nine turnovers compared to
Phoenix's two, but the Nuggets managed to trim the deficit to 27-21 at the end
of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz then scored 14 points in the second quarter, including 12 in a row,
and the Nuggets' 21-7 flurry produced a 42-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix answered with its own 11-2 spurt, capped by Kidd's layup, for a
45-44 lead with 3:22 left in the half. But 3-pointers by McCloud and Van Exel
helped give Denver a 57-53 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta had eight points and six rebounds in the third quarter, when the
Suns used a 10-0 run to help forge an 80-75 lead entering the final period.

Ecuador President Forced To Flee

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- President Jamil Mahuad was forced by protesters to
flee his palace Friday, though he insisted that he is not resigning. Thousands
of protesters surrounded Ecuador's national palace on Friday night, hours after
a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the military forced out the unpopular
president. At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Ecuador's ambassador said Mahuad had taken refuge at a military base
in Quito. The OAS unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the attempt to
overthrow the government and expressed full support for Mahuad.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela needs between $10 billion and $30
billion to repair the damage from December's massive floods and landslides, and
much of the money will have to come from other countries, a top official said
Friday. "The figures are astronomic because a substantial part of the national
infrastructure has been destroyed," Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero told
reporters. Valero's statement is the first official estimate of the damage since
avalanches of mud, water and boulders came crashing down the mountain that
separates the capital, Caracas, from the Caribbean Sea on Dec. 15.

until Monday to respond, after which British Home Secretary Jack Straw will make
his decision "as soon as possible," a Home Office spokeswoman said Friday. The
new request is the latest development in the case of Pinochet, 84, who has spent
15 months under detention in Britain. He is fighting a Spanish judge's efforts
to extradite him to Madrid to face charges of the systematic torture of
political opponents throughout his 1973-90 dictatorship.

Ex Disney Exec Cleared of Charges

Naughton, a former executive with the Disney Go Network, was convicted on the
pornography count Dec. 16. The next day, a federal appeals court ruled in
another case that it was a violation of free speech to ban "cyber porn," images
of children generated by computer that don't use minors. Naughton still faces a
March 21 retrial on two previously dismissed charges: seeking sex with a minor
over the Internet and interstate travel to have sex with a minor.

<HEADLINE> Heat 101, Hawks 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- Tim Hardaway couldn't wait to return and Jamal Mashburn just
wanted to stay.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardaway returned to the lineup after missing 26 games, but it was Mashburn,
the subject of trade talks, who keyed Miami's 101-79 victory over the slumping
Atlanta Hawks on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn, playing in his first game since learning he was nearly dealt to
Philadelphia, scored 28 points. Hardaway scored just two points on 1-of-6
shooting but dished out 11 assists in 26 minutes. It was his first game since
injuring his right knee Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew Mash would rise to the occasion," said Hardaway, who had no
turnovers. "He's like I am. He likes a little confusion, controversy out there
on the basketball court. Coach told us he's not making the move and he'll stick
with us. Mash showed us he wants to stay."
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning added 20 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mash had a sensational game," Mourning said. "He was able to block out all
the negativity floating in the air and play his game."
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta, 3-16 on the road, has lost 10 of its last 12 games, including four
straight, and eight in a row to the Heat in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami outscored the Hawks 62-37 in the second half as cold-shooting Atlanta
made just 13 of 43 attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't go on playing this way and if our play doesn't change, then we
will have to do something," Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens said. "Either change the
lineup or move somebody."
</P>
<P>
	   Heat coach Pat Riley expressed similar thoughts after Miami's dismal home
loss to Chicago on Tuesday. He praised Mashburn's ability to block out the
week's distractions, including a proposed trade that had him going to
Philadelphia for Larry Hughes, Billy Owens, Bruce Bowen and Nazr Mohammed.
Mashburn shot 10-of-19.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a professional; this is a profession," Riley said. "That's exactly how
he handled that and I'm proud of it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Jackson paced the Hawks with 18 points. Dikembe Mutombo, the NBA's
field-goal percentage leader, shot just 1-of-11 from the field for six points
with 20 rebounds. Isaiah Rider, who had been averaging 23 points, had just 12 on
6-of-22 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn scored seven points in Miami's 16-6 run to start the fourth
quarter, boosting the Heat's 67-58 lead to 83-64 with seven minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I get between those lines it's all mental," Mashburn said. "I just go
out and play basketball."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hawks missed their first seven shots of the third quarter and went
5-of-20 in the period to help Miami turn a 42-39 halftime deficit into a
nine-point lead heading into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   After missing his first five shots, Hardaway hit a running bank shot at
10:09 of the third quarter. He then fed Mashburn for a fast-break layup to key
an 8-0 burst and a 51-44 Heat lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first brought the ball up I had the jitters," Hardaway said. "After
that I was happy to be out there, feeling my oats."
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn hit back-to-back jumpers to boost Miami's lead to 60-50. After
LaPhonso Ellis hit two straight jumpers, Anthony Carter hit a 20-footer and a
hard-driving layup to give Miami a 67-58 lead after three.
