GDP Is Growing at 5.4 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew robustly as the country's total
output of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the January-March quarter, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But that sparked fresh inflation worries among
economists and investors. Workers enjoyed the biggest jump in wages and benefits
in 10 years. Consumer spending led the way by posting its largest increase in
nearly 17 years. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose sharply, reflecting
higher energy prices.

Giuliani: Cancer May Affect Senate Run
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Appearing upbeat and energetic at a City Hall news
conference, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani disclosed Thursday that he has prostate
cancer. While the disease was caught early, it could spell the end of his Senate
run against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Giuliani, 55, confirmed speculation that
started Wednesday evening when he was seen entering a hospital and leaving three
hours later. The Republican mayor said he would continue his Senate run for now
but would make a more definitive statement in two to three weeks after he
decides on a course of treatment.

Miami Mayor Fires City Manager
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Mayor Joe Carollo fired the city manager Thursday, just
days after he demanded the firing of the police chief for not warning him about
the raid to seize Elian Gonzalez. Carollo had asked City Manager Donald Warshaw
to fire Police Chief William O'Brien, saying he ''lost all confidence'' in the
chief for not telling him that federal agents were about to raid the Gonzalez
household early Saturday. Warshaw refused. Carollo insisted today that Warshaw's
firing had nothing to do with ''little Elian.'' Carollo said Warshaw has been
badmouthing him to his colleagues and trying to turn department heads against
him. The seizure of the 6-year-old Cuban refugee has plunged City Hall into
political turmoil.

Three More Papers Shut in Iran
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners shut down three more newspapers
Thursday, including one owned by reformist President Mohammad Khatami's brother,
pressing their campaign against publications that have fueled public support for
reform. About 200 students demonstrated against the closures at the Shahid
Beheshti University in northern Tehran in the early hours of Friday, said an
Iranian journalist. The media closures, now numbering 16, are hampering
Khatami's allies' political ambitions. Only one reformist paper remained
publishing Thursday as campaigning started for the May 5 run-off elections,
which will decide 66 seats in the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis.

U.S. To Have Terrorism Field Test
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Next month, Cabinet secretaries, top state and local
officials and emergency units from Denver and Portsmouth, N.H., will conduct the
largest-ever field test of the nation's ability to respond to a terrorist attack
with chemical or biological weapons. Driven by recent violent attacks here and
abroad, Congress ordered the test and appropriated $3.5 million last year to pay
for it. The test will take place during 10 days in May, federal officials
announced today. U.S. officials have concluded it only a matter of when -- not
whether -- some terrorist will use a weapon of mass destruction on a domestic
target.

Feinstein of California and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend were the
top Democrats in a poll measuring public interest in a female vice president.
The poll was conducted by the White House Project, a nonprofit group urging the

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Ray Allen and Sam Cassell scored 20 points apiece as
Milwaukee beat Indiana 104-91 Thursday night, the Bucks' first playoff victory
since 1990. The Bucks evened the best-of-five Eastern Conference series at one
game apiece, taking the home-court advantage away from the rattled Pacers as the
first-round series heads to Milwaukee for the next two games on Saturday and

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- While thousands of people formed a human chain
around the U.S. Capitol earlier this month in a loud appeal to
cancel debts owed by impoverished nations, some religious leaders
have quietly preached for decades against what they call ''economic
chains of slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Thomas Burns, a Maryknoll priest, traveled
from Lima, Peru, to Washington to urge members of Congress to
cancel the debts of poor countries, among other economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   He told of performing emergency baptisms on babies -- three a day
-- who were dying of dysentery while scarce resources were going to
debt payments, not health care.
</P>
<P>
   Back then it was lonely work. Today religious leaders as diverse
as Pope John Paul II, Bishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Billy Graham,
and the Rev. Pat Robertson support what Tutu calls ''a moral
crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen the religious community come around an issue
like this since the (anti-) apartheid movement,'' said Thomas Hart,
director of government relations for the Episcopal Church, a member
of the Jubilee 2000/USA campaign for debt reduction, a coalition of
religious and secular groups.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 of the poorest countries in Africa, Latin America,
and Asia, owe about $220 billion in debt to the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, regional development banks and donor
governments. In some cases, says Hart, debt payments consume 30
percent to 40 percent of countries' budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Jubilee 2000 campaign began in England in the late 1990s,
named after the biblical jubilee year when God called for the
freeing of slaves and canceling of debts. It soon spread to 60
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in June 1997, the Jubilee 2000/USA effort includes such
religious groups as the National Council of Churches, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, Catholic Relief Services and the Muslim
Public Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept of economic justice is a cornerstone of Islamic
social and political thought,'' says Salam Al-Marayati, director of
the Muslim Public Affairs Council. Debt cancellation is necessary,
he says, ''so future generations will not always be shackled in
economic enslavement by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000/USA organized the April 9 rally in Washington. The
group wants world leaders to cancel unpayable loans and ensure that
the freed resources are used to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been some success. Under a 1996 international
debt relief arrangement for Uganda, for example, annual debt
service payments were cut from $50 million from $150 million. The
government has used the savings to spend more on education and to
double enrollment in primary schools, monitoring groups say.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to offer $90 billion in debt relief to the world's
poorest nations was endorsed last June by the world's seven major
industrialized democracies at their annual economic summit and
adopted by the World Bank and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress for the U.S.
share, about $920 million over four years. Congress has authorized
$320 million and funded the first year's installment of $110
million. But that was to cover cancellation of bilateral loans,
those between the United States and another nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilee 2000 also wants cancellation of $600 million in
multilateral loans between impoverished countries and institutions
such as the Interamerican Development Bank. But Congress hasn't
approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Knippers, president of the Institute for Religion and
Democracy, finds some Jubilee supporters misguided, particularly
those who reject stringent lender-imposed economic reforms.
''There's quite a bit of naivete. You can't always assume that the
clergy or church leaders are trained economists.''
</P>
<P>
   But religious leaders say they have economists on their side,
including Jeffrey Sachs, director of Harvard's Center for
International Development. And they maintain that they're among the
most reliable sources because of their work in indebted countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guidance comes from the real human-face stories that
Maryknoll people from different countries send our way,'' says
Marie Dennis of the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns. ''We know
the impact of debt. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, you need economists. But economists who are disconnected
from impact of policies will never have the tools to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis sees real progress. ''Within the last six months, the
same institutions began to move from talking about how any debtor
country would pay off as much as it could ... to talking about
poverty reduction and the goal of debt cancellation. Whether they
do it is another challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jubilee 2000 campaign will meet next month to discuss how to
exert more pressure and to address questions such as how to hold
creditors and debtors responsible for loans lost to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Hart sees a growing consensus that unpayable debts should be
written off. ''The question is how and when.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, hopes Burns, the Maryknoll priest. Last September, he
happened to hear President Clinton on the BBC calling for debt
relief for the most impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that if Clinton did it there was going to be a domino
effect,'' says Burns, who still lives in the same Lima shantytown.
''I jumped up and started dancing.''

<HEADLINE> Group: Growth in campaign spending not due to cost rise  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Campaign spending is going through the roof
but it is not being driven by a corresponding increase in the cost
of mounting a big-time campaign, a group is contending.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fair Elections Project, which favors campaign
finance reform, said Thursday a study of George Pataki's campaigns
in 1994 and 1998 show that politicians are spending far more on
campaigns basically because they can raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   The group's co-chairman is Evan Davis, former counsel to
ex-Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Davis ran unsuccessfully
for state attorney general in 1998 in a campaign in which he
stressed the need for campaign reform in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A question raised in both New York and nationally by the
escalating costs of campaigns is whether they have occurred because
of a ''rise in campaign costs or simply an arms race by the
candidates,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This study, conducted in the largest media market in the
nation, provides a clear answer,'' Davis, a New York City lawyer,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spent $10.7 million to beat Cuomo in 1994 in a close
race, according to the New York Fair Elections Project study.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a weaker Democratic challenger in 1998 in New York City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Pataki spent $23.7 million, the New
York Fair Elections Project noted.
</P>
<P>
   The group created a special price index to measure increases in
the cost of goods and services that affect campaigns, things like
buying television time, print advertisements, travel, campaign
workers and consultant salaries plus inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1998, those factors went up by 27 percent, but
Pataki's overall campaign spending increased 121 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are decisive and clear,'' Lauren Stiroh, a
consultant for National Economic Research Associates of White
Plains, which conducted the research for the study. ''There is no
doubt in New York state the cost of campaigning does not explain
the rise in campaign spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, a close Pataki adviser who ran his 1998 campaign,
called the study ''bogus'' and an ''absolutely worthless piece of
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In both 1994 and 1998 Pataki was up against extremely
well-financed opponents and spent as much as necessary to ''get his
message out,'' Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot be outspent 10 to 1, 15 to 1,'' she said. ''You
have to match your opponents' spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Elections Project only counted money it said Pataki
spent on actual campaign expenses. In all, Pataki's election
committee reported spending $14.4 million in 1994 vs. $10.6 million
for Cuomo and $6.6 million for B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence
Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Vallone spent $6 million and Golisano $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Golisano did not garner much support among voters in
either 1994 or 1998, the presence in both races of the Rochester
millionaire influenced Pataki's political calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Spending his own money almost exclusively, Golisano raised the
monetary stakes in both campaigns, Mucha said. Pataki felt he had
to generate the funds necessary to respond to the attacks from
someone who could afford to spend ''an enormous amount of time and
effort'' to respond to attacks from Golisano, according to the
Pataki aide.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki camp was stung in particular in 1998 by Golisano's
incessant television advertisement attacks against the debt
policies of Pataki's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has often said he had to spend too much to become
governor, Mucha said, and he proposed a bill in 1999 to slash the
size of maximum campaign contributions and to ban the use of
''soft'' money in statewide campaigns. That proposal did not pass
in the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group said
he found it interesting that Pataki spent less than half as much
getting elected in 1994 in his tight race against the incumbent
Mario Cuomo than he did against weaker opposition in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a chicken-and-egg thing where he had a $25 million
war chest (in 1998) so he warded off any serious challenges. ...
You have to spend it somewhere,'' Horner said.

<HEADLINE> Sentencing for killer mom delayed, judge to consider abuse impact  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- LeRoy Leubner came to court wanting to see
his ex-wife sent to jail for burning down her house with the
couple's 13-year-old autistic son inside.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased, though, that Cayuga County Judge Peter Corning
instead adjourned the sentencing and agreed to hear evidence of
domestic abuse regarding Michelle Davis, who claims she killed her
son to stop him from raping and abusing her.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' attorney asked for the last-minute adjournment so Corning
could consider whether Davis was responsible for her actions
because of the alleged abuse she suffered. If Davis' case meets the
criteria under the state's domestic abuse laws, she could receive a
significantly lighter sentence, including immediate probation.
</P>
<P>
   Leubner said Davis made up the rape allegations to obtain
leniency. He said his son, although big at 5-foot-7, 155 pounds,
was not violent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny was convicted of a crime and has never had a chance to
defend himself. None of this is true and a hearing will give us a
chance to challenge her lies,'' Leubner said outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   First-degree manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years
but it was expected Davis was going to receive a term of between
three to five years Thursday. Leubner is confident the hearing will
undermine Davis' story and convince the judge she should receive a
longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''She deserves to spend a lot more time in jail for what she
did. If we have to wait a little longer to see that happen, we can
wait,'' Leubner said
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors at one time considered bringing death
penalty charges against the 37-year-old Davis, she was allowed to
plead guilty in March to first-degree manslaughter and use an
''affirmative defense,'' which holds that she suffered from
''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted using a candle and nail polish remover to start a
fire in her Fleming home last Sept. 4, killing her 13-year-old son,
Daniel Leubner, who was asleep on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her plea came several days after a closed four-day hearing on
whether to suppress her statement as evidence. It was later
revealed for the first time that in her statement, Davis alleged
her son had raped her and beaten her on several occasions,
including the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they investigated Davis' claim and found no evidence
to back up her allegation of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Corning will hold a hearing to consider the domestic abuse
claims. If witnesses are available, the hearing will begin next
Wednesday, otherwise it could be late May or early June before it
is held, the judge said. Defense attorney David Elkovitch said
testimony would focus on the effects of post-traumatic stress
syndrome and rape trauma syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Davis remains free on bail pending her sentencing.

<HEADLINE> High School Explosion Injures Five  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Two apparently homemade explosive
devices detonated in a high school on the Navajo Reservation on
Thursday, injuring five students.
</P>
<P>
   One student was knocked unconscious, said Ron Brown of the
Navajo Department of Law Enforcement. The others injured at Tuba
City High School complained of eye and skin irritation and
shortness of breath. All were taken to a medical center for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One device exploded in a bathroom and another in a hallway. The
school was not damaged, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The devices appeared to have been made with plastic soda bottles
stuffed with aluminum foil, white paper correctional fluid and
another liquid, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo police evacuated the area and called a hazardous
materials team. They were also questioning two young suspects, but
Brown said he didn't know whether they were students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what the motive for the explosion
was, he said. Neither the school nor local law officers had
received any recent threats, Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Exec Convicted in Inside Trade Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former top Wall Street executive could face a
decade in prison for giving inside information on bank stocks to an
X-rated movie actress.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan returned a guilty
verdict against James McDermott Jr., and codefendant Anthony
Pomponio on Thursday, after deliberating for parts of three days.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, a former chief executive at a New York investment
bank, and Pomponio were convicted on seven of eight counts in the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, former head of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, took a deep
breath before the verdict was read but showed no emotion once it
was delivered, holding his head high as the jury forewoman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and Pomponio, 45, of
North Caldwell, N.J., had both admitted having extramarital affairs
with Kathryn Gannon, 30, but had denied engaging in insider
trading.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott allegedly gave inside information to Gannon, a woman
described to the jury only as an actress, dancer and model who
sometimes goes by the stage name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Two jurors who declined to identify themselves said outside
court that they did not know Gannon was a porn star and that it
would not have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   One male juror added, though, ''We didn't think she was the
Queen of England.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood set sentencing for July 17 on
charges conspiracy and securities fraud that could bring up to 10
years in prison for McDermott and Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged McDermott gave Gannon secret information
about six stocks, allowing her to buy bank stocks that were about
to skyrocket in value after public announcements of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused of giving the information to Pomponio, the owner
of a New Jersey quartz- and glass-cutting company who met Gannon at
an adult trade show in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, McDermott's lawyer, Denis McInerney, referred
to his client as a ''rocket scientist on bank stocks'' and admitted
that McDermott gave Gannon tips on stocks -- but only before he
learned the stock involved merger deals.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and McInerney declined to comment after the verdict.
Pomponio's lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon and Pomponio allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
Gannon, who has a home in Miami, Fla., is a fugitive. Prosecutors
have sought her extradition from Canada, where she is believed to
be living.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said he was disappointed with the
verdict and that his client will vigorously defend herself.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the verdict were correct, Shapiro said, ''It does not
follow that Kathryn Gannon is guilty of the charges brought against
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said the Department of Justice must decide whether it
will pursue plans to extradite Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking it one step at a time. I expect her to eventually
appear in a courtroom somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury exonerated McDermott and Pomponio on one count of the
indictment, finding they did not conspire to trade illegally in one
of the six stock deals.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Janitor's Strike Holds Lessons  </HEADLINE>
By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The successful campaign waged by janitors to
gain significant wage and benefit increases was carefully scripted,
planned years in advance and may provide a blueprint for job
actions throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a watershed moment,'' said Kent Wong, director of the
Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''They
did thorough research, they skillfully utilized community allies,
religious allies and created broad popular support. All are
significant lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the drama that unfolded in Los Angeles, with its wide
disparity between the very rich and the very poor, will be replayed
to even greater effect in the coming weeks in Silicon Valley, where
the contrast between stock-option millionaires and the janitors who
clean up after them is even greater.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the script written by Mike Garcia, president of
the 20,000-member Service Employees International Union Local 1877,
which represents both the Los Angeles janitors and those in San
Jose, Oakland and other Northern California cities.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Garcia and staff have prepared
janitors for the fight that would be waged in 2000. They forged
alliances among the city's many unions, which historically have not
worked together. They also met with building owners and worked in
election campaigns -- all in preparation for this year's showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We taught them they needed to struggle to win, they needed to
be prepared to do whatever was necessary if they really wanted to
win a good contract, if they wanted to win respect and dignity,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   But can the drama be repeated when the players are teachers and
truck drivers instead of Hispanic janitors earning below-poverty
wages?
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the janitors union) can be successful in this type of
dispute because these were largely marginalized workers and they
turned it into a civil rights demonstration,'' said Gary Chaison, a
professor of Industrial Relations at Clark University in Worcester,
Mass. ''It's not going to work in a typical manufacturing dispute
or a hospital dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-week strike, representatives from other SEIU
locals, the Teamsters Union and the AFL-CIO came to Los Angeles to
observe and take notes. While the cast of characters may change,
the strategies devised by Garcia and his staff are likely to be
emulated.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Garcia said he decided to ''reinvent the
strike,'' using it as an offensive tool rather than a defensive
move born of desperation
</P>
<P>
   ''We realized we needed a crisis,'' he said. ''We were able to
create an image for the janitors as a group of workers who were
fighting back, who were going to lift themselves out of poverty.
... The janitors created a fight the world would not let them
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   A key strategy was to bypass the cleaning contractors, who
negotiate with the unions and hire the janitors, and appeal
directly to building owners. Garcia said he waited too long to make
building owners the villains in the drama. It's a blunder he
promises not to repeat in Silicon Valley, where a contract covering
thousands of janitors expires at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our janitors were well-defined, but the enemy was faceless for
too long. It took a while for pressure to mount on the building
owners only because we didn't expose who they were sooner,'' Garcia
said
</P>
<P>
   Another key strategy was to build political power by mobilizing
the union to elect candidates and then call on officials to
publicly support the strike, pressure building owners and
contractors and even get arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lifted the bar for our political endorsements and asked
more from our elected leaders,'' said Miguel Contreras, executive
secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. ''We were
able to parlay our political leverage to get them to engage in
civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   The union persuaded Vice President Al Gore, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and members of
the state Assembly and various city councils to pass resolutions,
give speeches and lead marches.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, we amassed so much political support,
they were calling and hounding these building owners to get this
done,'' Garcia said. ''As Mayor Riordan told me, 'Everybody wants a
part of this kill.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said other unions can learn from the techniques used in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be afraid to take risks,'' he said. ''You can't be
afraid to ask your members to do the ultimate and you can't be
afraid to lead them there.''

<HEADLINE> Wynn Buys Desert Inn Resort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Just a month after it looked like departing
Mirage Resorts Inc. Chairman Steve Wynn was leaving the casino
business, the casino mogul is back in, buying the Desert Inn resort
down the street from three of his famed properties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wynn confirmed this afternoon that he is the purchaser of the
Desert Inn as a birthday gift for his wife, whose birthday is
tomorrow,'' a spokesman for Wynn, who requested he not be named,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Wynn and his wife, Elaine, are the only
shareholders of the 715-room resort on the Strip. Wynn also
acquired the Desert Inn golf course, behind the resort, and an
adjacent 32-acre parcel of undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman declined to say how much Wynn paid Starwood Hotels
&AMP; Resorts Worldwide in the deal that is contingent upon the
completion of the MGM's $4.4 billion buyout of Mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left Thursday evening at Starwood headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported earlier this week that
Wynn was considering buying the Desert Inn for $275 million in an
all-cash deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is not going to discuss the price,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Advent, a casino designer and developer, had made a
separate offer for the resort on Monday. He would not disclose how
much his bid was. Advent said Starwood did not respond to his
offer.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of Midwestern investors led by former Las Vegas City
Councilman Matthew Callister reportedly offered Starwood $300
million for the Desert Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Feldman, a spokesman for Mirage Resorts, said Thursday that
the boards of directors for Mirage and MGM Grand gave approval for
Wynn to buy the property.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage Resorts' seven-member board had to give Wynn approval
because he still has fiduciary obligations to Mirage until the MGM
deal is completed later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn will make about $483 million on the sale of Mirage Resorts'
14 properties to MGM Grand. Tthe deal is expected to be completed
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood purchased the Desert Inn in 1998 as part of its $14.6
billion purchase of ITT Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A deal to sell the Desert Inn to Sun International Hotels for
$275 million fell through in March when Sun decided to go private.
</P>
<P>
   The posh Desert Inn has 715 rooms and a 30,000-square-foot
casino. By comparison, Mirage Resorts' showcase Bellagio has 3,000
rooms and about 120,000 square feet of casino space.

<HEADLINE> Immigration Problems Sideline Vorbe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Sebastien Vorbe's regular season debut
with the Los Angeles Galaxy will be delayed because of immigration
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe, a Haitian national team midfielder, signed with the
Galaxy on Tuesday and hoped to play Saturday against the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars in East Rutherford, N.J. But Vorbe has
had problems with getting a work permit, a team spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain when Vorbe, 23, would be able to play for the
Galaxy. Further complicating matters is Vorbe's commitment to play
for Haiti in World Cup qualifiers in May.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe played with the Galaxy during the preseason and scored the
winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Talleres de Cordoba of the
Argentine First Division on March 8 in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Vorbe played for Florida International in 1997 and '98, and
scored nine goals in 37 matches.

<HEADLINE> Verdict Against Wal-Mart Thrown Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday
threw out a $2.75 million verdict won by a former Wal-Mart employee
who said she was falsely accused of stealing from the cash
registers.
</P>
<P>
   The court said there was no evidence to support the jury's
finding that Wal-Mart maliciously sought prosecution of Carolyn
Binns.
</P>
<P>
   Binns, who worked in the layaway department at a Wal-Mart in
Monticello, was suspected by two store managers of stealing. One of
the managers called police, and Binns was charged with theft in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, however, a prosecutor dropped the charges,
apparently because of insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded her $750,000 in compensatory damages and $2
million in punitive damages.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An American soldier charged with
killing a South Korean woman fled a military compound hours before
he was to go on trial, the U.S. military command in Seoul said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''For now, we can say that he is no longer under custody,'' said
Kim Yong-kyu, a command spokesman, adding that he did not have any
other details.
</P>
<P>
   But South Korean officials said they were notified by U.S.
military investigators that Spc. Christopher K. McCarthy fled the
U.S. military command in Seoul early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   YTN, an all-news cable television network, said authorities
discovered that McCarthy was missing after he was allowed to meet
with his lawyers inside the main U.S. military compound in central
Seoul. His trial was to start later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old soldier from Concord, N.H. was charged with the
beating death of a 31-year-old bar waitress, identified by police
only by her surname, Kim, in Seoul on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was arrested three days later and told investigators
that he hit the woman because she refused to have sex with him.

sued Microsoft for antitrust violations worked out last-minute details Thursday
to sanctions proposed against the company. Facing a Friday deadline, the

   PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- The man who had been the oldest surviving crew
member of the USS Arizona has been laid to rest with shipmates in the hull of
the battleship that sank during Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. National Park
Service divers placed the cremated remains of Capt. Francis Marion Falge, 96, of
Carmel, Calif., in a gun turret near the stern of the ship during a ceremony
Wednesday. He died Jan. 21. Since the end of World War II, 14 other Arizona

GDP Is Growing at 5.4 Percent

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew robustly as the country's total
output of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the January-March quarter, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But that sparked fresh inflation worries among
economists and investors. Workers enjoyed the biggest jump in wages and benefits
in 10 years. Consumer spending led the way by posting its largest increase in
nearly 17 years. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose sharply, reflecting
higher energy prices.

days after he demanded the firing of the police chief for not warning him about
the raid to seize Elian Gonzalez. Carollo had asked City Manager Donald Warshaw
to fire Police Chief William O'Brien, saying he ''lost all confidence'' in the
chief for not telling him that federal agents were about to raid the Gonzalez
household early Saturday. Warshaw refused. Carollo insisted today that Warshaw's
firing had nothing to do with ''little Elian.'' Carollo said Warshaw has been
badmouthing him to his colleagues and trying to turn department heads against
him. The seizure of the 6-year-old Cuban refugee has plunged City Hall into
political turmoil.

pressing their campaign against publications that have fueled public support for
reform. About 200 students demonstrated against the closures at the Shahid
Beheshti University in northern Tehran in the early hours of Friday, said an
Iranian journalist. The media closures, now numbering 16, are hampering
Khatami's allies' political ambitions. Only one reformist paper remained
publishing Thursday as campaigning started for the May 5 run-off elections,
which will decide 66 seats in the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Albright Challenges Helms on Russia  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenging the powerful Republican chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday the Clinton administration intends
to pursue new arms control accords with Russia in the time it has
left.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, at a joint news conference with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, said the American people supported the dual
quest for further cutbacks in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals and
a way to mount a defense against intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has presented Russia with a draft agreement
that would revise the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, The New
York Times reported on their Web site early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would allow the United States to protect itself
against missile attacks from nations such as North Korea, Iraq,
Iran and Libya, the Times said. It said the draft was presented to
the Russians earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who has great but not insurmountable
power to sidetrack treaties or even kill them, vowed Wednesday to
block any new Clinton administration arms control pacts.
</P>
<P>
   He included any agreement with Russia that might clear the way
for a limited defense against missile attack from such countries as
Iran and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Russian government should not be under any illusion
whatsoever that any commitments made by this lame-duck
administration will be binding on the next administration,'' the
North Carolina Republican told the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is likely to ask Russian President Vladimir
Putin at their summit meeting in Moscow June 4-5 to agree to modify
the ABM treaty to permit a U.S. project involving 100 anti-missile
launchers and an improved radar system.
</P>
<P>
   Senate approval would be required to change the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But such an initiative, Helms said, would be ''DOA -- dead on
arrival'' at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The likely Republican presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, and many other conservative Republicans would go far
beyond the administration's tentative plans and attempt to
construct a nationwide defense against missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia takes the position both approaches violate the 1972
treaty. Ivanov proposed during a three-day visit here the two sides
cooperate on theater missile defenses allowed under the accord. In
1997 Russia approved all U.S. requests for a green light for
missile tests as part of such a defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said Thursday the United States was faced now with
a new potential threat, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and
had to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can have a pause for the rest of the year,''
Albright said. ''I don't agree with what Sen. Helms said
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she made it clear differences with Russia had
not been resolved during Ivanov's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't agree on all issues. This is only to be expected,''
Albright said. ''We cannot both be right all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, registering his government's position on missile
defenses, insisted the 1972 treaty ''be made a cornerstone of
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia had proposed an ''adequate response'' to any
threat of missile attack and that his government was prepared for
further discussions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are focused on finding solutions to the problems we are
faced with,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Cohen, at a joint news
conference with Colombia's minister of national defense, Luis
Fernando Ramirez, said he was confident Russia would come to
understand a limited U.S. anti-missile system was not threatening
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied that, as they understand the intent and the
capability of the system, they will see that it does not pose a
threat to their strategic systems,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Helms' statement on blocking any kind of arms
agreement during the remainder of Clinton's term, Cohen said:
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not something that is a last-minute item on the agenda
for President Clinton and any form of legacy that he might seek to
achieve. He has been dedicated to reducing the level of strategic
armaments and has worked diligently in that effort.''

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Red Wings 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Peter Forsberg and Sandis Ozolinsh scored, and
Patrick Roy posted his 13th career playoff shutout as the Colorado
Avalanche beat the Detroit Red Wings 2-0 Thursday night in the
opening game of their Western Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, tied for third in NHL history in playoff shutouts, extended
his playoff record for victories to 115. He had 25 saves, while
Detroit's Chris Osgood had 24.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Saturday at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg scored the only goal of the first period on a
deflection at 10:13.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg stormed down the left side with the puck, and his shot
was lost in traffic in front of the net. Red Wings defenseman Steve
Duchesne attempted an awkward clearing pass which went directly to
Adam Deadmarsh at the right point. Deadmarsh's slap shot was
deflected by Forsberg past Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, the top scoring team in the NHL during the regular
season, outshot Colorado 10-7 in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings missed two scoring opportunities early in the
second period. Roy lost his balance after chasing the puck behind
the net, and Kris Draper's shot at an open net deflected off
defenseman Jon Klemm's stick.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Aaron Miller later made a stick save to stop Duchesne
on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   After Martin Lapointe went to the penalty box for roughing,
Ozolinsh scored on a power play at 11:39 to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Ozolinsh's shot, past Sergei Fedorov from the left point, ended
Detroit's string of 25 straight penalty kills in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ozolinsh's fourth goal of the playoffs and his eighth
point in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third, Osgood stopped Forsberg on a 2-on-1
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to Colorado from Quebec in 1995, the Avalanche have
never lost a second-round playoff series, going 3-0 including a
second-round ousting of Detroit last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams entered the second round well rested and played their
best hockey. Detroit swept the Los Angeles Kings in the first round
and Colorado, 12-1-0 in their previous 13 games, eliminated Phoenix
4-1.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 113, Kings 89  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers' playoff opener was
Shaq's Show. Game 2 was Bryant's Time.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, seemingly improving with every game, scored 22 of
his career playoff high 32 points in the first half Thursday night
as the Lakers rolled to a 113-89 victory over the Sacramento Kings
and a 2-0 lead in their first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 in the best-of-five series will be played Sunday at Arco
Arena in Sacramento, where a fourth game will be played Tuesday
night, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who had 46 points, 17 rebounds and five
blocked shots in the Lakers' 117-107 victory in the opener, had 23
points, 19 rebounds, six assists and three blocked shots in Game 2,
and Glen Rice added 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took command by outscoring Sacramento 16-3 in the
final seven minutes of the second quarter for a 56-41 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings appeared thoroughly demoralized before the third
quarter was over, and understandably so, considering the Lakers led
by as many as 23 points before settling for an 83-64 lead entering
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, who scored 28 points in 27 minutes before fouling
out midway through the fourth quarter of the opener, avoided foul
problems in Game 2 and shrugged off a bad start to get 22 points,
12 rebounds and six assists in 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Vlade Divac was the only other Sacramento player in double
figures with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were determined to do a better job of blocking out
after the Lakers got 25 offensive rebounds in Game 1, but did
poorly early.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers picked off four in one sequence, and had eight in the
first seven minutes -- including four by O'Neal and three by A.C.
Green -- to help them go ahead for good. In all, the Lakers had 14
offensive rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made their first four shots and were 7-of-11 at one
stage, but trailed 21-15 mainly because they couldn't keep the
Lakers off the offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   It was 35-24 entering the second quarter, and the Kings opened
the period with a 14-5 run to draw within two points. At that
stage, the Lakers turned up the intensity on defense in pulling
away to their 15-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bryant's previous career playoff high was 28 points against
San Antonio last May 19. He surpassed that when he made a
three-point play with 3:01 left in the third quarter. ... The Kings
were 26-of-35 and the Lakers 10-of-14 from the foul line in Game 1.
In Game 2, the Lakers were 25-of-35 and the Kings were 16-of-20.
... Webber missed six of his first seven shots, including an
uncontested dunk. He wound up 8-of-28 from the floor and didn't
come out of the game for the first time until midway through the
fourth quarter. ... O'Neal, a virtual lock to win his first Most
Valuable Player award, was honored before the game as winner of the
IBM award, which is determined by a computer rating that measures a
player's overall contribution to a team. ... O'Neal attempted only
five free throws in Game 1, making four. He was 5-of-11 in Game 2,
including 2-of-8 in the third quarter. ... The Lakers outrebounded
the Kings 54-37 in Game 1 and 48-40 in Game 2. ... The Kings have
lost nine of their last 10 games, including seven of eight to
finish the regular season.

   After the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City and East Africa U.S.
embassy bombings and a 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo
subway, U.S. officials have concluded it only a matter of when --
not whether -- some terrorist will use a weapon of mass destruction
on a domestic target.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Friday that a previous, secret
exercise to determine how a medium-sized city would cope after a
terrorist detonation of a weapon of mass destruction showed that
Cincinnati's hospitals, police and other services were woefully
unprepared for such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said the findings were
presented to Attorney General Janet Reno, then Deputy Defense
Secretary John Hamre and senior FBI officials at two Saturday
sessions at the Pentagon earlier this year. They immediately
ordered the formation of interagency working groups to study the
problems that might arise from a major terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Called ''Topoff'' because of the involvement of top officials,
the exercise next month will have the active participation of Reno,
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Federal
Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from governors' and mayors' offices, state and local
emergency managers will join the FBI, local police and fire
departments in responding to the fake chemical and a fake
biological attack during the 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vitally important that our nation be prepared for the
consequences of a terrorist event,'' Witt said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the test ''can only help us to better educate and
train responders across all levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver and Portsmouth, N.H., were picked to represent a large
metropolitan area and a smaller city and because they have
different levels of training. Denver has had federally funded
preparedness training; Portsmouth has not.
</P>
<P>
   While the two cities are known, the participating officials and
responders who will make and execute decisions will not know in
advance exactly where or when the ''terrorists'' will strike during
the 10-day period or what ''weapons'' they will use. No actual
weapons or germs will be used.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to test the ability of existing agencies to identify
and diagnose biological attacks, conduct mass immunization and mass
emergency patient care and to identify chemical weapons and limit
contamination while rescuing and treating large numbers of people.
Managers will be required to decide what to tell the public and how
to prevent panic.
</P>
<P>
   Actors will play victims and even news media members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Denver and Portsmouth tests, a separate,
previously scheduled domestic counterterrorism test, NCR-2000, will
be conducted in Washington, D.C., and adjacent Prince Georges
County, Md., by the FBI, the Energy Department, FEMA and state and
local emergency responders. They will respond to a fake attack with
an as-yet undisclosed type of weapon of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   To guard against false alarms among non-participants, all
messages sent during the test will be proceeded and followed by a
notice that it was part of an exercise. First responders will not
use lights or sirens and will obey traffic laws as they travel to
the ''scene,'' a Justice official said.

<HEADLINE> Castro: Accept More Elian Friends  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro is accusing U.S.
officials of limiting access to Elian Gonzalez by Cuban diplomats
and of hindering efforts by Cuban friends to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been nothing but obstacles and difficulties of all
kinds,'' Castro complained Thursday at Havana's Jose Marti
International Airport after four children, four of their parents
and Elian's doctor flew to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the U.S. State Department was limiting Cuban
diplomatic access to the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor, who is
staying at the Wye River conference center 70 miles outside
Washington, D.C. -- well beyond the 25 miles Cuban diplomats are
allowed to travel from the capital without special permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result is they are kidnapped there,'' Castro said, adding
that the Cubans could have chosen another site closer to Washington
but relied on the good faith of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Castro also complained that U.S. officials had told Cuba that
Elian's physician, Dr. Caridad Ponce de Leon, cannot practice
medicine at the Maryland site under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television later reported that on her arrival, U.S.
Customs confiscated medicines for Elian from the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials are trying to create a little bit of Elian's
hometown, Cardenas, at Wye River, where the boy is staying while a
court considers efforts by his Miami relatives to seek political
asylum against his father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have said that we want to move Cardenas to the United
States,'' Castro said, complaining about U.S. refusal to grant
visas to all 31 people Cuba had proposed to help Elian recover from
trauma, catch up with schoolwork and renew relations with his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Castro said that if the family had to wait a month or more for a
court ruling allowing Elian to return, ''it would be better if he
were with people that he knew.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that the U.S. limited the Cubans to 15-day visas
so that the children who visit Elian would have to be rotated,
preventing a stable, school-like environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are crazy things, absurd, ridiculous, which cannot
contribute anything to helping the boy,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon, who has overseen much of
Cuba's campaign for Elian's return, said sending the children ''is
the only way that you can have an idea of a school for a little boy
that has the right to return a life as normal as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really prefer to believe that the American public would not
tolerate having this issue dragging on and on,'' he told The
Associated Press, adding that it ''sends a terrible message'' to
U.S. families trying to recover children being held abroad.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed a proposal by Republican presidential candidate
Gov. George W. Bush that U.S. officials should convince the father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it is the job of any government to interfere in
what is a fundamental human right ... that everybody has a right to
live in his own country or to choose his own nationality,'' Alarcon
said.

<HEADLINE> Argentina President Triumphs  </HEADLINE>
By OSCAR SERRAT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- When he took office in December,
President Fernando De la Rua inherited an economic tableau that was
anything but appealing: Unemployment hovered in double digits and a
recession kept deepening.
</P>
<P>
   But De la Rua publicly celebrated one of the biggest political
triumphs of his young administration Thursday as he toasted Senate
passage of a bill to alter the country's rigid labor laws in a bid
to spur job and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor leaders, however, said the bill will only inflict
pain on workers and do little to boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The vote late Wednesday was a hard-fought victory for a
president whose top priority during four months of office has been
rescuing South America's second-largest economy from the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a triumph for democratic institutions,'' an ebullient
De la Rua said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for extending the trial period of new hires and
lowering employer payroll contributions for new workers. The
government says that will boost wage flexibility and create more
jobs while reducing the cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor reform is considered a centerpiece of De la Rua's moves
toward a long-term recovery and Argentine economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   He went up against dissident labor leaders to claim his victory.
And in the end, the bill was passed after De la Rua's ruling
center-left party compromised with foes to include a clause barring
companies from lowering salaries in collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of Congress approved the bill weeks ago and is
to reconcile the two versions. House approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua defended the bill, saying Thursday that it would not
harm workers. ''It's for the good of all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line labor leaders disagree. They have vowed to wage a
strike May 5 in protest of the legislation, which they claim would
hurt workers and do nothing to ease the country's 14 percent
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight on behalf of hungry workers,'' Hugo Moyano, head
of a hard-line truckers' union, told protesters outside Congress
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua has countered that it is vital for companies to have
more say over their own pay scales and other issues that had kept
certain foreign investors at bay. Critics have long claimed that
too much power still rests in the hands of national union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It is De la Rua's second major legislative victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after taking office, he pushed through a highly
unpopular tax hike which should help Argentina trim its federal
deficit by $2.5 billion -- from $7.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The early victories have comforted the International Monetary
Fund, which in February approved a $7.4 billion standby loan for
Argentina. The deficit-cutting package seemed to reassure the bond
markets, where Argentina routinely seeks financing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, economists caution that the benefits of the labor
reform bill will not be felt for some time. ''This legislation is
not for the short term, it's a long-term strategy,'' said economic
analyst Esteban Fernadez Medrano.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's economic woes came fast upon the heels of the 1998
Asian financial crisis, and were only made worse after neighboring
Brazil devalued its currency last January.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian currency upheaval made Argentine goods more
expensive there, quickly dampening Argentina's chief export market.
But government officials talk of the recession just now showing
signs of ebbing.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict Argentina's economy will grow 4 percent this
year, bouncing back after it slumped 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people say they doubt they will feel any benefits
from the president's reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of workers in the street. ... I'm afraid of
losing my job,'' said 47-year-old factory worker Jorge Rosi, who
took part in demonstrations against the labor reforms.

<HEADLINE> Black Youth Urged To Buckle Up  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Citing studies showing low rates of seat belt use
among black youths, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher called on
mayors to help get black children in their cities to buckle up.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study found that blacks in their teens and 20s are half
as likely to use automobile safety belts as whites and Hispanics in
the same age group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, wearing seat belts saves lives,'' Satcher said
Thursday at the annual meeting of the National Conference of Black
Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   He told the city leaders and high school students that traffic
accidents are the leading cause of death for blacks age 15 and
under, and the second leading cause for those age 15 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive seat-belt use could save as many as 1,300 lives a
year, prevent 26,000 injuries and reduce costs to society by $2.6
billion, according to a 1999 study by Nashville-based Meharry
Medical College, where Satcher used to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk called the traffic deaths of black
teen-agers a ''silent epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These are lives and dollars thrown out the window because we
are too lazy, too arrogant or to hip to buckle up,'' said Kirk, who
leads a committee urging black mayors nationwide to launch public
awareness campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Giuliani has prostate cancer  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he would continue
his Senate race for the time being, despite being diagnosed with a
treatable form of prostate cancer, but said he would make a more
definitive statement in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' he said when asked how the diagnosis would
affect the Senate race. ''I think in fairness to me, to the
Republican Party, to all of the parties and everybody else you need
some time to think about it. And I really need to know what the
course of treatment is going to be before I can evaluate. ... And
then, after I determine that, then I will figure out does it make
sense this year or doesn't it or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   He still plans campaign appearances in Saratoga today and in
Buffalo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing upbeat and energetic at a hastily arranged City Hall
news conference Thursday, Giuliani confirmed speculation by
reporters that started Wednesday evening when Giuliani was seen
entering Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and leaving three hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was diagnosed yesterday,'' Giuliani, 55, told the packed
news conference surrounded by his top aides. ''It's a treatable
form of prostate cancer. It was diagnosed at an early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had additional tests performed Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he got regular prostate checkups because his
father died at age 73 of prostate cancer in 1981. Giuliani, who
rarely speaks about personal matters to the media, said his own
cancer reminded him of his father's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings up very painful memories,'' he said. ''And, you
know, I miss my father every day of my life. And he's a very, very
important reason for why I'm standing here as the mayor of New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Democratic rival for the Senate, Hillary Rodham
Clinton -- who was campaigning in the upstate village of Penn Yan --
spoke briefly by telephone with the mayor and wished him ''a speedy
and complete recovery,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-wishers included friend and foe alike -- and ranged
from Gov. George Pataki to the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor and I certainly have political differences, but I
certainly wish no ill will or ill health on him,'' said Sharpton.
''My differences with him are social and political. I would hope he
would do what is best for his health and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, who had considered challenging Giuliani for the
GOP Senate nomination, issued a statement offering his prayers and
support, adding that health issues transcend politics. Through his
spokesman, Lazio declined to say whether he would enter the race if
Giuliani dropped out. The New York Senate primary is in September.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, released a statement asking for
as much privacy for her husband as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic about Rudy's recovery,'' she said. ''We
have discussed this and I will be very supportive of him in dealing
with the choices he has to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men but
early detection greatly increases the chance of successful
treatment. About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the disease in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have survived prostate cancer are former Sen.
Bob Dole and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments include the radical prostatectomy -- the removal of
the prostate -- and radiation. Treatment of the cancer would almost
certainly require as much as several weeks away from City Hall and
off the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bad news is that it's cancer, the good news is that there
are lots of possible options, and it's going to take a while to
figure out which option is going to bring about a cure,'' said
Giuliani. ''Over the next week, maybe two weeks, maybe
two-and-a-half or three weeks, I'll figure out with my doctors what
the best form of treatment will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Catalona of Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who
removed Torre's cancerous prostate last year, said that with
surgery, a patient is typically in the hospital for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're usually able to return to normal activities within a
few weeks,'' he said, ''but they're anemic and it takes 6 to 8
weeks or somewhat longer to build their blood count up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Giuliani should be able to resume his mayoral
schedule after that and also run for Senate, Catalona replied:
''Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his sometimes testiness with the press, Giuliani
smiled, laughed and joked during his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he would be nicer, he replied, ''No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he felt well, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' he said. ''I can't say I feel absolutely
great. I had the biopsy yesterday, that creates a few pains that
you'd rather not have ... but I'm in very good health.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's schedule Thursday included a previously scheduled
meeting with Pataki at the governor's Manhattan office in which the
governor expressed his support and the two discussed city business,
said mayoral spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said the campaign had
collected more than $10,000 on Thursday via its web site and
received about 1,000 E-mails. On a typical day, the campaign
receives some $2,000 and about 150 E-mails.

<HEADLINE> House kills measure to ban hand-held cell phones while driving  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Chatting on a cell phone while driving
will remain legal in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy debate Thursday, lawmakers used a voice vote to
kill legislation that would have banned the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued the measure, raised as an amendment to a bill
on child safety in motor vehicles, would reduce accidents on
Connecticut roads. Rep. Richard Roy, who sponsored the bill, said
driving with a hand-held phone is as bad as driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're four times more likely to have an accident,'' said Roy,
D-Milford.
</P>
<P>
   Critics maintained the ban would be difficult to enforce and do
little to improve safety. They said motorists are more distracted
by a host of other activities -- from eating and drinking while
driving to finding a station on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lawrence Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, waved a Styrofoam cup of
tea and a bag of candy, and pretended to beat back imaginary
children in the car to illustrate the distractions he faces on a
typical drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't stop all of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said there are already laws on the books that
achieve the goal of the amendment more simply and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a law to take care of the weaving in and out of
traffic-- it's called reckless driving,'' said Rep. Lee Samowitz,
D-Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   An exception to the ban would have been made for motorists using
their cellular phones to make 911 or other emergency calls. Police
and fire officials would also have been exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Hands-free cellular phones would have remained legal to use
under the measure.
</P>
<P>
   There were an estimated 58 million cellular phones in use
nationwide in 1998, Roy said. Statistics show there will be about
80 million by year's end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Fontana, D-North Haven, said the ban would have been
in line with state statutes governing seat belt use, drunken
driving and the safe construction of cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a precedent to pass such laws,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners in Virginia have hard time keeping up with Connecticutcases  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Connecticut inmates who have been shipped to Virginia
to ease
prison overcrowding say the move has made it harder to contact
their lawyers and move their court cases along.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a human rights group said it is seeking an in-depth
review of allegations of prisoner mistreatment, The Day of New
London, Conn. reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Wallens Ridge prison in Big Stone Gap, Va. is in a remote
Appalachian village, a 14-hour drive from Connecticut, making
travel for face-to-face consultations costly and time-consuming.
Consultation instead occurs by telephone and the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said many appeals are not being vigorously pursued, at
least not in a timely fashion, depriving their clients of the
constitutional right to be represented by effective counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even convicted murderers may have been falsely or unjustly
convicted,'' said Conrad Seifert, an Old Lyme lawyer who has served
as a state-appointed special public defender.
</P>
<P>
   ''The appeals process is important. The attorney doesn't work in
a vacuum. He needs to work with his client. Share information. All
that has been destroyed,'' Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 500 Connecticut inmates sent to Virginia, 89 had
pending legal matters as of last week, the state public defender's
office said. Forty-nine of those inmates are pursuing direct
appeals of convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers and prisoners told The Day they did not want to
discuss cases with clients over the telephone, for fear Virginia
prison guards will listen in.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Traylor, spokesman for the Virginia corrections
department, said the Wallens Ridge staff considers lawyer-client
conversations confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as private as it can be from a pay phone,'' Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the human rights group Amnesty International USA is
seeking an independent review of allegations of abuse in the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''The consistent theme (in the complaints) is that there have
been beatings, an excessive use of electroshock equipment, and
regular psychological abuse,'' said Curt Goering, deputy executive
director of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Goering said not all allegations are true and they can't be
accepted at face value. He added, however, that they can't be
proved or refuted until they are researched in depth.
</P>
<P>
   Traylor said the corrections department would respond to
detailed complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have raised allegations,'' Traylor said. ''We'd be glad
to address any of their specific concerns if they provide us with
specific information -- the names of the inmates, exactly what
happened, that kind of thing. But we will not respond to
allegations. We will respond to proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and letters to The Day, some prisoners claimed
guards taunted them with racial and ethnic slurs, physically abused
them and threatened retaliation if the inmates made formal
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, at the request of the New Mexico attorney general, is
investigating allegations that inmates from that state have been
abused at Wallens Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut inmates and their relatives have submitted a stack
of letters and complaints to the FBI office in Richmond, in hopes
the FBI will formally investigate their claims.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Armstrong, Connecticut's corrections commissioner, said
he is satisfied that constitutional standards are being met in
Virginia. If he felt differently, he said, he would try to remove
the inmates.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 7, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Dave Martinez drove in three runs and
Dwight Gooden pitched five strong innings in his 400th career start
as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat the Anaheim Angels 7-3 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden (2-0) allowed a run on four hits and struck out three in
his third start for the Devil Rays, who obtained the former NL Cy
Young winner from the Houston Astros on April 13 in a cash
transaction. The victory was the right-hander's second in his last
11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla doubled with two out in the second against Ramon
Ortiz (1-2) and scored on the first of John Flaherty's three hits,
a bloop single inside the right field line.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams singled under the glove of third baseman Troy
Glaus with two out in the third, stole second and scored Tampa
Bay's second run on Martinez's double.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy led off the bottom of the third with his third
homer -- the fifth surrendered by Gooden in his first 17 innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays increased the margin to 3-1 in the fifth with the
help of Mo Vaughn's second error this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stocker led off with a single and Vaughn's wild throw to
first on a sacrifice bunt by Williams put runners at second and
third. Martinez followed with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Williams increased Tampa Bay's lead to 5-1 in the sixth with a
two-run bases-loaded single after Ortiz walked one batter and
reliever Al Levine walked two more. Greg Vaughn capped the inning
with an RBI single and Martinez completed the scoring in the eighth
with his second RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored their final two runs in the ninth off reliever
Roberto Hernandez on Scott Spiezio's RBI double and Darin Erstad's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who entered Thursday night's game with a major
league-leading .456 average, had three hits. It was Erstad's 15th
multi-hit game this month, the most by any major leaguer in April
since Dave Winfield's 15 multi-hit games in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's bunt hit followed a leadoff single by Gary DiSarcina,
and both advanced on a sacrifice by Kennedy. But the 35-year-old
Gooden, pitching these days on finesse and savvy instead of power,
reached back for some of his vintage magic and escaped the jam by
striking out Vaughn and Tim Salmon -- the latter with a 79-mph
breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tampa Bay's power quartet of Vaughn, Castilla, Jose Canseco
and Fred McGriff -- who hit a combined 305 home runs over the
previous two seasons -- failed to homer for the 14th time in the
team's first 21 games. The Devil Rays are 2-5 when at least one of
them homers, and 6-8 when none of them do. ... Angels manager Mike
Scioscia hit a dramatic game-tying two-run homer against Gooden in
the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 1988 NL Championship Series.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Rowland agree on budget  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut residents will get a break
when they go clothes shopping and fill up their gas tanks under a
$12.3 billion budget deal reached between the governor and leading
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come to conclusion, not only on the spending side of the
budget, but the tax side,'' Gov. John G. Rowland said Thursday. The
legislative session ends at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting Rowland's proposal to enact a 7-cent gas tax cut
on July 1, leading Democrats have now agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes a GOP-backed measure to have one
week-long sales tax exemptions on clothing priced up to $300.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats got something in return -- namely an increase on
clothing tax exemptions. Currently, clothing priced below $50 is
tax free. Democrats pushed that limit to $75.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never run into a tax cut I didn't like,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes $75 million in tax breaks to the state's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the legislative session started in February, Senate
Democrats have railed against Rowland's plan to lower the gas tax.
They argued that such a slash would suck money out of the state's
fund for road and bridge repairs and fail to give drivers relief at
the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ryan, Rowland's budget chief, insisted that would not
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats eventually softened their stance, suggesting last
month they would be willing to cut the tax 7 cents over three
years. They then proposed cutting the 32-cent tax to a quarter for
one year, with the understanding that it could be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk with the gas tax -- in addition to compromising the
transportation fund -- is that it's impossible to control how the
large oil companies ... are not pocketing the profits and not
passing the savings on to consumers,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George Jepsen, D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the gas tax cut say it would mean a savings of $85
to $140 a year for a family that drives 30,000 miles. In addition,
lowering the tax would keep Connecticut drivers from crossing state
lines to fill their tanks at cheaper prices, they say.
</P>
<P>
   While they've budged on the gas tax issue, Democratic leaders
resisted Rowland's pitch to give parents a tuition tax credit of up
to $500 if they send their school-age children to private school.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he predicts the credit plan will be passed as a
separate bill in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of bipartisan support for that,'' Rowland said.
''I think we'll have a vote on it, but it won't be part of the
negotiated settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jepsen said the plan doesn't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe there is support for tuition tax credits and
I'm personally and completely opposed to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the tax credits say they're too much like vouchers
that would drain money from public education.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also dropped a proposal to whittle adults out of the
state's HUSKY health care plan -- a program they had argued is too
costly and could have saved the state about $32 million. The
program was originally designed to provide health care for
uninsured children, but was expanded to include their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program will be implemented,'' said House Minority Leader
Robert Ward, R-Northfield.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget -- about $12.3 billion -- includes roughly $30
million of new spending and stays $50 million under the state's
mandatory spending cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really where we wanted to be,'' Rowland said. In
February, Rowland said he wanted to keep spending $84 million below
the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and lawmakers also want to use the state's surplus to
pay for one-time expenses and retire debt. As of April 1, the state
Comptroller estimated the surplus at $264.5 million. But that
estimate has been reduced to about $240 million, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   About $20 million of the surplus is earmarked for a bailout of
deficit-plagued University of Connecticut Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are still negotiating a package of bonding projects.

<HEADLINE> Prosecution of Woman Debated  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- At the age of 18, blood vessels
in Anne Marie DeGree's brain ruptured and she was left with the
social skills of a 6-year-old and a lifetime of psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   Riverside County prosecutors now want the 37-year-old woman to
spend time in jail for stealing a roll of Life Savers and a bottle
of Pepsi from a hospital gift shop and attacking a police officer
when he tried to take them away.
</P>
<P>
   DeGree allegedly took the items in March when she was being
treated for illnesses related to her brain injury. She has been
charged with felony burglary and felony assault on a peace officer
for trying to take the officer's gun and scratching his face. She
could get up to 25 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the DeGree family, mental health advocates, law
enforcement officials and prosecutors all agree a crime was
committed, they disagree on how to handle brain-injured defendants
who are not legally insane.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody could have been killed in this situation,'' said
Deputy District Attorney Richard Bentley. ''Just because you have a
brain injury doesn't give you a free pass. ... I can tell you I've
convicted two people of murder who had similar problems and were
given passes on their actions for more than 10 years -- until they
killed somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   California law does not allow a diminished capacity defense,
meaning DeGree cannot be considered legally insane because she does
not have a psychological diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made remarkable advances in treating the mentally ill.
Medications to treat their illnesses,'' said Dr. Thomas
Hafemeister, a mental health law professor and psychologist. ''But
when you're talking about brain injury, you're talking about
something that is virtually untreatable.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGree's injury, according to her parents, causes wild
fluctuations in her behavior, ranging from a docile child to a
willful teen-ager. She also lacks impulse control, which causes her
to overeat and take things that don't belong to her.
</P>
<P>
   ''One minute she's like a 6-year-old. The next she can curse you
out like a Marine drill instructor,'' said her mother, Helen
DeGree.
</P>
<P>
   Since her injury, DeGree has lived in a psychiatric facility,
except for three months in a mental health board and care home. She
was removed from the home because of her behavior, including the
theft of candy from a store, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley does not dispute claims that DeGree has the capacity of
a 6-year-old, but says her condition has no bearing on his
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   DeGree's attorney, Deputy Public Defender John Isaacs, argues
she was unable to form an intent to commit the crime because of her
condition. He said she also has been unable to help with her case.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really isn't an easy answer,'' he said. ''We're stuck
with an absurd law that doesn't take into account people in her
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   When DeGree was arrested, deputies were unaware of her mental
capacity, said Sgt. Perri Portales-Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   DeGree was jailed for more than two weeks before she was
released on $5,000 bail. She is being held at the University of
California, Irvine, Medical Center's psychiatric ward pending a
June hearing.
</P>
<P>
   While attorneys say they are discussing a plea bargain that
would reduce the charges to a misdemeanor, the family is lobbying
for a change in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not a criminal. She's brain-injured,'' said DeGree's
father, Otis DeGree. ''We just thought for sure when the district
attorney saw her medical file, he would throw the case out.''

<HEADLINE> 'South Park' Parodies Reno on Raid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Only four days after the Elian Gonzalez raid,
Comedy Central's ''South Park'' aired a parody that depicted
Attorney General Janet Reno in an Easter bunny outfit capturing
Romanian contortionists.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon was completed only hours before it was telecast on
the cable network Wednesday night, a Comedy Central executive said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode, a rifle-toting cartoon Reno drops from a
helicopter with a team of commandos to grab Romanian quintuplets
from a closet, disabling their new family with tear gas hidden in
an Easter egg.
</P>
<P>
   The girls had escaped from a circus, but Reno ordered them
returned to their home country after their father -- with a gun to
his head -- begs for them to come back.
</P>
<P>
   As they leave for Romania, the girls have harsh words for
protesters who wanted them to stay in America -- ''get a life'' --
and for the ''South Park'' kids who harbored them.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is
so much better,'' one girl said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, they left -- for a book tour and appearance on
''Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, ''South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt
Stone give Comedy Central their episodes three weeks in advance.
They often push those deadlines, but never as dramatically as this
week, said Debbie Liebling, a network senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Parker and Stone told Liebling they were writing
an episode that paralleled the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   But it required some furious rewriting after Saturday's
real-life raid. For instance, the rough draft had Reno in a bunny
suit, but she wasn't commanding a raid until after Saturday's
events, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of computer animation and an extensive ''South
Park'' library of images used during their three years on the air,
Parker and Stone were able to quickly make the episode. It took two
full nights of work, Liebling said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time they've taken such an immediate
advantage of a breaking news story,'' she said. ''It's pretty
amazing to be able to take animation and be that timely. I don't
think anybody has ever done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like students who don't crack open a book until the night before
the exam, Parker and Stone seem to work better on deadline, she
said. They cut it so close that Liebling wasn't even able to see
the final product before it aired.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been that way more than we'd like,'' she said, ''but in
this case it actually worked out very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Stone weren't able to talk about their handiwork on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're sleeping,'' Liebling said.

<HEADLINE> Airline Wants Reporters' Info  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK BARTELS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines is seeking
information given to reporters after a fatal plane crash last
summer and also wants a judge to block the release of pretrial
testimony from witnesses in lawsuits against the company.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers Thursday, airline attorneys asked U.S. District
Judge Henry Woods to issue an order to plaintiffs' lawyers to
reveal what documents they have released to the media. They also
asked the judge to require the lawyers to reveal ''the manner in
which the materials were provided.''
</P>
<P>
   American's attorneys argued that disclosure of witness testimony
before trial could influence potential jurors and could harm the
airline's reputation. American said the statements also could be
''used in a misleading, inaccurate or one-sided manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Woods ruled that information equivalent to trade
secrets, such as training manuals, should be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 1420 touched down June 1 and ran off the end of the
Little Rock National Airport runway, breaking apart, catching fire
and killing 11, including the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent plaintiff's motion, Capt. Cecil Ewell,
American's chief pilot at the time of the crash, said he would
never try to land in stormy conditions like those when the plane
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Ewell said in his deposition that most American Airlines pilots
would take the same position and ''only an idiot would attempt to
land in a thunderstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   American cited Ewell's comments in its filing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Capt. Ewell's brief statement, however, was taken completely
out of context,'' American said. The quote was from a lengthy
answer in which Ewell said he did not believe Flight 1420's crew
knowingly flew into the thunderstorm, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiff's attorney David Rapoport said Thursday he expects
victims' lawyers would oppose the airline's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like a company that is awfully frightened about
evidence that is being developed,'' Rapoport said. ''I have been
actively involved in litigating cases for close to 20 years and
have not seen a motion like this before.''
</P>
<P>
   American's motion says its purpose was ''not to keep the media
from obtaining facts about the accident.''

<HEADLINE> 'Miss Saigon' Closing in December  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Miss Saigon,'' the long-running British
musical set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, will close
Dec. 31, after a nearly 10-year run of 4,063 performances.
</P>
<P>
   Its final curtain will come six months after the June 25 closing
of ''Cats,'' another big British musical produced by Cameron
Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much as I will miss 'Saigon' at the Broadway Theater, I am
utterly thrilled at how long this serious musical has run both on
Broadway and in London,'' Mackintosh said Thursday. ''I have no
doubt that 'Miss Saigon' will continue to appear all over the
globe, even though she might be in a different frock.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Miss Saigon,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Lea Salonga, opened
in New York on April 11, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Its arrival was marked by controversy. Actors Equity originally
denied Pryce, who created the role of the Engineer in the London
production, permission to play in New York. Equity wanted an Asian
actor in the role.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh canceled the show, but changed his mind after Equity
reversed its decision.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, written by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel
Schonberg, has grossed more than $264 million and been seen by more
than 5.9 million theatergoers. It is a love story between an
American soldier and a young Vietnamese woman. Both Pryce and
Salonga won Tony Awards for their performances. The long-running
London production closed last October.

<HEADLINE> No Three Mile Island, Cancer Link  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A 13-year study of people living near the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant found no link between radiation
released during the 1979 accident and cancer deaths among nearby
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pittsburgh study, posted on the Internet on
Thursday, should give some reassurance to people who live near the
site of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. It does not
eliminate the need to continue monitoring their health, the lead
researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, triggered by equipment malfunction and operator
error on March 28, 1979, caused about a third of the nuclear fuel
to melt inside a reactor just outside Middletown, about 10 miles
from Harrisburg. The plant's owners maintain that only a negligible
amount of radiation escaped from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 other studies have explored the health effects of
the accident, but the University of Pittsburgh research covers the
longest time span so far -- from the time of the accident through
1992.
</P>
<P>
   It follows more than 32,000 people who lived within five miles
of the plant and who were interviewed by state health workers
within two months of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found no significant increase in cancer deaths among
nearby residents when compared to a larger population in three
counties surrounding the plant, said Evelyn Talbott, an associate
professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were unable to factor in other potential influences
on the results, nor were they able to say whether stress stemming
from the accident had a long-term impact on residents' health,
Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things that cause cancer and a lot of
things that need to be measured,'' she said. ''We can only measure
so many of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The study did find increases in certain types of cancer, but it
failed to turn up a link to the dosages of radiation that residents
were believed to have received, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said further study is needed. Many cancers can remain
latent for two decades or more, and the university's researchers
are obtaining the data needed for a 20-year study.
</P>
<P>
   One anti-nuclear activist, Eric Epstein, was skeptical of the
study, saying the state's original survey of residents was flawed.
He has called for studies extending 10 miles from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a recitation of the industry line. It is
absolutely nothing new,'' said Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   The study was posted on the Internet site of Environmental
Health Perspectives. The paper will appear in the June issue of the
journal, which is produced by the National Institute of
Environmental Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> Comic Revisits Kent St. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By AMY BETH GRAVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio (AP) -- Chuck Ayers still shakes whenever he remembers
that it could have been him.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the line of fire just minutes before National Guard
troops shot at anti-Vietnam War protesters 30 years ago at Kent
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings on May 4, 1970, killed four students and wounded
nine. Ayers, then a 22-year-old student, took pictures of the
protests for a photography class. He ducked into a campus building
just before the gunfire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as those times are to revisit, Ayers has decided to
talk about the shootings through his work as the illustrator for
the nationally syndicated comic strip ''Crankshaft.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of overwhelming for me,'' Ayers said. ''I'd always
been on the edges of it and suddenly with the strip out there, I'm
in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The strip, written by 1969 Kent State graduate Tom Batiuk, is
featuring a monthlong series about the shootings leading up to the
30th anniversary. The artists hope to educate young people about
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Batiuk said the comic tries not to place blame for the
shootings; he wants readers could draw their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to spotlight a particular aspect of our human
nature,'' Batiuk said. ''I tried to turn it into an engaging
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Thursday, Ayers plans to bring his 13-year-old daughter to
Kent State for a commemorative candlelight march.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll walk her through the campus and tell her the story
whether she wants to hear it or not,'' he said. ''This is hard for
me because she'll never fully understand the feelings of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the first time since the shootings that all of
the students who were wounded will be on campus together. They will
meet with the mothers of the four slain students -- Allison Krause,
Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer and William Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   In the comic series, the character Pam describes her memories of
being a Kent State student and photographing the events leading up
to the shootings. The story is told while Pam walks through the
campus with her opinionated father, Crankshaft, and her two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's pretty good at capturing the three generations. I
think the way it's playing out is absolutely fabulous,'' said Carol
Cartwright, Kent State president.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright was a 28-year-old teacher at Penn State University
when she heard about the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those heart-stopping moments when you're
absolutely drawn to the news to find out what happened,'' she said.
''It goes through your mind that it can't possibly be true, it
can't come to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis, a Kent State sociology professor who witnessed the
shootings, said he anticipates a renewed interest in the event
because ''Crankshaft'' is printed in more than 320 newspapers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cartoons are read by youngsters. I anticipate young people
asking 'Did this really happen this way?''' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The comic strip touched Alan Canfora so much that he sent copies
to the family of the slain students.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a very moving commentary of the tragic event of
May 4, 1970,'' said Canfora, who was shot in the wrist that day.
''I think it's a very rare thing that a cartoon strip reveals such
sensitivity.''

<HEADLINE> Theme Park Prices Keep Rising  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- After spending $48 million to build a new
roller coaster, a new hotel and a marina, officials at the Cedar
Point amusement park in Ohio have no problem raising the price of
admission by $5.
</P>
<P>
   They're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of going to an amusement park is rising all over, with
the average adult admission in North America increasing $2.70 over
last season to $37. That's the largest increase in seven years,
according to a survey of 30 theme parks by Amusement Business, a
trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said the increases are justified by the
investments parks have made in new and better rides.

<P>
   ''We supply a full day of entertainment for people of all
ages,'' said Robin Innes, a spokesman for Sandusky, Ohio-based
Cedar Point, which will have 68 rides and 14 roller coasters when
it opens for the season May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of an adult admission at Cedar Point is now $38.
</P>
<P>
   Some parks are also raising the price of children's tickets.
Last week, Disneyland began applying its adult price of $41 to
visitors 10 and older. The price previously started at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all visitors receive some kind of discount, said John
Graff, president of the International Association of Amusement
Parks and Attractions in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parks, even at these prices, are a very good value in what
you pay if you consider what it costs to go to a three-hour
football game or a two-hour baseball game or a night at the theater
to see 'Cats,''' Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks in Florida and California are among the costliest,
charging as much as $46 per adult. Parks in the Midwest, such as
Holiday World in Santa Claus, Ind., cost as little as $27 per
adult.
</P>
<P>
   Theme park attendance in the United States was at an all-time
high last year -- 309 million. Attendance has been increasing 3
percent to 5 percent a year during the past 20 years, Graff said.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags New England led the other parks in price increases,
jumping $6 to $33 per adult. Premier Parks has invested more than
$100 million in new rides and attractions since the company
purchased the park in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest prices increases -- $1 -- came from Dollywood in Pigeon
Forge, Tenn. and the big theme parks in Orlando: Walt Disney World,
Universal Florida and SeaWorld Orlando. The Orlando theme parks now
charge $46 per adult.
</P>
<P>
   Dollywood, which now charges $31 per adult, recently built
Dreamland Forest, a $5 million play area for children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly don't raise prices just to raise prices,'' said
Jill Thompson, a Dollywood spokeswoman. ''We raise it based on the
investment we've made in the park.''

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan News Photographer Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A Guatemalan newspaper photographer was
shot and killed Thursday during violent street protests against bus
fare increases in which three other people reportedly died.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Martinez, 37, who was covering the weeklong protests for
the Guatemala City newspaper Prensa Libre, was killed when a
private security guard fired at students allegedly looting a
business, said Prensa Libre's news editor, Conrado Monroy.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men died of unspecified injuries at San Juan de Dios
General Hospital, a hospital public relations employee said. The
Radio Sonora station also said a woman shot alongside Martinez had
died of her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   President Alfonso Portillo, in an address to the nation, said he
lamented Martinez' death and set a deadline of noon Friday for
privately owned bus companies to roll back the fare increases or
face a government takeover of their lines.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reports had indicated that 18 people, including two
other journalists, were wounded in the hours-long protests on
Thursday, said Fernanda Castejon, spokeswoman for Portillo. Several
received gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the wounded was Alexander Garcia, a cameraman for
Guatemala's Channel 7 television station, who suffered gunshot
wounds to his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Security guard Gustavo Garcia Rosales fired seven times into the
crowd with a 12-gauge shotgun, National Civil Police spokesman
Faustino Sanchez said. Another guard, Luis Fernando Ramirez, fired
a 9 mm pistol. Both were arrested after hundreds of protesters and
others gathered outside the mall to demand the guards be handed
over to them.
</P>
<P>
   The guard was part of a security detail employed at a local
shopping mall which the protesters apparently were trying to loot.
Other guards also apparently fired their weapons during the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters and others gathered outside the mall
after the shooting to demand that the guard be handed over to them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hundreds of riot police, backed up by a vehicle
equipped with a water cannon, were dispatched to the downtown area
to try to control the protests.
</P>
<P>
   The protests broke out after the government ignored demands by
university students in Guatemala City for a cancellation of a
recent fare increase of 25 to 36 percent in public transportation.

<HEADLINE> Mandela in First Visit to Burundi  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- In his first visit to Burundi, former
South African President Nelson Mandela will step into his role as
peace mediator and try to convince the reluctant Tutsi-led army to
complete a power-sharing agreement with Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The army and the rebels have been battling for seven years in a
civil conflict that has left more than 200,000 people dead. Most
Burundians blame it on politicians and officers who refuse to
relinquish their tight grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's visit today will include an address to the army
command and parliament, but he will focus on convincing soldiers to
sign on to an agreement worked out during 22 months of peace
negotiations in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mandela is coming to convince those still reluctant to commit
themselves to the peace accord,'' said Therence Nahimana, a leading
Hutu parliamentarian. ''There is a need to go from options to
solutions. The quickest way is to convince people to sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still not finalized, the agreement centers on who will
lead a transitional government, the design of an electoral system
for a country with a significant Hutu majority and Tutsi minority,
and on the integration of Hutu rebels into the Tutsi-dominated
army.
</P>
<P>
   Although the peace talks have involved as many as 19 political
parties and interest groups, the key players in Burundi are the
army and two leading political parties, one dominated by Hutus and
the other by Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   The latest conflict goes back to 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu who won Burundi's first
democratic elections that propelled his party to power but also
spread panic among the Tutsis who had controlled the army, economy
and government since independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela will meet for just 10 minutes with President Pierre
Buyoya, a retired Tutsi major who took power for the second time in
a bloodless coup in July 1996, according to the schedule made
available by the government.
</P>
<P>
   At least six political parties involved in the Arusha
negotiations have objected to Mandela's visit, arguing it will lend
support to Buyoya and the army.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsi extremists, who object to sharing power with Hutu rebels
without having those suspected of mass killings prosecuted, called
for a public rally today to protest the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he is coming with a good message for us. It is a very
important visit, albeit short,'' army spokesman Col. Longin Minani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Minani said the country was calm after a recent spate of rebel
attacks outside Bujumbura that left at least 66 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela took over the Burundi negotiations last year after the
October death of his predecessor, former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere, who never visited Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Iteka, the leading human right group that often exposes
atrocities committed by the army and the rebels, said Mandela's
visit is too short to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several hours of audiences with officials alone will not
guarantee your success,'' Iteka said in a letter to Mandela,
inviting him to meet with civil society members and visit a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said no such visits were planned.

<HEADLINE> Families Evacuated in S. Carolina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Police blocked off streets and
evacuated residents after an explosion Thursday at an ice company
plant released ammonia gas. At least two people were taken to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were unsure what caused the blast at the Triangle
Ice Co., which was reported at about 9:30 p.m. Police said ammonia
is used as a coolant in machinery that makes ice.
</P>
<P>
   Two people -- a police officer and a resident -- were taken to
area hospitals Thursday night after being overcome by fumes, Mayor
Keith Summey said. The police officer was treated and released. The
mayor did not know the other victim's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Summey said residents were cleared from a mobile home park, with
officers going door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy fog-like cloud could be seen about midnight coming up
from behind the building.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things seem to be settling down,'' said City Councilman Kurt
Taylor, who lives near the plant. ''People are just going to go in
and do the forensics, see what happened and try to get things
capped off. I'm not concerned at all.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Workers Face Uncertainty  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCTURUS, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Judge Yokonia worries that his job on
a white-owned farm might vanish in the violent fight over land in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   If the government follows through on its plan to seize white
farmland and redistribute it to landless blacks, Yokonia and
Zimbabwe's 300,000 other farm workers are likely to lose their jobs
and a way to support relatives who depend on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be stranded,'' said Yokonia, a mechanic on the
Glinockie Farm, which has yet to be targeted by black squatters
occupying 1,000 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Other farms, though, have been hit by violence.
</P>
<P>
   Two farm workers were killed and more than a dozen injured when
militants from President Robert Mugabe's ruling party attacked a
banana plantation Tuesday near the lakeshore town of Kariba, 230
miles northwest of Harare, farm representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Militant ruling party supporters accuse farm workers of giving
in to pressure from white farmers to vote against a new
constitution and to support the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution, which failed in a February referendum, would
have allowed the government to seize white farms without paying
compensation. Ruling party lawmakers passed a bill allowing those
seizures anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If the farms are taken away, farm workers such as Yokonia would
not only lose their families' only source of income, but they would
lose their homes on the farms.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Yokonia admits he is angry with the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am angry in my mind, but I can't show them, otherwise they
might do something to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 200 youths carrying whips, sticks and rocks set at
least 30 farm workers' homes on fire and vandalized others on
another farm in the Arcturus district. A man directing the violence
said they were attacking the farm because it was a hotbed of
opposition activity.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the violence has not touched Glinockie Farm, which
produces peas, maize and flowers. A nearby cattle farm has also
been spared.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Muchidzuwa, who works with Yokonia, wonders what the
government will do with the workers if it seizes their farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't need us here, where are we going to go? They
must find a place for us as well,'' Muchidzuwa said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to move his wife and four children to his mothers' tiny
house if he loses his job.
</P>
<P>
   Muchidzuwa, who already cannot afford enough food for his
children, does not know how he would feed them or pay their schools
fees. He worries that his oldest son, who is 15, will resort to
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know what will happen tomorrow,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Other Parents Wonder About Elian  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Tom Sylvester, whose little girl was
spirited to Austria by his ex-wife more than four years ago, it was
bittersweet when government agents seized Elian Gonzalez in Miami
and reunited him with his father.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased to see Juan Miguel Gonzalez regain custody of his
son but embittered that government authorities have not shown
anywhere near the same resolve in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester's Austrian-born ex-wife took off for her homeland with
their 13-month old daughter in October 1995 despite a U.S. court
order granting him custody of the child. His contacts with the girl
since then have been limited to brief, supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   He is among thousands of American parents who have been victims
in international child abduction cases. The State Department's
Bureau on Consular affairs has active files on more than 1,100
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike in Elian's case, these parents have not benefited
from the personal intervention of the attorney general, from agents
beating down doors, from government-provided planes and
psychiatrists, or from extraordinary diplomatic maneuverings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was disheartening that so many federal resources went into
the return of a Cuban child to a Cuban father when the pleas of so
many parents for assistance in the return of their American
children are ignored by the federal government,'' Sylvester said by
phone from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester's grief is shared by Tom Johnson, a State Department
lawyer who has had a running battle with the Consular Affairs
bureau since his Swedish-born former wife ignored a custody order
and took off for Sweden with their daughter Amanda in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, has had only limited contact with his daughter, now 12.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the Elian case, Johnson said he was struck by the
''extraordinary time and effort'' the government devoted to it
compared with ''the lack of significant effort to bringing American
children back home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has spent more than $578,000 on the Elian
Gonzalez case, including Saturday's raid, since the 6-year-old
Cuban boy was rescued from the Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving,
officials said Thursday. The city of Miami spent $1 million, most
for police overtime, even before the street disorder set off by the
boy's seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, much less attention has been paid to efforts by
another passenger on the sunken refugee boat with Elian, Arianne
Horta, to have her daughter back in Cuba join her in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Virginia-based lawyer, Jim Cottrell, says there is a
stronger legal case for the administration to help his client than
there is for assisting Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Sweden belongs to the Hague Convention, which requires
member states to ''secure the prompt return of children wrongfully
removed to or retained in'' another member country and to respect
custody arrangements. It also specifies that the child be returned
to the country of ''habitual residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has not signed the Hague Convention but this has not
deterred the administration from assisting Elian's father. In part,
Washington wants to cooperate so as not to jeopardize its own
efforts to retrieve American children who are abducted to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is no fan of Attorney General Janet Reno, who authorized
the raid. ''Reno has not given American parents the time of day,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Marshall, director of the children's affairs office in the
State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, acknowledged the
frustration of left-behind parents. She said the bureau has become
far more active in helping them and staff has doubled since late
1998, with more increases planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing more and more,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester spoke admiringly of the raid, comparing it with a
failed Austrian effort to reunite him with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Early one Friday morning in May 1996, he said, six
court-appointed officials went to the home of his former wife and
daughter in an attempt to enforce an Austrian Supreme Court order
granting him custody.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester said that moments after the knock on the door, little
Carina was hustled out the back door in the arms of her
grandmother. There was no further enforcement effort and, he said,
the same court that had granted Sylvester final custody reversed
itself later on grounds that the child had assimilated into
Austrian society and should stay there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think any parent who is denied access to (a) child is going
to say that we are not doing enough,'' Marshall said. ''They always
think we can do more.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits there is room for improvement, and the General
Accounting Office concurs. The GAO, Congress's investigative arm,
said in a report in March that left-behind parents need a more
aggressive advocacy from the State and Justice departments.

GDP Is Growing at 5.4 Percent

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew robustly as the country's total
output of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the January-March quarter, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But that sparked fresh inflation worries among
economists and investors. Workers enjoyed the biggest jump in wages and benefits
in 10 years. Consumer spending led the way by posting its largest increase in
nearly 17 years. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose sharply, reflecting
higher energy prices.

Three More Papers Shut in Iran

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners shut down three more newspapers
Thursday, including one owned by reformist President Mohammad Khatami's brother,
pressing their campaign against publications that have fueled public support for
reform. About 200 students demonstrated against the closures at the Shahid
Beheshti University in northern Tehran in the early hours of Friday, said an
Iranian journalist. The media closures, now numbering 16, are hampering
Khatami's allies' political ambitions. Only one reformist paper remained
publishing Thursday as campaigning started for the May 5 run-off elections,
which will decide 66 seats in the 290-seat parliament, or Majlis.

<HEADLINE> Franco, Kuehne Share Houston Lead  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE WOODLANDS, Texas (AP) -- Carlos Franco had the field covered
in the first round of the Shell Houston Open -- except for Hank
Kuehne, the last player to tee off.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, with an early tee time, shot a 7-under-par 65 over the
par-72, 7,018-yard Tournament Players Course, giving him the early
advantage until Kuehne excelled later in the day and took a share
of the 1-shot lead Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been working hard on my game. It comes as easily as it
goes,'' Kuehne said. ''Honestly, it seems like another day of work.
You come in each day and the emotions are the same. It's great to
be the co-leader, but the emotions are the same if I shoot 7 under
or 3 over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Sutherland, Craig Stadler, Brian Gay and Jerry Smith
opened with 66s, and Doug Barron, Fred Funk, Dave Stockton Jr. and
Paul Stankowski shot 67s.
</P>
<P>
   Franco avoids the driving range and shows up as late as possible
for rounds, and his formula worked Thursday. He had eight birdies
and one bogey, equaling the 65 he shot in the first round of the
Honda Classic, his low round this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Practice? No, no, no, I come here to play golf, not for
practice,'' Franco said. ''I just like to come in and do a little
training (stretching), go to the putting green and hit a ball.
Okay, vamos (Let's go).''
</P>
<P>
   Franco had 15-foot birdie putts on the fourth and fifth holes,
and his only bogey came on No. 10. He kept his 3-wood in the
fairway, but his 9-iron hooked. He chipped for a par, but missed.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne got a late start, but he was quickly in the race. He had
pars on the first two holes and then ran in birdies on seven of the
next eight holes to tie Franco for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne bogeyed the par 4 fourth hole, dropping a shot back, but
he birdied again at No. 8 to tie for the lead. Keuhne, the 1998
U.S. Amateur champion, turned pro in last June. His best tour
finish was a tie for 29th in the Air Canada Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne got a sponsor's exemption into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the starts that I had last year and the events that I
played in, I feel a lot more comfortable here,'' Kuehne said.
''It's a great place to be. I dreamed about it since I was a kid
and I'm just like a kid in a candy store out here on the range.''

   Stadler had the second double-eagle 2 on the PGA Tour this year,
holing a 245-yard 3-wood shot in the 521-yard 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter where it was, I knew I'd have a putt for an eagle,''
Stadler said. ''It just flew right of the fringe and took a little
bounce. I couldn't see it from there. It went kind of down over

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Southern Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas attacked military outposts in
southern Lebanon on Friday, killing four Israeli-allied militiamen
and wounding three others, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas carried out an early morning raid on the Aramta
outpost, one of several crossing points linking the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon with the rest of the
country, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion destroyed the outpost, killing four members of the
South Lebanon Army, a militia paid and armed by Israel to help its
troops patrol the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports on the cause of the explosion.
Security officials said guerrillas infiltrated the position and
planted explosives. Others said a car bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
which escalated tensions in southern Lebanon amid efforts to smooth
Israel's troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the attack, which came amid a series of
hit-and-run raids by guerrillas, Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese security officials said two Israeli jets fired two
missiles near Rihan, just south of Aramta. Black smoke billowed
from the area. There was no immediate word of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese guerrillas are believed to use the area to infiltrate
the occupied zone and attack Israeli troops and allied militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military confirmed the air raid and said all planes
returned safely to the base.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group said its guerrillas ''scored
direct hits'' with rockets and mortars on the edge of the occupied
zone in Aramta. It was not clear whether that included the
explosion at the Aramta outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli gunners also fired artillery at suspected guerrilla
positions on the outskirts of the market town of Nabatiyeh to the
southwest, the officials said. There was no immediate word on
casualties from the shelling.
</P>
<P>
   In another statement issued in Nabatiyeh, Hezbollah claimed
rocket attacks on Dabshe, Tohra and Sweida, a cluster of hilly
positions manned by Israeli and SLA militiamen. It did not give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials confirmed the attacks and said they had no
reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust the 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 Israeli-backed militiamen controlling the
occupied zone, which Israel intends to vacate by July. Israel set
up the zone in 1985 to shield its northern territory from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Webber, Kings Struggle Offensively  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Webber shot from inside and outside,
but the result was the same. Not much was falling for him or the
rest of the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   And you can't beat the Los Angeles Lakers if you aren't scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had 22 points on 8 of 28 field-goal shooting in the
Kings' 113-89 loss to the Lakers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This loss hasn't sunk in. I hate to lose,'' Webber said. ''We
have to raise our level and now we get the home court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings return home for Game 3 Sunday trailing 2-0 in the
best-of-five first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to go to him, but it's just not Chris,'' Kings
coach Rick Adelman said. ''We have to have other people really get
involved and do some things so the whole load is not on his
shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this season, the Kings had trouble scoring
against a team they beat once in four regular-season meetings. In
three of those games, including the one victory, the Kings scored
more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not play very well offensively and that probably
surprised me the most because we've been able to score against this
team,'' Adelman said. ''They shut us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Webber had a career playoff high 28 points despite foul trouble
in Sacramento's 117-107 loss in Game 1 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he logged a grueling 41 minutes, the most of any
Kings player, and picked up just one foul. Webber also had 12
rebounds and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got to find a way to get him inside a little bit more where
he can take it to them. I really think he has the advantage
there,'' Adelman said. ''I don't worry about Chris. He's been the
rock for us for two years and he had a tough night shooting, but
he'll respond Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any time Webber or the rest of the Kings try to go
inside, they find Shaquille O'Neal waiting for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a big body and a big presence down there, but you still
have to be able to have the confidence to go in at him,'' Corliss
Williamson said. ''We got him a couple fouls early in the game and
we kind of got away from that. We have to continue to take it to
him and hopefully he can get in foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were expecting the same Kings that scored in triple
digits against them during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know they had their expectations of coming and giving us a
game,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ''We were set up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kobe Bryant had a career playoff high 32 points and the
Lakers ran away after the Kings got within two points with 7{
minutes left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento scored just three points the rest of the quarter and
trailed 56-41 at halftime. Webber had a shot blocked by Robert
Horry, then Jason Williams was blocked by O'Neal as the Lakers
restored their double-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You work on Shaq and A.C. Green and Horry are slipping in and
getting rebounds,'' Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of being down 2-0 was obvious in a subdued Kings
dressing room, where players hurried to change and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it. It's not like we have a seven-game series or
something. We have to win,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think guys are going to come out and try to put it all on
the line, which we should have been doing the past two games.
Hopefully, we'll all respond and come back hard Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Town officials call for congressional investigation of Pequotrecognition process  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) -- The mayor of Ledyard and the first
selectman of North Stonington are calling for a congressional
investigation into the process by which the Mashantucket Pequot
tribe was granted federal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots received federal recognition in 1983 through a
Special Act of Congress. That allowed them to establish a
reservation and enter into a gambling compact with the state.
</P>
<P>
   They now operate a multibillion-dollar empire that includes the
Foxwoods Resort Casino, which opened in 1992 and is the world's
largest casino.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the reservation's neighboring towns on Thursday
told The Day of New London that a federal investigation is
warranted because of new information uncovered by author Jeff
Benedict and contained in his book ''Without Reservation: The
Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and Foxwoods, the
World's Largest Casino.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Benedict claims the present-day Mashantuckets have
no verifiable Pequot ancestry. It claims that some members,
specifically the family of former tribal chairman Skip Hayward,
have a thin blood relationship to the historic Narragansetts.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict claims that when the U.S. Congress bypassed the Bureau
of Indian Affairs to recognize the Mashantuckets and put an end to
the tribe's land claims Congress never investigated whether the
contemporary tribe descends from the historic Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the least we can do is ask for an investigation by
Congress,'' said Ledyard Mayor Wesley Johnson. ''They need to look
at this. They were deceived by the Mashantuckets.''
</P>
<P>
   North Stonington First Selectman Nicholas H. Mullane agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a well-researched book,'' said Mullane. ''It's
amazing, when you put all the pieces together, from start to
finish, what you come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequots were not prepared to comment on the
book Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tribe is reviewing the book. Until that is completed, well
have nothing to say,'' said Bruce MacDonald, the tribe's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Preston, First Selectman Robert Congdon said he was
about halfway through the book, and found it interesting, but not
startling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've heard a lot of this before. We cried foul from early
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congdon said his ''gut'' instinct is that Congress should look
into the tribe's origins and the establishment of its reservation,
but he is not ready to call for an investigation at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to address the book with our legal counsel in
Washington,'' he said. ''I'd want to talk about what actions there
are, if any.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a gaming compact between the Pequots and the state,
Connecticut receives 25 percent of the slot earnings at Foxwoods.
In March that was $16.2 million.

GDP Is Growing at 5.4 Percent

output of goods and services, called the gross domestic product, rose at an
annual rate of 5.4 percent during the January-March quarter, the Commerce
Department said Thursday. But that sparked fresh inflation worries among
economists and investors. Workers enjoyed the biggest jump in wages and benefits
in 10 years. Consumer spending led the way by posting its largest increase in
nearly 17 years. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP rose sharply, reflecting
higher energy prices.

<HEADLINE> HUD Sued Over Smith &AMP; Wesson Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A lawsuit by gun makers has deepened
the rift between Smith &AMP; Wesson and the rest of the largely unified
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's leading pistol maker, has been
charting its own way since entering into a landmark safety
agreement with the government March 17. The Springfield-based
manufacturer promised to install safety locks, demand background
checks on gun-show buyers and work on making guns that can be fired
only by their owner.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the industry, so far, is resisting.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, gun makers and a trade group sued the federal
government and 16 cities. They say the government is illegally
squelching trade by encouraging city police departments to buy
Smith &AMP; Wesson guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smith &AMP; Wesson has rewarded the bullying tactic of the
government through capitulation,'' Jeff Reh, a lawyer for Beretta
U.S.A. in Accokeek, Md., said Thursday. ''The gun industry is
unified. The only people who have taken a separate path are Smith &AMP;
Wesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, had expected some other gun makers to sign
on, said Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman Ken Jorgensen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were going to be some upset consumers. There were going
to be some upset dealers,'' he said. ''I think we have been
surprised by the reaction of some of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not directly target Smith &AMP; Wesson. But it
implicates the gun maker because competitors feel the government is
trying to ''coerce these other manufacturers to sign onto this
code,'' said Doug Painter, director of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, a trade group that took the lead in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if it was not expressed totally overtly, the idea of a
buying preference ... was at least in the back of everyone's mind''
when the safety code was negotiated, said Paul Jannuzzo, vice
president of Smyrna, Ga.-based Glock gun makers. ''Everybody on
both sides thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jorgensen denied that, adding, ''We have no control over
whether someone gives us preferential treatment or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials announced Thursday that 190 local governments
have joined in a pact giving preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson guns.
Officials have also agreed to drop the company from municipal
lawsuits challenging the safety and marketing practices of the gun
industry.

<HEADLINE> Jury convicts former Wall Street executive in insider tradingscandal  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An X-rated movie actress will vigorously defend
herself despite the conviction of a former top Wall Street
executive accused of feeding her inside information on stocks, her
lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Howard Shapiro, said Kathryn Gannon remains in
Canada, at least temporarily out of the reach of an indictment
bearing her name in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he was disappointed with Thursday's conviction of
James McDermott Jr., the executive, and codefendant Anthony
Pomponio of all but one of eight counts in an indictment charging
conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if it were correct, however, it does not follow that
Kathryn Gannon is guilty of the charges brought against her.
Indeed, she is not and she intends to contest them vigorously,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said the Department of Justice must decide whether it
will pursue plans to extradite Gannon, who is a Canadian citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking it one step at a time. I expect her to eventually
appear in a courtroom somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, held his head high as the jury forewoman notified the court
of the conviction. McDermott was a frequent guest on financial
programs in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He had appeared relaxed throughout a trial that featured
repeated references to his extramarital affair with Gannon, who
performs in X-rated movies under the name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood set sentencing for July 17 on
charges that could bring up to 10 years in prison for McDermott,
48, of Briarcliff Manor, and Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had directed before the trial that Gannon would only
be referred to as an actress, a model and a dancer who sometimes
goes by the stage name ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Two jurors who declined to identify themselves said outside
court that they did not know Gannon was a porn star and that it
would not have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   One male juror, though, smiled slightly and added, ''We didn't
think she was the Queen of England.''
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, the star of features including ''Fantasies of Marylin,''
''Pumped,'' ''The Violation of Marylin Star'' and ''Sins of the
Flesh,'' does not have any business in the United States since she
has quit the X-rated movie business, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said McDermott and Pomponio were each having an
extramarital affair with Gannon. The men did not meet each other
until their arrests, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged McDermott gave Gannon secret information
about six stocks, allowing her to buy bank stocks that were about
to skyrocket in value after public announcements of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused of giving the information to Pomponio, the owner
of a New Jersey quartz- and glass-cutting company who met Gannon at
an adult trade show in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio and Gannon, 30, who has a home in Miami, Fla.,
allegedly made $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged McDermott, a $4 million-a-year executive,
gave Gannon more than $150,000 to gamble with in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, McDermott's lawyer, Denis McInerney, referred
to his client as a ''rocket scientist on bank stocks'' and admitted
that McDermott gave Gannon tips on stocks -- but only before he
learned the stocks involved merger deals. McDermott and McInerney
declined to comment after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In final remarks to the jury before deliberations, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Alex Young Oh questioned whether McDermott's motives
could be considered innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think that's how it really happened?'' Oh asked. ''Come
on. She was the actress, dancer and model. He was the stud stock
picker.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was something more to this scheme than just the money.
Maybe McDermott was trying to impress her. This is a way for him to
show her what he did. Maybe it was a macho thing,'' Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   Pomponio's lawyer, Thomas Dunn, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   He said his client was ''pretty devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I really got to know the man and I really didn't buy the
government's case. I don't believe he did anything wrong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Duffy, president of McDermott's former firm, said
business had not been affected by the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there is any way to describe it other than a
personal tragedy,'' Duffy told The New York Times. ''The guy had it
all and threw it all away.''

<HEADLINE> Albert Pirro says Westchester DA is victim of smear  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Westchester District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro is still just a suburban prosecutor because of a federal
smear campaign, her much-investigated husband says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration's investigative tactics into
campaigns that are being run by Republicans'' have derailed Mrs.
Pirro's career, Albert Pirro said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows that my wife could have been and should have
been a statewide candidate for political office by now,'' Pirro
said at a news conference. ''The only thing that has held her back
is the fact that her husband ... has been subjected to constant
spotlight, scrutiny and criticism for business transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White had no comment, spokesman Herb
Haddad said.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro, one of the state's top lobbyists and a major
Republican fund-raiser, spoke the day after prosecutors alleged
that a loan taken out by Jeanine Pirro in 1993, ostensibly to buy a
$40,000 Mercedes, was ''an empty financial transaction, a sham''
used by her husband to cover up tax fraud. Albert Pirro said the
allegation was ''evidence of the prosecution's campaign to smear
the Westchester district attorney and to derail her career.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pirro, Westchester County's biggest vote-getter, a national
TV commentator and a veteran of People magazine's ''50 Most
Beautiful People'' list, has never been charged in the case. She
will not comment until the case is concluded, said spokeswoman Anne
Marie Corbalis.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pirro has often been mentioned for higher office, but her
husband's refusal to divulge information about his business, a
paternity suit against him, a fruitless bribery investigation and
the tax case have been roadblocks to her career.
</P>
<P>
   The tax case alleges that Albert Pirro and his brother Anthony,
who was his accountant, conspired to hide about $1 million in
Albert Pirro's income by masking personal expenses as business
deductions. Albert Pirro says he has paid all the back taxes and
blames his brother for bad tax returns. His brother blames him.
</P>
<P>
   Though the indictment alleges that many of the expenses were
family-oriented, like vacations, baby sitters, toys and veterinary
expenses, the alleged loan arrangement is the closest connection so
far between the district attorney and her husband's tax case.
</P>
<P>
   The new court papers say that Albert Pirro, in the name of one
of his many companies, leased a 1989 Mercedes-Benz for his wife in
late 1988. The lease payments were fraudulently deducted as
business expenses through 1992, although the car was used by Mrs.
Pirro, then a county judge, ''for personal purposes,'' the papers
say.
</P>
<P>
   She took out a $41,000 loan in January 1993 and paid her
husband's company $39,470 from her personal account. However, the
prosecution says, the company made the payments on Mrs. Pirro's
loan and paid it off entirely in November 1993, the month she was
elected district attorney. It then sold the car to a dealership for
$32,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loan taken by Jeanine Pirro was an empty financial
transaction, a sham intended to make it look like Jeanine Pirro had
purchased the vehicle ... and was responsible for the payments,''
the papers say.

<HEADLINE> Sentencing for killer mom delayed, judge to consider abuse impact  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- LeRoy Leubner came to court wanting to see
his ex-wife sent to jail for burning down her house with the
couple's 13-year-old autistic son inside.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased, though, that Cayuga County Judge Peter Corning
instead adjourned the sentencing and agreed to hear evidence of
domestic abuse regarding Michelle Davis, who claims she killed her
son to stop him from raping and abusing her.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' attorney asked for the last-minute adjournment so Corning
could consider whether Davis was responsible for her actions
because of the alleged abuse she suffered. If Davis' case meets the
criteria under the state's domestic abuse laws, she could receive a
significantly lighter sentence, including immediate probation.
</P>
<P>
   Leubner said Davis made up the rape allegations to obtain
leniency. He said his son, although big at 5-foot-7, 155 pounds,
was not violent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Danny was convicted of a crime and has never had a chance to
defend himself. None of this is true and a hearing will give us a
chance to challenge her lies,'' Leubner said outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   First-degree manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years
but it was expected Davis was going to receive a term of between
three to five years Thursday. Leubner is confident the hearing will
undermine Davis' story and convince the judge she should receive a
longer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''She deserves to spend a lot more time in jail for what she
did. If we have to wait a little longer to see that happen, we can
wait,'' Leubner said
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors at one time considered bringing death
penalty charges against the 37-year-old Davis, she was allowed to
plead guilty in March to first-degree manslaughter and use an
''affirmative defense,'' which holds that she suffered from
''extreme emotional disturbance'' the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Davis admitted using a candle and nail polish remover to start a
fire in her Fleming home last Sept. 4, killing her 13-year-old son,
Daniel Leubner, who was asleep on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Her plea came several days after a closed four-day hearing on
whether to suppress her statement as evidence. It was later
revealed for the first time that in her statement, Davis alleged
her son had raped her and beaten her on several occasions,
including the night of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they investigated Davis' claim and found no evidence
to back up her allegation of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Corning will hold a hearing in late May or early June. The judge
rejected a proposal from Davis' lawyers to use a transcript of the
closed hearing instead of calling back witnesses to testify.
Defense attorneys said they could have their case ready by next
Wednesday if they were permitted ot use the transcript as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney James Vargason opposed using testimony from
the closed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't cross-examine a transcript,'' Vargason said after
court.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney David Elkovitch said testimony would focus on
the effects of post-traumatic stress syndrome and rape trauma
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Davis remains free on bail pending her sentencing.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were higher in early trading today.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32 points in the early

3-to-2 lead over decliners.

   Market-watchers are encouraged by Wall Street's ability to rally

   Strange as it may seem, the news of a potential uptick in

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 39; Dow Down 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today, with
technology shares rising for the second straight day while
blue-chip stocks came under selling pressure amid concerns over
rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq
composite index was up 39.30 at 3,731.87. The Dow Jones industrial
average was down 65.46 at 10,822.64.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 2.07 at 1,462.85.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were led by a rally semiconductor shares.
Intel gained 2 11/16 to 128, Broadcom rose 3\ to 174 and PMC-Sierra
jumped 9 5/16 to 189 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in the high-tech sector couldn't prop up the
broader market, which was weighed down by fears of rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes rose
last month even faster than spending, something that hasn't
happened since October.
</P>
<P>
   But although people made more money last month, they didn't put
significantly more away in savings. The report showed that personal
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- only
rose slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a record low of 0.2
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   That provided another sign that the economy continues to grow at
a brisk pace, another factor for the Federal Reserve to consider at
their policy-making meeting on May 16. Most economists expect the
Fed to raise interest rates for the sixth time since June as they
attempt to keep inflationary pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has a governor on it right now ... it's called the
Fed meeting next month,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Until
that meeting, there will be a lid on the upside of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 129.95 million
shares, down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index up 4.23 at 498.81.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.25 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.09 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 2.31 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
2.78 percent.

<HEADLINE> Body of kidnapped consultant found strangled, burned in NJ swamp  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A New Jersey man could face the death
penalty in Kentucky for kidnapping a British computer consultant
who was found dead in a New Jersey swamp with marks indicating he
had been strangled and set afire.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the suspect, Gregory J. Marcinski,
impersonated an FBI agent to kidnap Paul Jeffrey Gale because Gale
was dating Marcinski's former lover.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, 23, of Brick, has been held without bail since April
20, three days after Gale was reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   Gale's shirtless body was found about 2 a.m. Thursday in a
shallow grave two miles from Marcinski's residence, said FBI
Special Agent Garey S. Chin. It bore ''ligature markings'' on the
neck and burn marks from a flammable liquid, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found after Marcinski's housemate, Preston C. Foray
Jr., was arrested Wednesday night and gave agents the location, the
FBI said in a court filing. Foray, 21, admitted helping Marcinski
hide the body, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners suspect the victim died of strangulation, but
a final determination and positive identification might not be made
until next week, FBI Special Agent Sandra Carroll, a spokeswoman
for the Newark office, said today.
</P>
<P>
   The body was ''burnt beyond facial recognition,'' leaving
medical examiners to seek Gale's dental records and DNA from his
twin brother in their efforts to confirm his identity, Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale, 28, who lived in Naples, Fla., was awakened by Marcinski
and kidnapped April 17 from his hotel room in Florence, Ky., but
investigators do not yet know where he was killed, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski told Foray that he killed the man after driving around
with him for about an hour, Foray told agents, according to papers
filed Thursday by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''The understanding, at this point, is that it occurred
somewhere between Kentucky and New Jersey. The exact point is
unknown,'' said Linda Tally Smith, an assistant commonwealth
attorney for Boone County, Ky. Regardless of the location, Kentucky
can charge Marcinski with murder because the crime originated
there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is awaiting autopsy results and other information
before deciding whether to charge Marcinski with murder, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will probably become a capital case, but we're still
looking at it,'' Smith said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marcinski is being held in the Monmouth County, N.J.,
jail awaiting extradition to Kentucky on state kidnapping charges
and a federal charge of impersonating an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Foray, who lived at the home of Marcinski's grandmother, does
not face Kentucky charges, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Foray told agents on Wednesday that when he saw Marcinski on
April 17, Marcinski disclosed the kidnapping and showed him the
body in the trunk of Marcinski's grandmother's Buick, according to
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Foray spoke softly and kept his head bowed during a brief
appearance before U.S. Magistrate John Hughes in Trenton on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes set bail at $1 million, but said he would release Foray
on $90,000 in property bonds from his parents on the condition that
he live and work with his father in Point Pleasant and wear an
electronic monitoring device.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the judge ordered Foray to spend Thursday night
in protective custody at the Monmouth County Jail, where Marcinski
is also being held.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michael E. Wilbert told the judge his client is
''despondent,'' and said Foray could face a ''catastrophic result''
in jail without protective custody. He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Foray faces up to 15 years in federal prison if found guilty of
accessory after the fact of a kidnapping, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Treby Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a volunteer emergency medical technician, flashed an
EMT badge and computer-generated FBI credentials to gain access to
Gale's room at the Holiday Inn in Florence, a city across the Ohio
River from Cincinnati, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Gale recently lived in Mount Laurel, N.J., where he worked as a
computer programmer for TRW Integrated Supply. He was working for
TRW in Kentucky this month as a consultant in the merger of two
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Marcinski became enraged that Gale had been
dating his ex-girlfriend, Darla Guidie, and drove the Buick 800
miles to Kentucky to confront Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski identified himself as Special Agent ''Trimble'' and
handcuffed Gale before placing him in the front seat of the Buick
in the early morning hours of April 17, authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   Guidie told the FBI that Marcinski made the fake identification
on his computer and ''bragged that he had gotten the format for the
phony FBI credentials off of the Internet,'' according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   She had a restraining order against Marcinski, said John Mercun,
the executive assistant prosecutor for Ocean County, where Brick is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski, a member of the Community First Aid Squad and a
self-employed computer technician, was also arrested last August
when another ex-girlfriend told police he assaulted her and grabbed
her new boyfriend by the neck, pushing him to the floor, the Asbury
Park Press of Neptune reported.

   PESARO, Italy (AP) -- Benelli, an Italian motorcycle and motor
scooter manufacturer, has agreed to build a line of scooters for
Renault that will bear the French automaker's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still don't know how many units will be produced in total.
It's for Renault to decide according to their sales plan,''
Benelli's president, Andrea Merloni, said Friday.

   Benelli will build the scooters at its Pesaro factory in central

<P>
   Didier Marsaud, spokesman for Renault SA in Boulogne, France
refused to say how much the agreement was worth and would not
specify the number of vehicles Benelli will produce on behalf of
Renault.
</P>
<P>
   Renault will take sole charge of worldwide distribution for the
scooters, which will make their appearance in the first half of

<HEADLINE> French Heirs Seek Texas Matisse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A Matisse painting acquired a half-century ago by
a Texas family may have been among hundreds of works stolen by
Nazis from a French art collector.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 heirs of Alphonse Kann are tracing the chain of ownership
for the 1907 oil-on-canvas landscape, ''La Riviere aux Aloes''
(Brook With Aloes), by Henri Matisse. It has been on display in
Houston's Menil Collection since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Warin of Paris, Kann's great-nephew, contacted the
museum in a letter last July.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing research on the piece, as is Warin,'' Menil
director Ned Rifkin told the Houston Chronicle for a story
published today. ''We want to do what is right and best, and we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Warin has spent several years trying to track more than 1,000
artworks seized by German occupying forces from Kann in a 1940 raid
on the collector's home near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Matisse work, part of the Houston display of 20th-century
art, was acquired in 1950 by John and Dominique de Menil. Their
private art collection is housed in the museum that bears their
name.
</P>
<P>
   Paris' Le Monde reported in October that the Houston Matisse oil
appeared in photographs of Kann's home taken before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Kann estate has already recovered two Pablo Picasso oils
from French and Swiss collections. The estate also initiated claims
to two other Picassos -- one at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
and another owned by a French regional museum -- and has sued to
reacquire other works.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to return plundered Nazi art to its rightful owners have
intensified recently. Heads of some of the nation's largest museums
testified earlier this month before the Presidential Advisory
Commission on Holocaust Assets, pledging to inspect and identify
artworks suspected of being stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The family says Kann's collection was stolen from his home
outside Paris in October 1940 after Kann, who was Jewish, moved to
London ahead of the Nazi occupation of France for what he thought
would be a temporary stay. He never returned and died in 1948.

<HEADLINE> Ninth livery driver this year killed on the job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A livery cab driver was fatally shot outside a
Brooklyn home early this morning, becoming the ninth driver killed
on the job this year.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, whose name was withheld pending notification of his
family, was pronounced dead on arrival, said Brookdale Hospital
spokesman Malcolm E. Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old driver had been shot once in the back of the
head, Kafka said.
</P>
<P>
   The man was shot in his cab at 3:55 a.m. outside of 110 Elton
St. in the Highland Park section. There was no immediate arrest.
The driver did not have a bulletproof partition in his green
Lincoln Town Car, and police say he had picked up two passengers
who hailed him on the street, a practice the police commissioner
has said is dangerous and against taxi commission rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, livery driver Jose Olivares, 35, was fatally shot in
the head during a botched robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rash of shootings recalled the early '90s, when
livery cab drivers were under siege. In 1992, cabbies were killed
at the rate of nearly one per week -- a total of 45 slayings, the
highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, in March and April 1990, seven livery drivers were
killed in six weeks, prompting scores of drivers to quit or switch
to day shifts. Six of the slayings took place in the Bronx; one was
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven livery drivers were killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Livery cab drivers often support their families by working in
underserved areas of the city, and tend to get their customers
through telephone calls to dispatchers.

<HEADLINE> Feds May Change Air-Bag Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government plans to require
automakers to use a 25 mph test for air bags, an industry-backed
move designed to better protect children and smaller adults,
according to published reports today.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration will
issue the order next week instructing automakers to begin using the
test in 2003, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers will be required to install air bags that inflate
forcefully enough to cushion occupants as a car crashes into a
solid wall at 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA previously had said it supported an eventual return 30 mph
test to ensure the bags would deploy forcefully enough to protect
unbelted adults in high-speed crashes.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd would not comment on the reports,
saying the rule had not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups that favor the 30 mph test argue automakers
could use sensors and dual-speed air bags to make sure the devices
do not deploy too forcefully and harm children and smaller adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is engineering malpractice,'' Joan Claybrook, president
of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said of the new rule.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997 NHTSA had required a 30 mph test to try to prevent
deaths to passenger-side occupants due to air-bag deployments,
often in low-speed accidents. It made the test optional in 1997 and
automakers quickly installed less-forceful air bags in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that air-bag deaths have declined sharply
for those model years.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA's first draft of the rule included a return to the 30 mph
standard by 2008. The rule would have been phased in gradually,
with automakers allowed to use the slower speed until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspapers reported that the Office of Management and
Budget, which reviews proposed rules, rejected that proposal,
saying arguments for the 30 mph test were not convincing and could
harm those they are meant to protect.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1, there had been 158 air-bag fatalities, 92 of them
children. Air bags have saved the lives of some 5,000 people since
the 1980s, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule, automakers will phase in the new air bags
starting with 2003-model cars and must be in full compliance by the
2006 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The rule also will require the automaker to reduce the severity
of crash injuries in tests and run tests on a whole family of
dummies rather than just one representing an average-size male.

<HEADLINE> Sales Up for Japan Electronic Cos.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Hitachi Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd. returned to
profitability in the latest fiscal year after losses a year
earlier, but a third Japanese electronics maker, Toshiba Corp.,
posted a wider loss due to costs of a legal settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sales improved for all three companies in the fiscal year ended
March 31 as the nation's economy began to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi swung into the black on improved demand for information
and electronics goods, posting a profit of 16.92 billion yen, or
$159 million, compared with the previous year's loss of 336.92
billion yen.
</P>
<P>
   Sales edged up 0.3 percent to 8.001 trillion yen, or $75
billion, from 7.977 trillion yen the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi's household appliance division posted a profit for the
first time in three fiscal years. Its information and electronics
operations saw strong semiconductor demand for use in personal
computers and mobile communication equipment. Sales of liquid
crystal products for personal computers were also strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fujitsu earned 42.73 billion yen, or $401 million, compared with
a loss of 13.64 billion yen the previous year when its results
included huge restructuring charges and were hurt by a fall in
semiconductor prices.
</P>
<P>
   Group sales rose 0.2 percent to 5.255 trillion yen, or $49.4
billion, from 5.242 trillion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba lost 28.00 billion yen, or $263 million, for the fiscal
year partly because of expenses linked to the settlement of a U.S.
class-action lawsuit. It lost 13.90 billion yen in the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Its sales grew 8.5 percent to 5.749 trillion yen, or $54
billion, from 5.30 trillion yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was Toshiba's first increase in three years with solid sales
in semiconductors, liquid-crystal products and mobile communication
goods. Stability in semiconductor prices in the second half also
contributed to the growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the company reported expenses of 106.39 billion yen, or $999
million, linked to last year's settlement of a U.S. suit over the
floppy disk controllers used in its laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to admit there was a defect, Toshiba offered
remedial software or coupons for Toshiba products to owners of its
laptops shipped since 1985 affected by the settlement, estimated at
5 million. The lawsuit said that the controllers distort or lose
information written onto disks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Creative Technology, a Singapore-based multimedia
peripherals maker, said its earnings rose fivefold in its third
quarter due to an investment gain.
</P>
<P>
   Creative earned $88.3 million in the three months ended March 31
from $18.3 million a year earlier. The latest figures included a
gain of $70.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Winds Drive Ariz. Forest Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOBE, Ariz. (AP) -- Winds and low humidity were no help to
firefighters battling the season's first major wildfire that had
scorched more than 1,800 acres in the Tonto National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters struggling over steep terrain were pulled away from
the front lines Thursday as winds gusting to 25 mph fanned the
flames. Gusts of up to 40 mph were expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really heightens our concern,'' forest spokesman Jim
Payne said. ''Those winds mean that fire has the capacity to spread
even more.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately known what sparked the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A ranch and other buildings as well as archaeological sites and
the habitat of an endangered Mexican spotted owl were threatened,
Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began about 3 p.m. Wednesday near Coon Creek and
quickly raged through dry underbrush and trees in the remote Sierra
Ancha Wilderness northeast of Phoenix, the U.S. Forest Service said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, officials evacuated a dozen people who were
camping, working at a nearby ranch and staffing a forest lookout on
Aztec Peak. A state highway also was temporarily closed, Payne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a wildfire ultimately burned over 65,000 acres
in the same general area of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Globe is about 75 miles east of Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> Norway Workers Set To Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Some 82,000 private sector workers were set
to strike next week after union members on Friday overwhelmingly
rejected the pay deal their leaders had negotiated with employers.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a defeat for the leaders of the main trade union
confederation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the leaders agreed to a settlement with the
Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry that included a
pay increase of 3.5 percent to 4 percent and a fifth week of
vacation starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   More than 64 percent of the 146,000 union members who voted
rejected the deal. The wage increase was criticized as too meager.
In addition, many workers already have five weeks of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the groundswell of opposition was the central
bank's interest rate recent increase of 0.25 percent in interest
rates. Workers said the increase would annul the entire pay raise
by raising mortgage costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority for 'no' is surprisingly large,'' the labor
confederation's vice chairman Jan Balstad said.
</P>
<P>
   The employers' group had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   About 82,000 workers were set to begin striking Wednesday,
starting with hotels in 10 cities, many ferries and product
delivery services, which threatened to leave empty shelves in many
grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Norway's two main tabloid newspapers planned to cease
publishing, most construction work was to be halted and the state
liquor store chain would be forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no solution, the strike will gradually be stepped up
to involve more businesses, and some observers said it could last
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The unions said they planned to leave key sectors like the
offshore oil and gas industry, the metal industry and mass
transportation unaffected for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Labor confederation leader Yngve Haagensen and leaders of many
of the 17 individual federations earlier this week urged their
223,000 members to vote for the deal but said they would lead a
strike if the rank and file rejected the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Giuliani has prostate cancer  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, showing a rare public
soft side, thanked New Yorkers for their get well wishes a day
after revealing that he has prostate cancer that could curtail his
Senate run against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very, very nice and very indicative of what the city of
New York is all about,'' Giuliani said today during a brief City
Hall news conference. ''The people of New York City sort of have a
reputation for being sort of tough and have a reputation for being
kind of cynical, but the reality is that they are the most generous
and the most loving in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Regardless of political differences, we all stick
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the well-wishers today was Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, who called and then put a political rival, Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert on the line as well. Likely Republican Presidential
nominee George W. Bush and former Sen. Bob Dole, himself a prostate
cancer survivor, also sent their best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, 55, reiterated that he would continue his Senate race
for the time being. He said he would likely halve his campaign
schedule in upcoming weeks, but will attend events in Saratoga
tonight and Buffalo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said more tests, taken Thursday, revealed that his
cancer was limited to his prostate.
</P>
<P>
   In Giuliani's otherwise business-as-usual mode, his campaign
announced today that it is beginning a massive direct mail campaign
and that it had also completed a large radio and television ''ad
buy.'' The ads are to begin airing in May.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday how his diagnosis would affect the Senate race,
he replied, ''I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in fairness to me, to the Republican Party, to all of
the parties and everybody else you need some time to think about
it. And I really need to know what the course of treatment is going
to be before I can evaluate,'' he said. ''And then, after I
determine that, then I will figure out does it make sense this year
or doesn't it or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he also appeared upbeat and energetic as he
confirmed speculation that he has a ''treatable form of prostate
cancer'' that was ''diagnosed at an early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he got regular prostate checkups because his
father died at age 73 of prostate cancer in 1981. Giuliani, who
rarely speaks about personal matters to the media, said his own
cancer reminded him of his father's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings up very painful memories,'' he said. ''And, you
know, I miss my father every day of my life. And he's a very, very
important reason for why I'm standing here as the mayor of New York
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning upstate on Thursday, spoke briefly by
telephone with the mayor and wished him ''a speedy and complete
recovery,'' said her spokeswoman, Karen Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Other well-wishers included friend and foe alike -- and ranged
from Gov. George Pataki to the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, who had considered challenging Giuliani for the
GOP Senate nomination, issued a statement offering his prayers and
support, adding that health issues transcend politics. Through his
spokesman, Lazio declined to say whether he would enter the race if
Giuliani dropped out. The New York Senate primary is in September.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, released a statement asking for
as much privacy for her husband as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic about Rudy's recovery,'' she said. ''We
have discussed this and I will be very supportive of him in dealing
with the choices he has to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men but
early detection greatly increases the chance of successful
treatment. About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the disease in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments include the radical prostatectomy -- the removal of
the prostate -- and radiation. ''Over the next week, maybe two
weeks, maybe 2{ or three weeks, I'll figure out with my doctors
what the best form of treatment will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Catalona of Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, who
removed the cancerous prostate of Yankee manager Joe Torre last
year, said that with surgery, a patient is typically in the
hospital for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're usually able to return to normal activities within a
few weeks,'' he said, ''but they're anemic and it takes 6 to 8
weeks or somewhat longer to build their blood count up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Giuliani should be able to resume his mayoral
schedule after that and also run for Senate, Catalona replied:
''Absolutely.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Bounce Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices rebounded today in early
dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade, a day after getting
pummeled in a weather-related selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for mostly dry weather in the Midwest this weekend
supported corn and soybeans. Both crops remain vulnerable to
subnormal soil dryness despite a spate of recent rains.
</P>
<P>
   No heavy rains are expected until next weekend, and traders said
it was too early to deal contracts based on those forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also stabilized after the selloff, although
market-watchers said gains would be limited by the start of harvest
and generally favorable conditions for both the winter wheat crop
and for spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 1\ cent to $2.55\ a bushel; July
corn rose \ cent to $2.34{ a bushel; July oats rose } cent to $1.23
a bushel; July soybeans rose { cent to $5.45{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle fell .23 cent to 69.17 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 84.27 cents a pound; June lean hogs
fell .05 cent to 77 cents a pound; May frozen pork bellies fell .22
cent to 99.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 102; Nasdaq Up 57  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares
rising for the second straight day while blue-chip stocks came
under selling pressure amid concerns over rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was
up 57.50 at 3,831.53. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
102.38 at 10,785.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 9.62 at 1,455430.01.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in technology stocks was led by a rally in
semiconductor shares. Intel gained 2 1/16 to 127 3/8, Broadcom rose
6 9/16 to 177 5/16 and PMC-Sierra jumped 10 3/8 to 193, all on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that aggressive investors think that the selloff has
hit the bottom with technology stocks, and it is safe to stick your
toe back in the water,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in the high-tech sector couldn't prop up the
broader market, which was weighed down by fears of rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes rose
last month even faster than spending, something that hasn't
happened since October.
</P>
<P>
   But although people made more money, they didn't put
significantly more away in savings. The report showed that the
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income
-- rose only slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a record low of
0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   That provided another sign that the economy continues to grow at
a brisk pace, which the Federal Reserve will likely consider at its
policymaking meeting on May 16. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates for the sixth time since June as they attempt
to keep inflationary pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has a governor on it right now ... it's called the
Fed meeting next month,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Until
that meeting, there will be a lid on the upside of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of higher interest rates pushed financial services stocks
down. American Express dropped 1 11/16 to 153 5/16 and J.P. Morgan
was off 3 1/16 at 128 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Merck was down 3 5/16 to 68 3/16 after financial news station
CNBC reported that the company may face safety questions from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration about its painkiller Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 429.65 million
shares, down from 515.91 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index up 5.71 at 500.29.

<HEADLINE> Delta Pilots To Get On-Board Meals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hoping to eliminate growling stomachs in the
cockpit, Delta Air Lines plans to make meals available to pilots on
flights where food is served.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said the program, which it is starting voluntarily, will
cost $3 million to $5 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's pilots have no contractual provision for in-flight
meals. They get money to buy food at airports to bring aboard, but
long lines and quick connections often make that impossible.
</P>
<P>
   On international flights, the pilots typically eat airline food.
But on domestic flights, extra meals are first offered to flight
attendants -- leaving many pilots hungry on long trips.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we get food, and sometimes we don't,'' said Delta
Capt. Andy Deane, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
the union that represents Delta's 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and the union are negotiating a new contract, which
becomes amendable next month. Deane said the pilots plan to make
the food provision mandatory in the contract.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Fla. Lawmaker Gets 5 Years  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- An ousted state senator was sentenced to the
maximum five years in federal prison for his role in a $2 million
Medicare fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Alan Gold on Friday rejected a two-year
sentence recommended in a plea bargain, citing Alberto Gutman's
''callous disregard'' of the public trust and five years of lies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most astounding, while engaged in his obstruction he even
chaired the Florida Senate's Criminal Justice Committee,'' Gold
wrote in a 35-page order rejecting Gutman's attempt to pull out of
his plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, a Republican lawmaker for 15 years, also was fined
$50,000, ordered to pay $98,175 restitution and placed on probation
for three years after prison.
</P>
<P>
   Winning re-election from a largely working-class Hispanic
district even under indictment, he resigned from the Florida Senate
last fall as part of the plea bargain and would have faced removal
from office had he not.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman's lawyers alleged prosecutors broke terms of the plea
agreement, but said Gutman would report to prison next month while
an appeal is pursued.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Marci, were indicted in 1998 along with 23
others in a $15 million fraud investigation of home health care
administrator Mederi of Dade County Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was the largest Medicare fraud uncovered
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Others who were forced out of office during a series of
corruption investigations in Miami included two Miami-Dade County
commissioners, two city commissioners and a city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy for helping set up
two home-health care companies that never did any legitimate
business, used voter lists to get names of purported patients and
collected $843,648 from Medicare. A third company set up by a
codefendant generated $1.2 million in false billings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gutman earlier pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was
sentenced to six months of house arrest, $15,000 restitution and
three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Codefendant Maricela Maury, an informant whom Gutman's defense
painted as a more pivotal participant, was sentenced Thursday to a
year on probation.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After seven seasons, David Duchovny may not
find much to mine creatively in Fox Mulder, his character on ''The
X-Files.'' But the series -- its future in limbo -- does still offer
its star a training ground for what he really wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   It's that old Hollywood cliche of wanting to direct.
</P>
<P>
   This week's episode (airing on the Fox network at 9 p.m. Eastern
Sunday) gave Duchovny his second chance at writing and directing
for ''The X-Files.'' The hour, titled ''Hollywood A.D.,'' combines
zombies and serious discussion of resurrection themes, religious
fanatics and filmmaking zealot Ed Wood, yet another tirade by
Mulder's boss, and some of the most self-deprecating humor the
series has ever featured.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, for ''X-Files'' fans, this one has it all,
including appearances by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, and his buddy
Garry Shandling as Hollywood incarnations of FBI agents Scully and
Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Directing the show is great training for me,'' said Duchovny,
who would like to try feature-film directing. ''It's an enticement
to me, and having done two episodes, I at least feel I know what it
may take to write or direct a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In Duchovny's episode, a producer shadows Mulder and Scully to
research a studio film that winds up being based on an X-File.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny said he wanted to explore ''realness and fakeness on
all different levels. You've got a movie of the real case, and
you've got the real case, but the real case is actually in a TV
show.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Hollywood version toys with the ''real case'' and
simplifies it hits home with Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it boils down to is, you have three-dimensional people,
but when you try to tell a story about them or tell a TV story,
they become less dimensional,'' he said. ''What bothers me is the
kind of simplification of myself through the character of Mulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's -- and Mulder's -- dry wit is apparent throughout the
script.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Scully (Gillian Anderson), the producer whispers into
a tape recorder: ''She, Jodie Foster's foster child on a Payless
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mulder: ''He's like a Jehovah's witness meets Harrison Ford's
'Witness.'''
</P>
<P>
   And later, as Mulder and Scully blunder about: ''I like the way
you guys work. No warrants, no permission, no research. You're like
studio executives with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulder and Scully investigate a bombing in a church crypt, where
they find forged religious texts and a freshly deceased body among
the bones. They encounter a dogmatic cardinal, a 1960s radical who
believes he's Jesus, and pottery fragments that purportedly
captured Christ's voice when he ordered Lazarus to rise from the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Framing the case, at the episode's beginning and end, is a
screening of the movie based on the case, with Mulder and Scully in
the audience alongside celebrities who include ''X-Files'' creator
Chris Carter and Minnie Driver, Duchovny's co-star in his current
film ''Return to Me.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mulder, Shandling spews bad Hollywood action-flick dialogue
at a fiery pontiff and his army of resurrected zombies. The
Hollywood Mulder and Scully even tumble into a coffin and embrace
passionately.
</P>
<P>
   ''After we shot that, I went home that night and thought, that
might have been weird, directing my wife kissing a friend of mine
in a coffin,'' Duchovny said.
</P>
<P>
   There's amusing interplay between the ''real'' Mulder and Scully
and the Hollywood versions, including a twist on the apparent
come-ons that Duchovny, playing himself, made to Shandling's
character on ''The Larry Sanders Show.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the episode's humor, Duchovny said he views it as one of
the weightiest ''X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it as funny, but at the heart of the case is a much more
serious discussion of life than ever takes place on our show,''
Duchovny said. ''This is probably darker than just about any show
we've ever done, if you think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode effectively works in scenes from cult director Ed
Wood's ''Plan 9 From Outer Space,'' which Mulder views for the 42nd
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a really bad 'X-File,''' Duchovny said, ''but told
with the best of a storyteller's heart from a guy who was totally
committed to what he was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Duchovny's commitment to an eighth season of ''The
X-Files,'' the ball is in Fox's court. Duchovny wants more money,
though he would not say how much he's asking. He also is seeking a
less-grueling work schedule and wants Fox to settle up on his
lawsuit, which claims the network underpaid him on the series'
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The cast and crew are working on the season finale, not knowing
whether it also will put the wraps on the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely could do another year, but I really don't know if
it'll happen,'' Duchovny said. ''I'm kind of happy that decision's
been taken away from me. I've made my terms clear.''
</P>
<P>

   EVEN GREEDIER: If greed is good, this must be even better. The
Fox game show ''Greed'' airs five ''Super Greed Special Edition''
episodes beginning Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern, then continuing May 2,
5, 12 and 19. On ''Super Greed,'' the Tower of Greed shifts so that
the last three monetary levels double in value. This Friday, a team
of three players will reach the million-dollar level and win -- and
then face the decision whether to risk it for $2 million ... or
possibly even $4 million. Chuck Woolery is the host.

<HEADLINE> Original Buffalo wing sauce going Japanese  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Eighteen tons of hot goods from Buffalo are
winging their way to Japan. Not hot as in stolen. Hot as in, hot.
</P>
<P>
   The bar that invented Buffalo-style chicken wings shipped 1,500
cartons of its hot sauce to Tokyo-based ISM Co. on Thursday. The
company plans to work with one of the world's largest advertising
agencies to turn Japanese taste buds on to Buffalo's most famous
culinary contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment is the biggest order ever landed by Mar-K Ltd., the
Buffalo company that manufactures, bottles and distributes Frank &AMP;
Teressa's Original Anchor Bar Buffalo Wing Sauce. Owner Joanne
Kaminski said the Japanese distributor is already talking about
placing an order for 36 tons in June.
</P>
<P>
   After that, orders will be based on how well the fiery sauce
sells in a country where most dishes have traditionally been milder
than even the tamest Anchor Bar flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big hurdle, because Buffalo wing sauce is a brand-new
item in Japan,'' Kaminski told The Buffalo News. ''But the sauce
has two things going for it: It's American and it's original, and
both of these factors are regarded highly in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mas Ishihara, owner of ISM, is a former Rochester resident who
developed a taste for hot wings on a visit to Buffalo and then
bantered with Kaminski on the Internet about bringing wings to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Mar-K has filled many small orders for customers all over the
Orient but Kaminski said this will be the first large-scale push to
market Buffalo chicken wings in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She was somewhat encouraged after participating in Foodex Japan
2000 in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of older, more traditional Japanese people were tasting
the wings and saying things like, 'Agh, horrible.' They thought it
was just too hot and spicy. But the younger people were ecstatic.
They love the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Arun Jain, chairman of the marketing department at the
University at Buffalo School of Management, said the sauce may
succeed based on the changing palates of many Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to be moving from blander food to more spicy
things,'' said Jain, who has traveled in Japan. ''I see it with a
lot of Japanese students who come here to study.''
</P>
<P>
   Jain encouraged marketers to work closely with restaurants on
developing creative uses for the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why couldn't you use it with shrimp or even fried fish?'' he
said. ''If you can get the creative juices flowing in Japanese
restaurants and homes, this could really take off.''
</P>
<P>
   All three varieties of the Anchor Bar sauce will be marketed in
Japan -- original, hotter and suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had real reservations about the 'suicidal' label and even
let Mas know that we could rename it,'' Kaminski said. ''But he
said, 'Oh, no. We think it's very funny.'''

<HEADLINE> Bush Taps Aide To Run Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has selected
longtime friend Don Evans as chairman of his Republican
presidential campaign, signaling his pleasure with the team of
Texas confidants who helped launch his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announced the appointment today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don is a good man and a great friend,'' Bush said in a
statement distributed by his campaign. ''He is an experienced chief
executive and someone that I trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who has led Bush's record-breaking fund-raising effort,
said, ''I am honored to be able to serve America in this sort of
way.'' He is an oil and gas businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to all of America learning what I already knew,
and that is this is a man you can trust, an extraordinary leader, a
man who cares about all Americans. If you love America, you're a
friend of George Bush's,'' Evans said in a telephone interview with
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He and the rest of Bush's political team are in Washington for a
series of political and fund-raising meetings to prepare for the
Republican National Convention in August and the fall campaign
against Democrat nominee-in-waiting Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement formalizes a role Evans has filled for Bush
since the first days of the governor's presidential campaign.
Though Evans' official job was chief fund-raiser, he has been the
de facto chief executive officer of Bush's political operation.
</P>
<P>
   Naming Evans chairman leaves no doubt that Bush has dismissed
the grumbling in some GOP circles that he needs to expand his inner
circle beyond the close-knit band of aides from Texas. The
complaints subsided as Bush solidified his standing in recent polls
and formed advisory committees loaded with Washington operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Evans have known each other for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is not a surprise; aides said last week Evans
was virtually certain to get the job, and he was introduced in
Washington meetings this week as the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said a general chairman may join the campaign in the fall
to serve as an authoritative voice for Bush in media interviews.
Evans, however, would have more influence as the campaign's CEO.

<HEADLINE> Deere To Cut 300 Jobs at Iowa Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere &AMP; Co. plans to cut about 300 jobs by
phasing out engine production at a plant in Dubuque, Iowa, over the
next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Deere expects to cut the jobs through normal attrition, and
officials do not foresee any layoffs, according to a company
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, all John Deere Dubuque Works employees will help
manufacture construction equipment at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The engine operations jobs cut at the Dubuque plant will move to
plants in either Waterloo, Iowa, or Torreon, Mexico, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 jobs represent about 20 percent of the plant's current
work force.

<HEADLINE> URGENT  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman on Friday ordered
state Human Services officials to eventually close the beleaguered
Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Parsippany.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the hospital is no longer ''functioning in a manner
that is perceived as safe.'' The governor wanted an immediate
assessment of every patient to identify those who can receive
alternative care.
</P>
<P>
   State Human Services Commissioner Michele K. Guhl said it may
take as long as three years to move all of Greystone's patients.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued earlier this month found the hospital's 610
patients were crowded into bedrooms and living in unsanitary
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's decision comes on the heels of a sexual assault and
other incidents at the hospital, which is more than 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A leading state Democratic critic earlier this week called on
the hospital's chief executive officer to resign after a
21-year-old male patient was charged with sexually assaulting a
19-year-old mildly retarded female patient in an elevator of the
hospital's main administration building.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's order also follows the October escape of a
civilly committed sex offender, the arrest of four Greystone
employees for assaulting and illegally restraining another patient
in March, and an investigation into at least a dozen employees
failing to report a suicide attempt last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said there continues to be a need for a long-term
psychiatric facility in northern New Jersey. But she said many of
the patients can be treated in smaller facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we have the unique opportunity to take a hospital that
was built in the 1800s and replace it with more appropriate, more
humane facilities for people with mental illness,'' Guhl said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Japan Food Cult Ordered To Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A court on Friday ordered a Japanese cult that
claimed the ability to gain powerful insights through the human
foot to pay damages to former followers for coercing them into
paying exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
   The cult, Ho-no-hana Sampogyo, which claimed to cure illnesses
by examining feet, was ordered to pay $2.12 million to 27 people,
said Fukuoka District Court spokesman Hiroshi Yoshizaki.
</P>
<P>
   Former members say they paid the group as much as $935,000 after
being warned that they would die or get cancer unless they had the
soles of their feet inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against the cult surfaced about four years ago, and
some 1,000 former group members have filed lawsuits, demanding a
total of $50 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, was the
first that held Ho-no-hana Sampogyo legally responsible for
defrauding followers.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Motoaki Kimura was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News
Agency that the cult ''significantly deviated from the range of
what is permissible in the name of religious training.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese police raided the group's headquarters and branches
around the country in December, and are investigating it for
suspected fraud. Friday's ruling comes amid growing public concern
about the bizarre practices of several Japanese religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-no-hana Sampogyo, led by guru Hogen Fukunaga, also claimed
that the shape of people's feet revealed their personality, with
short toes signifying short tempers and fat toes foretelling good
fortune.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Finds Croatia Human Remains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- U.N. investigators found the remains of
about 10 people at a site near the central town of Gospic, where
dozens were believed slain and buried by Croats during the 1991
war, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of digging, forensics examiners ''have
recovered some human remains'' in the village of Obradovic Varos,
said Steve Chambers, an official with the U.N. war crimes tribunal
in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are 10 human remains'' that were unearthed
there, he said, adding that the exact number of bodies would be
known after pathological examinations next week in the capital,
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers spoke to reporters in Gospic after the court's
examiners finished their work in Obradovic Varos.
</P>
<P>
   Between 60 and 120 people -- mostly Serbs, but also dissenting
Croats -- disappeared in late 1991 and were presumed killed and
buried at several locations near Gospic, 60 miles southwest of
Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Serbs, who took up arms in 1991 to
oppose Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia, committed the
majority of war crimes in the fighting that followed. But human
rights groups said they believe Croats also killed Serb civilians
in Gospic and several other places.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's new, pro-Western government allowed the tribunal to
investigate in Gospic, unlike the previous government of the late
President Franjo Tudjman, which claimed Croats did not commit war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Three former military officials told tribunal investigators
about Gospic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The three blamed wartime military commanders in Gospic -- Gen.
Mirko Norac and Col. Tihomir Oreskovic -- for orchestrating the
murderous campaign. They also said former top government officials,
including Tudjman and the late Defense Minister Gojko Susak, knew
about the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Norac, Oreskovic and former government officials have denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A Croatian investigative team also participated in the
exhumation. Reporters were not allowed near the site.

<HEADLINE> Deep Israel Lebanon Pullback Cited  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Eager to secure international backing for its
planned withdrawal from Lebanon, Israel suggested Friday that it
would meet a U.N. demand to redeploy behind a 1923 colonial
boundary, the deepest possible pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Special U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen met with Israel's army
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, and top commanders to discuss
the line to which Israel would withdraw. Cartographers attended the
session at the Israeli Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen, who began a Mideast fact-finding tour on Thursday,
has told Israel it should pull back to the boundary drawn by
Britain and France when they carved up the Middle East in 1923,
Israeli and U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Roed-Larsen issued
a statement Friday noting that U.N. resolution 425 calls for Israel
to withdraw to the 1923 line.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thus far, there seems to be no disagreement on this issue,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has not said how far he is
willing to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   The 1923 line is the only internationally recognized boundary
between Israel and Lebanon and was reaffirmed in a 1949 armistice
agreement, U.N. officials said. Israel and Lebanon, still
officially at war, don't have a mutually agreed border.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1950s, Israel built a fence marking its version
of the border, which was fairly close to the 1923 boundary,
although in some places the fence deviated from the line for
topographical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Israel moved the border northward by up to a few
hundred yards following attacks on border towns. Israeli map
experts estimate that the total area in dispute is no more than 1.2
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Israel does not expect difficulties in reaching agreement with
the United Nations on the line to which Israel's troops must
withdraw, an Israeli official said Friday, hinting that Israel was
open to the U.N. demand for a withdrawal to the 1923 line. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have said they would recognize the United
Nations as the final arbiter in disputes over the border
demarcation.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has sought U.N. backing for its withdrawal since it has
been unable to negotiate the pullback with the Lebanese government.
After the pullback, U.N. peacekeepers, who now serve as a buffer
between the Israeli occupation zone in south Lebanon and the rest
of Lebanon, would redeploy along the border.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel accepts the 1923 demarcation line as its boundary with
Lebanon, this could set a precedent for Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
which have been deadlocked for two months over a border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has indicated it is willing to return all of the Golan
Heights, captured in the 1967 Mideast war, to Syria and draw the
new border based on the 1923 demarcations. However, Syria has
insisted that it also be given land it had captured in border
skirmishes between 1949 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has refused to do so, saying Syria had no claim to these
areas.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak pledged in his 1999 election campaign that he would
withdraw from Lebanon by July 2000, he was still optimistic that he
could reach an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Israeli-Syrian talks broke down over the border
issue, and Israel was forced to make plans for a unilateral
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Tighten Their Borders  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- When Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party joined
Austria's coalition government this year, the nations of the
European Union were united in their condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, European governments are discovering that Haider's brand of
xenophobia sells.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of countries whose policies look a lot like
Austria's,'' said David Boratav of the London-based European
Council on Refugees and Exiles. ''We face a trend of increased
racism and xenophobia in Europe. You can't single out one country.
Legislation in the U.K. and Austria is very comparable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago, before the Freedom Party joined Austria's
government, EU nations took pains to distance themselves from
Haider's nakedly anti-immigrant stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Joerg Haider and his party are admitted into the Austrian
government, that country will not belong to that European family
which hails tolerance, human rights and a struggle against
xenophobia,'' said Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson, echoing
his colleagues' outraged statements.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the Freedom Party, right-wing parties across the
continent have made gains at the polls by exploiting the fear of a
rising tide of immigrants and refugees. Governments, on the right
and the left, have responded by toughening their rhetoric and
tightening their borders. And some of the steps came before
Haider's party joined Austria's government in February.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the opposition Conservative Party has accused the
government of making the country a ''soft touch'' for refugees and
has called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party government, for its part, has introduced a
series of strict new policies, including issuing vouchers instead
of cash to asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw signaled his government's hard-line
stance by spending time this month watching immigration officers
intercept a group of stowaways who arrived in the southeast port of
Dover in the back of a truck. Under regulations introduced last
month, the driver could be fined $3,200 for each stowaway.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's get-tough attitude is being replicated across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Belgium temporarily reinstated border controls to
halt the flow of illegal migrants, and it suspended a visa-free
travel agreement with Slovakia after a wave of asylum applications
from Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, which has the highest per capita rate of
asylum-seekers in Europe and where about 20 percent of the
population is foreign-born, the far-right Swiss People's Party took
22 percent of the vote in elections last October. Months earlier,
71 percent of the electorate voted to tighten asylum procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Several EU countries -- including Britain -- have put some of
their asylum-seekers in detention, a move refugee groups say
contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans would counter that the actions are necessary
because their countries are being swamped by refugees. But the
number of asylum-seekers is nowhere near the highs reached during
the Balkan wars of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, 27,032 asylum applications were lodged
in the 15 EU countries, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees -- a slight decrease from the 27,800 recorded in January.
In 1999, monthly totals ranged from a low of about 22,500 to a high
of about 32,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the EU received 282,860 asylum applications. In 1992,
the number had jumped to 667,700. By 1998, it was back down to
291,220 and the next year it was just under 350,000.
</P>
<P>
   The number of illegal immigrants who do not seek asylum is
higher, and harder to quantify. But anti-immigrant mood has little
to do with size of a country's immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, which has the lowest percentage of foreign residents
of any EU country, the government wants to further restrict an
already strict policy that saw this year's immigration quota set at
700.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit in the Finnish city of Tampere last October, EU
leaders agreed to create an ''area of freedom, security and
justice'' by developing coordinated policies to fight trafficking
in human beings and organized crime, alongside a streamlined
refugee policy that respects human rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata
warned the EU leaders not to go too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''My plea is to ensure that policies and practices designed to
control irregular immigration do not jeopardize the rights of
refugees and asylum-seekers,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Foot Cult Ordered To Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A court on Friday ordered a Japanese cult that
claimed the ability to gain powerful insights through the human
foot to pay damages to former followers for coercing them into
paying exorbitant fees.
</P>
<P>
   The cult, Ho-no-hana Sampogyo, which claimed to cure illnesses
by examining feet, was ordered to pay $2.12 million to 27 people,
said Fukuoka District Court spokesman Hiroshi Yoshizaki.
</P>
<P>
   Former members say they paid the group as much as $935,000 after
being warned that they would die or get cancer unless they had the
soles of their feet inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints against the cult surfaced about four years ago, and
some 1,000 former group members have filed lawsuits, demanding a
total of $50 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Fukuoka, 560 miles southwest of Tokyo, was the
first that held Ho-no-hana Sampogyo legally responsible for
defrauding followers.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Motoaki Kimura was quoted as saying by the Kyodo News
Agency that the cult ''significantly deviated from the range of
what is permissible in the name of religious training.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese police raided the group's headquarters and branches
around the country in December, and are investigating it for
suspected fraud. Friday's ruling comes amid growing public concern
about the bizarre practices of several Japanese religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-no-hana Sampogyo, led by guru Hogen Fukunaga, also claimed
that the shape of people's feet revealed their personality, with
short toes signifying short tempers and fat toes foretelling good
fortune.

<HEADLINE> Drought Ravages South Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By MASSOUD ANSARI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THAR, Pakistan (AP) -- Known as the land of peacocks, pigeons and
poverty, Thar district in southern Pakistan has been ravaged by its
worst water shortage in 100 years, causing thousands of people to
flee the region, villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   Daily temperatures have been hovering around 129 degrees here in
Sindh province. Burning winds whip over the parched land.
</P>
<P>
   Located not far from the border with India, Thar relies
exclusively on rainfall for its survival. During the rainy season
the region is awash with colorful flowers, mushrooms and greenery,
and it is famous for pigeon-raising and the peacocks that roam
freely through villages.
</P>
<P>
   But when the rains don't come, as they haven't this year, the
land becomes barren, leaving people and livestock with nothing to
eat or drink.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you talk about the severity, this is the worst we have had
in over ten decades,'' said villager Ghanish Lal.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his neighbors have fled in search of water. But the
journey is a tortuous one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sandstorms and cyclonic whirlwinds scorch every straw in the
pastures and leave no option for the people except to migrate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who survive are actually skin and bones,'' said villager
Jai Ram, who blamed the drought for his brother's death last month.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme heat has plagued other South Asian countries as
well. In western India, a searing drought has affected 50 million
villagers, while in the north 30 million struggle with severe
shortages. Those desperate for a drink have begun digging small
wells with their bare hands, some reaching six feet before finding
dirty, saline water.
</P>
<P>
   Water wells in southern Afghanistan are also bone dry, and
thousands of nomads and villagers have lost their livelihoods
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the hardest hit areas were in the southern Sindh
and Baluchistan provinces, where dead animal carcasses where lay
baking in the sizzling heat while vultures swarmed overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Near a Thar village called Sooram, children chased after passing
vehicles with their hands cupped together, begging for water.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no official death toll, but local newspapers said
up to 500 people have died from diseases caused by the drought.
</P>
<P>
   But ''the real disease is hunger, and people are dying because
they don't have money to buy food or medicine,'' said Dr. Allah
Nawaz, with a local medical aid group called Thardeep.
</P>
<P>
   Ram said he wanted to leave the area to find water, but his
mother, who had a nervous breakdown after her son's death, refused
to go. His three small children cry most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where to go and how to take my ailing mother and
young children,'' Ram said, looking at his 75-year-old mother
huddled beneath a leafless tree.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ram sold two goats for one tanker of water and a
small amount of flour. He is one of the luckier people in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been surviving on leaves, tree bark and red chilies.
Most eat once, maybe twice, a day.
</P>
<P>
   Aid organizations have attempted to document the extent of the
drought in the area, but it has been difficult because of the
constant movement of people and livestock.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises 0.7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes went up faster than their
spending did last month, the first time that's happened since
October. Now with extra cash in their pockets, consumers are
expected to spend briskly in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by a sizable 0.7 percent in March, a little
stronger than many analysts anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Solid wage gains, hiring for the 2000 Census and federal subsidy
payments to farmers helped boost incomes last month, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story behind income growth implies that future spending
will advance because consumers have the money to spend. It all
comes back to jobs, jobs, jobs,'' economist Richard Yamarone said.
''The solid job growth that we have had fuels income growth, which
fuels spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaking economy, in its longest-ever streak of
uninterrupted growth, has pushed the nation's unemployment rate to
near a three-decade low of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, stock markets gains and low
inflation, Americans have been feeling in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity and is the locomotive of the speeding economy, rose a
brisk 0.5 percent in March, right on target with many analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers continue to be avid spenders and continue to enjoy
healthy income gains,'' economist Mark Zandi of RFA Dismal Sciences
said. ''I think the report indicates continued solid spending
growth through the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the report is the latest evidence of a rapidly
growing economy that needs to be slowed to a more sustainable pace
through higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average was
down more than 100 points in afternoon trading rattled by fears of
higher interest rates. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq was up more
than 50 points.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Americans spent all they earned and more. Spending
grew by a torrid 1.4 percent, the strongest pace since 1994, while
income rose 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the first three months of this year, consumers went on
their biggest shopping spree in nearly 17 years, catapulting
spending up by a rate of 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times since
June 30 to slow the economy, which grew at a 5.4 percent rate in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's rate increases are designed to raise borrowing costs
for big-ticket items such as homes and cars and in that way cool
off demand and keep inflation from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Given the outlook for continuing strong economic growth
supported by hardy consumer spending, many analysts expect the Fed
will boost rates again on May 16. Some analysts said the central
bank may raise rates by a half-point rather than the more moderate
quarter-point increases the Fed has used in its last five rate
moves.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Americans' wages grew by a strong 0.7 percent, up from
a 0.3 percent rise in February. Federal subsidy payments to farmers
helped lift farm proprietors' income, which increased 18.6 percent
in March, following a 2.7 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans' income growth last month outpacing the rise in
spending, the personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of
after-tax income -- rose slightly to 0.4 percent from a record low
of 0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the savings rate isn't as bad as it seems because the
calculation doesn't take into account gains realized from such
things as rising stocks and higher real-estate values.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report also showed that spending on durable goods,
manufactured items expected to last at least three years, fell 2.5
percent in March, reflecting a slowdown in car sales. In February,
such spending rose 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on nondurables, such as food and fuel, rose 1.4 percent
in March, down from a 2.1 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, retail sales in February and March didn't
grow as fast as the government previously thought. Revised
estimates, released by the Commerce Department, show that sales
rose 0.2 percent in March, down from the 0.4 percent gain initially
reported. February's sales rose 1.3 percent versus a 1.8 percent
increase.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Human Rights Meeting Ends  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- After a six-week session which climaxed in
surprisingly strong criticism of Russian violations in Chechnya,
the U.N. Human Rights Commission ended Friday with a plea for the
most basic right of all: that to life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow human beings to die in large numbers before
our very eyes,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary
Robinson said in an appeal for more international action against
the drought in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plight of millions of people at risk must impel the search
for peace and security, for respect for human rights, and for the
expression of international solidarity,'' Robinson told the
53-nation commission's closing session.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is the top U.N. human rights watchdog. Its
meetings often bog down in differences between developing countries
wanting more emphasis on economic rights and the United States and
Europe striving for better protection of civil and political
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   This year was no different, and the commission extended its
growing list of themes by appointing new investigators on the right
to food and to adequate housing.
</P>
<P>
   Activists like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch took
heart from a landmark decision to appoint a special U.N. envoy to
monitor the treatment of human rights defenders -- a move previously
blocked by Cuba and some developing country allies.
</P>
<P>
   A report presented to the meeting said that human rights
activists suffered repression in some 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is shameful that those who seek to promote and to help
protect human rights themselves so often become the victims,''
Robinson said. ''I have been deeply troubled by the fears expressed
to me by some non-governmental representatives. As one woman put to
me: 'Coming here may have made us targets at home,''' the former
Irish president added.
</P>
<P>
   Russia became the first permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council to suffer a formal rebuke. In a 25-7 vote, the commission
criticized Moscow for ''disproportionate and indiscriminate use of
Russian military force, including attacks against civilians'' in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, put forward by the EU, urged Moscow to set up a
commission of inquiry and allow in special U.N. investigators.
There were 19 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless the Russian government moves swiftly on these
proposals, the skepticism of the international community and
supporters of human rights inside Russia can only mount,'' said
U.S. delegation leaders Harold Hongju Koh and Nancy Rubin in a
statement after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities -- which snubbed Robinson during a recent
visit to the region -- denounced the U.N. move and said it wouldn't
be bound by its decision. Moscow sent ground troops into Chechnya
in September, following weeks of airstrikes, after Chechnya-based
Islamic militants invaded neighboring Dagestan in August.
</P>
<P>
   For the 10th straight year at the commission, Beijing used its
economic and political muscle among developing countries to block
U.S.-led attempts to censure Chinese repression. Washington's
campaign was also weakened by EU's refusal to co-sponsor the text,
as France in particular was worried about future business deals.
</P>
<P>
   The commission reiterated its annual criticism of violations in
Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Myanmar, Congo and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Cuba -- also a yearly ritual -- provoked the most
forceful response outside the U.N. debating chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 200,000 demonstrators joined government-sponsored protests
in Cuba against the U.N. vote. The Havana government scrapped a
planned visit by EU leaders to protest Europe's compliance with the
perceived U.S. conspiracy and dropped plans to join an EU aid and
trade pact.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Hurts Whitman VP Chance  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- She would love to be known primarily as a
tax-cutter, but Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey cannot shake
free from the divisive effects of the abortion debate within the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Her support of abortion rights -- particularly her veto of
legislation to outlaw the operation critics call ''partial-birth
abortion'' -- dominates discussion about her chances of being tapped
by fellow Gov. George W. Bush as his vice presidential running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right fringe, unfortunately, care more about one issue
than they care about winning the presidency, and they are willing
to torpedo the ability of the party to shape the agenda of this
country for the 21st century,'' Whitman, 53, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because they judge people by one issue -- and not always
accurately on even that one issue -- they are going to say some
pretty nasty stuff, and they have been,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg is among those who believe
Whitman could harm Bush's chances by causing internal strife that
Republicans can ill afford in their quest to recapture the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican right would go absolutely bananas if Whitman
were nominated,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., an anti-abortion activist in
Congress, said simply, ''It is just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-time county legislator, daughter of two rock-ribbed
Republicans who held prominent roles in the party in New Jersey and
nationally, Whitman burst into the headlines in 1990 by nearly
defeating Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Building on her strong showing in that race, she ran for
governor in 1993 promising a 30 percent income tax cut. Her victory
over Democrat Jim Florio, the incumbent, made Whitman the Garden
State's first female governor.
</P>
<P>
   She moved quickly to fulfill her campaign pledge, and her office
says she has enacted 37 separate tax cuts since taking office in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has also made land preservation and education top
priorities, establishing academic standards for public schools and
proposing a 10-year plan to save 1 million acres of open space and
farmland in the nation's most densely populated state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she only narrowly won a second four-year term in 1997,
hurt in part by the campaign of a Libertarian candidate who
emphasized that he was the only abortion opponent in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The state constitution bars her from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's star was at its height in the Republican Party four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-mentioned as possible running mate for Bob Dole, Whitman was
viewed as a woman who could break the party's glass ceiling as a
member of the national ticket. In the end, she was named co-chair
of the San Diego convention as Jack Kemp got the running-mate
prize.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the Republican-controlled New Jersey
Legislature passed a bill to outlaw the late-term abortion
procedure that foes call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman vetoed it and advocated her own version, which included
a clause permitting the procedure if the mother's health was at
stake. Republican lawmakers voted to override the veto, with
support from some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As for her vice-presidential chances this year, Republican
political analyst Steve Salmore, formerly of Rutgers University,
said Whitman has become too much of a a lightning rod for
anti-abortion factions -- as shown when Gary Bauer took potshots at
her during debates in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would make that issue a major issue of division in the
convention. I don't think George Bush needs that,'' Salmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman herself has complicated the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year passed a bill requiring doctors to
notify parents before performing abortions on minors. Whitman
signed it, saying it was a common-sense provision supported by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   She denied she was trying to appease anti-abortion groups, and
in fact she did not. But she also alienated abortion-rights
advocates who had seen her as something of a hero within the ranks
of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had an impressive record on choice up until this situation
with the parental involvement bill,'' said Nina Miller, director of
Planned Parenthood's political branch, the ''Action Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nationally, it didn't make any pro-life groups warm up to
her,'' Miller said, ''and it only hurt her support among the
pro-choice groups.''

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Elizabeth Taylor's lifetime of work on screen --
and off -- has earned her another honor: fellowship in the British
Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Institute Director Jon Teckman praised Taylor on Friday for her
film performances and her dedication to social causes, particularly
in fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are delighted that our first fellowship award of this new
century should be going to such a worthy recipient,'' Teckman said.
''An Oscar-winning actress with more than 60 films to her credit,
Dame Elizabeth is universally acknowledged as one of the superstars
of the silver screen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are particularly pleased that we are also able to recognize
her charitable work,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 68, was designated a dame on Queen Elizabeth II's
coveted New Year's list of titles and awards. Last year, she
received the British Academy of Film and Television Arts
Fellowship, that institute's equivalent of a lifetime achievement
award.
</P>
<P>
   She is to be honored by the British Film Institute on May 24.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises in European Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The U.S. dollar pushed the euro to a new low today
and was higher against most other major currencies in European
trading. Gold prices were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 90.30 cents in early trading in London,
its lowest level since the currency began trading in January 1999.
Its previous low was 90.59 cents set Thursday in New York trading.

<P>
   The currency of 11 European nations was quoted at 90.84 cents
late in the day in London, down from 91.07 cents here late

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Giuliani to court Independence Party  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton has decided to join
her cancer-stricken Senate rival, Republican Rudolph Giuliani, in
courting support from the New York arm of the Reform Party, her
campaign spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She will be appearing at the Independence Party forum'' on
Saturday, Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, it had been unclear of the first lady would attend
the forum in Buffalo. The mayor had earlier announced his intention
to attend and reiterated that even after announcing Thursday that
he had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The forum amounts to a job interview with Independence Party
leaders who will select their Senate candidate in late May or early
June at their state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton has been concerned that having the
Independence Party Senate line could put her on a ticket headed by
conservative Pat Buchanan, a leading contender for the Reform
Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a problem with Mr. Buchanan,'' the first lady said
Wednesday during a campaign stop in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has expressed similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the last-minute decision to attend the forum,
Wolfson said Friday that ''Hillary is determined to travel around
the state and talk with as many people as possible about why she is
running for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton is also concerned about being linked with
Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party who is
now a major force in New York's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the attraction of third-party nominations is strong
in New York when candidates expect a close race. Polls show the
Clinton-Giuliani race is just that. Unlike other states, New York
allows major party candidates to also run on third-party ballot
lines and combine their vote totals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Republican George Pataki beat Democratic incumbent
Mario Cuomo in the governor's race on the strength of the
Conservative Party vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Independence Party became New York's third
largest political party. As of March 1, it had more than 172,471
members. The Conservative Party fell into fourth place with 171,496
members. Both are dwarfed by the Democratic (4.96 million members)
and the Republican (3.09 million members) parties.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the line brought more than 109,000 extra votes to
Democrat Charles Schumer as he beat Republican incumbent Alfonse
D'Amato in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has said he will decide within a few weeks, after
consulting with his doctors about treatment options, whether to
continue with his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party is in the midst of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a state judge reinstated Jack Essenberg as
the state party chairman, ruling that he had been ousted illegally
by Fulani's faction and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Essenberg said Friday that while the Senate forum had been
arranged by his opponents in the party and he would not be
attending, he was encouraging other party members and the
prospective candidates to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But Essenberg made it clear that he also wanted nothing to do
with Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather have the (presidential ballot) line blank than
have Buchanan,'' Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulani is backing Buchanan.

<HEADLINE> Anti Slavery Group Honors Tutu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Rev. Desmond Tutu, who has urged the
United States to come to terms with its history of slavery, has
been honored by a group named for the early anti-slavery movement.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu will be the second recipient of the National Underground
Railroad Freedom Center's human rights award. The first was civil
rights activist Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, 69, a Nobel laureate and former Anglican archbishop of
Cape Town, South Africa, will be presented the International
Freedom Conductor Award on Aug. 5, Freedom Center officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As South Africa tore off the burdensome shackles of apartheid,
Desmond Tutu has been in the forefront of efforts to replace evil
with goodness, hypocrisy with truth, violence with peace,'' said
federal Judge Nathaniel Jones, co-chairman of the center's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to
dismantle apartheid in South Africa. He is completing a two-year
stay as a visiting professor of theology at Emory University in
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 115; Nasdaq Up 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares
rising for the second straight day while blue-chip stocks came
under selling pressure amid concerns over rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was up 70.81 at 3,844.84. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
115.64 at 10,772.46.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 10.47 at 1,454.45.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in technology stocks was led by a rally in
semiconductor shares. Intel gained 1} to 127 1/16, Broadcom rose 3
3/16 to 173 15/16 and PMC-Sierra jumped 13 13/16 to 196 7/16, all
on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that aggressive investors think that the selloff has
hit the bottom with technology stocks, and it is safe to stick your
toe back in the water,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in the high-tech sector couldn't prop up the
broader market, which was weighed down by fears of rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes rose
last month even faster than spending, something that hasn't
happened since October.
</P>
<P>
   But although people made more money, they didn't put
significantly more away in savings. The report showed that the
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income
-- rose only slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a record low of
0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   That provided another sign that the economy continues to grow at
a brisk pace, which the Federal Reserve will likely consider at its
policy-making meeting on May 16. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates for the sixth time since June as they attempt
to keep inflationary pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has a governor on it right now ... it's called the
Fed meeting next month,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Until
that meeting, there will be a lid on the upside of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of higher interest rates pushed financial services stocks
down. American Express dropped 1 15/16 to 153 1/16 and J.P. Morgan
was off 2 13/16 at 128 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Merck was down 3 3/16 to 68 5/16 after financial news station
CNBC reported that the company may face safety questions from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration about its painkiller Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based music service MP3.com tainted the technology
sector, falling 39 percent after a judge found the company liable
for infringing the copyrights of the Recording Industry Association
of America. MP3's products make it possible to download music over
the Internet. Shares fell 4{ to 7[.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 629.26 million
shares at midafternoon, down from 750.51 million shares on
Thursday. On the Nasdaq, advancers were ahead by an 11-to-8 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 8.00 at 502.58.

<HEADLINE> China Tries To Stop Antiques Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Mainland Chinese officials said Friday they
were trying to block Christie's and Sotheby's from auctioning off
treasures looted from an imperial palace in Beijing 140 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at China's State Bureau of Cultural Relics said on
condition of anonymity that they had taken measures to stop the
sale of the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to elaborate while awaiting a reply from the
auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's spokeswoman Victoria Cheung said Friday that the
auction house was aware of the views of mainland officials, but
declined to say whether Christie's would pull the items from
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Rochell, Sotheby's managing director for China and South
East Asia, said talks were under way and he hoped to reach
agreement before Tuesday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say if the items would be removed from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items that British and French troops looted from Yuan
Ming Yuan in 1860, during what has been called the second Opium
War, was a hexagonal ceramic vase featured on the cover of a
Sotheby's catalog for an auction next week, China's state-run
newspaper Economic Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It was commissioned by the Qing Dynasty emperor Qianlong in
1743, the report said. Yuan Ming Yuan is also known as the Old
Summer Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The two houses' catalogs also include three bronze sculptures
from a water clock that included the heads of the 12 animals of the
Chinese zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   They were also stolen from the palace, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's and Sotheby's plan to auction the pieces, along with
other Chinese ceramics and works of art, in Hong Kong on Monday and
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End Mostly Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A strong showing by the technology, media and
telecom sectors, combined with resilience on Wall Street, boosted
most European stocks Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of European companies rose 6.63
points, or 1.7 percent, to 392.60, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx

stronger-than-expected results from Swedish telecom equipment maker
Ericsson. The sector ticker ended the day up 5.5 percent, or 57.1
points, at 1091.7.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter European Equity Strategist Richard
Davidson said the strong earnings from Ericsson showed that
technology stocks continued to represent good value.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology is cheap,'' Davidson said. ''It is not a sentiment
change. It's (movement) is based on fundamental results.''
</P>

   Older economy sectors also posted reasonable gains, and analysts
cited the benefits of a slumping euro on the earnings of big
corporate exporters.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Cause 911 Headaches  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKFORD, Mich. (AP) -- Cellular phones provide peace of mind in
an emergency for many people. But they are an increasingly
dangerous headache for 911 dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't realize their phones are pre-programmed to call
911 if a certain button is pushed,'' says Mike Miller, a Michigan
State Police radio dispatcher. ''They put their phones in their
pockets or purses and they move around and the buttons get pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ''One day I had 94 calls from cell phones that were accidental
or hang-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. With an estimated 91 million Americans now
owning wireless phones, frustrated dispatchers from Los Angeles to
Boston report an epidemic of calls from phones that connect to 911
after pre-programmed dial options are accidentally triggered
without their owners realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They drive us crazy!'' said Kris Willis, a supervisor in the
911 center in Cleveland, Tenn., who estimates her office gets as
many 30 such calls a day. ''You've got a dispatcher tied up on the
phone sitting there for one or two minutes to make sure there's
nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Director of Telecommunications Blair Sutherland
says he doesn't know exactly how many of the 2,400 wireless phone
calls every day to 911 in his state are unintentional. But it's an
increasingly common -- and easily recognizable -- problem for his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our communications center will get a 911 call, and there will
be nobody speaking to them or we will hear another conversation or
a rustling sound indicative of the phone being in their pocket or
purse,'' said Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   The National Emergency Number Association, a Columbus,
Ohio-based industry group, recommends that wireless customers
remove the pre-programmed feature from their phones to prevent
accidental calls or keep their phones in a place where their
buttons won't be bumped.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a classic case of unintended consequences: the wireless
industry intends to make a phone that is safer, but people
inadvertently hit the button and call 911,'' says Mark Adams,
executive director of the association. ''These calls alone get
staggering when you talk about the resources they tie up.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also lock the phone keypad, so no call can be made
without punching in a special code, says Michelle Gilbert, a
spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, which serves 16 million customers
nationally. Or they could turn off phones that aren't in use.
</P>
<P>
   Government-mandated technology expected to be installed over the
next few years should also alleviate some of the problem by
allowing dispatchers to trace the number and location of wireless
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   California Highway Patrol dispatchers in Los Angeles County are
already using some of the new equipment, which allows them to get a
readout showing the phone numbers of all 911 wireless calls,
including apparent accidental calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll call them back and let them know they need to secure
their phones,'' said supervisor Bruce Boysen, who estimates about
25 percent of the wireless calls his department gets are
unintentional. ''We can also check to see if there's actually an
emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not an option for most emergency dispatchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan police outpost where Miller works estimates nearly
half of its wireless calls are unintentional, but it lacks the
technology to automatically trace those calls.
</P>
<P>
   Officials occasionally have used 69, a standard phone service
available in many areas, to track down untended wireless phone
owners -- like Mac McNichols.
</P>
<P>
   McNichols was in a car Thursday afternoon when the wireless
phone he uses for work apparently dialed 911 and reached Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shocked. How it did it I don't know,'' McNichols told a
reporter, saying the phone was laying on the car seat next to him.
''Will you tell them I'm really sorry?''

<HEADLINE> INS Meets Portland Officials  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTINE GONZALEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland International Airport has gotten
a bad image over the past year for an extremely high rate of
deporting -- and sometimes jailing -- businesspeople from Japan and
other countries without proper visas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. immigration officials, concerned that the city's reputation
as ''Deportland'' is insulting Asian businesses and hurting trade
with Oregon companies, met Thursday with international and local
officials to try to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very interested in improving our practices to make the
system better for everyone involved,'' said Peter Gordon, acting
western regional director for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ''It is not our desire to sit here and say we want to
refuse entry to everyone who comes into Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS announced that it would look into alternatives to jail
for deportees waiting to be sent home, educate businesses about
visa requirements and give INS inspectors sensitivity training so
they don't seem so rude to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Portland immigration inspectors turn away
foreigners nine times as often as inspectors in Seattle. Some
visitors later re-enter the United States through San Francisco or
Seattle with the same documents. Rejected travelers are sent back
to their homelands, but if they miss a return flight they're
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese travel agencies have blacklisted the airport. Asia
Times, an Internet newspaper based in Thailand, dubbed the city
''Deportland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Consul General and officials from the State
Department, the business community and the Port of Portland, which
manages the airport, attended the meeting with immigration
officials. Japanese representatives said the tone was positive, but
remained skeptical that the problem would be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some kind of progress,'' said Ken Obikane of Shokokai,
a nonprofit organization that represents Japanese-owned companies
and subsidiaries based in Oregon. ''But we have to see what kind of
action the INS takes. Until then, nobody knows if they can improve
the situation.''

<HEADLINE> Permanent Chechnya Force OKd  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russia said Friday it has formed an army
division for permanent duty in Chechnya, where rebels are still
mounting attacks despite government claims that they are being
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the 42nd division was ready
for deployment, the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not say how large the division was, but the
military has said about 25,000 Russian troops would be in Chechnya
for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said stationing the division in Chechnya was the next
step in bringing the eight-month military campaign to an end,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russian claims that the rebels are verging on defeat,
the militants are hanging on, staging regular attacks on Russian
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Russia may be in for a drawn-out guerrilla war in
Chechnya. Russian troops, relying on a lopsided advantage in
firepower, swept over the northern lowlands after invading in
September. But rebels have proved difficult to rout from their
hideouts in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces in Chechnya stepped up search and destroy
operations Friday in the south, where rebels are becoming more
active, the military command told Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rebel scouts and saboteurs in small groups are attacking army
convoys, roadblocks and federal positions, resorting to hit-and-run
tactics,'' the command's press service said.
</P>
<P>
   It said there were eight attacks on Russian positions Thursday
in the Nozhai-Yurt, Vedeno and Shatoi districts in southern and
eastern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels near Vedeno deep in the mountains fired Grad rockets, an
unusual use of such heavy weaponry, Interfax reported, citing
military officials.
</P>
<P>
   The 9{-foot-long missiles caused no injuries and Interfax cited
an official as saying they apparently had been set off from
makeshift facilities rather than from the mobile launchers used by
Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The efficiency of this technique is nearly zero,'' Interfax
quoted the unidentified official as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The military command said federal troops located and attacked
six rebel bases Thursday. It said 10 rebels were killed and two
were captured. The rest escaped, the command said, according to
Interfax. The casualty figures could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian air force sharply scaled back its bombing of
suspected rebel bases in the Argun and Vedeno gorges Friday, flying
just two missions over the past 24 hours compared to 70 sorties the
day before, press service said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extremist bases, camps and fortified posts which had been
discovered in the course of the anti-terrorist operation were wiped
out'' in the earlier air raids, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on the Russian convoys and positions followed a lull
that Russia had said showed the rebels were fragmented and nearing
collapse. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday reiterated
the claim that the rebels were disorganized and losing control.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in September, following
weeks of airstrikes, after Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded
neighboring Dagestan in August. The rebels also are blamed in a
series of apartment bombings in Russia that killed about 300 people
in September.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Vets Seek Diabetes Funds  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Vietnam veterans group asked the Veterans
Affairs Department on Friday to add diabetes to the list of
diseases linked to Agent Orange and other herbicide exposure during
the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam Veterans of America, in two petitions to VA
Secretary Togo West, also urged the department to consider the
total ''in-country effect,'' analogous to what has come to be
called ''Gulf War Syndrome,'' in determining disability
compensation.

   ''In-country veterans were exposed to land, air and water that
teemed with toxic chemicals ... and endemic diseases,'' VVA
National President George Duggins wrote West. He said that as a
result Vietnam vets disproportionally suffer from diseases
associated with more advanced age such as arthritis, immunological
and neurological disorders, muscular conditions and vascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-five years after the end of the war, we are seeing new
patterns of disease develop,'' said Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., who
joined VVA officials at a Capitol Hill news conference. ''I urge
Secretary West to join us in finding a more equitable way to ensure
that Vietnam veterans finally receive the care they have long
deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans have focused on diabetes since the VA's Agent Orange
Task Force a year ago concluded there was a link between the
disease and exposure to Agent Orange and other herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Air Force also released a study that found ''the
strongest evidence to date'' that airmen exposed to Agent Orange
had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The VVA says West, with the existing evidence, has the authority
''and the solemn responsibility,'' to add diabetes to the Agent
Orange list, but West has asked the National Academy of Sciences to
review the data both from the task force and the Air Force study
before any recommendations are made. That review is to be concluded
by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force sprayed millions of gallons of Agent Orange in
Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 to destroy jungle cover for enemy
supply lines and expose enemy bases.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law governing Agent Orange, Vietnam veterans need not
prove a direct causal relationship to receive service-based
compensation for certain diseases. The nine diseases on the list
include Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, respiratory cancers,
soft-tissue sarcoma and prostate cancer. The offspring of veterans
with spina bifida, a congenital birth defect of the spine, are also
eligible for benefits and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation for the ''in-country effect,'' the veterans said,
should be patterned on ''Gulf War Syndrome,'' where the VA has
recognized that the environment during the 1991 war with Iraq was
so toxic and hostile that health benefits were warranted even when
the diseases underlying a variety of symptoms have not been
diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Vietnam vets, diseases eligible for compensation
are clearly defined and the cumulative effects of a war that ended
a quarter-century ago may not be easy to prove.

<HEADLINE> Miami Police Chief Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The city's police chief resigned today after the
mayor criticized him for letting his department get involved in the
Elian Gonzalez raid -- a dispute that has plunged the city
government into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation came a day after Mayor Joe Carollo fired the
city manager during a hearing where dozens of residents said police
abused them while they protested Saturday's pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief William O'Brien said he issued the order to clear
his officers from around the house before armed federal agents
whisked Elian away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there's incredible anger and frustration in the (Cuban)
exile community, and I want to tell you, if you're looking for a
focal point for that frustration, here it is: I gave the orders,''
said O'Brien, 56.
</P>
<P>
   The former Vietnam-era Air Force fighter pilot and 25-year Miami
Police veteran said he was retiring because ''the healing's got to
start. The healing's got to start for this community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I refuse to be the lightning rod of divisiveness in this
community,'' O'Brien said. ''I refuse to be the chief of police in
a city that has someone as divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo
as mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Carollo had earlier demanded that City Manager Donald Warshaw
dismiss O'Brien for failing to warn the mayor about the raid to
seize the 6-year-old Cuban boy.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, who preceded O'Brien as chief, refused to fire him.
Since only the city manager can dismiss the chief, the stage was
set for the confrontation and Warshaw's firing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien will remain on the job until a replacement is named,
Warshaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not leaving to save my job. There are no deals being
made,'' said Warshaw. ''My fate is pretty much in other people's
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami City Commission can give Warshaw his job back if four
of five commissioners vote within 10 days to overturn Carollo's
decision. In comments today, Warshaw said he wouldn't lobby to
regain his job but noted that the mayor has little support from
other commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Johnny Winton, who did not support Warshaw's
dismissal, said it was too early to tell whether the commission
would consider overriding Carollo.
</P>
<P>
   Winton said O'Brien's retirement comes at a time when the
community most needs its professional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we're creating a gigantic leadership void,'' he
said. ''We're in very sad and trying times in the city of Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   The city commission voted to create a committee to investigate
police involvement in the federal government's seizure of Elian and
any police brutality that occurred during the protests. More than
300 people were arrested and tear gas was used to disperse crowds
after the boy was seized.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said Thursday that Warshaw's firing had nothing to do
with Elian. The mayor said Warshaw has been criticizing him, lying
and trying to turn department heads against him.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo could not immediately be reached for comment today
following O'Brien's announcement. Messages left at his office were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief had an hour's advance notice of the 5:15 a.m.
raid, but did not but tip off the mayor, a Cuban-American who had
openly sided with the Cuban boy's Miami relatives. O'Brien said
today he had never made a practice of telling mayors about plans
for police raids.
</P>
<P>
   The chief's resignation came as city officials prepared for
plans by Cuban exiles to converge into a street in Little Havana on
Saturday for a peaceful rally denouncing the U.S. government's
seizure of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Cuban exile leaders have spoken on Spanish-language
radio stations to urge people to participate in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elian's Miami relatives, who returned from Washington
early Thursday, were coping with their inability to meet with the
boy and the aftermath of the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel humiliated,'' Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez told
The Miami Herald. ''The world needs to pay attention to this case
so there are no more families like the Gonzalezes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, may intervene in the appeal of a
government decision to reunite him with his son. But the court put
off a decision on the father's request that he be substituted for
Elian's great-uncle as the boy's representative in the case. Such a
move would allow the father to drop the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The court also denied a request by Elian's Miami relatives to
visit the boy and declined to appoint a guardian for the boy other
than his father.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments May 11 on
whether Elian can seek an asylum hearing without his father's
permission and whether the Immigration and Naturalization Service
should have interviewed the boy to determine his wishes.

<HEADLINE> British 'Mad Cow' Study Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Preliminary results of a study to gauge how many
Britons could be infected with the human form of mad cow disease
have provided little insight into the extent of the threat,
government scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of 53 people in Britain have been attributed to a
variant of the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Experts
believe it is a human version of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
and that people get it by eating contaminated beef.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers working for the Department of Health analyzed 3,170
preserved samples of tonsil or appendix tissue for traces of an
infectious protein called prion, which has been found in the
appendixes and tonsils of people who have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   None of the samples showed the protein, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that no positives have been found is welcome news,
but these early results should not be taken as an indication of an
'all clear,''' said Britain's chief medical officer, Dr. Liam
Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Les Borysiewicz, a professor of medicine at the University
of Wales who chaired the committee reviewing the data, said it
would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions from the study's
negative results.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing we need is a better diagnostic test,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The test used, while the best available at the moment, has
limitations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're quite a way away from being able to give reassurance,''
Borysiewicz said. ''It really does not take us further in
estimating the size of the epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe most of the cases of infection with the human
form of mad cow disease occurred in the late 1980s, before the
introduction of controls to prevent contaminated meat getting to
the table.
</P>
<P>
   How many people eventually succumb to the disease, which emerged
in 1995, largely depends on the length of its incubation period,
which scientists say may be up to 20 years or more. Estimates of
the number of people who could be infected range from about 100 to
hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists intend to test a total of 18,000 samples,
including freshly removed tonsils and appendices.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Graham Medley, an expert on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease at
Warwick University, in England, said it is difficult to anticipate
what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the incubation period is 10 years, then we are in the
middle of the epidemic,'' he said. ''If the incubation time is 30
years, then we are only at the beginning. We have never before seen
this disease in humans and we simply do not know at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   British beef was banned in Europe for two years following an
outbreak of mad cow disease and the emergence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. The ban was lifted in August 1999 everywhere but France,
which has been taken to court by the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Alchemy Halts Rover Talks With BMW  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Rover workers celebrated Friday when a venture
capital firm failed in its bid to acquire the troubled auto group,
but industry analysts warned that any reprieve from drastic layoffs
could be brief.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's BMW, which owns Rover, said it might close down the
money-losing car business altogether if it can't find a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic reversal, Alchemy Partners announced that it had
called off talks aimed at a Rover takeover. Alchemy was believed
close to clinching a buyout, but said differences arose late
Thursday that compelled it to terminate discussions with BMW.
</P>
<P>
   BMW confirmed the two companies broke off negotiations due to
their inability to agree on conditions of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''BMW Group will now pursue alternative routes to bring to an
end its involvement in Rover Car Operations. Those routes include
the sale of Rover Car Operations or its closure,'' the company said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A closure of Rover's flagship Longbridge plant in central
England -- and the resulting loss of at least 8,500 jobs -- would
fulfill employees' worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''BMW wants out. That's what it's all about -- to escape the
losses,'' said Garel Rhys, director of the center for automotive
industry research at Cardiff University Business School. ''Even if
getting out means closure, it's either that or the destruction of
BMW itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The German carmaker said the impasse would not affect a plan to
sell its successful Land Rover operations to Ford Motor Co. Ford
has agreed to buy the four-wheel-drive business for $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Alchemy's unspecified bid offers unexpected hope
for a government-backed consortium that was patching together a
rival offer for Rover. The consortium, led by former Rover chief
executive John Towers, was widely seen as having insufficient time
to prepare a viable proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having suggested that it wanted to reach an agreement on
Rover by next week, BMW said Friday that it would postpone making a
decision until as late as the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Chinn, a spokesman for the Longbridge factory, said workers
there were ecstatic to hear of the collapse of Alchemy's takeover
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's absolutely superb news,'' said Longbridge employee Terry
Reilly. ''We have always said Alchemy was bad news for this plant --
they are asset strippers who intended to sell off the best bits and
leave people out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy had indicated it would need to lay off several thousand
employees. The Towers consortium has said it would eliminate far
fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rhys said that jubilation at Longbridge and at British
companies that supply parts for Rover cars was premature.
</P>
<P>
   The Towers consortium still has only a month to inspect Rover's
accounts, prepare a formal proposal to its financial backers and
secure the funding needed to buy and operate the car business.
</P>
<P>
   ''A month is going to be a pretty tight schedule for all that,''
Rhys said.
</P>
<P>
   Any company or group of investors planning to make an
alternative bid for Rover would be even more hard-pressed to meet
BMW's new deadline for a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to see who else is in the picture,'' said Gilly
Filsner, an analyst at the London-based automotive consultancy
Ludvigsen Associates.
</P>
<P>
   BMW decided last month to sell Rover after trying for six years
to restore it to profitability. Its abrupt withdrawal sparked
fierce criticism of the British government for what many people
perceived as its mishandling of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   BMW blamed much of its failure to stem losses at Rover on the
strength of the pound, which makes it more expensive to build cars
in Britain for sale in continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Filsner noted that BMW had proven its ability in the past to
sell cars priced in marks, at a time when the German currency also
was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''If BMW was incapable of making a go of Rover,'' she asked,
''how can someone without that kind of experience come in and be
successful with a high-volume business?''
</P>
<P>
   The failure of BMW and Alchemy to agree on terms of a sale
leaves the German company in a difficult position.
</P>
<P>
   BMW on Thursday dismissed the Towers consortium's offer as
''financially not secured,'' suggesting the consortium lacked the
funds needed to operate Rover. Now, BMW has no deal for an asset it
wants badly to dump.
</P>
<P>
   Investors punished the company for its failure to strike a deal
with Alchemy, driving BMW's share price down 2.3 percent from
Thursday to $26.85 at the close of trading in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   With investors demanding action and no viable buyer yet in
sight, BMW may find itself forced to close Rover's passenger car
business to shore up its share price and protect itself from an
unwanted takeover.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Attorney Gertz Dies  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Elmer Gertz, a civil rights attorney who helped
spare Jack Ruby from a death sentence and got ''thrill killer''
Nathan Leopold paroled after more than 30 years in prison, has
died. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz died at a Chicago nursing home early Thursday. He had
suffered a heart attack in January and never fully recovered, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz became a national figure in the late 1950s, when he won
parole for Leopold. Leopold and Richard Loeb were University of
Chicago students, sons of millionaires, when they accused in 1924
of the ''thrill killing'' of 14-year-old Bobby Franks. In its time,
the case was the ''trial of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Famed attorney Clarence Darrow persuaded the two to plead guilty
and saved them from death sentences. In 1958, Gertz got Leopold
paroled by persuading authorities he had rehabilitated himself in
prison. Leopold, who had a genius-level IQ, had devoted himself to
study in prison, mastering 27 languages. (Loeb had died in prison
in 1936.)
</P>
<P>
   Getz made news again in the early 1960s, this time for defending
Henry Miller against obscenity charges tied to his novel ''Tropic
of Cancer.'' The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately sided with Miller,
refusing to allow the book to be banned.
</P>
<P>
   Gertz also argued against the death penalty for Ruby, who was
convicted of killing Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of
President John F. Kennedy. Ruby's death sentence was overturned,
but he died in prison of natural causes in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, a landmark case was decided in Gertz's favor when the
U.S. Supreme COurt held that it was unconstitutional to disqualify
potential jurors because they objected to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel justified in my fights,'' Gertz said in a recent
interview for John Marshall Comment, the magazine of the John
Marshall Law School in Chicago. ''One of the difficulties in the
American criminal justice system is that we think in terms of
vengeance, not in terms of preventing crime or treating criminals
so that they cease to be criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertz, a 1930 graduate of the University of Chicago Law School,
fought for fair housing in Chicago in the 1940s and 1950s, and
argued for the admission of black lawyers into local bar
associations.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee during the
Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1969-1970 and is credited
with including strong civil rights language that became a model for
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the great civil libertarians of the nation. He
was willing to take on unpopular causes,'' said former Sen. Paul
Simon, a friend of Gertz's for more than 30 years.

   Microsoft Breakup Plan To Be Filed
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The proposals of the Justice Department and 19
states for punishing Microsoft for breaking the antitrust laws will
be submitted to a federal judge after the market closes today. All
the parties reportedly propose that the software giant be split
into two competing companies forbidden to reunite for at least 10
years. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson after ruled
April 3 that Microsoft repeatedly broke federal antitrust laws
intended to maintain fair competition by using its monopoly power
in computer operating systems to crush rivals. Microsoft stock was

   EU Opens Nintendo Price-Fix Probe
</P>

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission today opened an
investigation into possible price-fixing by Nintendo and seven
video game distributors. The Commission has been looking into
whether these companies divided up the market for Nintendo video
game systems like the ''NES'' model and the portable ''Game Boy''
in order to keep prices artificially high. ''The Commission
believes that the companies concerned participated in a cartel-like
arrangement with the aim of partitioning the European single
market,'' the agency said in a statement. Officials in Nintendo's
offices in the Netherlands and Germany were unavailable for comment
late today.

percent, a bit more than expected. Spending was up 0.5 percent. And
the savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income --
rose to 0.4 percent from a record low of 0.2 percent the month
before. March was the first month since last October that income
had grown faster than spending.

   Buffett To Take Blame at Meeting
</P>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett will be able to
tell shareholders in person this weekend what he already has said
in print -- his company had its worst year ever and he blames
himself for the performance. This weekend's annual meeting is
expected to attract 12,000 investors and followers of Buffett, one
of the world's richest men, who has made the gatherings a
circus-like event. Berkshire's earnings dropped 42 percent in 1999,
to $1.6 billion from $2.8 billion the year before. Berkshire's
stock, the most expensive on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 20
percent last year. At the same time, the stock market soared.
Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock was up $500 at $59,900 a share
this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, but almost 24
percent below the 52-week high of $78,600.

   Delta Pilots To Get On-Board Meals
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines plans to make meals available to
pilots on flights where food is served. The carrier says the
program, which it is starting voluntarily, will cost $3 million to
$5 million annually. Delta's pilots have no contractual provision
for in-flight meals. They get money to buy food at airports to
bring aboard, but long lines and quick connections often make that
impossible. On international flights, the pilots typically eat
airline food. But on domestic flights, extra meals are first
offered to flight attendants -- leaving many pilots hungry on long
trips.

its European Getaway operation and an enhanced Web site the airline
plans to begin this summer. TWA lost $76.1 million in the first

investors, though not quite distracting them from their
preoccupation with inflation and interest rates. A day after AT&AMP;T
pulled off the biggest initial public offering in U.S. history in a
market with sudden disdain for IPOs, investors wasted no time in
embracing the wireless ''tracking'' stock as it hit the open
market.

   Alchemy Calls Off Talks With BMW
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The venture capital firm that was expected to
acquire the troubled Rover automaking group from Germany's BMW has
called off the deal, and BMW warned today that it might close Rover
if it cannot find a buyer. Alchemy Partners, which was believed
close to clinching a buyout of Rover's money-losing car business,
said differences arose late yesterday that compelled it to
terminate discussions with BMW. BMW confirmed that the two
companies have broken off negotiations, due to their inability to
agree on certain unspecified conditions of the sale.

<HEADLINE> Arrest Made in Berlin Wall Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A former East German secret police colonel wanted
in Germany for the deaths of four people killed trying to flee over
the Berlin Wall has been arrested on the Spanish island of Gran
Canaria, Berlin police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Walter Schulze, 52, had been charged with four
counts of manslaughter in shootings at the wall between November
1985 and 1989, including the last person killed there during a Feb.
5, 1989, flight attempt.
</P>
<P>
   A police statement said that Schulze had turned to running
brothels after the fall of East Germany and that he had contact
with the underworld.
</P>
<P>
   He was to appear at his court trial in October 1988, but
disappeared with his Latvian-born wife in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police issued an international arrest warrant in February and
after a three-month search a special Spanish police group arrested
him Thursday in Gran Canaria, one of the Canary Islands, a police
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   A request for his extradition was being prepared, police said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 116; Nasdaq Up 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology shares
rising for the second straight day while blue-chip stocks came
under selling pressure amid concerns over rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 91.96 at 3,865.99. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down 116.34 at 10,771.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.37 at 1,456.55.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in technology stocks was led by a rally in
semiconductor shares. Intel gained 2 11/16 to 128, Applied
Materials rose 2 15/16 to 103 1/4 and PMC-Sierra jumped 13 9/16 to
196 3/16, all on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that aggressive investors think that the selloff has
hit the bottom with technology stocks, and it is safe to stick your
toe back in the water,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in the high-tech sector couldn't prop up the
broader market, which was weighed down by fears of rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that Americans' incomes rose
last month even faster than spending, something that hasn't
happened since October.
</P>
<P>
   But although people made more money, they didn't put
significantly more away in savings. The report showed that the
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income
-- rose only slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a record low of
0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   That provided another sign that the economy continues to grow at
a brisk pace, which the Federal Reserve will likely consider at its
policy-making meeting on May 16. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates for the sixth time since June as they attempt
to keep inflationary pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has a governor on it right now ... it's called the
Fed meeting next month,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Until
that meeting, there will be a lid on the upside of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of higher interest rates pushed financial services stocks
down. American Express dropped 3 to 152 and J.P. Morgan was off 3
at 128 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Merck was off 3 1/16 to 68 7/16 after financial news station
CNBC reported that the company may face safety questions from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration about its painkiller Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based music service MP3.com tainted the technology
sector, falling 39 percent after a judge found the company liable
for infringing the copyrights of the Recording Industry Association
of America. MP3's products make it possible to download music over
the Internet. Shares fell 4{ to 7[.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 738.90 million
shares, down from 896.28 million shares on Thursday. On the Nasdaq,
advancers were ahead by an 11-to-8 margin.

<HEADLINE> Vargas Llosa Defends Trujillo Book  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Mario Vargas Llosa
spent months researching his new novel about the late Dominican
dictator Rafael Trujillo -- and found, 39 years after Trujillo's
death, a society still haunted by his long dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Vargas Llosa has been in Santo Domingo both promoting
and defending his new novel, ''La Fiesta del Chivo'' (''The Goat's
Party''). He says the book, a work of historical fiction,
represents the ''human truth'' of the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a version that many Dominicans, still struggling to
solidify their democracy, aren't comfortable with. The book has
left many in this Caribbean nation of 8 million feeling a little
exposed, a little embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until 1961,
when he was assassinated by a few conspirators. In that era, many
Dominicans acquiesced to the dictatorship in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The iron curtain that we have covered ourselves with for
decades has been broken,'' said Carlos Francisco Elias, a literary
critic.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo's legacy was a series of authoritarian administrations,
fraudulent elections and a culture that reveres strongmen --
including Joaquin Balaguer, a Trujillo aide who led the country on
and off and at 93 is running again for president in May elections.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting here for the first time since the book was published,
Vargas Llosa told a crowd of more than 800 that everything in the
novel either ''happened or could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian author said it pained him to learn that the family
of Antonio de la Maza, one of the men who assassinated Trujillo,
was unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I have admiration for any of the characters that figure in
the novel, it is for the seven men who waited for Trujillo on the
highway to San Cristobal and killed him there,'' Vargas Llosa said.
</P>
<P>
   De la Maza's relatives bought an advertisement in the newspaper
Hoy saying the novel would confuse younger generations who didn't
live through ''the system that asphyxiated us.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the conspirators have died.
</P>
<P>
   Historian and former U.S. Ambassador Bernardo Vega noted that
none of the assassins' families came to hear Vargas Llosa speak.
''The families are not happy with the book because he treats them
as humans who get drunk and cheat on their wives and have human
weaknesses, rather than as the heroes we read about in history
books,'' Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   In classic Vargas Llosa style, ''The Goat's Party'' moves back
and forth in time and place.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with the fictionalized memories of a woman whose
father had fallen out of favor with the regime and who offered her
to Trujillo to satisfy Trujillo's rumored passion for young girls.
</P>
<P>
   Her memories are superimposed on the story of the dictator's
assassins and Trujillo's final days. Scenes of the torture those
men suffered in prison afterward are mixed with a portrait of the
woman, Urania Cabral, visiting her father for the first time since
her encounter in Trujillo's bedroom 35 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas Llosa also devotes a good bit of the book to Balaguer,
describing how he managed to stay in power after Trujillo died. The
author said he portrayed Balaguer -- himself a prolific author -- as
cold and calculating because he came across that way in interviews
and in ''a good part of his works.''
</P>
<P>
   Releasing his own book Friday, a work of history called ''The
English Race,'' Balaguer praised Vargas Llosa's work as ''a good
novel ... (delivered) with great ease of style and a lot of
imagination.''

<HEADLINE> Mandela Assures Burundi's Army  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Confident that Burundi's seven-year
civil war is near an end, former South African President Nelson
Mandela on Friday assured the Tutsi-led army that no peace
settlement would be possible without its support.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's first, whirlwind trip was meant to convince the army --
the real force in the tiny central African nation -- that their
concerns would be taken into account during peace negotiations in
Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations, in their 20th month, ultimately should yield a
power-sharing agreement that would allow for the integration of
Hutu rebels into the army.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that we are on the verge of a breakthrough,''
Mandela said before leaving the heavily-guarded capital, Bujumbura.
But ''if the army and the National Assembly are not with us, we
cannot bring peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace mediator brought along former Nigerian President Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar to explain to the officers how a series of
coups had ruined his own West African nation. Abubakar assumed
power in Nigeria in 1998 -- after dictator Gen. Sani Abacha died of
a heart attack -- and paved the way for multiparty elections that
were won by another former military leader, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's Hutu rebels have been battling the army since 1993 in
a fight that has left more than 200,000 people dead. Most
Burundians blame politicians and officers who refuse to relinquish
their tight grip on power to restore calm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I indicated that the defense force of Burundi is far ahead of
the thinking of the politicians,'' Mandela told reporters. ''They
support negotiations without reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said he had listened to questions and concerns from the
High Army Council, although he said he did not agree with the men
on every point.
</P>
<P>
   One disagreement touched on integrating majority Hutus into the
army, Mandela said, and he warned against ''unilateral
integration'' outside the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it had already recruited and trained Hutu
soldiers and officers, and that Mandela's proposal for an ethnic
quota had largely been met.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels have argued that only fighters from their ranks --
not just any Hutus -- should be eligible for integration.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to 121 legislators at the National Assembly, Mandela
promised to mobilize funds from international donors to develop
industry in Burundi and eradicate poverty, but only after peace
takes hold.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela briefly visited the Military Academy, where he promised
midlevel officers he would give them, and not their commanders,
priority during his next visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the same military facility in October 1993 that Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first
democratically elected president and a Hutu, prompting Hutu
politicians to drum up support for the Hutu rebellion that has
engulfed the country in violence.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the message was different. As Mandela walked onto
the academy's stage, a band struck up Bob Marley's anti-war song
called ''War'' to the rousing applause of the military men in the
hall.

<HEADLINE> Government study says impact of gambling difficult to gauge  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A central question in the national debate over
legalized gambling -- whether its economic benefits outweigh its
social costs -- cannot be resolved with information currently
available, according to a federal study released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Using Atlantic City, N.J., as its case study, the General
Accounting Office found ample statistics on jobs created and taxes
paid by the casino industry but little definitive information on
the downside of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''While data on family problems, crime and suicide are
available, tracking systems generally do not collect data on the
causes of these incidents, so they cannot be linked to gambling,''
reported the GAO, the investigatory arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO did the study at the request of Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.,
a leading congressional opponent of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, it follows the path previously covered by the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which released a report
last year after two years of work.
</P>
<P>
   Like the commission, the GAO found anecdotal reports linking
compulsive gambling with domestic violence, child abuse and
divorce, but no way to establish or measure the connection.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO wrote: ''We found no conclusive evidence on whether or
not gambling caused increased social problems in Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission last year wrote: ''After much testimony and a
review of the existing economic literature, the commission has
concluded that it is currently impossible to obtain even a rough
approximation of a true cost-benefit calculation concerning the
economic impact of legalized gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO visited and spoke to officials in Atlantic City,
Atlantic County and New Jersey's capital, Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   It reported that domestic violence incidents, child abuse,
divorce, single-parent families and suicide ''increased in some of
the years after casinos began operating and decreased in other
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter appended to the GAO report, New Jersey Casino
Control Commission Chairman James Hurley wrote, ''We clearly
believe that the positive impacts that casinos have generated far
outweigh the perceived negative impacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay James, who chaired the national commission on gambling,
wrote that the GAO study should ''serve as a further reminder that
additional research must be undertaken at the federal, state and
local level'' to gauge the social costs of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO is working on a separate study, also requested by Wolf,
focusing on the economic and social effects of so-called
''convenience gambling,'' a phrase often applied to slot machines
and video poker terminals located in neighborhood bars or stores.

<HEADLINE> Films Preserved for History Featured  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Great and small 20th century movies rescued
from destruction will be shown starting Saturday at the National
Gallery of Art as part of a preservation project to save ''orphan''
films.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings range from a one-minute ''Blacksmithing Scene''
made in 1893, the first film shown commercially in the United
States, to an 83-minute 1924 feature shot wholly in Alaska, ''The
Chechahcos.'' From World War II, there's a 10-minute
''Autobiography of a Jeep'' and a cartoon warning soldiers against
spies, with comic rhymes by noted children's author Dr. Seuss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Films made by the old nitrate process can't even be shown any
more-- it's against the fire laws,'' said Roger L. Mayer, chairman
of the National Film Preservation Foundation. ''After a while, they
just turn into jelly if they aren't transferred to safety film.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the films made before 1951 have been lost, David
J. Francis told a preview audience at the National Gallery. He is
in charge of the world's largest collection of films at the Library
of Congress. The gallery will show 17 of them.
</P>
<P>
   James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, said Congress
recognized the importance of preserving old film in 1988 but did
not provide money to do it. One result, he explained, was the
foundation -- a public-private partnership which can collect
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation organized a White House Millennium Project called
''Treasures from American Archives'' that put together films and
collections of footage that go back as far as 1893. They provide a
panorama of the 20th century, the first to be recorded on camera
from its start.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Bill Ivey of the government's National Endowment for
the Arts said his agency had contributed $500,000 to the $1.5
million project and over the past 35 years had spent nearly $20
million on film preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said the University of California at Los Angeles has
millions of feet of old newsreels, invaluable to historians, which
could decay unless money becomes available to save them. Now, he
said, big studios have come to see that old hits have commercial
value and every year are spending $5 million to $10 million a year
on preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to worry about 'Citizen Kane' or 'Gone with the
Wind' any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to show that old films have commercial value even when
they were not hits, because of the vast appetite for material for
TV, the Internet and home videos. The ''Treasures'' project is
transferring 50 of them to a set of digital video disks (DVD's),
which can be used to show 10 1/2 hours of film. He said they will
be distributed free to libraries starting in September and sold to
the public for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Performances at the National Gallery start at 2 p.m. Saturday
with ''The Chechahcos'' and a 1908 special-effects comedy called
''The Thieving Hand.'' It will be followed by a sample of short
films from the project on May 6, and performances of other old
films May 7, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Stage Set for GOP Protests  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Protesters have agreed to drop their
free-speech lawsuit against the city and the stage has been set for
a week of noisy demonstrations at this summer's Republican national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Unity 2000 and city officials reached an agreement this week to
allow the group to use one of the downtown area's most heavily
traveled thoroughfares for a large rally on the eve of the July 31
to Aug. 3 convention, said city Solicitor Kenneth Trujillo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 local and national activist groups, promoting
dozens of ''progressive'' causes, plan to attend the July 30 rally
on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, which connects City Hall to the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Unity 2000 and a group organizing a smaller rally filed a
federal lawsuit earlier this month after the city refused to issue
a permit. The suit accused the city of trampling on the protesters'
free-speech rights by giving the Republicans first dibs on prime
public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy that the process is over,'' Unity 2000 leader
Michael Morrill said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement hinges on the approval of Philadelphia 2000, the
host committee that controls the sites for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required both sides to give ground. The
protesters agreed to scale back the event from nine to seven hours
and abandoned plans to march on Market Street and around City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the city agreed to provide a stage and sound system,
portable toilets, medical services and security at no charge.

<HEADLINE> Prison Riot Kills 26 in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Rioting that broke out after an inmate's
mutilated body was found stuffed in a prison sewer pipe led to 26
deaths before the unrest ended Friday, the worst bloodletting in
Colombia's violent prison system.
</P>
<P>
   The melee between paramilitary fighters and common criminals at
Bogota's El Modelo federal prison marked the swift collapse of a
much-touted nonviolence pact signed by inmates at the crumbling
facility just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Romulo Gonzalez, whose job includes prison
oversight, labeled the latest killings the product of ''40 years of
government neglect'' of Colombia's corrupt, anarchic and
overcrowded jails.
</P>
<P>
   The rioting broke out Thursday after guards found the body of a
missing inmate -- said to be a jailed paramilitary member -- chopped
to pieces in a garbage bag inside a sewer pipe, police operations
director Gen. Alfonso Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery led to retaliation killings that tapered off early
Friday between jailed rightist militia members and inmates in
another cellblock housing convicted murderers, armed robbers and
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun bursts and loud explosions were heard throughout the night
as officials mulled their options and inmates' families flocked to
the prison in search of news.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of anxious mothers, wives and girlfriends pressed at
riot police barricades outside the jail Friday morning as officials
were slow to release the names of the dead and 18 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had considered a police raid during the melee but
ultimately negotiated with gang leaders to lay down their weapons,
Gen. Arellano said. The inmates held hostages and had cut
electricity inside the jail, making a pitch-dark assault risky.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dead were shot in the head at close range, Arellano
added. Officials confiscated guns, grenades and caches of
ammunition, and transferred 42 inmates to other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   El Modelo, housing 5,000 inmates in quarters meant for only
1,800, was the site of a rare ''peace pact'' signed Feb. 29 between
rival factions, including militia fighters, jailed rebels and
common criminals.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony attended by top officials, the gangs then turned
over weapons and pledged a six-month reprieve in the jail's almost
daily violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gangleaders expressed hope that their pact, which followed a
December clash that left 12 inmates dead, would be an inspiration
to current peace talks to end Colombia's nearly 36-year civil
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But prisons director Fabio Campos acknowledged Friday that the
groups had only turned over a few of their arms, and that underpaid
guards continue to allow escapes and easy access to weapons in
return for bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally, there's corruption,'' Campos, a retired police
general and the eighth person to hold his post in just two years,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Campos pledged a weapons search and a crackdown on corrupt
guards at El Modelo but admitted there were no easy short-term
answers to a prison crisis in which nearly 500 inmates have been
killed since 1997 and more than twice that number have escaped.
</P>
<P>
   A major U.S. drug suspect wanted in the United States escaped
from Bogota's other federal prison, La Picota, in March after
allegedly bribing guards to smuggle him out in an old mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Campos said the government expected to build four new,
state-of-the-art federal prisons in addition to one opening in
June, and had plans to hire more guards and raise their salaries,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Book Blasts WWII Rabbis  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- During the Holocaust, ultra-Orthodox American
rabbis focused on saving several hundred Polish Talmudic scholars,
ignoring the suffering of millions of other Jews who were
eventually murdered by the Nazis, a new book charges.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis, organized as the Rescue Committee, feared that if
the tiny group of scholars and their students were lost, the Jewish
religion would vanish with them.
</P>
<P>
   The group's narrow goal brought it into conflict with mainstream
American Jewish groups working to rescue as many Jews as possible
and to influence reluctant American politicians to take action,
wrote Holocaust historian and Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''The Response of Orthodox Jewry in the United States
to the Holocaust,'' is being released Tuesday to coincide with
Israel's annual memorial day for the 6 million Jews killed in the
Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Menahem Porush, chairman of the Israel branch of Agudat
Israel, a worldwide ultra-Orthodox group, said it was only natural
for the rabbis to try to rescue those close to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has to teach us, who live according to the Torah, the
meaning of 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuroff documents how the rabbis funneled scarce funds to
scholars already safely in exile so they could maintain full-time
Talmud studies, even as other Jews were being killed in death
camps.
</P>
<P>
   Menahem Brod of the ultra-Orthodox Habad movement said the
refugees needed the money to survive.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zuroff's book, the Rescue Committee extorted money
from mainstream Jewish groups, employed shady practices to transfer
funds to Europe and even violated the Jewish Sabbath for its cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Rescue Committee threatened to mount a rival fund-raising
drive unless local Jewish federations handed over cash. Some
complied, Zuroff wrote, but others refused, arguing that the
mainstream rescue campaign would include the scholars anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Zuroff, who directs the Simon Wiesenthal Center office in
Israel, does not go so far as to blame the Rescue Committee for the
deaths of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''What actually cost the lives of Jews was that Nazis and their
collaborators murdered them,'' Zuroff said in an interview. But he
said the Rescue Committee's ''tunnel vision'' hindered rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Zuroff noted that Rescue Committee rabbis were the only ones to
march in Washington to protest the Nazi killings, but then-U.S.
President Franklin Roosevelt refused to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   Zuroff said Roosevelt's Jewish advisers counseled against a
meeting, reflecting the divisions among Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Rescue Committee saved about 625 Polish rabbis
and students who had escaped to Lithuania, and kept several hundred
others alive in Central Asia and Shanghai through donations, Zuroff
said.

<HEADLINE> Pink Plastic Flamingos Elicit Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- When Doug Henry bought a pair of pink
flamingos at an antique market for $15, he thought he'd found a
real bargain and great yard art.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors in the Towne Park subdivision didn't agree. Now
that bargain could end up costing Henry thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the subdivision's homeowners association began fining
Henry $25 a day for violating its rules prohibiting unapproved lawn
decorations. By the time Henry and his wife, Ellen, sold their
house, the fine had reached $3,400.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a lot of money for two little flamingos,'' said Ellen
Henry.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they didn't learn about the fine until last
month, when the association placed a lien on their house and
attorneys handling the sale withheld $3,400 in escrow. If someone
had just asked, the couple would have moved the plastic birds, Doug
Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners association spokesman George Nowack said the group
sent the couple two certified letters explaining the fine, but both
came back as undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   Now if the two sides don't reach a settlement, a judge might
have to decide who gets the $3,400 in escrow.

<HEADLINE> New owners say Vernon Downs is harness racing's greatest hope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VERNON, N.Y. (AP) -- A new paint job. A new owner. A new lease on
life. Officials at Vernon Downs are looking ahead with optimism
that they can resurrect the once-proud harness track.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered racing track opened its 2000 season Friday
night. Racing fans will see state-of-the-art improvements and a
more fan friendly schedule as Vernon Downs attempts to rebound
after losing more than $3 million over the last four years, said
John Signorelli, who put together a local investment to purchase
controlling interest of the track in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've spent close to a million dollars to give this place a
new facelift. Now we wait to see if our work resonates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to grow into what we want, we'll need this summer to be
successful,'' said Signorelli.
</P>
<P>
   The track begins its 104-date schedule in the midst of a
renovation project some would say goes against logic, considering
the health of New York's harness racing industry, which has been in
steady decline since the state-run off-track betting system was
initiated in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   A new 7/8-mile track is under construction, the jewel in a
$750,000 face-lift that also features improved corporate luxury
boxes, dining facilities and a more user-friendly simulcasting
area.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first phase of a vision Signorelli has for the 300
acres the track sits on in a scenic valley in the heart of Oneida
County farm country, about 30 miles east of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Signorelli also would like to develop a possible equine park to
train young horses, build a dude ranch with horse riding trails,
add an RV park and an amphitheater as well as a show-horse
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Special events such as professional wrestling, rock concerts, a
jazz festival and an AMA Grand National Dirt Track Championship
have been scheduled at the Downs during this season. Attracting
younger crowds is also part of Signorelli's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The blend of events works for creating long-term customers,''
Signorelli said. ''You can't create harness racing fans overnight,
but if you get them out here for the special events, maybe they'll
return for a night of harness racing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a vision, a plan,'' Signorelli said. ''Whether it will
work or not, only God knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Signorelli knows, though, that harness racing remains the key to
the equation. His vision will die unless he can develop a solid
following to a track that attracted an average of at least 3,000
fans a night from its 1953 opening through 1981, but hasn't
averaged 2,000 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The financially ailing track was perilously close to shutting
down before Signorelli's group came to the rescue. Last year, the
average attendance (1,334) and on-track handle ($103,280) were the
lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for confidence beyond the cosmetic, Signorelli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over in September, Signorelli has reached an
unprecedented two-year agreement with Vernon's horsemen that
replaces traditional revenue percentages with guaranteed purses and
corporate profit-sharing. And, already there have been 785 request
for stalls, up from 450 last season, evidence that the horsemen
believe a turnaround is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the season, which started in March last year and featured
many fan-unfriendly midweek dates, has been moved back a month and
will focus on weekends. That should help attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt we're trying to buck a statewide trend
here,'' Signorelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is New York's greatest hope for a harness racing
renaissance,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Managers Leave Soros' Fund Co.  </HEADLINE>
By NOELLE KNOX, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The top two managers at Soros Fund Management, a
$14 billion hedge fund company, are leaving in the wake of
double-digit declining performance this year.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Stan Druckenmiller, portfolio manager of the
Quantum Fund, and Nick Roditi, 54, portfolio manager of the Quota
Fund, puts the future of Soros' hedge fund empire up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hedge funds are, in many cases, very much one-man shows,''
said Meredith Jones, vice president and director of research for
Van Hedge Fund Advisors International Inc. She added, ''They are
big shoes to fill. There are not many people in the industry who
have the name recognition that Druckenmiller and Roditi did.''
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, 69, a renowned investor and philanthropist, said
Friday in a letter to investors that he will convert the Quantum
Fund to a ''lower risk/lower reward operation'' and rename it the
Quantum Endowment Fund. He did not name a successor to
Druckenmiller, who is taking a sabbatical after 12 years with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The Quantum Fund, which has assets of $8.24 billion, is down 22
percent this year, scarring an otherwise stellar record of
returning an average of 30 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Quota Fund, which has $1.27 billion in assets, is down 32
percent this year. Soros said he plans to transfer the management
of the assets to another outside advisor.
</P>
<P>
   News of the shakeup at Soros Fund Management comes less than a
month after Julian Robertson said he would liquidate Tiger
Management, a hedge fund with $6 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Both hedge funds have been victims of their own success. Their
eye-popping performance attracted huge sums of money, which became
harder and harder to invest deftly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have come to realize that a large hedge fund like Quantum
Fund is no longer the best way to manage money,'' Soros wrote in
his letter to investors, adding, ''Quantum Fund is far too big and
its activities too closely watched by the market to be able to
operate successfully in this environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are investment funds that are incorporated overseas
and cater to multimillionaires, universities, endowments and the
like. Hedge funds, which are largely unregulated, can make riskier
investments than mutual funds. For example, hedge funds often
borrow huge sums of money to pour into stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the hedge fund advisor, said she didn't think the
problems of Tiger and Soros would have lasting repercussions on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most hedge funds have less than $1 billion in assets, she said,
and don't face the same challenges.

<HEADLINE> Rio Stock Exchange Ceases Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's oldest stock exchange
ended trading for good on Friday, engulfed by its more powerful
rival in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, all share trading previously done on the Rio de
Janeiro Stock Exchange will be carried out by the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange, Latin America's largest bourse.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in July, the Rio exchange, known as BVRJ, will trade
exclusively in government securities. It also will be the forum for
privatization auctions of government companies.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by imperial decree in 1845, the Rio Stock Exchange was
the country's main bourse for more than a century. But it never
recovered from a trading scandal in 1989, when high-rolling
investor Nagi Nahas defaulted on payment of about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Exchange suspended operations, six brokerages collapsed,
and many investors shifted operations to Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume Thursday on the Sao Paulo Exchange was about $611
million, while Rio's volume was just $15.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Study Examines Gambling Impact  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A central question in the national debate over
legalized gambling -- whether its economic benefits outweigh its
social costs -- cannot be answered with information currently
available, according to a federal study released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Using Atlantic City, N.J., as its case study, the General
Accounting Office found ample statistics on jobs created and taxes
paid by the casino industry but little definitive information on
the downside of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''While data on family problems, crime and suicide are
available, tracking systems generally do not collect data on the
causes of these incidents, so they cannot be linked to gambling,''
reported the GAO, the investigatory arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO did the study at the request of Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va.,
a gambling opponent.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, it follows the path previously covered by the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which released a report
last year after two years of work.
</P>
<P>
   Like the commission, the GAO found anecdotal reports linking
compulsive gambling with domestic violence, child abuse and
divorce, but no way to establish or measure the connection.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO wrote: ''We found no conclusive evidence on whether or
not gambling caused increased social problems in Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO visited and spoke to officials in Atlantic City,
Atlantic County and New Jersey's capital, Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   It reported that domestic violence incidents, child abuse,
divorce, single-parent families and suicide ''increased in some of
the years after casinos began operating and decreased in other
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter appended to the GAO report, New Jersey Casino
Control Commission Chairman James Hurley wrote, ''We clearly
believe that the positive impacts that casinos have generated far
outweigh the perceived negative impacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay James, who chaired the national commission on gambling,
wrote that the GAO study should ''serve as a further reminder that
additional research must be undertaken at the federal, state and
local level'' to gauge the social costs of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO is working on a separate study, also requested by Wolf,
focusing on the economic and social effects of so-called
''convenience gambling,'' such as slot machines and video poker
terminals located in neighborhood bars or stores.

<HEADLINE> 2 Arrested in School Explosions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Two students were charged Friday with
setting off two stink bombs whose fumes sent six people at a Navajo
Reservation high school to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman described Thursday's explosions as a prank,
though the school canceled classes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure this is a serious matter to the school,'' said Ed
Hall, an FBI spokesman in Phoenix. ''To me, it's more like a
prankster trying to cause problems more than somebody trying to
cause harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Tuba City High students, Rajer G. Hudson and
Stewart R. Tracy Jr., were charged with assault with a dangerous
weapon and a crime on an Indian reservation, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on both federal charges, the Navajo students could
face up to 15 years in prison, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson and Tracy made the stink bombs by putting cleaning
chemicals and aluminum foil in a plastic bottle, Hall said. The
combination creates a gas that expands to crack the bottle and
causes a foul odor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson and Tracy told investigators they wanted to create a few
laughs and get out of school early but had no intention of harming
anyone, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Four students and two janitors were treated for minor eye and
throat irritation from the fumes, said Carinda Little, spokeswoman
for the Tuba City Medical Center. One boy was knocked unconscious
by the fumes but was responsive shortly after arriving at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson suffered minor burns, Hall said, but neither he nor
Little knew whether Hudson was considered one of the six injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tuba City is in the northwest corner of the 4.8-million acre
Navajo Reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Utah Rampage Suspect Captured  </HEADLINE>
By BOB KUESTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDY, Utah (AP) -- A man accused of shooting two people to death
and wounding three may have been trying to steal a car during his
brief, deadly rampage, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn Martinez, 21, was captured Friday morning, 12 hours after
he allegedly shot a woman at a hotel and four people at a nearby
restaurant in this Salt Lake City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Police Sgt. Kevin Thacker said Martinez was was discovered
at a house in nearby Midvale and gave up after a brief negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was trying to get a car. There may be more to it than that,
but he's not willing to talk to us,'' Thacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was held on suspicion of murder. A hearing had not been
scheduled as of Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has a long criminal history that includes convictions
for weapons offenses, burglary and armed robbery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He shot a female companion in the leg after arguing with her
over the use of a car Thursday night in a room at the Extended
StayAmerica hotel, police Sgt. Michelle Fenley said. The woman,
Jamie Lucero, was treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Martinez crossed the street to a Chevys restaurant
where he demanded to use a telephone, then shot and killed the
restaurant's 33-year-old manager, Jason Rasmussen, and wounded an
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Parker, 22, was in serious but stable condition Friday at
University of Utah Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then ran to the restaurant's parking lot, where he
fatally shot Peter Berg, 43, of Ogden, Fenley said. She said it was
unclear whether the man was trying to take Berg's car.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant then tried to carjack a vehicle driven by Debbie
Briggs, shooting her through the windshield, police said.
</P>
<P>
   With a bullet wound in her jaw and the gunman running after her
car, Briggs drove three blocks to a convenience store. She was
helped inside and an employee locked the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was bleeding very badly from her head and her shirt was
covered with blood,'' said a customer, Ryan Gibbons. Gibbons said
Briggs' daughter was grazed by a bullet, something Fenley could not
confirm. Briggs, 44, was in serious condition Friday at LDS
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A handgun thought to have been used in the shootings was found
in bushes near the restaurant, Fenley said.

<HEADLINE> Elian Senate Hearings Postponed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee said Friday it
was postponing a hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine the
legal implications of the federal raid on the Miami home of Elian
Gonzalez's relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was put off to an undetermined date after the
Justice Department informed the committee it could not meet a
Friday deadline to supply all documents related to the surveillance
of the home, the possibility of weapons in the home, the obtaining
of search warrants and the conduct of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 5 p.m. Thursday, we received an extensive document
request from the committee asking for documents by Friday,''
Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said. ''We began working
as hard as we can to compile all the documents sought by the
committee. Many of them are located in Miami and other outlying
offices, and we will continue to work with the committee to get
them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday letter from Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, to Attorney General Janet Reno gave the
department 24 hours to turn over all documents ''related to (1)
surveillance of the Miami home, including but not limited to the
possibility of weapons in that home; (2) seeking and obtaining the
search warrant and the arrest warrant; (3) the decision to enter
the home and the means of entry, and (4) the conduct of the
operation of entering the home, seizing the boy, and taking him to
Maryland, including but not limited to any tactical plan or rules
of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats have generally been critical of the
proposed hearing, characterizing it as the latest GOP attack on
Reno's Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The courts are the proper forum within which to look at all
these matters, not the Congress. I think it's politicized, I think
it's wrong and I think it could be very damaging,'' Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can serve as the first step of a graceful exit strategy
for hearings that were a mistake in the first place,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Judiciary's top Democrat. ''The American
public resents investigations that are increasingly political and
one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department seized Elian April 22 and reunited him
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The pair, along with Elian's
stepmother, Nersy, and his baby half brother, Hianny, are staying a
secluded retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken Thursday show Elian playing baseball with his
father, romping with a dog and smiling with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, kept up their criticism of
the operation to wrest Elian from his Miami relatives and return
him to his father. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, accused
the administration of ''character assassination designed to
discredit'' Elian's Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   ''As it turns out, Elian was in no danger with his Miami family
until the Justice Department entered their home with guns drawn,''
said DeLay, who has referred to the federal agents conducting the
operation as ''jackbooted thugs.''

<HEADLINE> Credit Lyonnais Probe Adds Trichet  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The head of the Bank of France is being
investigated in connection with the travails of Credit Lyonnais, a
bank that lost billions before undergoing a costly government
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, who has been expected to succeed Wim
Duisenberg as head of the European Central Bank in 2002, is
suspected of disseminating false information to financial markets,
judicial sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Trichet served as director of the French Treasury from 1987 to
1993, covering the critical 1992-93 period of bank records being
examined. Trichet was appointed governor of France's central bank
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Trichet said he was ''profoundly
surprised'' by the turn of events and that he would place himself
at the ''total disposition'' of the investigating judge. ''I have
total confidence in the justice of our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jean-Pierre Zanoto was expected to summon Trichet for
questioning. Zanoto is in charge of the investigation, which opened
in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' chairman from 1988 to 1993,
was placed under investigation two years ago for presenting false
financial records and information. Francois Gille, the bank's
director-general, is under investigation for presenting false
company accounts.
</P>

   The bank lent money to several companies that went under,
racking up billions of francs in debt and forcing a costly
government bailout, approved last year, that cost French taxpayers
nearly $18 billion.

Union Commission agreed to aid only on condition that the bank sell

<HEADLINE> Uganda Cops Check Cult Leader House  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Janet Kyomukama left the Ugandan doomsday
cult after being asked to write down her sins, pay a small fine for
each line and hand over $173. Her departure didn't stop the cult
from telling her what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a tiny, roadside cafe Friday, Kyomukama recalled how
one of the cult leaders now sought by police told her to take her
four young children to Kanungu, where 530 people were later burned
alive in a mysterious fire March 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said the world was going to end and what was happening in
Mozambique was an example,'' said Kyomukama, smiling one moment,
squirming uncomfortably the next. The cult leader, Credonia
Mwerinde, was referring to the flooding in the southeast African
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said if I did not go to Kanungu, I would see what would
happen to anyone left behind,'' Kyomukama told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after that exchange, Kyomukama's experience is just
another bit of evidence in the police investigation of 979 deaths
connected to the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Police, again complaining about a lack of funds, poked Friday
around a house in the Kampala suburb of Ndejje that had been rented
by another cult leader, excommunicated Roman Catholic priest
Dominic Kataribabo.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection came a day after 55 bodies were unearthed from a
house Kataribabo rented 4{ miles away in Ggaba, another suburb. A
month ago, 155 bodies were unearthed at the excommunicated priest's
house in a village near Kanungu in southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Kyomukama, who used to go to the Ggaba house for prayers, said
she joined the cult in 1998 but left after being asked to write
down her sins and hand over money. She told the AP that other
members implored her in February to rejoin. When she refused, they
told her to go see Mwerinde at the Ggaba house.
</P>
<P>
   Like the people living near the other cult houses, neighbors in
Ggaba either cannot or will not explain how 55 people could have
been killed, then buried in the garage in the small compound
without attracting attention.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ndejje, site of the house police checked Friday, the cult
didn't enjoy such a peaceful existence.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after moving into a new, three-bedroom house in
1998, cult members incurred the wrath of residents when they
demanded $100 before handing over a woman and boy who disappeared
after joining the group.
</P>
<P>
   Local security officer Moses Lwere said when the cult members
''dodged'' his requests to hand the pair over, he assembled other
local armed guards and confronted the cult members.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told them if they did not bring the woman and the boy, they
would have to face it rough,'' Lwere said.
</P>
<P>
   They got the pair back, and the cult members moved on, but
police took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Police have inspected the Ndejje house twice since March.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, officers asked the wife of the house's owner and
neighbors about the way the cult members behaved, dressed and
prayed, said Mary Kwetegyka, a teacher who lives a few doors away.
</P>
<P>
   Kwetegyka said no one believed any bodies were buried at the
house until they learned of the grisly Ggaba discovery. Now, she is
not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know what was taking place,'' she said. ''If they
had not been religious, we would have been suspicious a long time
ago.''

<HEADLINE> WWII Trophy Art To Be Returned  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Art pieces looted from Germany and Russia --
including parts of Peter the Great's famed Amber Room -- are
returning home in a historic swap, although hundreds of thousands
of other items still await repatriation.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange ends half a century of obscurity for the artworks
and opens them to public viewing. But they are only a fraction of
the vast cultural booty both Russia and Germany scooped up during
and after World War II, and the dispute over so-called ''trophy
art'' continues to weigh on the countries' otherwise warm
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi said Friday that the
exchange meant that ''for the first time ever, works of art that
were illegally taken away from Russia, are being given back,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   However, talks have not resolved ownership disputes for most of
the more than 1 million cultural valuables Germany claims Soviets
troops took -- paintings, rare books, coins and other items such as
church windows. Russia in turn raises the issue of compensation for
an estimated several hundred thousand items destroyed or lost
during Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides pillaged, but since Germany lost it was forced to
surrender its loot to the victors.
</P>
<P>
   Long only rumored to exist, the Soviet Union's vast cache of
looted masterpieces was confirmed by Russia only in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The artworks lay for decades in secret repositories at Soviet
museums while the government denied any knowledge of them.
</P>
<P>
   The works include pieces by Van Gogh, Degas, Renoir, El Greco,
Goya, Manet, Daumier, Veronese, Tintoretto, Cranach and more.
Complicating ownership claims, some items were looted twice, first
by the Nazis from occupied countries and then by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most controversial items is the Trojan gold excavated
in Turkey in 1873 by German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who
believed that it once belonged to the king of the ancient city of
Troy. The items are on display at Moscow's Pushkin museum.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian law bans repatriating looted art in most cases as
Russians see the treasures as compensation for lost and destroyed
cultural treasures. The Amber Room tops Russia's list of
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The room's walls were plated in 1,300 square feet of resplendent
amber mosaics, placed by mirrors and windows to glow a rich
golden-brown color. The room was a gift to Peter the Great from
Frederick William I of Prussia in 1716.
</P>
<P>
   Retreating Nazi troops hastily stripped the chamber in 1945 and
only fragments have been found.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Germany will formally hand over a mosaic called
''Sense of Smell and Touch'' depicting a scene of women frolicking
by a pool. The mosaic, along with a delicately-inlayed chest
formerly used by Russia's czars that will also be returned, were
discovered in private collections in 1997 in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Cultural Minister Michael Naumann was to present the
items to Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Amber Room's
original location in the Catherine Palace outside St. Petersburg on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bremen's Kunsthalle museum in turn received drawings and
watercolors by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Francisco Goya and dozens of
German artists.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead in Suburban Pa. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKEES ROCKS,PA. (AP) -- Three people were killed and at least
one wounded Friday in shootings at two suburban Pittsburgh shopping
centers and in two nearby communities. A suspect was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were shot to death at a Chinese restaurant at the
Plaza at Robinson Town Centre in McKees Rocks. A third person was
shot and killed at a martial arts school in a Monaca shopping plaza
about 18 miles northwest of McKees Rocks, said a Beaver County
dispatcher who would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Township police in nearby Carnegie said a third person was
wounded at an undisclosed location there. Gunfire was also reported
in Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Vinh Truong, a cook at the Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine restaurant in
McKees Rocks, said his brother-in-law was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Truong was in the kitchen when an employee ran from the front of
the restaurant, telling everyone to escape. Instead, he left the
kitchen and saw his brother-in-law on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see my brother Tony on the floor,'' said Truong, who did not
give the man's full name. ''I tell everybody 'Somebody shot
Tony.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Beaver County dispatcher said a suspect was arrested in
Ambridge, about 6 miles southeast of Monaca and 16 miles northwest
of Pittsburgh. No further details of the shootings or arrest were
immediately available.

a 25-year-old man injured in Carnegie was in critical condition,

<HEADLINE> Two Cigarette Cos. To Change Ads  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two companies that make unconventional
cigarettes -- one marketing an all-natural brand and the other
selling an herbal blend -- would stop advertising their products as
safe alternatives to regular cigarettes under settlements proposed
Friday by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission lodged separate complaints against
Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc. of Santa Fe, N.M., and
Alternative Cigarettes Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y., alleging that their
advertisements are deceptive because they imply that their products
are safer to smoke than other cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''These cigarettes are marketed with a 'natural' aura, but
they're neither healthy nor safe,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director
of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. ''The fact is, there's
no such thing as a safe smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   From now on, when the companies make a ''no additives'' claim,
they also must print on the package, ''No additives in our tobacco
does NOT mean a safer cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies also agreed to disclose on packages of herbal
cigarettes that ''Herbal cigarettes are dangerous to your health.
They produce tar and carbon monoxide.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlements don't constitute an admission by the companies
that any laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Sommers, president and chief executive officer of Santa Fe
Natural, said in a written statement that the company voluntarily
began placing a disclosure statement on its packages as early as
1997 but agreed to the changes requested by the FTC for the sake of
uniformity on industry warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not agree that any of our past additive-free statements
were deceptive or misleading in any way,'' Sommers said. ''We
believed at the time, and we continue to believe, that these
statements are the most accurate, truthful tobacco disclosure
statements in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alternative did not return a telephone message
left with a receptionist at the company's New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe markets ''Natural American Spirit'' tobacco cigarettes
and tobacco-free herbal cigarettes. Alternative Cigarettes sells
''Pure'' and ''Gold'' tobacco cigarettes, as well as ''Herbal
Gold'' and ''Magic'' herbal cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleged that Alternative Cigarettes tried to
portray their product as safer than others with the claim that
''Native Americans smoked all-natural tobacco without the ills that
are associated with smoking today.'' The FTC also said that even
herbal cigarettes contain carcinogens and toxins, including tar and
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlements, the companies also would be required to
notify distributors and retailers that they should stop using
existing ads and any promotional materials that make the disputed
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements will be subject to public comment until May 30,
when the commission will decide whether to make the decisions
final. The settlements don't carry a fine but any future violations
could carry a civil penalty of $11,000 for each breach.

<HEADLINE> Englewood couple sues to tear down mansion, build some affordablehousing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -- John and Laura Blackman live in a
turn-of-the-century, Mediterranean-style mansion with 11 bathrooms
and five fireplaces. And they're suing the city so they can tear it
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackmans, who have been trying to sell the mansion for a
year at a $5.2 million asking price, now want to convert the
4.7-acre estate into luxury town houses, with about 12 priced as
affordable housing, their lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawsuit alleges that the city doesn't have enough
affordable housing to go around, a claim dismissed by officials as
an attempt to blackmail it into letting the couple divide their
land.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears as if this is an attempt at increasing the sales
price of their property,'' Englewood City Attorney William Rupp
told The Record of Hackensack in Friday's editions. ''There is no
intent here to philosophically provide low- and moderate-income
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blackmans have not filed an application to the city Planning
Board or Board of Adjustment yet for a development, but their
attorney, David Watkins, says the pair want to build 48 town
houses, each valued at $750,000 to $1 million. Twelve of the homes
would be sold for an average price of $89,920.
</P>
<P>
   If that plan fails, the Blackmans want to build 120 apartments,
with 18 at affordable prices, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said the couple turned to the courts last year to avoid
local boards that often put up roadblocks to such developments, and
to increase the value of their property.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're entitled to it based upon the fact that Englewood
never complied with the Fair Housing Act,'' Watkins said. ''It
forces the city of Englewood to come into the requirements of the
20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blackmans are entitled to sue over a shortage of fair
housing based on the Mount Laurel guidelines set by New Jersey
Supreme Court decisions in 1975 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings require every municipality in the state to provide a
fair share of low and moderately priced homes, and allows residents
to sue municipalities that don't offer their required share of
units.
</P>
<P>
   Englewood should have 223 low- or moderate-income homes,
according to the guidelines, and all the homes must have been built
since 1980. Englewood has 1,365 affordable housing units, 261 of
which have been built in the past decade, City Manager Robert
Benecke said. The city received an award last year from the U.S.
Housing and Urban Development agency for its efforts to provide
fair housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents aren't happy about the Blackmans' plans, saying a
zoning change would ruin the neighborhood's character.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a case of extreme greed,'' said Eugenia Vogel,
co-president of the Englewood Homeowners Association. ''They want
to make a bundle of money by destroying our zoning laws. If this
subdivision is granted or any other subdivision is granted, anybody
who has an acre will build town houses.''

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, McCain Trade Angry Words  </HEADLINE>
By DENIS GRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- John McCain, on a journey meant
to heal old wounds, said Friday the wrong side won the Vietnam War,
adding to earlier comments that accused the communists of torturing
POWs.
</P>
<P>
   Irritated by McCain's remarks about torture, Hanoi accused the
United States of ''horrendous crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is in Vietnam to mark the 25th anniversary of the war's
end and to help boost U.S. ties with its former enemy. But that has
not kept the former Navy pilot from sharply criticizing the
communist government's conduct in the war, during which he was shot
down and spent 5{ years in a Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese government responded angrily to earlier comments
in which the Arizona senator said he did not forgive his former
captors for torturing and killing fellow prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi dismissed the allegations as untrue, accusing the United
States of bringing the war upon the Vietnamese and committing
''horrendous crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It runs counter to the norms of morality that those people who
brought bombs and shells to sow death among our people and wreak
havoc with a country now pass themselves off as having the right to
criticize their victims-cum-saviors,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Phan Thuy Thanh said in a statement made available Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain shrugged off the government statement and criticized the
oppression he said followed the communists' victory in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He said Friday that he thought ''the wrong guys'' won the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that they lost millions of their best people who left
by boat, thousands by execution and hundreds of thousands who went
to re-education camps,'' McCain told reporters, as he toured Ho Chi
Minh City, known as Saigon when it was the capital of U.S.-backed
South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized what he said was increasing corruption in the
country and an unwillingness on the part of some officials to
improve U.S.-Vietnamese ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The object of my relationship with Vietnam has been to heal
the wounds that exist, particularly among our veterans, and to move
forward with a positive relationship,'' the Republican senator
said. ''Apparently some in the Vietnamese government don't want to
do that and that's their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a difference in the attitude here of the government
toward foreign investment, toward a trade agreement. I see the
hammer and sickle out here on the banners,'' he said. ''I'm a bit
concerned about both the policies and attitudes, and the increase
in corruption in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later if he stood by his allegations of torture, he said:
''The facts are facts. Truth is truth. History is history. I always
tell the truth. I've fought against communism all my life.'' He
added that he was not concerned about Vietnam's response.
</P>
<P>
   McCain revisited the notorious ''Hanoi Hilton'' prison in Hanoi
on Wednesday. He was held captive there after his A-4 plane was
shot down Oct. 26, 1967, while on a bombing run on the North
Vietnamese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the prison's guards, McCain said: ''I
still bear them ill will, not because of what they did to me, but
because of what they did to some of my friends -- including killing
some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanh, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said McCain contradicted
statements he made during his first visit to the Hanoi Hilton in
1994 when McCain expressed thanks to Vietnam for the treatment he
received as a captive.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain claimed his statements were no different than
those he has made on seven previous trips to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   As Vietnam prepares to celebrate the anniversary of the
communist victory Sunday, Vietnamese officials also say the bitter
past should be laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the Foreign Ministry statement recalled that the United
States initiated a war in which almost 3 million people died and
more than 4 million were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people were the victims of its (American) brutal war of
aggression. The Vietnamese nation's losses and suffering are
wordless,'' Thanh said.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by wife Cindy and 13-year-old son Jack, McCain went
shopping Friday for a traditional Vietnamese tonic -- rice liquor
with a snake in the bottle -- and visited the Harvard Institute for
International Development in Ho Chi Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Head of France's Central Bank Probed  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The head of the France's central bank is being
investigated in connection with the travails of Credit Lyonnais, a
bank that lost billions before undergoing a costly government
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Trichet, who has been expected to succeed Wim
Duisenberg as chief of the European Central Bank in 2002, is
suspected of disseminating false information to financial markets,
judicial sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Trichet served as director of the French Treasury from 1987 to
1993, covering the critical 1992-93 period of bank records being
examined. Trichet was appointed governor of the Bank of France in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Trichet said he was ''profoundly
surprised'' by the turn of events and that he would place himself
at the ''total disposition'' of the investigating judge. ''I have
total confidence in the justice of our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jean-Pierre Zanoto was expected to summon Trichet for
questioning. Zanoto is in charge of the investigation, which opened
in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' chairman from 1988 to 1993,
was placed under investigation two years ago for presenting false
financial records and information. Francois Gille, the bank's
director-general, is under investigation for presenting false
company accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The bank lent money to several companies that went bankrupt,
racking up billions of francs in debt and forcing a costly
government bailout, approved last year, that cost French taxpayers
nearly $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lyonnais' reputation was so tarnished that the European
Union Commission agreed to aid only on condition that the bank sell
off a series of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Trichet defended his actions while treasury
director at the bank, saying it was the treasury's careful
investigation that led to the restructuring of the then-state-owned
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''More than seven years ago, (the treasury) did all within the
limits of its responsibility to ensure that the bank changed
course,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank, privatized last year, is now profitable.

<HEADLINE> AP Photographer Held for 3d Night  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Associated Press photographer Obed Zilwa
was detained for a third straight night Friday, even though his
lawyer said police admitted they had no evidence to link him to any
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police had earlier said Zilwa was being held in connection with
the bombing of Zimbabwe's only independent daily. Zilwa has
repeatedly protested his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   International press organizations on Friday demanded Zilwa's
immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigating officer had recommended earlier Friday
that Zilwa be released for lack of evidence, said Zilwa's attorney,
Jonathan Samkange.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Assistant Commissioner Emmanuel Chimwanda said he agreed
with the recommendation and would seek the authority to free Zilwa,
Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning from a meeting with his superiors, Chimwanda said
Zilwa would continue to be detained, and police investigators and
officials would meet in the morning to decide whether to charge him
in court Saturday or to release him, Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   Chimwanda acknowledged that the continued detention was illegal
because Zilwa had been neither charged nor released within 48 hours
of his arrest, Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been different if they said, 'Your guy has
committed an offense, and we've got evidence against him,''
Samkange said. ''Now they've said, 'We don't have evidence against
him. He's innocent, but we don't have the power to release him.''
</P>
<P>
   Samkange said it was now up to South Africa's ambassador to push
for Zilwa's release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a political decision now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Embassy said the its government was protesting
the illegal detention at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
journalists, as anyone, should be given due process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We obviously believe that reporters and photographers should
be allowed to do their job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Zilwa on Wednesday as he waited in the Harare
airport for his flight back to South Africa. He had been covering
the political violence in Zimbabwe for the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Zilwa, a South African citizen based in Cape
Town, matched a witness description of a person involved in a bomb
attack on The Daily News. No one was injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Zilwa was refusing to eat and sleep, Samkange said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am innocent, the police have told me I'm innocent, and I
should not be here at all,'' Samkange said Zilwa told him.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 South African journalists staged a protest outside the
Zimbabwe consulate in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon, demanding
his immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Foreign Correspondent's Association and the
South African-based Freedom of Expression Institute have also
demanded Zilwa's release.
</P>
<P>
   Yves Sorokobi, Africa program coordinator for the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists, said that if Zilwa is not
released by Monday, the organization would work for his release.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Prize winning author Nadine Gordimer issued a statement
calling the charges against Zilwa ''preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Cape chapter of the ruling African National Congress
said Zilwa's arrest ''boggles the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We know Obed as a dedicated and fearless journalist of
absolute integrity. His commitment to democracy and investigative
journalism are beyond question,'' wrote ANC provincial leader
Ebrahim Rasool. ''I cannot even begin to seriously consider his
involvement in the bombing of a newspaper's offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the foreign press has increased in Zimbabwe recent
days. Last week, state-run television ran a story accusing the
international press corps of biased and alarmist reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the bombing, police said they were
suspicious that foreign journalists arrived at the scene so
quickly. Many of the journalists were staying at the nearby Meikles
Hotel.

<HEADLINE> 'Nightly News' Rebroadcast on Hold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC said Friday that it has put on hold its
plans, announced only last week, to rebroadcast its ''Nightly
News'' program on the Pax television network each weeknight.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliates were upset about the idea, worrying that if
viewers could see the Tom Brokaw news report on another network an
hour later, many wouldn't watch it on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC purchased a 32 percent stake in the family-friendly Pax
network last year and has started trying to get the two networks to
work together. Pax stations wanted to run an hour-long news block
at 7 p.m. each night that featured the Brokaw broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The rebroadcast was to begin next month on a test basis, then
start permanently in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   A delay in the rebroadcast would give NBC affiliates time to
work on joint sales agreements with Pax stations, NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will enable potential future programming ideas to be seen
as opportunities and not threats,'' said Alan Frank, president of
the NBC affiliate board.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Child Care, Less Crimes  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children who attend quality day care are less
likely to commit crimes later in life, according to a report by law
enforcement groups unveiled Friday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued by Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a
700-member bipartisan coalition of police chiefs, sheriffs and
crime victims. Former police chiefs William Bratton of New York
City and Jerry Sanders of San Diego were among the authors.
</P>
<P>
   The report, a compilation of studies comparing children in and
out of day care programs in North Carolina and Chicago, found that
youths who spent their early years in quality child care were half
as likely to be arrested later. It involved 1,000 children who were
in day care at ages 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for increased government spending on day care
to ensure poor families have access, and better training and higher
salaries for child care workers, who on average are paid only about
half as much as parking lot attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Child care is not only a lifesaver for working families, it is
a crime-fighting strategy for our communities,'' first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton said at a ceremony announcing the study. ''For every
dollar we invest in child care we save $5 in crime costs down the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made child care a key issue in her U.S. Senate
bid in New York, was joined at the White House by Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., and Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. They are pushing for
an additional $3 billion to create slots for another 950,000
children in Head Start and for block grants to expand early
education and child care for children under 5.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also is pushing a plan to provide tax breaks for
parents and employers that offer day care for workers' children.
</P>
<P>
   One of the report's authors, Dr. T. Berry Brazelton of Harvard
University, said the ''scientific research now proves the early
childhood development programs that help kids in so many other ways
are also our most powerful weapons in the fight against youth
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls released with the report found parents and police
overwhelmingly support child care and after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   There was less agreement on whether children should be charged
as adults, kept in prisons or subjected to other increasingly
punitive measures. The polls found 17 percent of police chiefs
favor charging more juveniles as adults, compared with 12 percent
of the public.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Tape Soundtrack Removed  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The pop music soundtrack accompanying newly
released videotapes of the Columbine massacre's aftermath will be
removed in new copies of the tapes, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Artists whose melancholy music was used to accompany footage of
the blood-soaked Columbine library threatened legal action if the
songs were not removed. The tapes were given to victims' families
on a judge's order and sold to the public for $25 this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Videotapes with the soundtrack included were released because
I did not want to tamper with the court order in any way,'' said
Jefferson County Attorney Frank Hutfless, who was widely criticized
for making the tapes available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 copies of the videotape with the soundtrack were
sold Wednesday and Thursday. Hutfless encouraged anyone who had
those copies of the tapes to exchange them for soundless versions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that we would have a very strong case if we were forced
to go to court to defend alleged copyright violations. However, to
avoid any additional legal wrangling, we will remove the
soundtracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly three-hour tape combines footage shot by a Littleton
firefighter inside the school with TV news footage taken outside.
The songs -- by Sarah McLachlan and Cheryl Wheeler and a remembrance
by two Columbine students -- were added when the tape was produced
by a Littleton Fire Department employee as a training video.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan's U.S. record label, Arista, said the videotapes were
a clear copyright infringement because neither the singer nor
Arista had granted permission to use her song ''I Will Remember
You.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan said adding music to the images at Columbine was
''sick.'' But her manager, Terry McBride, said a recall of the
videotapes probably wouldn't be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very much doubt that anyone is going to give them back,''
McBride said. ''We didn't see any malice in this situation. Someone
made an error and they are correcting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the tape was ''Friend of Mine (Columbine),'' written by
brothers Stephen and Jonathan Cohen, who survived the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were completely blindsided by this,'' said Jason Hickman,
who produced the song. The Cohens ''were appalled. Their mother was
totally distraught.''
</P>
<P>
   A publicist with Wheeler's current record company, Rounder
Records, said the artist was not as concerned with the copyright
infringement question as she was in trying to stop the
dissemination of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wanted to help get the tape stopped from being sold,''
said publicist Kerry Murphy. ''I'm sure she's pretty
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were given Tuesday to victims' families who told a
judge they needed them for civil lawsuits against the sheriff's
office. Several families have filed suit over officers' handling of
the April 20, 1999, attack, in which two students killed 12
schoolmates and a teacher before killing themselves.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers Education Plan  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Campaigning on George W. Bush's home turf,
Democrat Al Gore called Friday for withholding federal education
money from states that fail to improve student test scores and
redirecting the money to help some of the worst schools.
</P>
<P>
   The plan echoes one by the Texas governor, who has made
accountability the centerpiece of his education plan. But Bush, the
presumptive GOP presidential nominee, would redirect federal money
to vouchers that could be used to attend private schools --
something Gore opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to invest more and demand more -- not aim too low,
invest too little and drain resources away from public schools with
private school vouchers,'' Gore said in a speech to the National
Conference of Black Mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore also would give bonuses to states that
improve test scores and reduce dropout rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I propose a plan with clear financial incentives for states
and school districts that successfully narrow the achievement gap --
and there will be clear financial consequences for those that
don't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With education at the top of voter concerns, Bush and Gore are
both campaigning hard on their plans for schools.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Gore has been touting an ambitious, $115
billion, 10-year plan to hire more teachers, triple the number of
charter schools, provide universal preschool and help build new
schools.
</P>
<P>
   That included a provision to identify and help fix failing
schools, but Friday's announcement offered considerably more detail
and suggested, for the first time, that federal education funding
should be tied to student performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp said Gore was taking a page from its plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to question a convert on the day of his
conversion, but we're glad Al Gore now agrees with Governor Bush's
proposal to hold schools accountable for results,'' said spokesman
Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Gore plan, states that fail to improve test scores
would lose administrative money used to implement federal education
programs. That includes Title 1, an $8.6 billion program that helps
11 million poor students.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would redirect the money into a fund that failing schools
could tap to introduce new reforms as they work to turn themselves
around.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has campaigned on a host of traditionally Democratic
issues, has proposed a $13.5 billion, five-year education plan, far
more modest than Gore's proposal. Bush argues that the core of his
philosophy is accountability -- holding schools responsible for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan includes harsher financial consequences for failing
schools. He would pull Title 1 money from individual schools that
fail to improve, giving the money over to parents in $1,500
vouchers that could be used for students to attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan outlined Friday, he would require states to
set standards and identify failing schools. If the schools do not
improve within two years, they would be closed then reopened under
new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   To help schools turn around, Gore offers $500 million per year
to pay for reform plans. He would also direct after-school money to
students at these schools and give the schools first crack at other
education funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan, beyond vouchers, breaks from other Republicans as
he calls for more, not less, federal spending -- though far less
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would give families tax breaks to save for college,
vouchers to pay for after-school programs and rewards to schools
that improve test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Gore regularly criticizes these plans, saying there will be no
money to pay for them if he goes through with his proposed, $483
billion tax cut. ''He's already spent all the money,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush cites rising test scores in Texas, Gore said his
rival's state has below-average preschool enrollment and doesn't
have enough teachers to meet upcoming needs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's accountability plan also would:
</P>
<P>
   --Pay signing bonuses to attract new principals and teachers to
schools that are shut down and need to be reopened with new
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   --Measure progress based on the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, which many states already use.
</P>
<P>
   --Offer competitive grants for schools to enforce discipline and
anti-gun policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has proposed tying federal dollars to
school performance, and in 1994 Congress linked funding to
improvements in educating poor kids. So far, no states have had
money withheld.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Black Mayors also invited Bush to
address the gathering but he declined, said Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk,
a Democrat. Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor had a
previously scheduled commitment.

<HEADLINE> Safety Agency Upgrades GM Probe  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety agency has upgraded its
investigation into some General Motors Corp. cars because of
possible ignition problems that could start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a monthly
report released Friday, said investigators will examine the
ignition on the Pontiac Grand Am, Buick Skylark and Oldsmobile
Achieva from model years 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 83 complaints about the problem, including three
injuries. Some drivers say when they turn the ignition, the car
will not start and then a fire ignites in the steering column.
</P>
<P>
   There are 699,617 of the vehicles on the road, the safety agency
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also upgraded its investigation into reported braking
problems on the 1995 model year GMC Jimmy, Chevrolet Blazer and
Chevy Suburban sport utility vehicles, Chevy Astro vans and Chevy
S10 and C/K pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have complained that the exhaust gas recirculation
valve sticks open, resulting in loss of brake power and extended
stopping. The agency estimates there have been 32 crashes and 105
complaints -- but no injuries -- related to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A GM spokesman said the company is cooperating in the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA opens any safety investigation with a preliminary inquiry
in which the government and manufacturer exchange paperwork,
including any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation then could be upgraded to an engineering
analysis, during which engineers study parts to see if they are
defective. An investigation eventually can lead to a recall.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also is upgrading these investigations:
</P>
<P>
   --1997-2000 Chevrolet Corvette; 127 complaints that seat belts
won't retract, making them unusable. There are about 85,880 of the
cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
   --1997-1999 Chevrolet Malibu; 42 complaints of overheating of the
stop and tail lights that may cause an outage. There are 520,777 of
the cars of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also opened a preliminary investigation into Bell
Helmets USA's Star 1 model after a fatal motorcycle accident in
which the rider's helmet came off. An inspection showed the chin
strap had separated from the helmet shell.

<HEADLINE> Aetna CEO Willing To Listen to Bids  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s new chairman told
disgruntled shareholders Friday that the nation's largest health
insurer is not for sale. But mindful of dissatisfaction with the
performance of Aetna stock, William H. Donaldson said he would
consider any meaningful offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is a legitimate and compelling proposal brought to
our attention, we will take a look at it,'' Donaldson told about
1,000 shareholders at the company's annual meeting held at its
Hartford, Conn., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than putting itself on the market, Aetna is speeding to
carry out plans announced in March to split into two publicly
traded companies: One for health care, the other for financial
services. The breakup is expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Aetna rejected a $70-per-share, or $10 billion,
takeover offer from Wellpoint Health Networks and ING Group, saying
it was inadequate. That move perturbed some big shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna fell $2.06\, or by 3.4 percent, to close at
$57.87{ Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline Friday
came as most of the health maintenance sector was retreating
following an announcement from HMO Sierra Health Services that it
would have lower-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, said
David Shove, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's stock has been stagnant since 1995, the year before it
bought fast-growing health maintenance organization U.S.
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Several shareholder activists told Donaldson on Friday that they
agreed with Aetna's decision to split into two companies, but
stressed the company needs to move quicker to increase the value of
their stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need some surgery here,'' said Evelyn Davis, a shareholder
activist from Washington, D.C., who was dressed in surgery scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Lens, an Aetna shareholder and former employee, said
Aetna put too much faith in U.S. Healthcare to improve its health
insurance business. ''The assumption was U.S. Healthcare had all
the knowledge,'' he said. ''We've all seen the wisdom of that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, a Wall Street veteran who has been on Aetna's board
for two decades and took over as chairman in February, said Aetna
will be operating as two separate companies by July. But he
cautioned it will take longer to get all the regulatory approvals
for the change.
</P>
<P>
   He said working as two companies will ''unleash the
entrepreneurial energies'' of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to build on its online efforts, Aetna said it has
signed an agreement to partner with Harvard Medical School to
provide information for its consumer health Internet site (http:
www.intelihealth.com). Harvard replaces Johns Hopkins University on
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's stock has been under severe pressure since last fall,
when the company became one of the targets of several class-action
suits filed by the same trial attorneys who won big settlements
from the tobacco companies. Among other things, Aetna was accused
of withholding information from its HMO members that it provided
financial incentives to doctors to influence their treatment
decisions. The company has said information is provided members
through such channels as member handbooks and Internet postings.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also had more difficulty than expected in
turning around the money-losing Prudential health care business
which it bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has also been waging a public relations battle to maintain
its image as consumer-oriented company. Medical providers argue
that the company skimps on care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret that we have disappointed shareholders,
customers, providers and employees,'' Donaldson told shareholders.
But he said his strategy will restore confidence in Aetna and
increase profits.

   Aetna plans to generate $500 million to $1.5 billion for the
sale of some of its international operations. It also said it will
save up to $150 million this year by cutting costs, including
reducing employee travel and cutting the workforce through
attrition.

<P>
   Davis, the shareholder activist who holds court at many
stockholder meetings, said Aetna could go further to reduce
expenses. When Donaldson said the company has 80 in-house
attorneys, she quipped: ''Why not just have eight good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna officials have remained silent on how they will change its
Aetna U.S. Healthcare business, which has been criticized for
restricting patient access to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson suggested Aetna was looking at developing plans that
would give consumers more freedom to choose doctors and reduce
restrictions on health providers. ''We want to lead not only in
size and scope, but in quality of operations.''

<HEADLINE> Backlash Casts Pall on Biotech Spuds  </HEADLINE>
By BOB FICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- One of the nation's largest potato
processors is turning away from genetically altered spuds, saying
its fast-food customers don't want them in their fryers.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's J.R. Simplot Co. told its growers in Idaho and North
Dakota that, while it believes biotechnology is important for
agriculture and providing affordable food, it has to respect the
preferences of the fast-food chains it serves.
</P>
<P>
   Its largest customer is McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about a highly visible retail product in french
fries and therefore pressure from extreme environmental groups and
anti-technology groups managed to raise this to a level where there
appeared to be consumer reluctance,'' said Simplot spokesman Fred
Zerza.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker wouldn't confirm the report,
saying the company doesn't publicly discuss purchasing for
competitive reasons. But he said the report, if true, suggests
''tiny numbers dwindling even more'' in terms of McDonald's use of
genetically modified potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 4 percent of the potatoes used in McDonald's North
American restaurants come from genetically altered seed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If producers are going to be out of it (genetically modified
foods), then we'll be out of it too,'' Riker said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, about 4 percent of the nation's potato acreage was
planted with genetically altered potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Potato breeder Steve Love, who helped Monsanto Co. develop its
NewLeaf beetle-repelling potato five years ago, called Simplot's
move senseless but not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem we're seeing with acceptance is that we have never
really given the public anything that they can measure and say ...
'Is it worth me taking something I don't know anything about,'''
Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically altered potatos can improve crop growth while
reducing the need for chemicals. But, like genetically altered
soybeans and corn, thought to be the future of agriculture when
they hit the market in the 1990s, they have faced increasing
concern from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans were the first to balk at buying biotech grain, which
they dubbed ''Frankenfoods,'' and resistance has grown in Asia. The
critics argue genetically engineered crops have not been proven
safe.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto spokesman Bryan Hurley said the consumer backlash
spilling over from Europe should have no material effect on the
company since NewLeaf was such a small part of its business and the
markets are strong for biotech corn, soybeans and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect has been significant on the Boise operations of
Naturemark, Monsanto's NewLeaf marketing arm, where staff has been
dramatically reduced as farmers turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is too far removed now from food production, so new
technologies are poorly understood and that's the problem,''
Naturemark spokesman Jan de Weerd said.
</P>
<P>
   By planting the genetically altered seeds, potato growers can
avoid some chemical spraying and save about $140 of their $1,500
per-acre production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We constantly hear from EPA and the environmental community
that we use too much pesticide. Here's a tool comes along that
reduces that, and they don't like that either,'' said Potato
Growers of Idaho spokesman John Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year looks like a big year for aphids and beetles so
you'd do well growing Naturemark, but very few growers will,''
Thompson said. ''There's no market.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're heading back to the stone age,'' said farmer Clen
Atchley, who planted genetically altered potatoes on a fraction of
his 1,000 acres last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Atchley said, he probably won't plant any.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Agriculture Department released a survey last month
showing U.S. use of genetically altered seeds is expected to drop
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, genetically altered corn production was
projected to drop from 25 percent last year to 19 percent in 2000;
biotech cotton from 55 percent to 48 percent; and biotech soybeans
from 57 percent to 52 percent.

   U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department, seeking a remedy last
used to dismember AT&AMP;T, asked a court today to split Microsoft into
two competing companies to shatter its monopoly over the system
that runs most personal computers. The government, joined by 19
states, asked that the giant software company be split into one
company to produce the Windows operating system and another to
handle other software applications, like spreadsheets and
databases. The government wants the companies to be barred from
reuniting for 10 years. The proposal was submitted to U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson after the close of financial markets
today. Jackson ruled April 3 that Microsoft repeatedly broke
federal antitrust laws intended to maintain fair competition by
using its monopoly power in computer operating systems to crush
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Gates Defends His Company
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft chairman Bill Gates had said before
today's filing that consumers will suffer if Microsoft is split up.
''We wouldn't have Windows today if it hadn't been for the Office
group and the Windows group working together,'' he said. Microsoft
spokesman Jim Cullinan said the recommendation to split the company
is ''like like telling McDonald's that it can only sell burgers,
not fries, and that it has to give away the recipe for its secret
sauce. We are confident that the appeals court will support
Microsoft's position,'' he added. Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal, whose state was among 19 and the District of
Columbia to join in the suit, said, ''The most important thing is,
this is a very measured but responsible remedy.'' The judge is now
in the hands of the judge. Microsoft stock was down 1/16 at 69}
today.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' incomes, spending and savings were
all up in March, the Commerce Department said today. Personal
income -- wages, interest and government benefits -- rose 0.7
percent, a bit more than expected. Spending was up 0.5 percent. And
the savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income --
rose to 0.4 percent from a record low of 0.2 percent the month
before. March was the first month since last October that income
had grown faster than spending.

   Buffett To Take Blame at Meeting
</P>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett will be able to
tell shareholders in person this weekend what he already has said
in print -- his company had its worst year ever and he blames
himself for the performance. This weekend's annual meeting is
expected to attract 12,000 investors and followers of Buffett, one
of the world's richest men, who has made the yearly gatherings a
circus-like event. Berkshire's earnings dropped 42 percent in 1999,
to $1.6 billion from $2.8 billion the year before. Berkshire's
stock, the most expensive on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 20
percent last year. At the same time, the stock market soared.
Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock was up $500 at $59,900 a share
this afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, but almost 24
percent below the 52-week high of $78,600.

   Aetna CEO Willing To Listen to Bids
</P>

   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s new chairman told
disgruntled shareholders today that the nation's largest health
insurer is not for sale. But mindful of dissatisfaction with the
performance of Aetna stock, William H. Donaldson said he would
consider any meaningful offers. Rather than putting itself on the
market, Aetna is speeding to carry out plans announced in March to
split into two publicly traded companies: One for health care, the
other for financial services. The breakup is expected this summer.
Last month, Aetna rejected a $70-per-share, or $10 billion,
takeover offer from Wellpoint Health Networks and ING Group, saying
it was inadequate. That move perturbed some big shareholders.

   Credit Lyonnais Probe Adds Trichet

   PARIS (AP) -- The head of the Bank of France is being
investigated in connection with the travails of Credit Lyonnais, a
bank that lost billions before undergoing a costly government
bailout. Jean-Claude Trichet, who has been expected to succeed Wim
Duisenberg as head of the European Central Bank in 2002, is
suspected of disseminating false information to financial markets,
judicial sources said on condition of anonymity. Trichet served as
director of the French Treasury from 1987 to 1993, covering the
critical 1992-93 period of bank records being examined. Trichet
said he was ''profoundly surprised'' by the turn of events and that
he would place himself at the ''total disposition'' of the
investigating judge.

   Top Managers Leave Soros' Fund Co.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The top two managers at Soros Fund Management, a
$14 billion hedge fund company, are leaving in the wake of
double-digit declining performance this year. The departures of
Stan Druckenmiller, portfolio manager of the Quantum Fund, and Nick
Roditi, 54, portfolio manager of the Quota Fund, puts the future of
Soros' hedge fund empire up in the air. George Soros, 69, a
renowned investor and philanthropist, said today in a letter to
investors that he will convert the Quantum Fund to a ''lower
risk/lower reward operation'' and rename it the Quantum Endowment
Fund. He did not name a successor to Druckenmiller. The Quantum
Fund, which has assets of $8.24 billion, is down 22 percent this
year. The Quota Fund, which has $1.27 billion in assets, is down 32
percent this year. Soros said he plans to transfer the management
of the assets to another outside advisor.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Viking Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed five Nordic leaders
Friday to mark a new exhibit on Vikings and to declare that
Americans should learn more about ''this fascinating early
chapter'' of history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, hosted a
luncheon to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of the Vikings'
arrival in North America and the opening Saturday of a Smithsonian
Institution exhibit, ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is amazing to me to look at the Viking ships and imagine
that they made it all this way 1,000 years ago,'' Clinton said.
''You have clearly decided to make this a tradition, and you're
welcome back in the year 3000.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked he couldn't exactly say the Vikings discovered
this land, because Americans disagree over who actually did that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Italian-Americans revere Columbus. ... Anglo-Americans argue
for the primacy of Jamestown and Plymouth as the first colonies,''
Clinton said. ''Franco-Americans remind us to honor Champlain,
Cartier and La Salle along side all others. And of course, our
Native Americans consider all these people insignificant
latecomers.''
</P>
<P>
   King Harald V of Norway said 10 million Americans claim Nordic
roots ''and combine this with a deep felt and unswerving loyalty''
toward the United States. In turn, he said, Nordic nations are
looking to the United States for lessons in coping with diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nordic countries are becoming multicultural societies,
with the opportunities and challenges this presents,'' Harald said.
''The United States has always made it possible for its citizens to
cherish their ethnic groups and celebrate their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100 guests attended the luncheon, including Queen Sonja of
Norway; President Olaf Ragnar Grimsson of Iceland; President Tarja
Halonen of Finland, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Prince
Joachim of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million Smithsonian exhibit, at the National Museum of
Natural History, features a variety of artifacts and traces the
lives, travels, jewelry, religion, clothing, poetry and impact of
the Norse.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all the challenges and superstitions men and women faced
1,000 years ago, they still had the daring and enterprise to look
beyond the horizon,'' Clinton said. ''All Americans should know
more about this fascinating early chapter of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Vikings' legend can be seen in places like
Delaware's New Sweden, Oslo, Minn., or Denmark, Iowa. He noted that
the spacecraft Viking I and Viking II made the first expedition to
Mars in 1976, drawing ''Hmms'' of approval from his guests.

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Low Versus Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped to another record low against
the dollar Friday as the U.S. currency staged a strong advance
against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 90.30 cents in midday trading in London,
below its previous all-time low of 90.59 cents reached at midday
Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the single curency of 11 European nations recovered a bit to
finish at 90.92 cents in late dealings in New York, down from 91.01
cents in late dealings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar gained nearly 2 yen against the Japanese yen, rising
to 108.18 Japanese yen from 106.36 yen late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. currency also rose to 1.4810 Canadian dollars from
1.4766 late Thursday but it fell to 1.7228 Swiss francs from
1.7272. The British pound fell to $1.5526 from $1.5753.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, launched in January 1999, sank to new lows on three of
the five trading days this week. Analysts say investors doubt that
European authorities can rally around a strategy that would
stimulate growth and make Europe a more attractive place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank's quarter percentage point increase in
interest rates on Thursday failed to spark enthusiasm for the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar's most striking move Friday was its advance
against the Japanese yen, which has also been trading near record
highs against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anderson, financial economist for Fleet Bank in Boston,
said some the yen buying was by professionals in advance of a
series of Golden Week national holidays that will close the
financial markets in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He said traders feel Japanese authorities ''are more bothered by
the euro's weakness than the U.S. is'' and would like to see the
euro strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   A strong yen versus the euro makes Japanese products more
expensive in Europe, dampening the Japanese export market.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1514 German
marks, up from 2.1476; 7.2155 French francs, up from 7.2028; and
2,129.88 Italian lire, up from 2,126.02.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denies Wrongs in Legal Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A conservative group said Friday that
President Clinton admits in sealed papers that he made misleading
statements in the Monica Lewinsky scandal while denying committing
perjury or obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation,
said Clinton also argues in the 85-page document that his position
as president should weigh in favor of his keeping his license to
practice law in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arguments to an Arkansas Supreme Court committee is in
response to a complaint by the Atlanta-based foundation seeking to
disbar Clinton for his 1998 testimony denying that he'd had a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intention of putting'' Clinton's filing on the
public record,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of Clinton's filing will come out when the
foundation submits its rebuttal May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin called the president's arguments ''a pathetic attempt to
defend the indefensible. He denies everything, which is exactly why
he should be disbarred, because he still doesn't recognize the fact
the did anything wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Ninth driver killed, NYPD steps up efforts  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The crime scene was eerily familiar for police
and livery drivers alike: a livery driver found shot in the head in
a cab with no bulletproof partition. The suspects: passengers he
unlawfully picked up on the street in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, nine drivers have been killed, the latest one
early Friday morning; 11 drivers were killed in all of 1999. To
combat the murder spree, Police Commissioner Howard Safir will
assign more officers to a task force devoted to protecting about
41,000 drivers, said Fernando Mateo, president of the New York
State Federation of Taxi Drivers. Mateo met with Safir Friday for
about 30 minutes to discuss the drivers' safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 300 officers are on the task force. Safir didn't give
any numbers but promised a ''substantial'' amount of extra cops to
watch over the drivers, Mateo said after the meeting, closed to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Safir showed Mateo a video about the livery cab industry that
will be delivered to all precincts. Among the video's reminders for
cops -- all cabs in the city have amber warning headlights they can
flash if they are in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spoke about the flashing lights and how a lot of police
officers are not acknowledging that the flashing lights are on ...
it's what signals when a livery driver is in trouble,'' Mateo said.
He added no cabbies who complained their signals were ignored have
been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, police will set up more checkpoints where they stop
drivers to see if they're OK, and task force officers would work
longer hours and patrols would increase, he added. The FBI has been
asked by Mateo's group to assist the NYPD. FBI spokesman Jim
Margolin said at this point, no federal statutes have been violated
and there is no jurisdiction for the agency to intervene. But the
agency will provide assistance if requested, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appeals, Safir and Mateo begged livery drivers not
to pick up street fares, a practice that is against Taxi and
Limousine Commission rules. All but one of the slain drivers were
killed by street fares, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the extra few dollars your life isn't worth it,'' Mateo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest driver slain -- Cesar Lopez, 43, of Staten Island --
was allegedly killed by one of two passengers picked up on in
Brooklyn at 3:55 a.m., police said. Lopez, a native of the
Dominican Republic, had been a livery driver for 12 years, working
the past five for Livonia Car Service. He is survived by his wife,
Maria, a 7-year-old son and 9-year-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a nice person, always laughing, always joking around,''
said colleague Julio Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Like the eight drivers killed before him, Lopez's car was not
equipped with a bulletproof partition, police said. In response to
the killings, the TLC voted last week to require all drivers to
install either bulletproof partitions or digital security cameras
in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the TLC made it mandatory for yellow cabs and livery
cars owned by more than one driver to have the partitions. But cars
owned and operated by individual drivers -- 90 percent of all livery
cars -- could have either partitions or tiny surveillance cameras
installed behind the rearview mirror. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
recently pledged $5 million toward a grant program to help pay for
the security devices.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., asked for $600,000 in
federal funds to purchase 2,000 partitions.
</P>
<P>
   The recent increase in driver murders and the new requirement
has apparently overwhelmed shops that install partitions, which are
cheaper to install than cameras. Partitions cost between $250 to
$350, and cameras start at $600. The waiting list to have
partitions installed ranges from one week to two months.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why livery drivers pick up street fares, Mateo said
it was a combination of finances and understanding. Drivers can
make more money with street fares, he said. And because they live
and work in the inner city, they know the community depends on them
for transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo urged residents to come forward if they have information
on the killings. Police have made arrests in only two of the nine
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're crying for your help, we're the people who transport
you, we're the people who work for you, your parents and your
grandchildren,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Group Faults Clinton on Testimony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A conservative group said Friday that
President Clinton admits in sealed papers that he made misleading
statements in the Monica Lewinsky scandal while denying committing
perjury or obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation,
said Clinton also argues in the 85-page document that his position
as president should weigh in favor of his keeping his license to
practice law in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arguments to an Arkansas Supreme Court committee is in
response to a complaint by the Atlanta-based foundation seeking to
disbar Clinton for his 1998 testimony denying that he'd had a
sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intention of putting'' Clinton's filing on the
public record,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of Clinton's filing will come out when the
foundation submits its rebuttal May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin called the president's arguments ''a pathetic attempt to
defend the indefensible. He denies everything, which is exactly why
he should be disbarred, because he still doesn't recognize the fact
the did anything wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Euro Hits New Low Vs. the Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro slipped to another record low against
the dollar Friday as the U.S. currency staged a strong advance
against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro fell as low as 90.30 cents in midday trading in London,
below its previous all-time low of 90.59 cents reached at midday
Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the single curency of 11 European nations recovered a bit to
finish at 90.92 cents in late dealings in New York, down from 91.01
cents in late dealings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar gained nearly 2 yen against the Japanese yen, rising
to 108.18 Japanese yen from 106.36 yen late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. currency also rose to 1.4810 Canadian dollars from
1.4766 late Thursday but it fell to 1.7228 Swiss francs from
1.7272. The British pound fell to $1.5526 from $1.5753.
</P>
<P>
   The euro, launched in January 1999, sank to new lows on three of
the five trading days this week. Analysts say investors doubt that
European authorities can rally around a strategy that would
stimulate growth and make Europe a more attractive place to invest.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank's quarter percentage point increase in
interest rates on Thursday failed to spark enthusiasm for the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar's most striking move Friday was its advance
against the Japanese yen, which has also been trading near record
highs against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anderson, financial economist for Fleet Bank in Boston,
said some the yen buying was by professionals in advance of a
series of Golden Week national holidays that will close the
financial markets in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   He said traders feel Japanese authorities ''are more bothered by
the euro's weakness than the U.S. is'' and would like to see the
euro strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   A strong yen versus the euro makes Japanese products more
expensive in Europe, dampening the Japanese export market.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1514 German
marks, up from 2.1476; 7.2155 French francs, up from 7.2028; and
2,129.88 Italian lire, up from 2,126.02.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Teens Elect Bush in Mock Vote  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- George W. Bush accepted the Republican
presidential nomination Friday -- from a mock convention put on by
Oregon teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was nominated a day earlier by a 3-1 margin
over John McCain at the model convention, which is an Oregon
tradition that dates back to 1964. The students, mostly high
schoolers, play the parts of delegates, committee chairs and caucus
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting by telephone from Austin, Texas, Bush told the 2,000
students on the convention floor that he will ''run a campaign that
will lift our spirits.'' On education, he said schools should make
decisions at the local level and students should be provided with
standards they must meet before advancing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, presidential candidates including Robert F.
Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson and Bush's
father have appeared in person at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some students on Friday were disappointed that Bush didn't do
the same. Indeed, Tyler Warren, 18, of Hillsboro High School, said
he felt most of the presidential candidates this year were ignoring
the youth vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush had wanted to reach out to the younger generation of
voters, this could have been an important attempt to do that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the best convention style, after Bush hung up students
representing the Texas delegation gave him a standing ovation and
marched around the convention floor chanting his name and waving
signs.

<HEADLINE> 4 Dead in Suburban Pa. Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A gunman opened fire in two suburban
Pittsburgh shopping centers Friday, killing three people, police
said. A man in custody was also suspected in a fourth person's
death, as well as shootings at two synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were fatally shot at a Chinese restaurant in McKees
Rocks, while another person was killed at a martial arts school in
Monaca, police said. A woman was found dead in her Mount Lebanon
home, and the shooter was suspected in her death, said Mount
Lebanon police Deputy Chief Henry Egal.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's cause of death had not been determined. She lived on
the same block as the unidentified suspect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect also fired shots at two synagogues, but no one was
injured, police said. A swastika and the word ''Jew'' had been
sprayed on one synagogue, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinh Truong, a cook at the Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine restaurant at
the Plaza at Robinson Town Centre in McKees Rocks, said his
brother-in-law was one of the two shot there.
</P>
<P>
   Truong was in the kitchen when an employee ran from the front of
the restaurant, telling everyone to escape. Instead, he left the
kitchen and saw his brother-in-law on the floor
</P>
<P>
   ''I see my brother Tony on the floor,'' said Truong, who did not
give the man's full name. ''I tell everybody 'somebody shot
Tony.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Beaver County dispatcher said a suspect was arrested in
Ambridge, about 6 miles southeast of Monaca and 16 miles northwest
of Pittsburgh. No further details of the shootings or arrest were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Township police in nearby Carnegie said another person was
wounded at an undisclosed location there. Linda Ross, a spokeswoman
at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, said that the 25-year-old man was
in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the upper back and
neck region.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Matching Funds Awarded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's defunct presidential campaign
qualified for $3.4 million from taxpayers to help pay off its debts
as election officials tallied another round of matching funds
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission certified $5.4 million in
matching funds to seven presidential candidates, pushing the total
for the 2000 election to $54.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, qualified
for almost $1 million in the latest round, bringing his total to a
record $14.1 million. The numbers tend to climb each presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   At $14 million, McCain also surpassed the previous record of
$13.5 million set by GOP nominee Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The matching funds show McCain's fund-raising strength in the
battle for the GOP nomination. He suspended his campaign March 7,
ceding the contest to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and reported $8.6
million in debts at the end of that month.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee, didn't accept matching funds,
freeing him from the primary spending limits attached to the
taxpayers' money. He didn't need it: Bush has raised a record $80
million.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government matches the first $250 of each individual
contribution to a candidate who limits primary spending to $40.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials say they expect to qualify for about $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's former Democratic primary opponent, Bill Bradley, will
receive another $277,763, bringing his total to $12.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates certified for funds Friday were: Alan Keyes,
Republican, $359,608; Gary Bauer, a Republican who quit the race,
$68,423; Patrick Buchanan, Reform Party, $117,809; John Hagelin,
Natural Law Party, $234,910.
</P>
<P>
   Due to a shortage of funds, the Treasury is behind in making
payments. In all, the government now owes candidates about $16.3
million.

<HEADLINE> Russia Faces U.S. Move To Amend ABM  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With its conventional forces deteriorating and its
nuclear arsenal approaching obsolescence, Russia looks with anxiety
at moves to further undermine its military might -- which it
believes changing the ABM Treaty would do.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction from the Kremlin on Friday to the release
of new details about the United States' push to amend the pact, but
Russia has vehemently objected for months.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin has threatened that Russia could pull
out of all arms control pacts if the United States goes ahead with
building a missile defense system Russia says is disallowed under
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is likely to be at the center of President Clinton's
June 3-4 summit with Putin. Clinton has said of Putin that ''I
think the United States can do business with this man,'' and the
ABM dispute promises to test that view.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants Russia to agree to amending the treaty
to allow construction of such a system, which Washington says it
needs to protect the country against possible missile attacks by
''rogue'' nations such as North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Russia argues that the system would undermine the treaty's basic
philosophy: that nuclear states are unlikely to launch a missile
strike if they have no way of defending themselves against a
retaliatory barrage.
</P>
<P>
   The United States counters that its proposed system would be
designed to defend against only a few dozen missiles and could not
protect the country against an attack as large as Russia is capable
of launching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strategic offensive forces give each side the certain ability
to carry out an annihilating attack ... Forces of this size can
easily penetrate a limited NMD (national missile defense) system of
the type the United States is now developing,'' says a U.S.
document published Friday by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and
confirmed by U.S. Ambassador James Collins.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia worries that the limited NMD system the United States
says it wants could easily be expanded and the U.S. proposal
suggests negotiations on further changes in the treaty should begin
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the United States expanding its missile defenses
comes as Russia's nuclear capacities decline. The current Russian
arsenal of about 6,000 warheads could shrink to a few hundred in
the next decade, analysts say, because maintaining the old ones and
building new ones costs more than the cash-strapped government can
bear.
</P>
<P>
   Economics was a key argument behind Putin's recent successful
push for the Russian parliament to ratify the long-delayed START II
arms-reduction treaty. Proponents said trimming the nuclear arsenal
would enhance security.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's sense of security has plunged over the last decade as
the troubles of the underfunded conventional forces became known
and NATO expanded eastward.
</P>
<P>
   With his championing of START II and the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty, Putin has indicated a willingness to work with the
West as long as Russia negotiates from a position of strength. If
the United States pushes Russia into a corner on ABM, he may look
for a way to compromise without appearing to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   The military has said its likely response to any breach of the
ABM treaty would be to fit multiple nuclear warheads to its new
Topol-M missiles. Topol-Ms currently carry just one warhead each,
in line with START II.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 154; Nasdaq Up 86  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks fell for a third straight
session Friday as investors fretted about rising interest rates,
but technology shares continued their recovery and drove the Nasdaq
composite index higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 154.19 to close at
10,733.91. The blue-chip index ended the week down 110.14 points,
or 1.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite rose 86.63 to close at 3,860.66. The index,
which fell steeply earlier this month, ended the week with a gain
of 216.78 points, or 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 12.49 to 1,452.43.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in technology stocks was led by a rally in
semiconductor shares. Intel rose 1{ to 126 13/16 a day after
company executives detailed plans to begin selling an Intel-branded
machine for online access later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, a maker of equipment used in the
semiconductor industry, rose 1{ to 101 13/16 and PMC-Sierra jumped
9\ to 191~.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like Lycos, up 5\ to 46{, and Yahoo, up 5
15/16 to 130\, were also higher, convincing analysts that the
technology sector is poised for a broad, if moderate, recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that aggressive investors think that the selloff has
hit the bottom with technology stocks, and it is safe to stick your
toe back in the water,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But the gains in the high-tech sector failed to prop up the
broader market, which was weighed down by fears of rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that Americans' incomes
rose last month even faster than spending, something that hasn't
happened since October.
</P>
<P>
   But although people made more money, they didn't put
significantly more away in savings. The report showed that the
personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income
-- rose only slightly to 0.4 percent in March from a record low of
0.2 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
   That provided another sign that the economy continues to grow at
a brisk pace, which the Federal Reserve will likely consider at its
policymaking meeting on May 16. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates for the sixth time since June as they attempt
to keep inflationary pressures under control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has a governor on it right now ... it's called the
Fed meeting next month,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of
market analysis at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ''Until
that meeting, there will be a lid on the upside of this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of higher interest rates pushed financial services stocks
down. American Express fell 5{ to 149{ and J.P. Morgan fell 3 to
128].
</P>
<P>
   Merck fell 2 to 69{ after financial news station CNBC reported
that the company may face safety questions from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration about its painkiller Vioxx. The company later
released a statement saying the drug is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based music service MP3.com tainted the technology
sector, falling 39 percent after a judge found the company liable
for infringing the copyrights of the Recording Industry Association
of America. MP3's products make it possible to download music over
the Internet. Its shares fell 4| to 7.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange and by a 12-to-7 margin on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.18 billion shares, compared with 1.31
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.69 to
506.25.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 2.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain To Meet May 9  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting aside differences, aides for George W.
Bush and John McCain agreed Friday on the broad outlines of an
agenda for a May 9 meeting between the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee and his vanquished rival.
</P>
<P>
   One day after McCain nearly scrapped the event in a dispute over
the agenda, Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and McCain political
director John Weaver met for 45 minutes here and agreed to keep the
date a week from Tuesday in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda was said to include McCain's signature issue of
campaign finance overhaul along with military reform, Social
Security, education, health care, making the GOP more inclusive and
McCain's role in the fall campaign and the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a cordial, productive meeting and we agreed on an
agenda,'' Weaver said in a telephone interview minutes after the
session broke up. ''Senator McCain looks forward to a productive,
substantial meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate telephone interview, Allbaugh said, ''It was a
positive 45-minute meeting. We talked about a variety of issues and
the governor is looking forward to meeting Senator McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides were expected to discuss the topics in more detail before
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The session will be important to the political fortunes of both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to unify the party and appeal to independent-minded
voters who flocked to McCain's campaign before he dropped out in
March. The Arizona senator, who still has presidential ambitions,
wants to show Republicans he is a party man.
</P>
<P>
   There are downsides for both men, too. Bush is unlikely to
emerge from the meeting with McCain's endorsement, which he needs
to help court independent voters. And McCain fears he could damage
his political maverick image if he unites with Bush at a meeting
that independent voters recognize as, in the words of one aide, ''a
political charade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised the stakes by taking the unusual step last week of
announcing that he would ask McCain whether he wants to be
considered a prospect for the vice presidential nomination. McCain
has said he doesn't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has been under pressure from some Republicans who
think McCain's appeal is worth a major effort to get him on the
ticket. McCain and his advisers believed that Bush was turning the
meeting into a high-profile forum for the Arizona senator to take
himself out of the running.
</P>
<P>
   Their discomfort with that notion suggests that some top McCain
supporters want him to remain a vice presidential prospect. Some of
them say they suspect that McCain could be persuaded to serve on
the ticket if Bush waged a sincere campaign to do so.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's camp felt that Bush and his advisers were trying to
seek advantage in the meeting through news leaks. After threatening
to cancel or postpone the event Thursday, Weaver's previously
scheduled meeting with Allbaugh took on added importance.

<HEADLINE> Shootout Spurs Panic in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Troops from a West African
intervention force clashed with renegade soldiers Friday, killing
one rebel in a shootout that sent residents running for cover in
war-ravaged Sierra Leone's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The firefight in Freetown erupted when six armed Nigerians from
the intervention force known as ECOMOG went to retrieve a truck
that had been commandeered by soldiers from the country's ousted
junta.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups opened fire, leaving a former junta commander
injured and his bodyguard dead, witnesses said. Destroyed vehicles
littered the street.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire sent bystanders fleeing. Businesses shut down, and
the streets emptied except for ex-junta fighters who roamed the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma appealed for calm on
state-run radio, urging his followers to leave the streets as U. N.
peacekeepers strengthened checkpoints and took up positions in
front of key buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are carrying out checks on a random basis for smuggled
weapons which we will confiscate,'' U.N. commander Maj. Gen. Vijay
Kumar Jetley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian-led intervention force was the government's main
backer during eight years of civil war but has scaled down its role
since a peace accord was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the U.N. force is expected to be increased from the
current 8,500 to 11,500 soldiers by July. But many Sierra Leoneans
have expressed skepticism that the U.N. troops can enforce the
fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorized to use force if necessary, the U.N.
peacekeepers -- mainly Indians, Kenyans and Nigerians -- have avoided
confronting the former Revolutionary United Front rebels and their
allies from Koroma's ex-junta.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeeping contingents have themselves been robbed by
rebels, who killed tens of thousands of civilians and intentionally
maimed many more during the war.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 23,490 of an estimated 45,000 pro-government militia and
rebel fighters have been disarmed under the July peace accord,
according to U.N. figures. Yet tens of thousands of rebels have
refused to give up their guns, U.N. officials say.

<HEADLINE> Chris Rock's Comedic Magazine Debuts  </HEADLINE>
By CANDACE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the tradition of Harvard's Lampoon, the
first black satirical publication produced at a historically black
university made its long awaited debut Friday but its main backer,
Chris Rock, was absent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clean. It's colorful. It's well stapled. It's very
good,'' said Bill Stepheny, a New York-based record producer who is
co-founder of the 23-page, full color Illtop Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The first run, 20,000 copies, was produced and distributed by
students at Howard University, one of the nation's oldest
historically black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine was conceived in 1998 by Rock who wants it to be a
training ground for African-American writers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a market where people of color are under represented
and nearly nonexistent in the creative behind-the-sences roles
(i.e. ''Friends''),'' writes Rock on page five of the magazine. ''I
hope that The Illtop Journal becomes a name that is synonymous with
producing some of the most talented young black comedy writers in
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepheny read a letter from Rock at a news conference where the
magazine was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have all worked very hard and I am so proud of our first
issue of the Illtop Journal,'' said Rock, who apologized for not
being on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Rock said he is making a movie ''to make some money to pay for
all of this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore April Bush, 20, really liked the magazine. ''The name
is dope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's also Rock's creation, a take on Howard's student
newspaper ''The Hilltop.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York native has appeared on several comedy shows,
including ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''In Living Color.'' He has
won three Emmy and two Grammy Awards, has appeared in several
movies, written a book and hosts his own HBO talk show.
</P>
<P>
   P. Kobina Yankah, the Journal's editor-in-chief, said Rock
brought energy to the publication. ''He's personally seen the
magazine, seen all the articles, sent feedback to us,'' Yankah
said.
</P>
<P>
   The staff was treated to a trip to New York last year to HBO's
''The Chris Rock Show'' where they got advice on their writing.
</P>
<P>
   The premier issue features a photo of a campus building with one
cartoon fraternity character initiating another with the slogan,
''Our Brutal Initiation into the World of Literary Humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The back page pictures two white characters dressed as court
jesters ready to initiate a black cartoon figure with wooden
paddles. The paddles carry the names of Illtop's counterparts at
Harvard and Stanford. Two representatives from those college humor
magazines welcomed the Illtop with a mallet, copies of the Lampoon,
a drinking mug and a framed sketch.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal contains humorous ads and articles on sex and
politics. There are articles like, ''White's student's guide to
howard u,'' and ''Texas Teen Looks Forward to Big Score.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an interview with comedian Paul Mooney and horoscopes,
but even they can't be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, one of the magazine's faculty advisers, said the
first two issues would be free, but after that ''We're looking for
sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   The students plan two issues a semester but Stepheny said:
''We'll take it as it comes. The success is that we got it done.''

<HEADLINE> Buffett To Take Blame at Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JOE RUFF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire Warren Buffett will be able to
tell shareholders in person this weekend what he already has said
in print -- his company had its worst year ever and he blames
himself for the performance.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's annual meeting of shareholders in Berkshire
Hathaway is expected to attract 12,000 investors and followers of
Buffett, one of the world's richest men, who has made the
gatherings a circus-like event.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in which Berkshire has holdings lay out their wares,
including Dairy Queen, Coca-Cola, See's candy and Dexter shoes.
Stockholders, some of whom have attended for decades, come to meet
old friends and listen to Buffett crack jokes and talk about
investment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In Berkshire Hathaway's annual report released in March, Buffett
-- known as ''the Oracle of Omaha'' -- said 1999 was his company's
worst in its 35-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year's guilty party:
your chairman,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing shareholders Saturday, Buffett probably will lay it on
the line again, said Andrew Kilpatrick, a stockbroker from
Birmingham, Ala., who wrote ''Of Permanent Value, The Story of
Warren Buffett.''
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will be understanding, Kilpatrick said, because
people who stick with Buffett know he picks good investments and
stays with them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bet he walks out to a standing ovation and then gets some
tough questions,'' Kilpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime shareholder and retired stockbroker Bob Soener of Omaha
said Buffett's investments helped him put seven children through
private school and college. He believes Buffett will work through
the tough year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cream always goes to the top,'' Soener said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has some climbing to do. Berkshire's earnings dropped 42
percent in 1999, to $1.6 billion from $2.8 billion the year before.
Berkshire's stock, the most expensive on the New York Stock
Exchange, fell 20 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the stock market soared, including a 19.5
percent increase in Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway's Class A stock gave up early gains and
closed down $100 at $59,300 a share Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. While that's almost 25 percent below the 52-week high of
$78,600, it also is 45 percent above its 52-week low of $40,800.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire's main business -- insurance -- struggled, particularly
because of losses in one of the largest reinsurers in the world,
General Re Corp. Huge payouts on claims from earthquakes and storms
contributed to an $897 million underwriting loss.
</P>
<P>
   Auto insurer GEICO's underwriting profit also fell last year and
probably will be weak again in 2000, although GEICO's investment in
marketing is paying off, Buffett said in his annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is warning stockholders that his company will not
outperform the stock market as dramatically as it has in the past.
Prices are higher for businesses and stocks, Buffett said, and
Berkshire is so huge that if it makes a new investment it would
have to be among a limited number of big businesses to have any
major impact on Berkshire's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   General Re is raising its rates, Buffett said, and barring any
new castastrophe, its underwriting losses should fall considerably.
However, Buffett said, General Re probably will have an
unsatisfactory year in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some core investments for Berkshire, like Coca-Cola, did not
perform as they have in the past, Kilpatrick said, and General Re
suffered through extraordinary claims, including earthquakes in
Turkey and Taiwan and winter storms in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick said he believes General Re will recover and provide
the investment money that Buffett wants. As Buffett warned, it will
not happen overnight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a big ship and it will be a slow turn,'' Kilpatrick
said.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold prices slid to a seven-month low Friday, pressured by the
dollar's continued strength and the imminent gold sale by the Swiss
National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, natural gas prices leaped higher and soybeans
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Gold has been mostly in the doldrums since last fall except for
a brief but explosive rally that pushed the price as high as
$326.90 a troy ounce in February.
</P>
<P>
   It had settled into a trading range around the $280s -- still
comfortably above the 20-year low of $255 reached last summer. But
the specter of upcoming central bank sales of gold in Europe has
driven buyers away, and the exodus from gold accelerated Friday
partly on word that the Swiss sale could begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss National Bank president Hans Meyer said the new currency
law freeing the Swiss franc from its gold reserves is to take
effect May 1, or Monday, and the bank will begin the sale of its
excess gold reserves ''as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That will dump more gold into a market that already has abundant
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gold for June delivery dipped $3.70 to $274.20 an ounce on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange -- the lowest
price since September.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult for investors or consumers to buy gold in the
face of certain knowledge that two major central banks will be
selling shortly,'' said Leonard Kaplan, chief bullion dealer for
LFG Bullion Services in Chicago, referring to the upcoming Swiss
and Bank of England sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''The natural human response is 'Well, let's wait and see what
happens.' This creates a shortage of buyers and gives sellers a
tremendous opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the dollar's seemingly unassailable might
discourages any flight into gold.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said the dollar's strength masks the fact that ''in 95
percent of the currencies of the world, gold is in a roaring bull
market. It is only in the dollar that gold has done very poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   On another trading floor of the New York Merc, natural gas
prices roared nearly 3 percent higher amid reports that warmer
weather in the southwestern and southcentral United States will
boost demand for supplemental cooling fuel.
</P>
<P>
   June natural gas rose 8.6 cents to $3.141 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Other energy prices were mostly higher. June crude oil rose 32
cents to $25.74 a barrel, expiring May heating oil contracts fell
1.87 cents to 73.18 cents a gallon and May unleaded gasoline rose
0.21 cent to 82.59 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose 13 cents to
$23.89 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans sank on the Chicago Board of Trade after a private
forecast said a potent storm system was headed toward the Midwest
next weekend. The long-term weather outlook halted a mild rally
that followed a big selloff on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains could alter the crop picture for this year, which so
far remains clouded by abnormally dry soil conditions.
</P>
<P>
   July soybeans fell 5} cents to $5.39\ a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Inflation on the Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Consumer prices rose 10.2 percent in
April, boosting Ecuador's annual inflation rate to 88.9 percent,
economic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador is trying to tame its inflation -- the highest in Latin
America -- by phasing out its currency, the sucre, and replacing it
with the U.S. dollar. April's annualized inflation rate is 8
percentage points higher than the previous month.
</P>
<P>
   President Gustavo Noboa's government has said the Andean nation
will end the year with inflation of no more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for school supplies, clothing and books at the start of
the new school year helped drive up the inflation rate, said German
Rojas, director of Ecuador's National Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause, he said, was an 80 percent hike in public
transportation fares, associated with the government's attempts to
cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   International lenders last month pledged a three-year dlrs 2
billion aid package to help finance the rebuilding of Ecuador's
shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditions for the aid include cutting government
subsidies, which is expected to significantly increase the cost of
home cooking fuel, gasoline and other consumer items.

<HEADLINE> Regional EPA Director Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency's
regional director in Denver was suspended Friday while he fights
allegations that he illegally helped raise money for a Montana
congressional candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Yellowtail was removed as head of EPA's Region 8, covering
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.
Yellowtail will help his acting successor for 30 days, then will go
on unpaid leave from his $130,000-a-year job, the EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel this is serious enough that he needs to step aside,''
said W. Michael McCabe, EPA's acting deputy administrator in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail's staff said Friday he had gone to his ranch in
Montana, and is due back in the Denver office next week. A call
seeking comment from Yellowtail in Montana was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Office of Special Counsel accused Yellowtail of
breaking the law by signing his name to a 1998 letter seeking
campaign contributions for Robert ''Dusty'' Deschamps, a Democrat
who ran unsuccessfully for Montana's lone House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowtail, 52, sought that seat in 1996 as a Democrat and lost
to Republican Rep. Rick Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law bans campaign activity by government workers.
Yellowtail has decided to defend himself through proceedings before
the Merit Systems Protection Board. The case could last six months
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The region overseen by Yellowtail has about 700 employees at
offices in Denver and Helena. Major projects include an ongoing
investigation into asbestos exposure from mining in northwestern
Montana.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Treasury Bonds Gain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The price of 30-year Treasury bonds rose Friday,
reversing early losses, as blue-chip stocks fell. But shorter
maturities were mostly lower on inflation jitters.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark long-term Treasury rose 11/32 point, or $3.44 per
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell to 5.96 percent from 5.98 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trading day, when long-term bonds were retreating,
yields briefly rose above 6 percent. The last time 30-year
Treasurys closed at or above 6 percent was March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Traders shifted money into bonds as blue-chip stocks fell. The
Dow Jones industrial average dropped 154.19 points to close at
10,733.91.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term notes were weighed down by inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe the robust economy is rekindling
inflation. Traders fear the Federal Reserve will be even more
aggressive in trying to cool of growth. That could mean raising
interest rates by one-half percentage point, rather than a
quarter-point increase that had been expected at a May 16 meeting
of the central bank's policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation and rising rates erode the value of investments that
pay a fixed return, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the price of short-term notes fell 1/16 point to 3/32
point, according to Bridge Telerate, a financial information
service. Intermediate maturities were mixed, ranging from down 1/32
point to up 1/16 point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.80 percent as the
discount jumped 0.07 percentage point from Thursday to 5.65
percent. Six-month yields were 6.10 percent as the discount rate
rose 0.05 point to 5.85 percent. One-year yields were 6.15 percent
as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 5.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, slipped to 5.94 percent from 6 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose [ point to 94 7/16. The average yield
fell to 6.00 percent from 6.01 percent on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Gun Buyback Program  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw his support Friday
behind a gun buyback program in the District of Columbia, pushing
aside criticisms that the programs are ineffective because they
draw only old, cheap guns from people desperate for money.
</P>
<P>
   The president went to the Metropolitan Police Department's
training facility on the south side of town to promote another city
gun buyback scheduled for June 23. Mayor Anthony Williams said the
city would devote $250,000 to the gun purchases, and Clinton added
another $100,000 from the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
</P>
<P>
   With that money, Clinton said, officers may be able to get 7,000
guns off the streets of the District, where gun possession is
illegal. A gun buyback last summer brought in 3,000 weapons at
roughly $100 each, among them .22-caliber ''Saturday night
specials,'' sawed-off shotguns and 9mm semiautomatics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no excuse now not to keep doing what works, and to do
more of it,'' Clinton said. ''I want America to be the safest big
country in the entire world and you can do it if we give you the
tools to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the District's buybacks -- one of the most
successful in the country -- a bittersweet victory for a police
department that has seen several officers slain in recent years and

children outside the National Zoo, including one police sergeant's

   ''You are in a successful enterprise, and you ought to tell
everybody that,'' Clinton said. ''Amidst all the tragedy and
heartbreak, ... you should take enormous pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics questioned whether federal funds should be used for the
program since its impact on the crime rate is not calculable.
</P>
<P>
   ''As well intentioned as these programs are, no one should be
disillusioned to think that it really has an impact on crime,''
National Rifle Association spokesman Bill Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee said Clinton should focus on
prosecuting criminals who carry guns, rather than encouraging
law-abiding citizens to give up their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety-nine percent of the time, honest Americans who are
hurting for money bring in guns that have been sitting in their
houses without being used,'' spokesman Chris Paulitz said. ''The
ones who are not bringing in the guns are the criminals. It doesn't
make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the age and type of the guns are not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to run an antique gun dealership,'' he said.
''If we avoid just one death, even an accidental death, then I
think it is worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, District police collected 3,000 weapons at roughly
$100 each. They kept a few ''for display purposes'' while the rest
were test-fired, given ballistics tests and destroyed, Police Chief
Charles Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never again will those weapons be available for settling an
argument, committing a street robbery or seriously injuring or
killing one of our children,'' Ramsey said. ''Never again.''

<HEADLINE> Minister Sentenced in Teacher Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A minister accused of assaulting a teacher for
giving his daughter a D-minus on her report card was sentenced to
2{ years in prison Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Dale Robinson, 36, of assault and battery and
disturbing the peace. Judge Rosalind Miller gave Robinson the
maximum penalty for assault and battery and ordered him to serve 10
additional days on the disturbing-the-peace charge.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Antonio Centeio lost several teeth and suffered eye
injuries and a broken jaw when Robinson, a 6-foot-8 former high
school basketball star, attacked him last year. Prosecutors said
the attack came after Robinson's daughter brought home near-failing
grades on her report card.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a minister and youth counselor in the city's Roxbury
section, allegedly told Centeio, ''This isn't over yet'' after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''For any parent, a minister nonetheless, to enter a school and
strike a teacher because of a bad grade is deplorable,'' District
Attorney Ralph C. Martin said in a statement. ''Parents are
supposed to set examples to which their children should aspire.''

<HEADLINE> Govt. Approves Protein As Pesticide  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has approved a
first-of-its-kind protein product that switches on a plant's
natural defenses against disease and insects, giving farmers a new
alternative to chemical pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, produced from genetically engineered bacteria, has
been shown in field testing to increase yields for tomatoes and
peppers by up to 22 percent and make plants more tolerant of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in modern agriculture, growers will be able
to harness the innate defense and growth systems of crops,'' the
Environmental Protection Agency said in a report on the product,
which is expected to go on sale in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Known by the trade name Messenger, it's one of a growing number
of ''biopesticides'' that either trigger or strengthen plants'
natural defenses or contain microbes that attack the pests.
</P>
<P>
   Messenger, which EPA approved for registration April 19, is the
first natural product that can turn on crops' own immune systems,
Phil Hutton of EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs said Friday.
Another product awaiting EPA approval uses a chemical to trigger
plants' resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Although environmental groups have been leery of many
genetically engineered crops, they were less concerned about
Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Benbrook, a consultant for environmental groups on
pesticide issues, said the future for such products ''is very
bright.'' But he cautioned: ''Sometimes in large scale commercial
applications, biopesticides either work significantly better than
people hoped or are not nearly as consistent as needed to be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the pesticides that Messenger could help replace is methyl
bromide, an ozone-depleting gas that is widely used on
strawberries, tomatoes and other vegetables. Methyl bromide, which
is used to fumigate the soil, is being phased out for most uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been anxiously awaiting the registration so we can use
the product in the field,'' said Dan Botts, director of
environmental and pest management division for the Florida Fruit
and Vegetable Association.
</P>
<P>
   The product, which will be marketed by EDEN Biosience Corp. of
Seattle, is primarily designed to protect against diseases caused
by viruses, bacteria and fungi, but field trials have also shown it
to be effective against some insects, the government said. It also
promotes root growth, reducing the plant's need for water.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, known as harpin, comes from the bacterium that
causes fire blight, a disease that attacks apple and pear trees.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at Cornell University discovered that the protein
triggers a response in plants that closes down the pathways by
which the bacteria can attack them. The problem for the plants is
that they usually detect the protein too late. By spraying crops
with the protein before they are under attack, the plants can
develop sufficient resistance to block a broad range of pathogens
when they do show up, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   EPA said the protein poses no harm to humans or animals. It
degrades so quickly that it cannot be detected within two hours of
application, scientists say. Pests also are less likely to develop
resistance to the product because they don't interact with the
protein, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500 field trials have been conducted worldwide on more than
40 crops, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, wheat, rice,
citrus, cotton and tobacco, EPA said.
</P>
<P>
   When the product was tried on tomatoes in Florida, overall use
of fungicides, bactericides, and insecticides was reduced by 71
percent, while yields improved by 10 percent to 22 percent. Trials
on jalapeno peppers in Mexico, New Mexico and Florida increased
yields by up to 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The development of Messenger and other biopesticides is likely
to speed up as EPA forces companies to take more conventional
products off the market because of health and ecological concerns,
environmentalists say.

<HEADLINE> Feds Expected To Alter Air-Bag Tests  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move supported by automakers, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration next week is
expected to announce a requirement that a 25-mph crash test be used
to check air bags.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer groups favor a 30-mph test, which they said
would save lives by requiring air bags that deploy forcefully
enough to protect unbelted adults in high-speed crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lower-test speed bags offer less protection,'' said R. David
Pittle, senior vice president and technical director for Consumers
Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers and other supporters, including the American Trauma
Society and the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety
Representatives, say the 25-mph standard is better because it will
ensure bags don't deploy so forcefully that they injure or kill
children and small adults.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA officials refused to comment, saying an announcement would
be made next week.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 158 reported air-bag fatalities, 92 of them
children. But air bags have saved the lives of some 5,000 people
since the 1980s, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, NHTSA required a 30-mph test to try to prevent
deaths to passenger-side occupants due to air-bag deployments,
which often occurred in low-speed accidents. It made the test
optional in 1997 and automakers quickly installed less-forceful air
bags in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Government data show that air-bag deaths have dropped sharply
for those model years.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Roberts, spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, said if the government required the 30-mph tests
''you're right back to putting children and small stature adults at
risk for serious injury or death.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't make any sense to jeopardize lives when the current
air bag system is working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA's first draft of the rule included a return to the 30-mph
standard by 2008. The rule would have been phased in gradually,
with automakers allowed to use the slower speed until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal reported
Friday that the Office of Management and Budget, which reviews
proposed rules, rejected that proposal, saying arguments for the
30-mph test were not convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rule, automakers will be required to install air bags
that inflate forcefully enough to cushion occupants as a car
crashes into a solid wall at 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Pittle said NHTSA officials have estimated 200 to 400 more
fatalities with the 25-mph test. ''That's an unnecessary cost to
occupant safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumer groups say automakers could use sensors and
dual-speed air bags to make sure the devices do not deploy too
forcefully and harm children and smaller adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's technology allows automakers to provide air bags that
protect both unbelted adults in high-speed crashes as well as
smaller occupants in low-speed crashes. It's not a matter of either
or,'' Pittle said.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing will also require that air bags protect a
''family'' of dummies instead of the average-sized male dummies
currently used in all tests.
</P>
<P>
   The rule also covers how air bags inflate when adults are
involved in serious automobile crashes, as well as checking how
they inflate in stationary tests when child dummies are positioned
close to the instrument panel where the air bag comes out.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds FCC Phone Decision  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An appeals court Friday upheld a decision by
the Federal Communications Commission to free long-distance
companies from having to file with the agency federal tariffs
outlining their rates or service changes.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
puts to rest a challenge by MCI WorldCom and others to the FCC's
1996 order doing away with the tariff requirement. The
long-distance companies filed suit, claiming that the commission
exceeded its authority in completely eliminating the tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard called the decision a victory for
consumers and said it would force long-distance companies to better
inform their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''What long-distance companies ought to be doing is aggressively
advertising their prices on the Internet and in the media,''
Kennard said. ''Federal tariff filings can no longer be used as a
tool to keep prices higher than what a competitive marketplace
would require.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies had contended that without tariffs, they would
have to enter into some other contract with customers each time
rates or services were changed. That would make it harder for them
to offer new discount plans or promotions featuring free or cheap
calls, they argued. It would also incur additional costs to send
out mass mailings to individual consumers to inform them of each
rate change.
</P>
<P>
   By at least permitting the tariffs, long-distance companies said
they could hammer out individual contracts with large users but
file tariffs in instances when it made more sense -- such as when a
change affects millions of mass-market consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies said they would have to determine how the FCC order
would change their business practices. Because of the court
challenge, long-distance companies have continued to file tariff
information with the FCC since the 1996 order.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the decision is unfortunate, but we look
forward to working with the FCC to ensure that the transition ...
is as smooth as possible for consumers,'' said MCI WorldCom
spokeswoman Julie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups had contended that the arrangement was letting
companies slip rate changes by customers. Critics added that the
tariff was used as a shield to avoid companies having to forge
individual contracts with users.
</P>
<P>
   The century-old doctrine allowed long-distance companies to
charge only the rates for services they had filed with the agency.
The tariff trumped all other agreements with customers, verbal or
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also contended that the system was hindering full
competition, because companies can find out what their competitors
are charging through the publicly available tariffs. The commission
wanted to make the conditions that long-distance companies operate
in more like that of other unregulated industries.
</P>
<P>
   Citing portions of a 1996 telecommunications law, the commission
said that it had the authority to stop enforcing the tariff
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the court agreed. ''It was certainly reasonable to
move regulation in that direction even if it ostensibly raises
transaction costs for the carriers,'' the three-judge panel ruled.

<HEADLINE> Sony Profits Fall 32 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Sony Corp.'s profit fell 32 percent in the latest
fiscal year as a strong yen depressed the value of the huge
electronics and entertainment concern's overseas earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said Friday its earnings fell to 121.84 billion yen, or
$1.1 billion, in the fiscal year ended March 31 from 179.00 billion
yen a year earlier. It was the second consecutive decline in Sony's
annual group profit, and Sony expects a smaller decline this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said that during the past fiscal year, the yen was 25
percent higher against the dollar at 110.6 yen. It expects the
dollar to cost 105 yen for the fiscal year that began April 1.
</P>
<P>
   A higher yen decreases the value of dollar-denominated earnings
for Japanese exporters like Sony.
</P>
<P>
   On a yen-denominated basis, group sales dropped 1.7 percent to
6.687 trillion yen, or $63 billion, from 6.804 trillion yen a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's U.S.-listed shares fell $7.68} to $225.62{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of electronic goods, which make up the biggest portion of
Sony's revenue, rose 1.1 percent to 4.720 trillion yen, or $44.4
billion, on high demand for personal computers, digital cameras,
digital videodisc players and color TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Electronics sales were up everywhere except for South America,
Sony said. Personal computers, cellular phones and color TVs sold
well in Japan, while in the United States digital cameras, DVD
players and video cameras did well in addition to PCs and color
TVs.
</P>
<P>
   On a local currency basis, Sony's movie business recorded a 3
percent increase in sales, partly on strong box office revenues
from ''Stuart Little'' and ''Big Daddy.'' But ''The Messenger: The
Story of Joan of Arc'' and ''What Planet Are You From'' flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Sony unveiled a new video-game machine in March called the
PlayStation2, which has sold 1.4 million machines. It is set to go
on sale in U.S. stores this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of introducing the PlayStation2 helped send
operating profit for game products down 43.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the current fiscal year, Sony expects group net profit to
decline to 120 billion yen, or $1.1 billion, on group sales of 7
trillion yen, or $65.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sony expects all of its business segments, excluding the music
division, to post higher sales this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony expects the music division to be flat compared with the
last fiscal year, senior executive vice president Masayoshi
Morimoto said. Hit albums during the last fiscal year came from
Ricky Martin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey, Sony said.

<HEADLINE> U S West Reports Increased Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- U S West reported Friday its first-quarter profits
rose 2.5 percent, topping Wall Street forecasts, as the local phone
company continued to post strong growth in wireless and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based Baby Bell, due to be acquired by Qwest
Communications International, earned $404 million or 79 cents a
share, through the first three months of the year. That compared
with earnings of $394 million, or 78 cents a share, for the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues grew 6.6 percent to $3.38 billion from the year-ago
tally of $3.17 billion, led by a 167 percent jump in wireless
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of U S
West rose 43} cents to $71.25.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our top-line growth figures show that we are hitting on all
cylinders through our growth initiatives and in our core
business,'' Sol Trujillo, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said Friday. ''And much of that top-line success is
flowing to the bottom line, despite incurring
higher-than-anticipated dilution from our growth initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were pleased with the earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it was certainly a strong effort by U S West. It
was a solid quarter in a lot of respects,'' said David Burkes,
telecommunications analyst with Hilliard Lyons. ''We think the
company appears to be moving toward the (Qwest) merger with strong
operating momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest results were hurt by $32 million in after-tax losses
and about $9 million in costs related to the merger agreement with
Qwest, an operator of a national fiber-optic network.
</P>
<P>
   The merger between the two companies recently won regulatory
clearance from the Federal Communications Commission, but still
needs to win approval from state regulators in Arizona, Minnesota,
Montana, Washington, Wyoming and Utah. Colorado and Iowa already
have approved the merger.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Qwest agreed to sell off its long-distance
operations in the states where U S West is the local telephone
monopoly. U S West cannot sell long distance in those markets until
it shows that they are open to competition.

<HEADLINE> Altered Crops Nixed By Kellogg  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. shareholders
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to force the cereal maker to
stop using genetically altered crops, despite claims from two
groups of nuns that the crops are unsafe and put the company at
risk for lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it might be something in the future, but right
now it's not an issue,'' said Tom Fisher, a retired Kellogg
employee and shareholder who was among the 94 percent voting
against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is in the process of removing genetically altered
ingredients from its products in Europe and Australia, where there
has been increasing consumer backlash over the safety over
genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has declined to do the same in North America,
citing a lack of consumer interest and insufficient scientific
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we thought there was anything ... that even hinted at these
products being unsafe, we would have taken them our of our food a
long time ago,'' chief executive Carlos Gutierrez told shareholders
at Friday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Judy Schroeder of Sisters of St. Joseph called the vote a
victory that their voices were heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have an obligation to future generations to not
harm the very fragile balance of the ecosystem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace activists who want Kellogg to adopt a commitment not
to use genetically altered products have also picketed the company
twice in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg isn't alone in facing biotech critics. A number of other
food and beverage companies are being targeted with similar
anti-biotech proposals, including General Mills, Quaker Oats and
Sara Lee. Coca-Cola's shareholders rejected a similar proposal last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gordon Judd, a spokesman for the Kellogg proposal, told
Kellogg shareholders the company's use of genetically altered crops
could affect more than the company's products -- it could affect
it's bottom line by exposing it to lawsuits and potential damage to
its market share and stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez told shareholders Friday that he is concerned about
the company's declining stock price, though he doesn't attribute it
to the use of genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is taking steps to build its business: In
the last year, Kellogg has sold its frozen bagel business, shut
down its oldest Corn Flake facility and acquired a vegetarian
foods-maker; there are also new cereals, including a soy-protein
mix, and convenience foods, which Gutierrez predicts will continue
to grow in importance for the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made really good progress,'' he said. ''But there's
still a lot to do.''

<HEADLINE> Governor orders closure of beleaguered psychiatric hospital  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- After decades of problems, including
attacks on patients, patient suicides and overcrowding, Gov.
Christie Whitman ordered Friday that Greystone Park Psychiatric
Hospital be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the hospital in Parsippany is no longer
''functioning in a manner that is perceived as safe.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Human Services Commissioner Michele K. Guhl
said it may take as long as three years to move all of Greystone's
600-plus patients. The governor said all patients must be evaluated
to determine who can be moved into the community and who must be
institutionalized at another hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sparse as to what, if anything, will replace the
124-year-old hospital that serves mentally ill residents of six
northern New Jersey counties.
</P>
<P>
   Guhl said a new, smaller facility may be built on the same site
in Morris County, or elsewhere in northern New Jersey, to serve
those who cannot be moved to less restrictive community group homes
or supervised apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The model of a sprawling big hospital .... is indeed a
dinosaur. It's over,'' she said. ''It's fair to say that Greystone
as we know it will not exist. While there may be a small
psychiatric hospital on those grounds, that's a maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Guhl said no single incident triggered the decision to close the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're exasperated, we're frustrated. I think we just reached a
cumulative level and we said, that's it, that's enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes on the heels of a recent spate of disturbing
reports and incidents at Greystone. Last month, a report found the
hospital's patients were crowded into bedrooms and living in
unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a male patient was charged with sexually
assaulting a mildly retarded female patient in an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's order also follows the October escape of a
civilly committed sex offender, the arrest of four Greystone
employees for allegedly assaulting and illegally restraining a
patient in March, and an investigation into at least a dozen
employees failing to report a suicide attempt last year.
</P>
<P>
   Guhl said Greystone, although as old and overcrowded as the
state's three other psychiatric institutions, has long bedeviled
state officials. A number of chief executive officers have been
hired and fired and new management techniques employed, but nothing
seemed to work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Greystone has had seemingly intractable problems for at least
20 years,'' the commissioner said. ''Something about Greystone has
eluded past administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said a recent Supreme Court decision directing
states to move borderline patients out of institutionalized
settings also factored into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But state Senate Democratic Leader Richard Codey, a longtime
watchdog for the mentally ill, said he opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor is saying it's broke and she doesn't know how to
fix it and that's wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Codey said he would rather the Whitman administration improve
conditions at the hospital by supplying more funding, increasing
employee salaries and firing Chief Executive Officer Michael
Greenstein, under whose tenure some of the recent problems
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves to be fired because this happened on his watch.
He's clueless. He let those people down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guhl said she stands by Greystone's top man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I honestly believe this goes well beyond any one CEO,'' she
said. Guhl said she will retain Greenstein because she wants to
maintain stability at the institution during ''this very anxious
time.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greystone will eventually be phased out, state officials
said they will move forward with interim measures to improve the
level of care at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Those short term plans include hiring 40 new employees, reducing
the population by about 50 patients, and establishing new programs
for the remaining residents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state will hire mental health experts to evaluate
all remaining Greystone patients, as well as about 750 others in
other hospitals, with an eye toward moving many into community
settings.
</P>
<P>
   The Greystone patients who still require hospitalized care would
then be moved into newly available beds at other facilities or into
a new northern New Jersey hospital, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
   Guhl said she has received assurances from Whitman that money
will be available for a new push toward community placement for the
mentally ill, although she declined to say how much.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said she would personally oppose privatizing
any new psychiatric hospital, but did not rule it out. She made no
guarantees that the hospital's 1,100 employees will retain their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That was not good enough for Democratic critics of
privatization, who sought an ironclad promise that any new future
hospital would remain in state hands.

<HEADLINE> Bush Elected in Teen Mock Convention  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- George W. Bush accepted the Republican
presidential nomination Friday -- from a mock convention put on by
Oregon teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was nominated a day earlier by a 3-1 margin
over his former rival John McCain at the model convention, which is
an Oregon tradition that dates back to 1964. The students, mostly
high schoolers, play the parts of delegates, committee chairs and
caucus chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting by telephone from Austin, Texas, Bush told the 2,000
students on the convention floor that he will ''run a campaign that
will lift our spirits.'' On education, he said schools should make
decisions at the local level and students should be provided with
standards they must meet before advancing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, presidential candidates including Robert F.
Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jesse Jackson and Bush's
father have appeared in person at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some students on Friday were disappointed that Bush didn't do
the same. Tyler Warren, 18, of Hillsboro High School, said he felt
most of the presidential candidates this year were ignoring the
youth vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bush had wanted to reach out to the younger generation of
voters, this could have been an important attempt to do that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the best convention style, after Bush hung up students
representing the Texas delegation gave him a standing ovation and
marched around the convention floor chanting his name and waving
signs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the No. 2 on the ticket, the students -- on the seventh
ballot -- nominated Rep. John Kasich of Ohio for vice president. He
defeated candidates including Elizabeth Dole, New York Gov. George
Pataki, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the students surprised convention organizers when they
nominated Geraldine Ferraro for vice president -- months before
Walter Mondale tapped her.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Police Homicide Chief Killed  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Seven gunmen killed the police homicide chief
in northern Sinaloa state Friday, the fourth slaying of a top
Mexican law officer in two months.
</P>
<P>
   The assailants ambushed Williams Roman Garcia's car, spraying it
with bullets in an attack that appeared to be part of a wave of
drug-related violence as Mexico prepares for a presidential
election on July 2.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Roman Garcia by seven armed assailants occurred
only blocks from the homicide chief's home, the Sinaloa state
attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The television network Televisa reported that at least one
person had been detained in connection with the attack, but
officials did not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Garcia, who had been chief of homicide for about 10
months, was investigating the Sunday shooting deaths of two Federal
Preventative Police officers and already had witness descriptions
of the assailants, according to officials from the state attorney
general's office who spoke to The Associated Press, but asked not
to be named for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Sinaloa Gov. Juan Millan told the government news agency Notimex
that the attackers in Sunday's shooting wore the insignia of the
Federal Judicial Police and that initial indications were that the
shooting happened during a confrontation between the two agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sinaloa state, home to most of Mexico's major drug traffickers,
has seen at least 130 homicides this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press 20 days before his
death, Roman Garcia said he had hit a wall in his attempt to
investigate the killings because the cases involved drug
trafficking, which is out of his area.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Garcia accused the federal judicial police, who are
responsible for investigating drug trafficking, of incompetence.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General releases first update on State Police reforms  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The attorney general Friday released the
first report detailing reforms made in State Police operations
ordered after the state admitted that the practice of racial
profiling existed.
</P>
<P>
   But the court-mandated disclosure did not contain numbers of
minorities stopped by troopers or other related statistics that the
state must periodically make public.
</P>
<P>
   In its agreement with the U.S. Justice Department, the state
said it would provide the number of motor vehicle stops, each
driver's race, a reason for the stop and the actions taken by the
trooper.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said in Friday's report that the information is
being compiled and it will be released ''within the time period set
forth'' by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Progress reports on more than 100 other items identified by the
Justice Department were included in the materials offered by the
state. Under the terms of the agreement, New Jersey is to issue
four such reports a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been substantial reforms on a number of the areas
that were singled out in the consent decree,'' said First Assistant
Attorney General Paul Zoubek.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms should show both the judge overseeing the agreement
and the public that the state has taken the issues seriously,
Zoubek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have set forth a comprehensive method for dealing
with this issue and ensuring the public that we have made
changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Justice department agreed to the legal
settlement with the state, which included the appointment of an
independent civilian monitor, who will report to the U.S. District
Court in Trenton. The consent decree was one way for the state to
avoid a full-blown civil rights battle in open court, according to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities also required the state to expand the
so-called early warning system to be installed to track trooper
patrols with an eye toward detecting any troubling patterns, and to
implement the system within six months.
</P>
<P>
   The order also mandated the reports on the highway stops to be
made public every six months.
</P>
<P>
   Many reforms, including a revision of State Police protocols and
new diversity training for all troopers, were ordered before the
consent decree, Zoubek said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that training has been done personally by Col. Carson
Dunbar, the trooper's superintendent, Zoubek said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year two reports from the state attorney general documented
the practice of racial profiling of motorists and of racial
discrimination within the State Police ranks. Promised improvements
included new training and a new system for civilian complaints.

<HEADLINE> Two Convicted in Huge Bank Failure  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) -- Two executives in one of the nation's
biggest bank failures were convicted Friday of obstructing a
federal investigation into how $515 million in assets vanished from
the only bank in a West Virginia coal town.
</P>
<P>
   Terry L. Church, former senior vice president of now-defunct
First National Bank of Keystone, and Michael H. Graham, a bank vice
president and director, were found guilty in a case that could cost
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as much as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Church was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two counts
of obstruction. Graham was convicted of one count of obstruction;
he was acquitted of conspiracy and had a second obstruction count
against him dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Church faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines at
sentencing on July 17. Graham faces five years and $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 95-year-old bank was closed Sept. 1 when federal regulators
concluded that as much as $515 million in assets had disappeared.
The FDIC estimates that it could become one of the 10 largest U.S.
bank failures since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Church, 47, had testified the loss was a bookkeeping error.
</P>
<P>
   She and Graham, 50, were accused of burying bank records on
Church's ranch near Keystone, disabling a microfilm machine to
prevent examiners from viewing records, and providing false
information about record-keeping practices.
</P>
<P>
   Church was found guilty of all the allegations. However, Graham
was acquitted of conspiring with her, and one of the obstruction
charges -- relating to documents hidden on Aug. 15 -- was dismissed.
The jury concluded Graham was guilty of obstruction for documents
buried on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached the verdict on the second day of deliberations
following a three-week trial. Both defendants were subdued as the
verdict was read, but they appeared upset outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not pleased with the count that I was convicted on,''
Graham said. ''I don't think it was correct. We will appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Church declined comment, but her lawyer, Charles Love, said she
would appeal. ''This is a first step on a long road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Susan Arnold declined to answer reporters' questions.

<HEADLINE> Navy Ships Head To Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Navy ships headed toward the Caribbean on
Friday in anticipation of an FBI-led operation to remove Puerto
Rican protesters from a bombing range on the island of Vieques,
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No military forces are to be used in the removal operation,
which is being planned by the Justice Department in collaboration
with the FBI and the Coast Guard. It could happen as early as
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious warships USS Bataan and USS Nashville were
picking up a contingent of about 1,000 Marines from Morehead City,
N.C., en route toward Puerto Rico. The two ships left their home
port of Norfolk, Va., on Thursday evening, officials said, and
could be in the vicinity of Vieques by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If the removal of the protesters goes forward, the Marines would
secure the perimeter of the bombing range after the protesters are
gone, government officials said, speaking on condition that they
not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials had no comment on the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, watching television and playing dominoes while
waiting on the Marines to show up, said they weren't afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ''A thousand Marines is nothing. They could put 10,000 Marines
in there and they wouldn't stop the protests. They can't stop it,''
said Pablo Hernandez, a 73-year-old Korean war veteran whose hat
sported a pin with the Puerto Rican flag saying ''Esta es mi
nacion'' (This is my nation).
</P>
<P>
   Added Luis Acevedo: ''If they take out 100 people, 200 people
will come. If they take out 200, 500 will come. We have much
support. They're not going to have enough room in the prisons for
all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based Pastors for Peace, a charity group, said
Friday it will send a delegation to Vieques on Saturday to set up
camp alongside a church-run tent camp of protesters. ''Our faith
calls us to civil disobedience,'' said its executive director, the
Rev. Lucius Walker Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In Vieques, Mayor Manuela Santiago exhorted protesters not to
resist arrest and to avoid violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want anybody in Vieques to receive any injury or blow
from resisting the forces that are going to dislodge them,'' she
said in an interview with WAPA radio.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan, Gov. Pedro Rossello refused comment. ''Ask the
Navy,'' he responded to reporters' repeated questions about a raid.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart was asked about
the possibility of a violent confrontation with the protesters, who
have camped out on the bombing range for a year to block the Navy's
use of it. They usually number only a couple of dozen but on
weekends their numbers swell to several dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart would say only that the White House expects Puerto Rico
to live up to its agreement to allow the Navy to resume using the
range. President Clinton made a deal with Puerto Rico on Jan. 31
that provided an extra $40 million in aid to Vieques, so long as
the protesters left and the Navy was allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached an agreement, now sometime ago, and I'm just
not going to speculate on, you know, any law enforcement aspect of
it,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal marshals and FBI agents are expected to launch the
removal operation next week, possibly as early as Monday, the
officials said. Puerto Rican police are to provide crowd control in
the vicinity of the range.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the several dozen protesters who are camped out on
the bombing range say they won't resist arrest, they do say other
demonstrators will replace them. Some promise to scatter into the
hills.
</P>
<P>
   They've occupied the range since April 19, 1999, when errant
bombs from a Marine Corps jet killed civilian guard David Sanes
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, shortly before the Bataan and Nashville got under
way, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said U.S. officials
were consulting with Puerto Rican authorities on the Vieques issue
but he would not comment further.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Wreckage Found in Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- American military officials
confirmed Friday that wreckage found in northwestern Bosnia is from
the F-16 piloted by U.S. Air Force Capt. Scott O'Grady when he was
shot down on June 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after O'Grady was shot down, U.S. Marines, braving
Serbian missiles and rebel guns, flew helicopters into hostile
territory and rescued the pilot who had remained in hiding after
being shot down.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by SFOR, the international Peace Stabilization
Force, said that members of a de-mining team had recently reported
the location of scattered wreckage of a military aircraft.
Following the report, SFOR dispatched a team to secure the site.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping officials said the wreckage was located between the
towns of Prijedor and Drvar in what is now Republika Srpska, the
Bosnian Serb half of postwar Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his rescue, O'Grady of Spokane, Wash., emerged
from a pine-covered forest with a pistol in his hand near the
location where his F-16C jet was shot down by a Serb missile.
</P>
<P>
   According to the statement released by SFOR in Sarajevo, the
crash site is densely thicketed and in a mountainous area of known
and suspected mine hazards.
</P>
<P>
   It said the survey team conducted a thorough search of the area,
discovering the main impact point and many pieces of the aircraft
spread over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   The survey team found several man-size pieces of the wing and
airframe, but most of the wreckage consisted of small metal
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   The 3{-year Bosnian war ended with the signing in December 1995
in Paris of a peace agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio, the town
after which the accord was named.

<HEADLINE> Uncle Sam Wants Your Census Form  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A decade ago, Leona Torres didn't fill out her
census form. This time around, she is a census ''enumerator,''
pounding the pavement -- and on doors -- to help anyone who hasn't
yet filled out and returned a census form.
</P>
<P>
   In some major cities, that's a tall order. While 65 percent of
households nationally mailed in their forms, only 59 percent of
Chicagoans and 58 percent of New Yorkers returned theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need better schools and better hospitals. We need a lot of
help with our parks,'' the 44-year-old mother of two tells
naysayers as she stands outside their doors in her predominantly
Hispanic, working-class neighborhood just southwest of downtown
Chicago. ''Think about your future and your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it is frequently people in neighborhoods like
these -- often poor, often minorities -- who are left out of the
count that authorities use for such things as budgeting for social
services and drawing up congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The very people who aren't counted are often the ones who need
the services most,'' says Don Davis, who is coordinating census
activities for Chicago Mayor Richard Daley.
</P>
<P>
   An enumerator's job can be a tough one, often requiring
detective work in neighborhoods not known for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nicodemus, a 57-year-old enumerator who also has a
security systems business, went to one address in a poor
Philadelphia neighborhood Wednesday and found a corner store gated
and locked, the apartment above apparently vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he learned from a passer-by that the owner of the
store had been shot and killed, and his son, who used to live
there, had closed up and left the area.
</P>
<P>
   There are challenges in rural areas, too.
</P>
<P>
   In North Dakota, census workers have encountered wary residents
and remote homes -- some without telephones -- on the state's four
Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hoovestol, Census Bureau office manager in Bismarck, N.D.,
said some workers have been ''up to their hubcaps in mud'' and have
had to walk three miles to get someone to pull them out.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say such extra efforts are crucial for an
accurate count. They estimate 12.5 percent of American Indians on
reservations were missed in 1990, making them the most undercounted
minority in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A key to a successful count is having enumerators canvas their
own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people know me or they've seen me walk my dog. It
helps a whole lot,'' says Sandra Limbrick, an enumerator who's
already helped several people, many of them elderly, fill out forms
in her neighborhood on the east side of Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The Census bureau also is also trying to hire enumerators who
speak other languages. It's a critical point in the area outside
Boston that census supervisor Francisco Dominguez oversees, where
more than 20 languages are spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a language barrier, face-to-face contact helps,
he said: Non-English speakers are ''more likely to respond to
somebody than to forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Census workers also try to ease any fears residents may have,
carrying with them forms that explain the bureau's strict
confidentiality policy. They're allowed to skip some questions,
including those about household income, if a person insists.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Trinidad, a 22-year-old Michigan State University
student who's taking the semester off to do census work in New York
City, says it's not usually fear or privacy concerns that keep
people from filling out their forms. More often, he says, it's
simple forgetfulness or lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''They threw it away or the April 15 deadline for returning it
had passed,'' said Trinidad, who makes $18.50 an hour -- among the
highest hourly rate for enumerators, many of whom will work well
into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The government still has enumerator jobs open. In Virginia,
4,200 enumerators began work Thursday, while 6,800 positions were
still waiting to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the most important job in the Census,'' says Christina
Flores, a team leader in one of the bureau's Chicago offices.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in School Explosions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Two students were charged Friday with
setting off two stink bombs whose fumes sent six people at a Navajo
Reservation high school to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman described Thursday's explosions as a prank,
though the school canceled classes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure this is a serious matter to the school,'' said Ed
Hall, an FBI spokesman in Phoenix. ''To me, it's more like a
prankster trying to cause problems more than somebody trying to
cause harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Tuba City High students, Rager G. Hudson and
Stewart R. Tracy Jr., were charged in Navajo Tribal Court with
aggravated battery, dangerous use of explosives, conspiracy and
endangering the welfare of a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the charges is a misdemeanor that carries up to a year
in prison, said Cathy Colbert, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI had said Friday that Hudson and Tracy would be charged
in federal court, but Colbert said federal and tribal authorities
agreed to charge them in tribal court first.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson and Tracy made the stink bombs by putting cleaning
chemicals and aluminum foil in a plastic bottle, Hall said. The
combination creates a gas that expands to crack the bottle and
causes a foul odor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson and Tracy told investigators they wanted to create a few
laughs and get out of school early but had no intention of harming
anyone, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Four students and two janitors were treated for minor eye and
throat irritation from the fumes, said Carinda Little, spokeswoman
for the Tuba City Medical Center. One boy was knocked unconscious
by the fumes but was responsive shortly after arriving at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson suffered minor burns, Hall said, but neither he nor
Little knew whether Hudson was considered one of the six injured.
</P>
<P>
   There was no listing for Hudson or Tracy in Tuba City. Colbert
said she did not know of an attorney for the students who could
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuba City is in the northwest corner of the 4.8-million acre
Navajo Reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Tobacco Region Has Big Harvest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba's western tobacco-growing region is
celebrating the biggest harvest since the collapse of the Soviet
Union set off a severe economic crisis, government media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party daily Granma said that the tobacco harvest
still under way in the western province of Pinar del Rio is
expected to yield about 53.2 million pounds of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The crop remains one of communist Cuba's primary sources of
badly needed hard currency, after tourism and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba exported 148 million cigars last year, of which 128 million
were hand-rolled. Western Europe is the largest market for Cuban
cigars -- accounting for 90 million cigars, or 65.5 percent of the
total.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Oil Pipeline  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia reached
agreement Friday on the legal framework for a 1,080-mile pipeline
to send Caspian Sea oil to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan without
going through Russia or Iran.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced the accord, which builds on an
initial agreement signed in Istanbul, Turkey, last Nov. 18.
''Today's achievement completes this work and brings the pipeline
project a critical step closer to fruition,'' the president said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next phase would be for companies in the United
States, Western Europe and Russia to work with Azerbaijan, Georgia,
Kazakhstan and Turkey to transform the legal documents into
commercial reality.
</P>
<P>
   The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, expected to cost $2.4 billion,
would carry oil from the rich fields of Azerbaijan through Georgia
to Ceyhan. The United States says the pipeline will help protect
global energy supplies by sending fuel through multiple routes
instead of a single chokepoint.
</P>
<P>
   Most Azerbaijani oil is exported through Russia. Much of the
Middle East's oil passes through the narrow Straits of Hormuz,
which separates Iran from the Arabian peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, the accord is intended to draw
the oil rich region closer to the United States and Europe and
reduce Russian influence in the newly independent Central Asian
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''By this action, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey have shown once
again their commitment to building regional cooperation, peaceful
relations and better lives for all their people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is committed to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline as a key part of our overall approach to Caspian energy
development,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to ensure access to world markets for the countries of
the region, while helping diversify sources of energy supply for
consumers in the United States and around the globe,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton witnessed the signing of the November agreement during a
visit to Istanbul for a meeting of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was the chief competitor for the U.S-backed deal and had
tried to persuade Azerbaijan to agree to a pipeline through Russia.
Iran had favored an oil swap deal in which Azerbaijani oil would be
sold in northern Iran and oil from fields in southern Iran would be
sold on Azerbaijan's behalf.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets 30 Years For Pyramid Scam  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Syracuse businessman who crafted the biggest
pyramid scam in history was sent to prison for 30 years Friday by a
judge who had offered to cut the sentence by 10 years if his wife
relinquished her assets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John S. Martin sentenced the businessman,
Patrick Bennett, to one of the largest white-collar prison terms in
history ''because of the defendant's failure to turn over all the
assets under his control.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Bennett, who was not in court, still lives on a 100-acre
horse farm and still controls a hotel. The family also retains an
interest in the Vernon Downs racetrack near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 47, was convicted last June on 42 counts including
securities fraud and laundering at least $1 billion as he cheated
about 10,000 investors of $700 million since 1990. Many of the
victims were elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband would have gotten a kick out of this,'' 84-year-old
Roslyn Levine said as she leaned on a cane after the sentencing.
''But unfortunately it killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine said her husband suffered a heart attack reviewing
paperwork relating to the $400,000 he lost.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was announced just after Bennett, wearing his blue
prison uniform, blasted the judge for giving him the unusual
ultimatum a month ago. Bennett said the judge wanted him to
acknowledge that all his assets, including the home where his wife
lives, resulted from fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took this as a threat,'' Bennett said. He said forcing a
defendant who continues to maintain his innocence that he committed
the fraud was ''illegal, unethical and un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Bennett used his company to entice investors
from 46 states into leases for office equipment that sometimes had
been bought with cash or did not exist. The company filed for
bankruptcy in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims lived in New Jersey, New York, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   The judge called the sentence appropriate, especially after
Bennett himself admitted on the witness stand that there was a
massive fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who are living in poverty see Mrs. Bennett on a horse
farm on assets derived from this fraud,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Bennett's ''obstinate fraudulent conduct alone''
would justify the 30-year sentence, especially since Bennett had
done nothing to relieve the massive damage to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Continued use of assets by Bennett's family is conduct
controlled by Bennett, he said. ''To do that is to continue that
fraud day after day after day,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the brief sentencing, several investors who
attended congratulated prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I celebrate. Thank you so much,'' said Walter Danz, 62,
of Long Beach, N.Y. as he shook the hand of Assistant U.S. Attorney
Patrick Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He said he lost $22,000, a significant part of his retirement
money from his years with the Department of Homeless Services for
the city of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather lose the money and see him get that extra 10 years
in prison,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the length of the sentence will hold up on appeal is
in question, lawyers on both sides concede.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. Pinnisi, lawyer for Bennett, said his client would
appeal.

<HEADLINE> Vicki Sue Robinson, 1970s disco diva, dies of cancer  </HEADLINE>
dthofons
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILTON, Conn. (AP) -- Vicki Sue Robinson, whose 1976 hit ''Turn
The Beat Around,'' was among the disco anthems of that dancing
decade, has died of cancer. She was 46.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson died at her home in Wilton on Thursday. Her husband of
10 years, Bill Good, was at her side, said publicist Faith Fusillo.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a talented person. She also was a very, very decent
person,'' Fusillo said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fusillo said Robinson had been ill for several months with a
variety of cancer that eventually spread to her lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was born in Harlem to interracial parents, who were
both performers. Her father, Bill Robinson, who was black, was a
Shakespearean actor. Her mother, Marian, a white folk singer,
performed under the name Jolly Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Sue Robinson's influences ranged from the blues of Dinah
Washington to the folk stylings of Pete Seeger. She made her
singing debut at age 6 with her mother at the Philadelphia Folk
Festival. As a teen-ager, she appeared on Broadway in ''Hair'' and
''Jesus Christ Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   When she hit the recording studio, she struck gold with ''Turn
The Beat Around,'' one of the biggest hits of the disco era. She
was nominated for a Grammy Award for best female vocalist and
earned a Billboard Award for the No. 1 pop album.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson joined in a disco revival in the last few years,
touring with K.C. and the Sunshine Band, The Village People and
Gloria Gaynor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all pretty devastated,'' said Felipe Rose, who plays the
Indian in the Village People. ''It's not just her talent and her
voice and her being a pioneer of disco, but when we saw her she was
always up, always bubbly, always there for other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson returned to the stage last year, starring in the
off-Broadway musical, ''Behind The Beat.'' Illness forced her to
leave the show in April 1999, said Fusillo.
</P>
<P>
   She also lent her voice to several jingles in television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   She performed benefit concerts for a number of charitable
causes, including Broadway Cares/Equity Fights, AIDS, the homeless
and the Gay Men's Health Crisis. She also participated in a
mentoring program for children in Connecticut schools.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband and mother. Her father died when
she was 19.
</P>
<P>
   A private memorial service will be held May 4 at the Unitarian
Church in Westport.

<HEADLINE> Upbeat NY Mayor Hits Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buoyed by New Yorkers' get-well wishes, an
upbeat Mayor Rudolph Giuliani returned to City Hall and the Senate
campaign trail Friday, a day after revealing he has prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A Long Island congressman who has had designs on the race said
he had telephoned Giuliani to say he wouldn't challenge him.
Giuliani's campaign said the mayor's Senate bid was proceeding
''full speed ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to an evening event in Saratoga, Giuliani
appeared on a TV talk show and attended a public hearing as members
of his camp put a positive spin on the prospects for his Senate
race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief news conference, Giuliani offered his thanks to
everyone who had offered him support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of New York City sort of have a reputation for
being sort of tough and have a reputation for being kind of
cynical,'' he said. ''But the reality is that they are the most
generous and the most loving in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance on CBS' ''Early Show,'' Giuliani said his
campaign schedule would be ''a little lighter. I'll eliminate half
the events, or something like that.'' A campaign spokeswoman later
said the mayor expected the downturn to last for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Rick Lazio said he had telephoned the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him that if he were a candidate for the Senate I would
not run, I would not challenge him,'' Lazio said. He said he called
the mayor because he did not want Giuliani's political concerns to
interfere with his health. Lazio refused to say what he would do if
the mayor bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had been gearing up last year to run for the Senate seat
being vacated by retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and had
raised a little over $3 million before Gov. George Pataki asked him
to step aside. Lazio suspended his bid but refused to officially
end it.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover-Weiss said Friday
that ''the mayor was appreciative'' of Lazio's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the campaign's moving full steam ahead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who phoned her get-well wishes to Giuliani on Thursday,
was back in Washington on Friday, unveiling a study showing that
children who spend their early years in quality day care are less
likely to be arrested down the road.

U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the largest trust-busting move since AT&AMP;T, the
government asked a federal court today to break software giant Microsoft into
two companies. If accepted by a federal judge, the proposal would bar Microsoft
officers and directors, including billionaire co-founder Bill Gates, from owning
stock in more than one of the new companies. Under the government proposal,
Microsoft would be split into rival companies. One would produce its Windows
operating software, the other company would handle other software applications,
such as word processing, spreadsheet and database programs.

remarks about torture, Hanoi accused the United States of ''horrendous crimes.''
McCain is in Vietnam to mark the 25th anniversary of the war's end and to help
boost U.S. ties with its former enemy. But that has not kept the former Navy
pilot from sharply criticizing the communist government's conduct in the war,
during which he was shot down and spent 5{ years in a Vietnamese prison.

Jed Rakoff was the first significant ruling challenging the San Diego-based
company, which offers a service intended to let users listen to music on the
MP3.com Web site from CDs they already own. Other lawsuits nationwide seek to
help define the rules of how music will be played on the Internet, a venue that

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met Friday with Preston
King, the Georgia man he pardoned for draft evasion 39 years after
King fled to England.
</P>
<P>
   King, a political science professor at Lancaster University in
England, came to the White House and sat in on Clinton's taping of
his weekly radio address. He told reporters later that he expressed
his appreciation to Clinton for pardoning him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was delighted to go in and meet with him,'' King said. ''I
don't want to comment further on it, simply to say that I'm
grateful that this has been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   King, 63, says he fled his hometown of Albany, Ga., in 1961
after his local draft board addressed him as ''Mr. Preston King''
before learning he was black and ''Preston'' after that. He was
given an 18-month sentence for draft evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pardoned King in February so he could return home for
the funeral of his brother, Clennon.

raid at the home of Elian's Miami relatives. He has said he didn't
want to tip off the mayor, who unlike O'Brien is Cuban-American and
had openly sided with the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's emotional resignation came less than 18 hours after
Carollo fired the city manager, Donald Warshaw, during a heated
hearing at which dozens of residents said police abused them while
they protested the raid.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien and Warshaw said their pending departures would not
affect the city's ability to ensure that a massive Elian protest on
Saturday would be safe and orderly. But the departure of the city's
two top professional managers leaves Miami once again in political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in very sad and trying times in the city of Miami,''
said city commissioner Johnny Winton.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo wanted Warshaw to fire the police chief, because in
Miami, only the city manager can fire department heads. When he
refused, Carollo fired Warshaw, but the mayor maintains his
decision had nothing to do with the raid. He claimed Warshaw had
been turning other officials against him.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Brien announced his resignation at the Miami Police
Department, scores of officers cheered and applauded. Some cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to know again who gave the order and who was
responsible, I want to say again, I gave the order and I am the one
who is responsible,'' said O'Brien, a 25-year Miami police veteran
and Vietnam-era fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   James Goldman, the Immigration and Naturalization Service agent
who led Saturday's raid, called O'Brien a ''hero of this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He did what we asked him to do -- to maintain operational
security, not to reveal the nature of the search warrant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, 56, said he will remain on the job until another chief
is named by Warshaw, which could happen as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said O'Brien's resignation was orchestrated by Warshaw
in order to save his city manager's job.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was made into the sacrificial lamb to resign,'' Carollo
said. ''He was sacrificed by Mr. Warshaw so that by doing this, Mr.
Warshaw is saving himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw said he wouldn't lobby to regain his job. ''There are no
deals being made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city commission has voted to create a committee to
investigate police involvement in the seizure of Elian and any
police brutality that occurred during the protests. More than 300
people were arrested and tear gas was used to disperse crowds after
the boy was seized.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, found adrift on an inner tube Thanksgiving Day after his
mother and 10 other Cubans drowned, was reunited with his father
after the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old boy must remain in the United States until a
federal appeals court rules on the Miami relatives' bid for him to
have an asylum hearing. For now Elian is living at the rural Wye
River retreat in Maryland with his father, stepmother and half
brother.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined Thursday by four of Elian's schoolmates from
his hometown of Cardenas, four of their parents and Elian's doctor.
Cuban diplomatic officials were being allowed to join the group
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court this week rejected the Miami relatives'
request to visit the boy and also ruled that Elian's father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, may intervene in the appeal. Such a move would
allow the father to drop the case. Arguments in the case are
scheduled for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed a hearing
scheduled for Wednesday to examine the legal implications of the
raid. The Justice Department said it needed more time to supply
documents. Critics have called such a hearing a political attack on
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The political infighting in Miami comes after several other
civic controversies.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo became mayor after a fraud-ridden 1997 election that
resulted in the apparent victor, Xavier Suarez, being forced from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo appointed Warshaw as city manager in 1998, after firing
Jose Garcia-Pedrosa three times. Garcia-Pedrosa, now one of the
lawyers representing Elian's Miami relatives, was reinstated all
three times by the commission, but chose to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Corey, a political science professor at the University of
Miami, said the latest squabble ''makes Miami the laughingstock of
the United States. It confirms the image of a banana republic.''

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Won't Budge on U.S. Inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Friday he
would not change his long-standing position that an American woman
jailed for terrorism serve out her life sentence in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who is running for a third term in an upcoming runoff
election, said his government would not budge from its strict
policy on leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason when we have received congressmen or
representatives from the American government in the case of Lori
Berenson it was not accepted that she be transferred to the United
States to serve out her sentence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori did not specify what requests he was referring to. The
U.S. State Department has consistently urged Peru to grant Berenson
a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson, who went on a two-week hunger strike earlier this year
to protest prison conditions, has maintained her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   A hooded military judge convicted the 30-year-old New York
native of treason on Jan. 11, 1996, for helping to lead a thwarted
assault on Peru's Congress by leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson's fate turned into a campaign issue on Thursday when
presidential hopeful Alejandro Toledo said in New York that if
elected, a new trial for Berenson could be possible if evidence is
found that she was denied due process.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson would not be granted special status because she is from
the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo on Friday clarified his position during a speech in
Washington after pro-government media in Peru reported that he had
pledged to give Berenson a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   He said his government would not take action on Berenson's case
but that if a new, independent judiciary decided a new trial was
warranted, his government would not interfere.

<HEADLINE> Sweatshop Watchdogs Urge Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) -- Universities in the Worker Rights
Consortium said Friday that the new watchdog group must be willing
to work with manufacturers to improve conditions at overseas
factories where collegiate apparel is made.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from 37 schools met at the Big Ten Conference
headquarters and agreed the watchdog group should give universities
more than three seats on its 12-member governing board, and should
find ways to cooperate with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't engage them, if we don't pull industry into this
conversation, then we are just talking to ourselves and
accomplishing nothing,'' said Larry Mann, associate chancellor of
the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Labor practices at factories under contract to shoe and
sportswear makers have come under criticism from several
universities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The WRC is meeting resistance from corporations such as Nike,
which has vowed not to permit surprise inspections desired by the
WRC's student founders. Nike also has dropped out of contracts with
two schools that joined the WRC.
</P>
<P>
   University officials at Friday's meeting said they are not
pushing to give manufacturers seats on the governing board. But
consensus is building to give industry leaders a chance to be
partners in the effort -- instead of adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The students have made it clear they don't want industry
representation on the board, but we have to decide what's an
acceptable alternative,'' said Melany Newby, vice chancellor at the
University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin joined the WRC after student protests. The school
withdrew from another monitoring group, the Fair Labor Association,
which activists criticized because its board includes heavy
representation from apparel-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Vada Manager said contract disputes that ended
deals with the University of Michigan and Brown University are
related to terms of the individual contracts -- not the schools'
decisions to join the WRC.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nike Chairman Phil Knight withdrew plans to donate
$30 million to his alma mater, the University of Oregon, after that
school joined the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Among Nike's problems with the WRC is a demand for companies to
provide workers an undefined ''living wage'' and calls for surprise
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''They seem to have set up a system of 'gotcha' monitoring,''
Manager said. Nike prefers the cooperative attitude of the Fair
Labor Association, which ''sits down with the companies to talk
about issues and rectify problems together.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Roeper, a former student activist at Haverford College who
is now the coordinator of the New York-based WRC, said students
behind the movement are viewed as combative because they started
the effort with protests and sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   She said while students would likely oppose any industry seats
on the board, she doubts students would oppose the position that
several university officials repeated during Friday's meeting --
''engaging the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it doesn't make sense though for Company X to be
involved in investigating themselves,'' Roeper said.
</P>
<P>
   Roeper said the ''real news'' of Friday's meeting was how many
schools sent representatives -- a sign they are serious about the
WRC's mission.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Pinochet Too Ill for Trial  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A lawyer for Gen. Augusto Pinochet said
Friday the ex-dictator is too ill to stand trial and isn't even
aware of the human rights charges he might have to face.
</P>
<P>
   ''The health condition of Gen. Pinochet does not allow a fair
trial for him,'' lawyer Ricardo Rivadeneira told the Santiago Court
of Appeals, which is deliberating whether the former dictator must
be stripped of his immunity and put on trial for scores of killings
that occurred after his bloody 1973 coup against Chile's elected
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doctors do not allow him any contact with his lawyers and I
myself have not been able to talk to him,'' Rivadeneira said in the
second day of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberation has focused on actions of the ''caravan of
death,'' a group of military officers who visited many of the
nation's jails conducting about 75 executions of political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecution lawyer, Carmen Hertz, asked the court to allow the
trial of Pinochet. Under Chile's constitution, the former dictator
holds the title of ''senator for life,'' which exempts him from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   So far, seven lawyers for the plaintiffs have addressed the 22
judges of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer supporting a trial, Juan Bustos, said the abuses
by Pinochet's 1973-90 regime were ''crimes against mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira made a long legal statement but he emphasized
Pinochet's deteriorated health as a reason to suspend the legal
action against him.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Pinochet was released from a 16-month confinement
in London and allowed to return home after British doctors said he
was mentally and physically unfit to stand trial anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira admitted that Chile's law is different and it only
exempts from penal responsibility those who are diagnosed with
madness or dementia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not saying that Gen. Panoche is mad or demented, but
doctors have not allowed him to be informed of the situation,'' he
added. ''Under these conditions, no fair trial is possible as he
cannot defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivadeneira renewed the request to have the court order medical
tests before allowing the hearings on immunity to continue.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan To Repay Part of IMF Loans  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pakistan has agreed to repay $55 million it
borrowed from the International Monetary Fund last year to resolve
an investigation into allegations the country lied about its fiscal
situation in order to obtain the loans, the agency said late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Aninat, an IMF deputy managing director, said in a
statement that the Pakistan will repay the loan by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan revealed in early April that the government of former
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had understated its budget deficits to
the IMF in order to continue qualifying for IMF support.
</P>
<P>
   Aninat said that the true figures showed that Pakistan's budget
deficit was 7.5 percent of the country's total gross domestic
product for the 1997-98 period, 2 percentage points higher than
initially claimed.
</P>
<P>
   He said IMF officials viewed the misleading budget data with
''serious concern.'' It was the third recent case in which the IMF
has found that member countries had misled the agency in order to
obtain loans. The other cases involved Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF said it was pleased that the discrepancies were
brought to light by the current government. Gen. Pervez Musharraf
took over Pakistan's government in a coup last October.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf cited Pakistan's economic turmoil as a key reason for
the coup. The military regime has promised to work for resumption
of IMF loans as a way to revive the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Observing that the discrepancies in the fiscal data had been
discovered by the current authorities themselves and had
immediately been brought to the attention of the IMF staff, (IMF)
directors commended the current authorities for their prompt and
full cooperation with the staff in the data revision process,''
Aninat said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said it believed the government had taken the proper
''remedial action'' with the offer to repay $55 million of the
loans the IMF had extended to the country based on the inaccurate
data.
</P>
<P>
   The 182-nation lending agency said it hoped to send an IMF
mission to Pakistan ''in the near future'' to begin discussions on
resuming IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF in 1998 awarded Pakistan a $1.6 billion emergency loan
package, to be released in installments, to help the country deal
with a severe financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That loan program was suspended last year while Sharif was still
in power because of an IMF finding that his administration was not
moving quickly enough to implement promised economic reforms. The
IMF loan conditions included broadening the tax base as a way to
increase revenues to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign aid
and loans, was pushed to the brink of default on $32 billion in
foreign debt in 1998 when Western countries imposed sanctions to
punish the country for nuclear tests it conducted in May 1998 in
response to nuclear tests by neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
   The United States later eased sanctions it had imposed on both
countries, paving the way for the IMF bailout package for Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Voters Nix Altered Crops at Kellogg  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. shareholders
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to force the cereal maker to
stop using genetically altered crops, despite claims from two
groups of nuns that the crops are unsafe and put the company at
risk for lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it might be something in the future, but right
now it's not an issue,'' said Tom Fisher, a retired Kellogg
employee and shareholder who was among the 94 percent voting
against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is in the process of removing genetically altered
ingredients from its products in Europe and Australia, where there
has been increasing consumer backlash over the safety over
genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has declined to do the same in North America,
citing a lack of consumer interest and insufficient scientific
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we thought there was anything ... that even hinted at these
products being unsafe, we would have taken them our of our food a
long time ago,'' chief executive Carlos Gutierrez told shareholders
at Friday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Judy Schroeder of Sisters of St. Joseph called the vote a
victory that their voices were heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have an obligation to future generations to not
harm the very fragile balance of the ecosystem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace activists who want Kellogg to adopt a commitment not
to use genetically altered products have also picketed the company
twice in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg isn't alone in facing biotech critics. A number of other
food and beverage companies are being targeted with similar
anti-biotech proposals, including General Mills, Quaker Oats and
Sara Lee. Coca-Cola's shareholders rejected a similar proposal last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gordon Judd, a spokesman for the Kellogg proposal, told
Kellogg shareholders the company's use of genetically altered crops
could affect more than the company's products -- it could affect
it's bottom line by exposing it to lawsuits and potential damage to
its market share and stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez told shareholders Friday that he is concerned about
the company's declining stock price, though he doesn't attribute it
to the use of genetically altered crops.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company is taking steps to build its business: In
the last year, Kellogg has sold its frozen bagel business, shut
down its oldest Corn Flake facility and acquired a vegetarian
foods-maker; there are also new cereals, including a soy-protein
mix, and convenience foods, which Gutierrez predicts will continue
to grow in importance for the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made really good progress,'' he said. ''But there's
still a lot to do.''

Despite Plan, Microsoft May Still Dominate

<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Even if Microsoft is broken up, its products might continue
to dominate the market, even if they come from separate companies. Under a plan
submitted to a federal judge by the Justice Department and 17 states, Microsoft
would be divided into one company that would produce the Windows operating
system and another that would make software programs such as the Microsoft
Office suite of spreadsheet, word processing and other business applications.
The immediate impact of the remedies could come within months as computer
makers, no longer required to adhere to Microsoft's previous business practices,
begin making custom alterations to the way Windows is presented to the customer.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- A day after the Miami mayor fired the city manager, the police
chief resigned today amid the Elian Gonzalez furor. Stepping down, Police Chief
William O'Brien lashed out at Mayor Joe Carollo, who had criticized him for
failing to notify the mayor about the federal raid to seize the 6-year-old Cuban
refugee. "I refuse to be the chief of police in a city that has someone as
divisive and destructive as Joe Carollo as mayor," O'Brien said. O'Brien said he
didn't want to tip off the mayor to the Elian raid because the mayor is
Cuban-American and had openly sided with the Miami relatives.

	   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several Pittsburgh
communities today, killing five people and critically wounding a sixth in what
police called a racially motivated shooting spree. The man was taken into
custody. The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span this afternoon. The gunman
fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian grocery store, two
employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a martial arts school. A
Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's relatives was found dead in
her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, was jailed in Center Township

Uncle Sam Wants Your Census Form

<HEADLINE> Israel's Potential in UN Gets Boost  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The European Union has circulated its
terms for Israel's admission into a U.N. grouping of mostly
European countries -- a key step in efforts to boost Israel's
participation at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the terms, which were obtained Thursday, it
could still be years before Israel is allowed to sit on any U.N.
committees, such as the powerful Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is the only U.N. member state that isn't part of a
regional group, which prevents it from being nominated for
committee membership.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Israel has been lobbying the Western European and
Others Group for admission because it faced such political
opposition from what would be its natural regional group of Middle
Eastern and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   While backed by the United States in its campaign, Israel ran
into opposition from several European countries. Earlier this year,
however, Spain reversed its opposition and decided to back Israel's
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Several EU committees then followed suit, leading to a final set
of terms from the EU that was formally presented to the rest of the
so-called WEOG group at U.N. headquarters on Tuesday, western
diplomats said, speaking on conditions of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of the terms, the EU said it accepts
Israel's temporary membership of the WEOG group in New York, which
includes western European countries, Canada, the United States,
Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The terms say Israel couldn't seek nomination for any committee
for two years, and that it couldn't upset the rotation schedule for
committees that has already been worked out among the existing
members. That could prevent Israel from sitting on the Security
Council for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Calls seeking comment from the Israeli mission were unsuccessful
Thursday. The mission is closed for the Passover holidays.

<HEADLINE> Form Black Panther's Settlement OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday approved the $4.5
million settlement of a civil rights lawsuit by former Black
Panther Geronimo Pratt, who spent 25 years in prison before his
murder conviction was overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both the city of Los Angeles and the federal government
stepped up to the plate and reached a fair settlement,'' said
attorney Johnnie Cochran, who represented Pratt during nearly 30
years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 53, was convicted in 1972 of robbing and shooting to
death schoolteacher Caroline Olsen on a Santa Monica tennis court
in 1968. The conviction was overturned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt always maintained he was framed by a government informant
because of his activities with the Black Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement approved by U.S. District Judge Christina
Snyder, the city will pay $2.75 million, which must be approved by
the city council, and the FBI will pay $1.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, lives in his hometown of
Morgan City, La., where he uses the name Geronimo ji Jaga.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a case about money,'' Cochran said. ''Geronimo was
never interested in things like money. He's interested in
justice.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tucker Carlson, a reporter for the
conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and a CNN political
commentator, was detained briefly by Vietnamese authorities in Ho
Chi Minh City, who questioned his travel documents, a spokeswoman
for the magazine said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, 30, was part of a group of reporters covering the
Vietnam visit of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of
war for over five years. When Carlson attempted to board a plane
back to the United States on Friday, Vietnamese officials accused
him of being in their country illegally because he lacked a proper
exit visa.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said Friday night that Vietnamese
authorities had told them Carlson was free to leave the country as
soon as he arranged transportation. Carolyn Wimmer of the Weekly
Standard said the magazine had not been able to reach him.

<HEADLINE> Budget in turmoil over Adriaen's Landing impasse  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state budget was thrown into turmoil
Friday night when the Adriaen's Landing development plan hit an
impasse over labor issues and the project's main private backer
threatened to pull out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said the
agreement reached Thursday between Rowland and legislative leaders
on a $12.3 billion budget was in limbo because of the clash.
</P>
<P>
   The House had been expected to approve the budget Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The budget is not going forward tomorrow,'' Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani said the Rowland would not sign a declaration needed to
use the state's surplus as part of the budget. The surplus has been
woven into the budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and leading lawmakers had agreed that a bill to sink
$455 million into the Adriaen's Landing project would be OK'd
before the budget would be voted on, Pagani said. The project was
set for a vote Friday. Bur Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan postponed the debate when some senators insisted the
development package include a guarantee that workers in the planned
hotel would be allowed to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group -- the major investment group in the
Adriaen's Landing project-- planned to pull out of the deal if that
promise was made, Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Waterford Group will not be able to be a part of the
project,'' he said. ''And the result of that would be the collapse
of the (project).''
</P>
<P>
   The Adriaen's Landing plan includes a 700-room hotel, a
convention center, entertainment and retail space and nearly 400
housing units on Hartford's waterfront. Also part of the package is
a $90 million stadium in East Hartford for the University of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs
are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, which is under the
umbrella of the AFL-CIO, has been lobbying for the guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot support in my district a project where over $700
million will be poured in and people making beds and cleaning
toilets are making $6 and $7 an hour,'' said Sen. John Fonfara,
D-Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Pagani said the deal already allows the workers to unionize, and
said the AFL-CIO was jockeying to make sure they would be the only
union to represent the employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leadership is going back on its word,'' he said.
''Everything was set to go until they caved into the AFL-CIO on
these unreasonable demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group, which has developed the Mohegan Sun casino
in Montville and operates hotels in Mystic, New London and Norwich,
has said it will spend $20 million to build the hotel at Adriaen's
Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Fonfara and labor advocates said the company pays its hotel
workers about $10,000 a year less than the Goodwin Hotel in
Hartford and the Hartford Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly must decide whether to sink about $455
million of public money into the project, which will cost more than
$771 million. The public funding portion of the project is
contingent on a commitment of $210 million in private financing.
Gov. John G. Rowland has said that threshold has been met.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan said Democrats were
divided over promising union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a basic concern that permeates the entire caucus about
the quality of jobs that will come with this project,'' said
Sullivan, D-West Hartford. ''There's a wide diversity of opinion as
to how best to come to that outcome and not sacrifice the
opportunity to get the jobs in the first place. At some point
there's either no jobs, or these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he would vote for the spending plan without union
guarantees for the hotel workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people who live in Hartford are not getting good paying
jobs, what's the point of this whole project,'' said Sen. Edith
Prague, D-Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen said both sides will have
to budge in order to save the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're at a classic impasse,'' said Jepsen, D-Stamford. ''I
wish the Wolmans would give in a little more, and I wish the unions
would give a little more flexibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans blamed Democrats for holding up the project,
which has been a major cause for Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans have always been accused of being insensitive to
the big cities,'' said Sen. Louis DeLuca, R-Woodbury. ''Here we
have a project that the governor wants to do for a city,
Republicans are ready and willing to support the governor to help
Hartford. The Democrats seem to have a problem with that.''

<HEADLINE> Visitation Set in Switched Baby Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- The biological mother of one of two
little girls switched at birth and sent home with the wrong
families was granted monthly visitation rights with her natural
daughter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A court last month approved a custody agreement that leaves
4-year-olds Callie Conley and Rebecca Chittum with the families who
raised them and grants their biological relatives visitation
rights.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Judge John Curry II
set a regular schedule for Paula Johnson, who has been raising
Callie, to see her natural daughter, Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge's schedule, Johnson will have Rebecca at
least one weekend per month and visitation during holidays will be
divided, said Mike Groot, an attorney for Rebecca's guardians,
Larry and Rosa Chittum.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also granted a visitation request by Rebecca's
biological father, Carlton Conley, but did not set a schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Callie and Rebecca were sent home with the wrong families
shortly after their births at the University of Virginia Medical
Center in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson learned of the mistake three years later when she sued
Conley for child support. The couple raising Rebecca, Whitney
Rogers and Kevin Chittum, died in a car crash before they learned
the truth. Their parents are now raising Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   Groot said he was pleased with the judge's decisions, adding,
''The Chittums are committed to doing what's best for Rebecca.''

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israel Militiamen Die in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Guerrillas detonated a car bomb near an
outpost of a pro-Israeli militia Friday, killing three militiamen
in an attack that heightened tension in the run-up to Israel's
planned withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said one militiaman
was killed and four others wounded, three seriously, and two other
militiamen were buried under the rubble of the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the SLA said the corpses of the two militiamen had
been recovered from the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   One guerrilla was killed in the attacks, Hezbollah said in a
statement issued in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle blast was one of several attacks by the Hezbollah
guerrillas on military positions in the Israeli-occupied zone,
Lebanese and Israeli security officials said. One soldier was flown
to Israel for treatment of wounds sustained in an attack, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel retaliated with a series of airstrikes on suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said there were seven air raids; Israeli
officials said there were four. The difference is thought to be
explained by warplanes hitting several targets on a single mission.
</P>
<P>
   The upsurge in hostilities came after a week of diplomatic
efforts aimed at smoothing Israel's expected July 7 troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In the bomb attack, the guerrillas, backed by rocket and machine
gun fire, drove a vehicle up to a position of the South Lebanon
Army militia in Aramta. The guerrillas detonated the vehicle's
explosives as they retreated, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said one militiaman
was killed and four others wounded, three seriously, and two other
militiamen were buried under the rubble of the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said its fighters teamed up with
another allied group, the Lebanese Resistance Brigades, to storm
the Aramta position and plant explosives. It did not refer to the
car bomb.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Davis Attends Practice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos opened their three-day
mini-camp late Friday morning. Terrell Davis made a
much-anticipated entrance 90 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   It was the running back's first practice since undergoing major
knee surgery in October.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt nervous today and a lot of things went through my mind
when I was out there practicing,'' the six-year veteran said. ''But
once I got out there, I said I wasn't going to think about it, just
practice. I got a little fatigued toward the end, but it still felt
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Davis became only the fourth player in NFL history to
rush for 2,000 yards in a season. His 1999 season ended when he
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the fourth
game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was trying to tackle Victor Green of the New York Jets and
was injured when teammate Matt Lepsis crashed into his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a major goal for me, to come out and at least try and
test it out,'' said Davis who gained 211 yards on 67 carries last
season.
</P>
<P>
   He said his goal Friday was ''to come back and at least get
bumped around, get hit and see how it responded and it responded
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis warmed up with the team then joined the rest of the
running backs and wide receivers in a leisurely passing drill where
the first pass thrown his way, a 10-yarder over the middle from
rookie Jarious Jackson, sailed 10 yards beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the backs ran routine running plays that required tight,
quick cutback moves. Davis said he ran pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went well and the way I wanted it to be,'' Davis
said. ''If I am out there, I might as well put myself through some
game-type situations rather than babying the knee, which wouldn't
do anything for me.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just a test and I told myself that I was going to
take strides and the steps necessary in trying to come back and
this was just another major step that I took.''
</P>
<P>
   On one play, linebacker Bill Romanowski knocked Davis off his
feet. Davis bounced right up and exchanged comments with Romanowksi
before returning to the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's good. I didn't mind that,'' Davis said. ''I was a
little ticked off, but I had to keep my composure.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis added that he has decided not to wear a protective knee
brace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made up my mind a long time ago that I didn't plan on
wearing a brace at all,'' Davis said. ''It restricts you from doing
things. It reminds you of the injury.''

Appeal Court Upholds Senator Eric Berntson's Fraud Conviction
<TEXT>
<P>
   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Senator Eric Berntson's fraud
conviction and one-year jail sentence have been upheld by
Saskatchewan's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The split decision was released Friday by the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Berntson, 58, was found guilty in March 1999 of defrauding
Saskatchewan taxpayers when he was deputy premier in the
Conservative government of Grant Devine.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to a year in jail and ordered to pay back the
$42,000 in false claims he made on government expense allowances
from 1987 to 1990.

Federal AIDS-Prevention Pamphlet Condoning Injection Drugs Sparks
Debate
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal Health Department has sparked sharp
debate with a health pamphlet that appears to endorse injection
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because we've made the choice that we don't want AIDS
doesn't mean the party's over,'' says the AIDS-prevention pamphlet,
which is being distributed at health clinics, schools and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can still fool around with sex and have a great time. Still
shoot up if that's what we're into.''
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet, which carries the logos of Health Canada and the
Canadian AIDS Society, provides detailed instructions for having
safe sex and cleaning needles.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Papadopoulos, executive director of the Toronto-based
Association of Local Public Health Agencies, said he was startled
by the wording of the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   A Health Canada spokesman said the pamphlet doesn't condone such
behavior
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simply acknowledging it does occur,'' said Michael
Jacino, marketing adviser to the Canadian Strategy on HIV-AIDS at
Health Canada.
Fishermen Want Lobsters, Not Trouble, as Spring Season Opens
</P>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- Fishermen in northern New
Brunswick say they'll be looking for lobsters, not trouble, when
they set their traps today in Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster fishery opens in various parts of the Maritimes this
morning, but most of the attention will be focused on the Burnt
Church area on New Brunswick's northeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Native and non-native fishermen clashed here last fall after
members of the Burnt Church First Nation took advantage of a
Supreme Court of Canada decision that said the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet
people have a treaty right to earn a moderate living from fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Burnt Church reserve has turned down a deal from Ottawa for
an interim fisheries agreement that would impose federal
regulations in return for financial and training incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of an agreement, there's a feeling in Burnt
Church that the spring season will go well and there won't be any
confrontations.
Klein Daughter Reported Assault To Get Her Addict Husband Behind
Bars
</P>
<P>
   DRUMHELLER, Alberta (AP) -- A daughter of Alberta Premier Ralph
Klein says she made up an assault complaint against her husband
because she thought jail might keep him away from crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Klein-Marcia, 36, received a conditional discharge Friday
on a mischief charge that stemmed from the assault complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial court Judge Gordon Clozza also ordered probation for
12 months, counseling and 100 hours of community service work. If
Klein-Marcia meets those conditions, she will have no criminal
record.
</P>
<P>
   Klein-Marcia sat silently in court while Crown prosecutor Sheila
Brown read from an agreed statement of facts in which the accused
said imprisonment might protect her husband from his cocaine
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The judge warned that false accusations can undermine progress
being made in getting women to report domestic abuse but said he
understood Klein-Marcia acted out of desperation.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore Talks to Gay Rights Group  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA SINDERBRAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tipper Gore told a gay rights advocacy group
Friday night that an administration headed by her husband would
''stand with you, and if necessary, fight with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to encourage all Americans to embrace gay and lesbian
children as their own and let them know they are loved, they are
respected, they are valued,'' said Mrs. Gore, wife of Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Mrs. Gore urged passage of the Hate Crimes
Prevention Act and the Employment Nondiscrimination Act now before
Congress. Both measures include protection against those targeted
because of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if elected ''my husband is committed to working
with you to explore how domestic partners can receive the legal and
economic benefits that other couples receive.''
</P>
<P>
   The line received hearty applause, though several audience
members noted that she stopped short of using the word
''marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Beeman, president of Parents, Families and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays, told Mrs. Gore that many in the audience
''realize that you're feeling a bit cramped in the home where you
live and might want to be making a move downtown soon.'' The
comment drew a standing ovation from the 900 or so people crammed
in the small hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The group is holding its annual convention in the Washington
area on the eve of this weekend's Millennium March for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''She'd make a great first lady,'' Sue Stewart, a PFLAG member
from Mountain View, Calif., said of Mrs. Gore. ''I'd vote for her --
I mean him.''

<HEADLINE> Stolen Chamberlain Ball Yields $500K  </HEADLINE>
By MARV SCHNEIDER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kerry Ryman was awakened from a sound sleep
Friday. His barber was calling to tell him the famed Wilt
Chamberlain basketball Ryman ran off with 38 years ago had been
sold at auction for $551,844.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the first I heard of it,'' Ryman said from his
apartment in Annville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Leland's auction house refused to say who bought the ball used
by Chamberlain when he scored an NBA record 100 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a well-known figure out of the sports world,'' Leland's
spokesman Marty Appel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryman, a 52-year-old crane operator, insisted he wasn't overly
interested to learn whether the ball had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The price exceeded the rosiest of estimates by about $400,000.
Only two other pieces of sports memorabilia have sold at auction
for more -- Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball for $3.05 million and
a 1910 Honus Wagner card for $640,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just glad to have the thing out my hands,'' Ryman said.
</P>
<P>
   The record game in Hershey, Pa., was played on March 2, 1962.
Ryman said he shook Chamberlain's hand, grabbed the ball and outran
an arena security guard, scaling a fence during his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something I'm proud of,'' Ryman said. ''I was 14 and
I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   As Annville and environs awakened to radio reports of his big
score, Ryman's phone rang constantly. Not all calls were answered.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't congratulate someone for something they should not
have done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was sold officially at 3 a.m., the time set by Leland's
for closing the first half of its two-day sale of some 1,500 sports
memorabilia items.
</P>
<P>
   The auction was conducted by phone, fax and e-mail, all coming
in to the company's office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Leland president Josh Evans had estimated the ball would go for
as much as $150,000. That figure was surpassed by midnight. By 1
a.m. the bidding was down to three serious contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was talk to one, put the others on hold, talk to another,
put the others on hold ... hold, talk, hold, talk,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   One bidder dropped out, then another, and finally one was left.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever did buy the ball has no worry about being caught with
stolen merchandise. Neither does Ryman. The statute of limitations
ran out in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain died last October, and when Ryman made off with the
ball, the 7-foot-1 center rejected an offer by a security guard who
wanted to go to Ryman's home to retrieve the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ryman will wind up with less than $500,000. Leland's will
receive a 15 percent commission that totals $82,650 plus a
negotiable seller's fee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel the need to try to radically change my life,''
said Ryman, who makes about $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am content with my job and my life. I would have given the
ball to charity but I would never have been able to make sure the
money was actually put to good use. Now, I have direct control of
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of it will go to charity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamberlain ball, by far, was the hit of the first day's
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams' uniform from 1941, when he batted .406, sold for
$120,097. A game-used Lou Gehrig cap went for $75,386.
</P>
<P>
   The ball that Mookie Wilson hit through Bill Buckner's legs in
Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, a part of actor Charlie Sheen's
collection, fetched $63,945. It was bought by Seth Swirsky, a
songwriter and author in Beverly Hills, Calif.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kris Benson limited Cincinnati to five hits in
eight innings as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Reds 2-1 on Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Benson (1-3) didn't allow a hit until Benito Santiago singled
with one out in the fifth. The right-hander struck out six and
walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams got the final two outs for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Brian Giles homered off Pete Harnisch (0-3) leading
off the second inning, the right fielder's fifth home run of the
season. Giles had hit just one homer in the last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch has given up six home runs in 25 innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Giles opened the fourth with a single as the Pirates loaded the
bases with nobody out, but managed just one run. Kevin Young
doubled and Wil Cordero was safe on third baseman Aaron Boone's
throwing error. Pat Meares drove in the run with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds scored in the eighth. Pokey Reese and Dmitri Young had
one-out singles to put runners on first and third, and Ken Griffey
Jr. had an RBI roundout.
</P>
<P>
   Benson pitched out of a jam came in the seventh when he walked
Bichette and gave up a single to Santiago. Boone grounded out and
pinch-hitter Michael Tucker hit into a double play
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have won three of the last four games.
Notes: The four-game series is part of the Reds' longest trip of
the season. They were 2-1 in New York, and will finish the trip
with three games in Philadelphia. ... The Reds have yet to win
three consecutive games this season. ... The Pirates started a
stretch of 10 consecutive games against NL Central opponents. ...
Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall was hitless in four at-bats, ending his
hitting streak at 12 games.

<HEADLINE> Tentative Deal in Janitors Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tentative contract agreement was reached Friday
night that could end a 10-day strike by 4,500 janitors who work at
suburban office buildings, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors will vote Monday on the proposal, details of which were
being withheld until the vote, said Ken Munz, spokesman for Local 1
of the Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Barry White, a spokesman for the Suburban Contractors
Association, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout began April 18 with 500 workers leaving their
cleaning jobs. The so-called rolling strike added a few hundred
workers at a time over the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers, making $6.65 an hour, were asking for raises and
employer-paid family health insurance. Their old pact expired April
9.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of no new negotiations, the union had threatened to
set up picket lines at downtown buildings, with city janitors
agreeing to honor the lines.
</P>
<P>
   In separate talks, 5,500 downtown janitors ratified a new
contract April 18 after staging a one-night walkout. And in Los
Angeles, thousands of striking janitors approved a new contract
April 24, ending a three-week walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities also face walkouts. A union local in San Diego is
on strike and contracts in Oakland, Calif.; Silicon Valley, Calif.;
Cleveland and Seattle will expire within the next few months.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Barry Ackerley, owner of the Seattle SuperSonics
for 17 seasons, underwent an unspecified cardiac procedure Friday
at a Seattle-area hospital.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Yankees 6, Blue Jays 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone proved there is still some life left
in his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Cone bounced back from a pounding in Toronto, holding the Blue
Jays to three hits in seven scoreless innings Friday night as the
New York Yankees won 6-0 for his first victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After Cone (1-2) allowed eight runs in three innings in an 8-2
loss to Toronto last Saturday, there were once again questions
about whether age and tens of thousands of pitches had finally
caught up to the 37-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Joe Torre said before the game he remained confident
in Cone, despite his 2-7 record and 5.98 ERA in 17 regular-season
starts since pitching a perfect game against Montreal last July 18.
</P>
<P>
   A slight adjustment in his delivery -- moving from the extreme
right of the pitching rubber to the left side -- appeared to pay off
for Cone, who lowered his ERA from 10.70 to 7.66.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays managed only five baserunners and only one made it
as far as second against Cone. The right-hander, known for his high
pitch counts, needed only 84 pitches to get through seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who scored only six runs in a three-game series
against Minnesota this week, scored four in the third off Kelvim
Escobar (2-3) with help from Toronto's shoddy defense.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer started the rally with an infield single. Escobar
and catcher Darren Fletcher hesitated to field the slow roller down
the first-base line and Fletcher then hit Spencer in the back with
his throw.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Chuck Knoblauch singled and Derek Jeter walked,
loading the bases. Paul O'Neill followed with a grounder to third
baseman Tony Battista, who misplayed the backhand for an error that
allowed the first run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams then hit a two-run double and Tino Martinez
added an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada, who homered from both sides of the plate Sunday in
Toronto, hit a solo shot in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar, who pitched a nine-hitter in Toronto's victory against
the Yankees last Saturday, allowed five runs -- three earned -- and
seven hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto's Raul Mondesi is hitless in his last 23 at-bats.
... Knoblauch returned to the lineup after missing three games with
a sprained left wrist. ... O'Neill also was back after leaving
Wednesday's game in the third inning because of blurred vision. ...
Toronto's Carlos Delgado went 1-for-3 with two strikeouts against
Cone, making him 3-for-32 with 16 strikeouts in his career against
the right-hander.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Sharks 0  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Sergei Zubov, whose absence the last month left
Dallas' power play sagging, assisted on two goals with a man
advantage Friday night as the Stars beat the San Jose Sharks 4-0 in
the opener of their second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose looked nothing like the team that eliminated top-seeded
St. Louis in the first round. Steve Shields allowed goals on two of
Dallas' first six shots, then gave up two more in a 1:55 span early
in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks took just four shots in the first period and failed
to get one off on their first three power plays. Stars goaltender
Ed Belfour stopped 18 shots overall for his ninth career postseason
shutout and second of these playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Sunday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came into the game just 2-for-26 on the power play
this postseason, but that was without Zubov, who usually runs the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   With him back following a knee injury, Dallas went 2-for-7 with
goals by Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk. The scores came on their
first and third tries.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov had a hand in the first one as he backhanded a shot into
Shields that caromed to Modano. He was wide open in front of the
net and swatted it in for a 2-0 lead with 5:59 left in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third goal this postseason and the 35th of his
playoff career, tying Steve Payne's franchise record. He has a
point in five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk made it 3-0 early in the third period when he fired a
backhanded shot past Shields on a tough angle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks have allowed 10 power-play goals in eight playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Gavey scored Dallas' first goal on the team's first shot.
He slid the puck under Shields after Kirk Muller stole it in the
San Jose zone. It was his first goal in 11 career playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Brenden Morrow got the fourth goal by getting a piece of a slap
shot by Derian Hatcher. Shields had a bead on the puck, but he
didn't get enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had a relatively easy night. There were few odd-man
rushes and his penalty-killing unit prevented him from seeing many
shots when San Jose had the man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   His best save was a sliding stop of hard-charging Owen Nolan in
the third period. But Nolan, who had five regular-season goals
against Dallas and was tied for the playoff lead with six goals,
spent more time getting up from hard hits than pressuring Belfour.

U.S. Urges Breakup of Microsoft
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government asked a federal court today to break
software giant Microsoft into two companies in the largest trust-busting move
since AT&AMP;T was carved into seven Baby Bells. If accepted by a federal judge, the
proposal would bar Microsoft officers and directors, including billionaire
co-founder Bill Gates, from owning stock in more than one of the new companies.
Under the government proposal, Microsoft would be split into rival companies.
One would produce its Windows operating software, the source of Microsoft's
monopoly power, according to a court filing.

   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- A white man opened fire in several Pittsburgh
communities today, killing five people and critically wounding a sixth in what
police called a racially motivated shooting spree. The man was taken into
custody. The shootings took place within a 20-mile range through suburbs
surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span this afternoon. The gunman
fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian grocery store, two
employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a martial arts school. A
Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's relatives was found dead in
her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, a lawyer, was charged with
criminal homicide and reckless endangerment. He was being held without bail.

INS Agent Defends Tactics of Elian Raid

   MIAMI (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who led the
raid to remove Elian Gonzalez defended the tactics today, saying force was
necessary given the presence of people who had ''vowed to prevent Elian's
recovery.'' ''This was the most challenging execution of a federal search
warrant,'' Agent James Goldman told The Associated Press. The agents worried
they'd be met by armed supporters of the Miami branch of the Gonzalez family.
Crowds had kept vigil outside the home, often swelling into the hundreds.
Federal investigators identified more than 20 people around the home as being
members of paramilitary groups, security companies, or ''individuals that had
vowed to prevent Elian's recovery by the federal government,'' Goldman said.

North Dakota that, while it believes biotechnology is important for agriculture

<HEADLINE> Execs Convicted in Bank Failure Case  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) -- Two executives in one of the nation's
biggest bank failures were convicted Friday of obstructing a
federal investigation into how $515 million in assets vanished from
the only bank in a West Virginia coal town.
</P>
<P>
   Terry L. Church, former senior vice president of now-defunct
First National Bank of Keystone, and Michael H. Graham, a bank vice
president and director, were found guilty in a case that could cost
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as much as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Church was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two counts
of obstruction. Graham was convicted of one count of obstruction;
he was acquitted of conspiracy and had a second obstruction count
against him dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Church faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines at
sentencing on July 17. Graham faces five years and $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 95-year-old bank was closed Sept. 1 when federal regulators
concluded that as much as $515 million in assets had disappeared.
The FDIC estimates that it could become one of the 10 largest U.S.
bank failures since the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Church, 47, had testified the loss was a bookkeeping error.
</P>
<P>
   She and Graham, 50, were accused of burying bank records on
Church's ranch near Keystone, disabling a microfilm machine to
prevent examiners from viewing records, and providing false
information about record-keeping practices.
</P>
<P>
   Church was found guilty of all the allegations. However, Graham
was acquitted of conspiring with her, and one of the obstruction
charges -- relating to documents hidden on Aug. 15 -- was dismissed.
The jury concluded Graham was guilty of obstruction for documents
buried on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached the verdict on the second day of deliberations
following a three-week trial. Both defendants were subdued as the
verdict was read, but they appeared upset outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not pleased with the count that I was convicted on,''
Graham said. ''I don't think it was correct. We will appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Church declined comment, but her lawyer, Charles Love, said she
would appeal. ''This is a first step on a long road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Susan Arnold said prosecutors ''are very pleased with
the verdict.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Serbs Convicted in Milosevic Plot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Six Serbs accused of plotting to kill
President Slobodan Milosevic were convicted of conspiracy and
terrorism Friday. Another defendant was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Boban Gajic, a soldier and the alleged ring leader of the
group that called itself the Serbian Liberation Army, and two other
defendants were sentenced to five years each.
</P>
<P>
   They were arrested in last December, months after Yugoslav
government troops pulled out of Serbia's southern Kosovo province
following NATO's air strikes. Some of the members had fought with
Serb forces battling ethnic Albanian insurgents in Kosovo last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier testimony, the defendants said they were deeply
unhappy with Milosevic's rule and territorial losses Serbia has
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   During the widely publicized trial, Gajic had told the court he
discussed the idea of toppling Milosevic with fellow officers and
with the other defendants, but maintained they were not a terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Two others received three-year prison terms and one was
sentenced to 1{ years. The seventh defendant was acquitted by the
military court in Nis, which ruled he was only remotely connected
with the group.

<HEADLINE> Monument Built to Railroad Builders  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUNK'S GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- With the lilting wail of traditional
Celtic music wafting through the trees, a monument was dedicated
Friday at the site of a mass grave where a group of mostly Irish
railroad laborers were buried some 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Local and national labor leaders attended the Workers Memorial
Day ceremony honoring the laborers, who died while laying a rail
line from Springfield to Bloomington in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Amtrak trains across the country blew their
whistles in tribute to the thousands of workers, mostly immigrants,
buried in unmarked graves across the continent who died while
building the nation's railroad system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Workers are what made this country; immigrants are who made
this great country,'' said Terence O'Sullivan, general president of
the Laborer's International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Funds for the $12,000 monument were raised through donations
from labor unions, Irish-American societies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Johnson, an Amtrak spokesman in Chicago, said the Workers
Memorial Day tribute was appropriate to current workers and as a
way to honor the anonymous thousands laid to rest beside the rails.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our trains still run on tracks that many of these people lost
their lives building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact story behind the 50 Irish workers buried at Funk's
Grove has been lost over time, but likely parallels that of others
who fled the potato famine in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, railroad workers lived in squalid camps along the
rails they were constructing. Malnourished and underpaid, many
arrived at the unsanitary ''shanty'' camps already weakened by
their voyage to this country.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matejka, a field representative for the North Central
Illinois Laborers' District Council, spent months reading
newspapers from 1851-1853 and poring over old records in
preparation for the dedication. He said period newspapers have many
accounts of large numbers of railroad workers dying during cholera
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, a marble Celtic cross, bears the same inscription
in English and Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   ''These immigrants from Ireland were driven from the land of
their birth by famine and disease,'' it reads in part. ''They
arrived sick and penniless, and took hard and dangerous jobs
building the Chicago &AMP; Alton Railroad. Known but to God, they rest
here in individual anonymity -- far from the old homes of their
hearts -- yet forever short of the new homes of their hopes.''

<HEADLINE> Upbeat Giuliani hits City Hall, campaign trail  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani told upstate voters Friday that he still ''wants to be
Senator'' but needs more time to make his decision in light of his
cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a senator because I was born in this state,
because I worked for the state,'' Giuliani told about 1000
supporters at a $50 a plate dinner in Saratoga Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was greeted with standing ovations and cheers at the
event hosted by the Saratoga County Women's Republican Club. It was
his first campaign appearance since he announced Thursday that he
was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief question and answer session before the event,
Giuliani said he ''needs a little more than a day and a half''
before he could make any decision on the race against the first
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I need the next week, 10 days, maybe two weeks, to figure out
the proper course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do that and than I'm going to make a decision and
whether I can or cannot campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who he would support if he decides not to run,
Giuliani said, ''I'm not going to get into that. I know who I don't
want to support.''
</P>
<P>
   During the speech, Giuliani told voters he's going to meet with
doctors in the upcoming weeks to determine a course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I'll be able to do that and run and give you the
kind of candidate you deserve.'' Giuliani said, drawing a round of
applause.
</P>
<P>
   While not mentioning his opponent by name, Giuliani again
attacked the Clinton administration in his speech, charging the
president's decision to bomb Iraq late in 1998 over Saddam
Hussein's weapons inspection was a ''Clintonian'' victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clintonian words do not mean what they say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, also at the event,
said he's ''confident that (Giuliani) will do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll have a lot of support,'' Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saratoga Springs, Giuliani appeared on a national morning
talk show and attended a public hearing as members of his camp put
a positive spin on the prospects for his U.S. Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief news conference, Giuliani offered his thanks to
everyone who had offered him support after his stunning
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of New York City sort of have a reputation for
being sort of tough and have a reputation for being kind of
cynical,'' he said. ''But the reality is that they are the most
generous and the most loving in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance on the CBS ''Early Show,'' Giuliani said his
campaign schedule would be ''a little lighter. I'll eliminate half
the events, or something like that.'' A campaign spokeswoman later
said the mayor expected the downturn to last for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first cancellations were two speeches before lawyers' groups
scheduled for Monday -- one in Syracuse, the other in Rochester --
commemorating Law Day. Both were originally set up as part of
Giuliani's mayoral duties, not his Senate campaign, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said the mayor needed time to
consult with physicians on the course of his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A Saturday appearance in Buffalo was still on.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers, in an Albany radio interview,
said that he had spoken with the mayor and was convinced that
Giuliani would press on.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll rise to the occasion,'' Powers said. Giuliani's campaign
also announced the start of a massive direct mail campaign, and the
purchase of ad space on television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, the 55-year-old Giuliani received the gift of
get-well cannolis fresh from a Staten Island bakery. City
Councilman James Oddo, R-S.I., told Giuliani that ''my mother is
setting record laps on the rosary on your behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani took a bite of the cannoli and posed for pictures
during the public hearing. ''The cannolis look great,'' Giuliani
said. ''Cannolis cure everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the mayor, who has received hundreds of
calls from well-wishers, returned many of those including one to
Yankees Manager JoeTorre, who had surgery for prostate cancer last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you hear the word cancer, it's frightening. It's still
frightening, but cancer is no longer a death sentence. That has to
be first and foremost in your mind,'' Torre said later during a
pre-game media availability at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He said the mayor seemed in good spirits, and that the only
advice Torre offered Giuliani was that he should listen to his
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mayor's other callers Friday were former Sen. Bob
Dole; Republican Presidential nominee George W. Bush; Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak; and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who phoned her get-well wishes to Giuliani on Thursday,
was back in Washington on Friday, unveiling a study showing that
children who spend their early years in quality day care are less
likely to be arrested down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign spokesman also said Clinton has decided to join
Giuliani in courting support from the New York arm of the Reform
Party.

<HEADLINE> United States 4, Guatemala 0  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- With an offensive burst rarely seen from an
American team, the United States stormed into the Sydney Olympics
soccer field Friday night by routing Guatemala 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Getting two goals in the opening eight minutes and three in the
first 22, the American under-23 squad easily won its CONCACAF
semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   The United States joined Honduras, which defeated Mexico 5-4 in
a shootout after a 0-0 tie in the opener, in Sunday's final. Both
teams earned berths at the 2000 Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   Few American soccer teams have displayed the explosiveness this
group showed against Guatemala. Only 46 seconds after kickoff, on
the first U.S. possession, Chris Albright headed a long free kick
by Peter Vagenas toward the middle of the penalty area. John
O'Brien, running full speed, sent a rocket of a shot over the arms
of goalie Luis Molina.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 12,299, some of whom were still settling into their
seats, erupted in noise as O'Brien did a somersault following his
goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the start.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. defender Ramiro Corrales made a long clear from in
front of his net during a scramble in the eighth minute, Albright
took the ball in the clear. His left-footed shot was deflected by
Molina, but it fell right to Josh Wolff, who tapped it into an open
net as Molina looked around for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemalan defense was nowhere to be seen on the third goal,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Olsen, the only member of the under-23 team who also plays
regularly for the main national squad -- players must be under 23
years old to play in Olympic qualifying -- set it up. He rolled the
ball to his right to Wolff, whose cross into the middle was
intentionally ignored by Albright, who knew Landon Donovan was
behind him. Donovan tapped it home in the 22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   With the Guatemalans demoralized, the Americans kept up their
unrelenting attack. But they either misfired or Molina made a
difficult save to keep it 3-0, although the hosts had a 19-2 shot
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was marred by fouls and five yellow-card
cautions. But the Americans never let Guatemala press the attack in
earning their third straight qualifying shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan scored his second goal in the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the U.S. players carried a banner around the field
saying ''Thank You Hershey, Olympics 2000.'' Several American
players were draped in U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the six-nation tournament, the United States beat
Honduras 3-0 and tied Canada 0-0.

<HEADLINE> Soldier Said in US Custody in SKorea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korean police said Saturday they
have handed over to U.S. authorities an American soldier who was
captured after he fled hours before he was to go on trial for
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Spc. Christopher K. McCarthy, 21, of Concord, N.H., broke out of
U.S. military custody and fled from the U.S. military command in
Seoul on Friday before he was to appear in a South Korean court.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean police captured him eight hours later at Itaewon
near the U.S. military command. He was handed over to U.S.
authorities late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean television footage showed the American soldier,
handcuffed and wearing a jogging suit, sitting on a bench at a
South Korean police station. He looked nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Under an accord governing the treatment of 37,000 U.S. soldiers
stationed here, South Korean police are required to put U.S.
soldiers accused of crimes in U.S. custody pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is charged with the beating death of a 31-year-old bar
waitress, identified by police only by her surname, Kim, in Seoul
on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested three days later and told investigators that he
hit the woman because she refused to have sex with him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Reliever Jeff Zimmerman balked home the winning
run in the bottom of the ninth inning Friday night, and the
Baltimore Orioles beat the Texas Rangers 4-3 for their eighth
straight home victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken led off the ninth with a single against Zimmerman
(0-3). Pinch-runner Mark Lewis, playing his second game for the
Orioles after being claimed off waivers from Cincinnati, moved to
third on Will Clark's double.
</P>
<P>
   With a 1-1 count on Greg Myers, plate umpire Ian Lamplugh called
Zimmerman for a balk and Lewis trotted home. Zimmerman did not
argue the call.
</P>
<P>
   Lamplugh ejected Baltimore left fielder B.J. Surhoff in the
first inning for arguing a called third strike. Because he had
played the field in the top half, Surhoff extended his consecutive
games streak to 345 games, the longest current string in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Conine and Mike Bordick homered for the Orioles, who have
not lost at Camden Yards since dropping their season opener to
Cleveland on April 3. Bordick drove in two runs, increasing his
league-leading RBIs total to 29.
</P>
<P>
   In the most intriguing at-bat of the evening, Albert Belle
fouled off 13 pitches before popping out on a 3-2 pitch from
Esteban Loaiza in the Orioles third.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom (1-1) pitched two perfect innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis hit his third home run of the season for the
Rangers, who have lost nine of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 2-0 lead in the third off Jason Johnson. Royce
Clayton doubled off the scoreboard in right field and Curtis
homered.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive two-out doubles by Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler in
the fourth made it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Conine, who replaced Surhoff, hit Loaiza's first pitch of the
sixth into the left-field bleachers for his fourth home run.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Bordick followed with his team-high seventh
home run, a two-run shot to left that tied it.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ripken played in his 2,809th career game, moving him past
his former manager, Frank Robinson, and into sole possession of
15th place all-time. ... Surhoff's ejection was the first of the
season by an Oriole and the fourth of his 14-year career. ...
Before doubling in the fourth, Kapler was in a 2-for-22 slump in
road games. ... Rangers first baseman Rafael Palmeiro felt
tightness in his left hamstring after stealing second in the fifth.
He was removed as a precaution.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark McGwire had a go-ahead two-run double
and three RBIs as the St. Louis Cardinals opened a four-run lead,
lost it amid a flurry of strikeouts, then rallied to beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 7-4 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, whose 52 homers are a major league record for
April, failed to homer for only the second time in 23 games. They
need six homers Saturday and Sunday to tie Baltimore's 1987 record
of 58 homers in any month.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Robert Person's wildness kept the Cardinals in
the ballpark, but also kept him in constant trouble even as he
struck out 10 in five innings. He had six consecutive strikeouts
between the second and fourth innings and seven in a span of eight
batters, but also walked three, allowed seven hits, threw a wild
pitch and committed a balk.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that wildness came in the first two innings as the
Cardinals, winning their fourth in five games, opened a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds' sacrifice fly followed leadoff singles by Fernando
Vina and Edgar Renteria in the first. The Cardinals started a
three-run second with Fernando Tatis' double, J.D. Drew's RBI
single and Mike Matheny's single ahead of Vina's run-scoring force
play grounder and Renteria's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen was 3-for-4 with a pair of doubles and three RBIs,
but the Phillies still lost their ninth in 11 games and 11th in 14
games. Rolen had an RBI single in the fourth and a two-run double
following Bobby Abreu's double in the fifth off Garrett Stephenson
(3-0).
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson was lifted for a pinch-hitter with the score tied at
4 in the sixth, but got the win when Phillies reliever Carlos Reyes
also struggled with his control.
</P>
<P>
   After two excellent defensive plays by shortstop Desi Relaford
and third baseman Rolen retired the first two batters, Reyes (0-2)
walked the bases full. McGwire followed with his double down the
left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen made one of the best plays by a major league infielder
this season, throwing out pinch-hitting Eric Davis while sitting on
his backside behind third base.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire added a sacrifice fly in the eighth off reliever Scott
Aldred, and Vina went 2-for-3 with two walks and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, who was 3-for-3 at the time, was up with two on and two
outs in the seventh, but reliever Mike James picked Abreu off first
in the Phillies' second major baserunning blunder. Doug Glanville
took the bat out of Rolen's hands by getting picked off second by
Stephenson with two outs in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals relievers James, Heathcliff Slocumb and Dave Veres
combined for four scoreless innings, with Veres finishing up for
his fifth save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: St. Louis' only other homerless game was April 7 against
Milwaukee. ... The Cardinals are 15-0 when they don't commit an
error and 0-8 when they do. ... Tatis has a 13-game hitting streak
(19-for-47). ... Stephenson started 5-0 last season before
finishing 6-3. ... The Phillies don't have an official team record
for consecutive strikeouts, but Steve Carlton (1981) and Curt
Schilling (1996) each struck out seven in a row. ... Relaford is
the only NL starting shortstop without an error.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If accepted by a federal judge, a government proposal to
break Microsoft into two companies would bar Microsoft officers and directors,
including billionaire co-founder Bill Gates, from owning stock in more than one
of the new companies. The proposal today to split Microsoft into rival companies
was the largest trust-busting move since AT&AMP;T was carved into seven Baby Bells.
One company would produce its Windows operating software, the source of
Microsoft's monopoly power, according to a court filing. The other company would

   McKEES ROCKS, Pa. (AP) -- In what police called a racially motivated shooting
spree, a white man opened fire in several Pittsburgh communities today, killing
five people and critically wounding a sixth. The shootings took place within a
20-mile range through suburbs surrounding Pittsburgh during about an hour span
this afternoon. The gunman fatally shot a person of Indian descent at an Indian
grocery store, two employees at a Chinese restaurant and a black man at a
martial arts school. A Jewish woman who lived next door to the suspect's
relatives was found dead in her home. The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, a

INS Agent Defends Tactics of Elian Raid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who led the
raid to remove Elian Gonzalez defended the tactics today, saying force was
necessary given the presence of people who had ''vowed to prevent Elian's
recovery.'' ''This was the most challenging execution of a federal search
warrant,'' Agent James Goldman told The Associated Press. The agents worried
they'd be met by armed supporters of the Miami branch of the Gonzalez family.
Crowds had kept vigil outside the home, often swelling into the hundreds.
Federal investigators identified more than 20 people around the home as being
members of paramilitary groups, security companies, or ''individuals that had
vowed to prevent Elian's recovery by the federal government,'' Goldman said.

U.S. Wants Missile Treaty Changes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has outlined to Russian

attack from Asia and later from the Middle East, a senior U.S. official said
today. Deployment of a limited defense, involving 100 launchers and improved
radar, is envisaged for 2005. North Korea, at this point, is considered the
mostly likely Asian country to attack U.S. targets. The second phase, involving
additional interceptors and radar and a second deployment site, would rely on an
orbiting satellite system that is not due to be completed before 2010, the
senior U.S. official told The Associated Press.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Chris Holt pitched a one-hitter, allowing only a
second-inning single to Ron Belliard, for his first career complete game as the
Houston Astros beat the Milwaukee Brewers 7-0 tonight. Holt did not allow a
runner to reach second base in his first shutout. Belliard's hit was clean to
center field.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 81, Hornets 76  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers did it with defense
in Game 3, from Aaron McKie shutting down Eddie Jones to Theo
Ratliff blocking shots to George Lynch and Toni Kukoc holding
Anthony Mason without a basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was a total team effort on a night when the Sixers needed a
lift from Allen Iverson's sidekicks, and they all provided it --
holding the Hornets to one field goal over the first 11{ minutes of
the fourth quarter in an 81-76 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series, with Game
4 set for Monday night in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   And if the 76ers are able to close out the series in that game,
they can point at four or five players who all stepped up when
their best defensive player, Eric Snow, sat out with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 24 points, McKie and Kukoc added 12 each and
Ratliff had 10 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had 18 for Charlotte, none when the Hornets really needed
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones missed his first seven shots of the second half before
finally getting one with 1.5 seconds left. By then it was too late
for Charlotte, which missed 12 of its first 13 shots in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Elden Campbell broke that spell on a bank shot with 16 seconds
left that made it 76-74. The Hornets immediately fouled McKie, who
made both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Hill rebounded the ensuing shot by Charlotte, and he and
Kevin Ollie made three of four free throws the rest of the way to
wrap it up.
</P>
<P>
   The key stretch came six minutes earlier when Iverson, Ratliff
and Kukoc all scored on driving layups as part of a 7-0 run that
put Philadelphia in control 66-59. After Kukoc made his layup over
Campbell, Iverson cupped his hand around his ear and pranced along
the sideline, asking the crowd for more noise.
</P>
<P>
   They responded, especially when McKie leaped high to block
Jones' fast break layup a minute later to preserve a 66-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones finally scored his first points of the second half on two
foul shots with 4:52 left, then stole the ball from McKie and made
one of two from the line to make it a two-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then came up with another steal, but David Wesley missed a
jumper, and Kukoc calmly hit a 3-pointer over Derrick Coleman to
make it 69-64.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who had the best game of anyone on the Sixers in Game 2,
was bothered by a chip fracture in his right ankle and missed his
first game of the season. McKie started in his place and Ollie, who
had played only two minutes in the first two games, played 15
minutes as McKie's backup and had eight points and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch went 0-for-6 from the field but the Sixers could live with
it because he helped hold Mason to an 0-for-7 night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers missed 14 of their first 17 shots but trailed only
14-10 with 2{ minutes left in the first quarter as Charlotte also
had trouble scoring points. Jones picked up his second foul along
with a technical with 1:44 left in the first, but he didn't pick up
his third until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis, showing Iverson-like quickness and leaping ability,
hit his first five shots as the Hornets went ahead early in the
second quarter before settling for a 40-38 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte led for all but 36 seconds of the third quarter, and
it was tied 57-57 heading into the fourth. McKie made a driving
layup two minutes into the fourth quarter, giving the Sixers their
first lead since 24-22.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Sixers drew their 11th sellout crowd of the season. ...
The scoreboard wasn't working during the first quarter. Heading
into the second quarter it read: Sixers 36, Celtics 18. ... Goaded
by the hosts of a morning sports talk radio show, Sixers fans sent
21 dozen doughnuts to Coleman's hotel room Friday morning. He was
booed every time he touched the ball. ... Sixers 12th man Ira
Bowman didn't hear coach Larry Brown call his name to check in for
the final 10 seconds of the third quarter, and Brown ran to
Bowman's seat, grabbed him and sent him in.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tucker Carlson, a reporter for the
conservative magazine The Weekly Standard and a CNN political
commentator, was detained briefly by Vietnamese authorities in Ho
Chi Minh City, who questioned his travel documents, a spokeswoman
for the magazine said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, 30, was part of a group of reporters covering the
Vietnam visit of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was a prisoner of
war for over five years. When Carlson attempted to board a plane
back to the United States on Friday, Vietnamese officials accused
him of being in their country illegally because he lacked a proper
exit visa.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said Friday night that Vietnamese
authorities had told them Carlson was free to leave the country as
soon as he arranged transportation. Carolyn Wimmer of the Weekly
Standard said the magazine had not been able to reach him.

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Rookie Adam Piatt singled in two runs in a
five-run seventh inning as the Oakland Athletics rallied to beat
the Minnesota Twins 5-2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (2-2) allowed two runs -- both unearned -- in six
innings for Oakland, which won for just the third time in eight
games. Heredia struck out three and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton drove in two runs on two ground-rule doubles for
Minnesota, which lost its second straight. Lawton has a 14-game
hitting streak, the longest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter Brad Radke (2-3) was pitching a one-hit
shutout, before the A's batted around in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs led off the inning with a single and moved to third
on Ramon Hernandez's one-out double. Eric Chavez followed with an
RBI single to chase Radke.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Olmedo Saenz singled off Hector Carrasco to tie the
game, and Terrence Long's sacrifice fly off Travis Miller made it
3-2. Piatt followed with a single up the middle to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Isringhausen got the final four outs for his fourth save
in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Radke allowed three runs on four hits in 6 1-3 innings. He
struck out five and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has given up 10 runs in his last 29 innings
after allowing 11 in his first 11 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took advantage of second baseman Frank Menechino's two
errors to score both of its runs.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Walker led off the third with a hard grounder that
Menechino bobbled. After Walker moved to second on a fielder's
choice, Lawton lined a double that bounced over the wall in
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton hit another ground-rule double to left-center to make it
2-0 in the fifth. Menechino had a throwing error that extended the
inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland will finish April with a losing record for the
third straight season. ... Guzman hit a hard grounder to Jason
Giambi in the first inning that got stuck in the web of the first
baseman's glove. Giambi had to settle for the unassisted putout
instead of turning the double play. ... Lawton leads Minnesota in
batting, games, at-bats, hits, walks and stolen bases. ... Radke
walked more than two batters for the first time this season. He did
it only four times last year. He has pitched six-plus innings in
five out of six starts.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 3, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- James Baldwin was in a groove Friday night, and
that's a rut the Chicago White Sox don't mind.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin pitched 7 1-3 strong innings for his fourth straight
victory and Jose Valentin hit a two-run homer as the White Sox beat
the Detroit Tigers 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key was throwing strikes,'' said Baldwin, who threw 101
pitches -- 67 of them strikes. ''Any time you're throwing strikes,
it keeps everybody on their toes, you play quick, and that helps a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second game between the teams since they engaged in
two brawls Saturday at Comiskey Park, but the first since
suspensions and fines were handed down Thursday by Frank Robinson,
baseball's vice president of on-field operations.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit manager Phil Garner and Chicago's Jerry Manuel began
serving eight-game suspensions, leaving bench coaches to run the
teams -- Bob Melvin the Tigers and Joe Nossek the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams wanted to win that game,'' Nossek said.
''Fortunately, we won it. But both teams did it on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is the first White Sox pitcher to open a season 4-0
since Wilson Alvarez went 8-0 to begin 1994. Baldwin gave up two
runs on six hits, walking two and striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke, who needed five stitches under his left eye after
he was cut during one the brawls, got the last four outs for his
second save in three opportunities. He struck out the side in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   This was only the sixth time in 23 games the White Sox -- leading
the AL with a 16-7 record -- have had a game decided by four or
fewer runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a while since we've been a tight game,'' said
Foulke, who led AL relievers with 123 strikeouts last season. ''So,
obviously that was fun. It makes you get good and focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit starter Jeff Weaver (0-3), who hit two White Sox batters
to ignite the brawl in Chicago, gave up three runs on 10 hits,
walking one and striking out four for his first career complete
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been nice to get the win,'' Weaver said. ''But
if I keep pitching like that, I'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 3-1 lead with a three-run third, keyed by
Valentin's two-run homer. Successive singles by Greg Norton and
Mark Johnson put runners at first and third. Norton scored on Ray
Durham's groundout, then Valentin hit his third homer, a few rows
up in the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia's eighth career leadoff homer gave Detroit a 1-0
lead in the first and Juan Encarnacion's fourth homer cut Chicago's
lead to 3-2 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tigers, who have the worst record in the major leagues
at 5-16, only got two more hits after Encarnacion's homer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's discouraging,'' said Polonia, who also had two singles,
going 3-for-3. ''You can't have a good night if your team doesn't
have a good night. Every day is blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who have won nine of their last 10 games, had a
runner at third with one out after Norton's triple in the seventh.
But on an attempted squeeze, Johnson's bunt died in front of the
plate, allowing catcher Brad Ausmus to easily tag Norton.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit third baseman Dean Palmer and reliever Doug Brocail
began serving eight- and four-game suspensions, respectively.
Chicago outfielder Carlos Lee and pitcher Bobby Howry each began
serving three-game penalties.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Among those fined for last weekend's brawl was Tigers
bullpen catcher Ron Nedset. ... Gregg Jefferies started at third
base in place of Palmer. ... Five of the first eight games at
Comerica Park were shutouts. Detroit, which was shut out a major
league-high 12 times last season, was blanked in four of the eight
games on that inaugural homestand. ... The Tigers will honor Sparky
Anderson with a special day Sunday during which they are expected
to retire his No. 11. Anderson will be inducted into the Baseball
Hall of Fame on July 23 wearing the uniform of the Cincinnati Reds.
... The White Sox have a winning record both at home and on the
road. ... This was the first time in Comerica Park for the White
Sox. Detroit helped Chicago open the new Comiskey Park in 1991,
beating the White Sox 16-1. ... Encarnacion, who also singled in
the first inning, extended his hitting streak to 10 games.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached in Janitors Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Striking suburban janitors unanimously approved a
contract agreement with building contractors Friday night that
ended a ten-day walkout, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give janitors a $1.35 per hour raise over three
years and family health insurance in the third year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you compare that to what we had before we struck, we see
it as a great victory,'' said Ken Munz, a spokesman for Local 1 of
the Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials planned to hold the ratification vote Monday but
later decided to press ahead. The janitors will head back to work
Monday. ''The place was packed and they didn't want to wait,'' Munz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suburban Contractors Association originally offered a
95-cent raise over four years and only single-person insurance,
Munz said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry White, a spokesman and negotiator for the Suburban
Contractors Association, declined comment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract, which expired April 9, set wages at $6.65 an
hour and offered insurance coverage for the worker only.
</P>
<P>
   The strike included 4,500 janitors who work at suburban office
buildings. It began April 18 with 500 workers leaving their
cleaning crew jobs. The so-called rolling strike added a few
hundred workers at a time over the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of no new negotiations, the union had threatened to
set up picket lines at downtown buildings, with city janitors
agreeing to honor the lines.
</P>
<P>
   In separate talks, 5,500 downtown janitors ratified a new
contract April 18 after staging a one-night walkout. And in Los
Angeles, thousands of striking janitors approved a new contract
April 24, ending a three-week walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities also face walkouts. A union local in San Diego is
on strike and contracts in Oakland, Calif.; Silicon Valley, Calif.;
Cleveland and Seattle will expire within the next few months.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Anwar Conviction  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- An appeals court on Saturday
refused to overturn Anwar Ibrahim's corruption conviction and
six-year sentence, prompting the ousted deputy prime minister to
accuse judges of cowardice and political persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached a unanimous decision,'' announced the
president of the Court of Appeals, Lamin Yunus, who was flanked by
two other appellate court judges.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move, Lamin refused to read aloud excerpts of
the appellate court's 59-page ruling, saying Anwar's attorneys and
journalists to read the ruling for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Anwar to jump up from his seat and launch a tirade
against the three judges.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disgusted, no bloody guts,'' he shouted before the stunned
courtroom, after the judges refused his request for them to
summarize their verdict and explain how they reached their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was fired as deputy prime minister in September 1998 by
his longtime mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamar. He was
arrested three weeks later and put on trial on four counts of abuse
of power.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, the High Court convicted Anwar in a verdict that
sparked violent anti-government protests in the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, and galvanized a fledgling opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who is currently standing trial for sodomy, insists all
the charges against him were trumped up by political enemies to
quash his bid to become the Southeast Asian nation's next prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Returns in Padres Game  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- John Rocker emerged from the Padres bullpen in
the left-field corner and walked along the warning track to the
opposing bullpen all the way in the other corner of the stadium
Friday night, accompanied by a security guard in a red jacket.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the normal way a visiting reliever shows up for work in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this wasn't the start of a normal trip for Rocker.
It was his first road appearance since his two-week suspension for
his comments about gays, minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Fans perched along the rails, watching out of curiosity as
Rocker took off his Atlanta Braves warmup jacket and started
playing catch. A teen-ager found an opening and called Rocker a
''jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan in a Padres cap shouted back, ''Hey, he's a human being,
leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Rocker walked over to the stands and the
fans closed in to get autographs. With the exception of Rocker's
snide comment to a photographer, it might have been any reliever
signing autographs on a spring evening.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had no comment, just sneers, for the media before
the game, even signed a New York Yankees cap for Eddie Solivan, 34,
who said he was of Puerto Rican descent, grew up in Spanish Harlem
in New York and now lives in suburban San Diego. Rocker signed a
ball for Solivan's 7-year-old son, Steven.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good day,'' Solivan said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rocker's disparaging remarks, Solivan said: ''At first
you get mad, then it takes time, you think about what he said. The
man did apologize. Everybody has a right to say something in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to get booed,'' Solivan said. ''Padres fans are
proud, too. My friends who are coming to the game, they're all
coming just to boo him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rocker walked from the Braves dugout through foul territory
to the bullpen in the right-field corner before the top of the
third inning, he was greeted by hearty boos.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves finished batting practice, Rocker was the last
to walk across the field to the dugout. He was warmly greeted by
fans, many wearing Atlanta caps, T-shirts and jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ''John, everyone should be able to voice their opinion,'' one
woman shouted.
</P>
<P>
   A young man gushed as he got an autograph: ''Oh yeah, Rocker,
man!''
</P>
<P>
   But in another section, a Padres fan wasn't pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hey, Rocker, I've got a white sheet I want you to sign,''
hollered Harry Maker, who said he was of Welsh, Irish, Spanish and
Blackfoot Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a fan of anyone who makes racist remarks,'' Maker said
after Rocker went into the clubhouse. ''I thought that was totally
inconsiderate, totally stupid that he put his mouth in a gear and
didn't put his brain in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Maker said he doesn't hate Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate his viewpoint. Racism has no place in baseball,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It figures that Rocker will get a harsher reaction when he makes
his first trip to New York in late June. His comments were directed
at people he had seen in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker went on the road following a nine-game homestand in which
he had four saves.
</P>
<P>
   Braves teammate Brian Jordan, who had been one of Rocker's main
critics after the remarks were published in a magazine, thought the
reliever would get booed by Padres fans, who generally are laid
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite sure they will because, to be honest, a lot of
Latins sit in the outfield,'' the right fielder said before the
game. ''I know. They get on my case all game long. So I can imagine
they're going to be rebelling a little bit. It's going to be
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Man Given Life For Student Killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- The second of two men convicted of
raping and murdering an 18-year-old college freshman was sentenced
Friday to life in prison plus 62 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Avalos, 27, apologized to the family of victim Carly
Martinez before being sentenced by the judge. He also apologized
for destroying evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the actions of a coward and not a man. I wish I
would have come forward right away,'' Avalos said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, disappeared in January 1998 from
Las Cruces, where she was returning for classes at New Mexico State
University. Investigators found her nearly nude body in the desert
six miles away on March 22, 1998, stabbed more than 30 times.
</P>
<P>
   Avalos was convicted of first-degree felony murder, three counts
of tampering with evidence, three counts of conspiring to tamper
with evidence, and single counts of kidnapping and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Co-defendant Jason Desnoyers, 24, was convicted of murder, rape,
kidnapping and 10 other counts in November and was sentenced to
life plus 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Avalos will be eligible for parole in 61 years, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that Jesse Avalos basically will spend the rest
of his life in prison,'' said District Attorney Susana Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence would have been life in prison plus 100
years, said prosecutor Martinez, who is not related to the victim.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam War Journalists Embrace  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP)-- Former members of the Saigon
press corps -- now, for a few days, members of the Ho Chi Minh City
press corps -- gathered in a hotel roof garden Friday to mark the
end of the Vietnam war 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of journalists from the United States, Britain, France,
South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and
Vietnam itself are in town to cover Sunday's official anniversary
parade, and to renew their own ties with the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's rather fun -- very pleasant and enormously
interesting, fascinating,'' said legendary British scribe Clare
Hollingworth, at age 88 the oldest of some 60 reporters and
photographers at the unofficial press reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingworth, who scooped the world on Adolf Hitler's invasion
of Poland in 1939, flew in from Hong Kong, her Asia base for many
years with London's Sunday Telegraph. It was her second return
since the war ended in 1975, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with food and drink, the journalists tried to assess the
reunion's meaning without getting too mired down in curbstone
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we're finally getting the ghosts of Vietnam off our
hands,'' said Saul Lockhart, of Hong Kong's South China Morning
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists gravitated toward the Rex Hotel in downtown Ho Chi
Minh City just as NBC's ''Today'' show was staging an elaborate
sidewalk interview with Sen. John McCain, who sparked controversy
earlier in the day with scathing remarks about the Vietnamese who
held him prisoner for five years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his wife, Cindy, had been invited to the press
reception but declined. McCain said he had to catch a plane to rush
back to Washington, D.C., to attend the White House correspondents'
dinner on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A few other ex-soldiers also were invited, among them former
Sgt. David Garcia, who led a reconnaissance team into Laos during
the 1969 battle of Hamburger Hill and was captured and held
prisoner for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be in Saigon means nothing to me,'' said Garcia, 50.
''Tomorrow we're taking a bottle of tequila to Hamburger Hill to
have a drink to absent friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest contingent was The Associated Press, whose 15
attendees included three Pulitzer Prize winners, photographers
Horst Faas, Nick Ut and Neal Ulevich.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were no speeches at the low-key affair, and as is their
custom, the correspondents avoided telling war stories to each
other. But Faas injected the requisite dark humor of their
profession: ''Morituri te salutant. We who are about to die salute
you.''

<HEADLINE> Royals 8, Mariners 5  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Joe Randa, Carlos Beltran and Carlos
Febles all drove in two runs and a crowd of more than 36,000 saw
the Kansas City Royals beat Seattle 8-5 Friday night for their
seventh straight home victory.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding season openers, the paid attendance of 36,317 was the
biggest crowd for an April game in Kansas City since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, whose slumping attendance in recent years has fueled
fears the team might leave town, own the best home record (9-1) in
the league and had won their previous six at home in their final
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Batista (1-0), in his first appearance since being
acquired from Montreal on Tuesday, went four innings in relief for
his first AL win. He gave up one hit and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (1-1) lost for the first time in eight career
decisions against AL teams. He went 6 2-3 innings and was charged
with six runs on eight hits, with three walks and three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit a two-run homer in the Mariners ninth. Ricky
Bottalico gave up an RBI single to Tom Lampkin before getting the
last out for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, the slump-ridden 1999 AL rookie of the year, tripled
off Tomko in the first to tie it and Randa's single made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Mike Sweeney hit a sacrifice fly and Jermaine
Dye and Randa had RBI singles. Febles' two-run single off Jose
Paniagua in the eighth made it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud put the Mariners on top 2-0 with a two-run single
off starter Jay Witasick in the first. Stan Javier and Rodriguez
walked ahead of him and both scored on the low liner into center.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick, a 4-2 loser to Tomko in Seattle last week, went four
innings plus two batters and gave up two runs on five hits and five
walks.
Notes: David Glass officially become the second owner in Royals'
history on Friday with a wire transfer of $96 million he paid for
the team. He was not at the game. ... The last time the Royals had
a bigger April crowd excluding season openrs was April 30, 1989,
when the Milwaukee Brewers drew 40,113. When Witasick walked
Rodriguez in the first inning, it marked the sixth straight time
Royals pitchers had given him a free pass. He set a club record
last time the Royals played Seattle with five walks in the game. In
all, Kansas City pitched walked 10 Friday night. ... Tomko and
Witasick combined to throw 63 pitches in the first inning, which
lasted 31 minutes. ... The Royals loaded the bases with two out in
the third but Tomko got Mark Quinn to ground sharply up the middle
and second baseman Mark McLemore made a good play.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
White Sox-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Jeff Weaver, who hit two White Sox batters before
the big brawl broke out last week in Chicago, led the AL in batters
hit last season with 17.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox selected Jeff Weaver in the second round
of the 1997 draft (62nd overall). But they couldn't agree to terms
with him and he was drafted and signed by Detroit the following
year.
Red Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Boston's pitchers entered the series leading the AL with
a 3.96 ERA and opponents are batting just .244 against them. ...
The three rainouts in Boston last weekend allowed the Indians to
avoid facing Pedro Martinez, who is 4-0 against them in the regular
season with a 1.83 ERA and 2-0 vs. Cleveland in the postseason.
Martinez will face Charles Nagy in the series finale Sunday. ...
Carl Everett is already on the verge of setting a team record in
his first month with Boston. Everett has seven homers in April, one
fewer than the eight hit by Mo Vaughn in April of 1996 and '97 and
Fred Lynn in '79.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The massive suspensions and fines handed down by
baseball disciplinarian Frank Robinson have gotten everyone's
attention. But while Indians manager Charlie Manuel understands the
message being sent, he said it's tough not to do anything when one
of his players gets beaned with a pitch. ''It's hard to just sit
there and not do anything,'' he said. ''Evidently, they're tying to
cut down on that.'' ... Indians ace Bartolo Colon, on the 15-day
disabled list with a pulled muscle in his rib cage, threw in the
outfield Friday and is progressing nicely, Manuel said. ... Scott
Morgan, the Indians' minor league player of the year in 1999, was
claimed off waivers by the Anaheim Angels on Friday. Morgan was
designated for assignment and dropped from the 40-man roster on
April 20. ''I think Scotty Morgan will play in the major leagues,''
Manuel said. ''It's kind of unfortunate he had to go. He's got
power, and he's at the point in his career when somebody needs to
give him a chance.''
Rangers-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers entered Friday's game 8-13. They haven't been
8-13 after 21 games since 1988. ... The next home run by 1B Rafael
Palmeiro will move him past Ralph Kiner and into sole possession of
47th place all-time. ... Injured LHP Justin Thompson threw on the
side Friday and could be activated to make his first start of the
season Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: RHP Scott Erickson, on the disabled list following
March surgery to remove bone chips from his pitching elbow, is one
of ''The 50 Most Beautiful People in the World'' in next week's
issue of People magazine. Erickson, who makes a rehabilitation
start for Double-A Bowie on Sunday, brushed off questions about the
honor. ''I'd rather think about pitching,'' he said. ... 2B Delino
DeShields is on a tear. In his last four starts, DeShields is
8-for-18 with a home run and nine RBIs.
Blue Jays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: David Wells, a crowd favorite during his two years with
the Yankees, starts Saturday against his former team. The
left-hander was greeted with a standing ovation when he returned to
Yankee Stadium last year for the first time since he was traded for
Roger Clemens. ''It was pretty unbelievable being a guy on the
opposing team and getting a bigger ovation than the guys there,''
said Wells, who is 14-8 in his career vs. New York. ... Toronto
called up LHP Eric Gunderson from Triple-A Syracuse and optioned
LHP John Bale to Syracuse. ... Since hitting .217 with 12 homers in
the first eight games, the Blue Jays hit .319 with 31 homers in the
next 15 contests.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Manager Joe Torre, who missed the first six weeks of
last season recovering from prostate cancer surgery, called Yankees
fan and New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to offer support for dealing
with the disease. ''Our jobs are very similar in that they aren't
five days a week. He is the only one who knows himself and his job
and when he can come back. He has to do what is best for his health
and people will understand that whether they are for him or against
him,'' Torre said of Giuliani, who announced he had prostate cancer
Thursday. ... Yankees relievers entered the game with 7-0 record
and league-leading 2.98 ERA on the year. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch
returned to the lineup after missing three games with a sprained
left wrist. ... OF Paul O'Neill was also back after leaving
Wednesday's game in the third inning with blurred vision.
Mariners-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners are guaranteed to finish April above .500
for the seventh time in their history. ... The Mariners are
starting a brief four-game road trip to Kansas City and Minnesota
hoping to get better pitching away from home. In 12 home games,
their pitchers are 8-4 with a 3.30 ERA. In their first eight road
games, they were 4-4, 6.88.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The David Glass era began with the Royals on Friday
with a wire transfer of $96 million to pay for the team. Glass, the
retired CEO of Wal-Mart, Inc., said his son Dan, 41, would be the
team president. While workmen were setting up for the weekly
post-game show Friday afternoon, about $2,000 in fireworks went off
prematurely. Fire engines were called to the scene, but there were
no injuries and no other damage. The show was still to go on.
Athletics-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Oakland started its longest road trip of the season, a
12-game four-city trip to Minnesota, Kansas City, Texas and
Anaheim. The A's were 4-20 against those teams on the road last
season. ... Thirteen years ago Friday, former Oakland pitcher
Dennis Eckersley committed in error in the A's 7-1 win over Boston.
He would not commit another error for eight years, setting an
American League record for pitchers with 470 consecutive errorless
games.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins opened their longest homestand of the
season, 12 games in 13 days. ... Minnesota needs to sweep Oakland
this weekend in order to have its first winning April since 1996.
Before that, the Twins had not posted a winning record in April
since 1987. ... Matt Lawton leads Minnesota in batting (.378),
games (23), at-bats (90), hits (34), doubles (6), walks (13) and
stolen bases (5).
Devil Rays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Jose Canseco entered Friday night's game needing
three stolen bases to become the eighth player in history with at
least 200 steals and 400 home runs. The first seven are Hank Aaron,
Willie Mays, Reggie Jackson, Frank Robinson, Dave Winfield, Andre
Dawson and Barry Bonds. ... The Devil Rays' home run-hitting
quartet of Canseco, Fred McGriff, Greg Vaughn and Vinny Castilla
did not have a homer among them in 14 of the team's first 21 games.
Prior to Friday night's contest, Tampa Bay was 2-5 when at least
one of them homered, and 6-8 when none of them did. Castilla missed
the first seven games because of a strained muscle near the left
side of his rib cage. ... Canseco hit 22 homers on the road last
season, but has only one in his first 11 road games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels claimed OF Scott Morgan off waivers from the
Cleveland Indians and placed him on the 40-man roster. Outfielder
Jeff DaVanon was transferred from the 15-day disabled list to the
60-day DL to make room for Morgan. ... One of the things manager
Mike Scioscia likes most about catcher Bengie Molina is his
willingness to play at considerably less than 100 percent -- as he
did on Thursday night despite intestinal flu. ''I think Bengie
understands what is expected of a front-line catcher on a
championship-caliber club and what the demands of that position
are,'' said Scioscia, who caught more games for the Dodgers than
anyone else. ''You're not going to feel 100 percent all the time --
in fact, he was feeling about 40 percent -- but he gave it his best
shot, and that's all you can ask.'' ... Major league batting leader
Darin Erstad, who already has broken Hal Morris' AL record for hits
in the month of April, entered Friday night's game with 44 -- and
needed three more to tie the major league mark set by Dante
Bichette in 1998 with Colorado.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: C Damian Miller was still nursing a sore hamstring
Friday. He'd missed the previous series against the Phillies but
could return Sunday because he works well with Randy Johnson. ...
The Diamondbacks have not lost a road series since last July 18-20.
Since then, they have gone 12-0 with one split in a road series.
... 3B Matt Williams, who's on the disabled list with a broken bone
in his right foot, is making good use of his time while hobbled.
Williams sat on a chair and fed his teammates soft tosses so they
work on their hitting strokes before Friday's game. ... After
winning their first five day games this season, the Diamondbacks
have lost four straight. They play the Cubs Saturday and Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Don Baylor, hit by the pitch more than any player in
major league history, said he understands the tough stance major
league baseball took by doling out big suspensions following a
brawl between the Tigers and White Sox. But Baylor said protecting
players ''has been done the entire history of the game.'' Baylor's
not for head hunting, but for respect. ''If you are pitcher you
have to be able to pitch inside, these guys are hitting home runs
at a record pace. I believe there is a time to pitch in. Some guys
do get hit. I think when they lose their minds out there on the
mound or fire at somebody's head, they should be suspended.'' ...
RHP Ismael Valdes will make a rehab start on Saturday for Class A
Daytona and scheduled to then join the Cubs to be re-evaluated
Sunday. Valdes is on the DL with shoulder tendinitis. ... The Cubs
have homered in 12 straight games.
Cardinals-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: RHP David Wainhouse was placed on the 15-day disabled
list Friday with right shoulder discomfort and LHP Justin Brunette
was recalled from Triple-A Memphis. Brunette pitched in one game
with St. Louis earlier this season. ... Friday's game in Veterans
Stadium was the Cardinals' first on artificial turf this season.
... This weekend's series in Philadelphia are the Cardinals' only
games in a 15-game stretch outside of Busch Stadium. They finished
off a 6-3 homestand Thursday and return home for three games
against the Pirates on Tuesday. ... RHP Matt Morris, who missed
last season with Tommy John elbow surgery, is expected to throw
batting practice Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Curt Schilling will come off the disabled list
and start Sunday against the Cardinals. He is 5-5 with a 3.93 ERA
against St. Louis. ... 3B Scott Rolen is the only Phillies player
to start all 22 games. ... RHP Jason Boyd, recently claimed from
the Brewers off waivers, made his last rehabilitation appearance
for Triple-A Wilkes-Barre-Scranton on Wednesday. He is out of
options and, if the Phillies don't keep him on their 25-man roster,
must clear waivers before he can return to the minors. ... Through
21 games, Desi Relaford was the only NL starting shortstop without
an error. ... The Phillies will honor the 50th anniversary of the
1950 NL champion ''Whiz Kids'' on July 8. ... The Phillies played
last season's four NL playoff teams in their first five series.
Reds-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Reds catcher Eddie Taubensee was a late scratch from
Friday's lineup because of tightness in his back. Benito Santiago
replaced him. ... Ken Griffey Jr. made his second career appearance
at Three Rivers Stadium on Friday. Griffey was on the American
League team in the 1994 All-Star game. At that time, he said he
wouldn't mind playing for the Pirates some day because he has
western Pennsylvania roots -- his grandparents and parents are from
Donora, Pa. However, when the Pirates made an offer to Seattle for
Griffey last winter, Griffey made it known he would exercise his
veto rights on a a trade to Pittsburgh. ... Reliever Norm
Charlton's Reds comeback ended after two games and a 27.00 ERA. He
was released on Friday and the Reds purchased the contract of
infielder Juan Castro from Triple-A Louisville. Castro was hitting
.317 in 19 games in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: In less than one month, the Pirates have dropped two
relief pitchers, called up two others, revamped the batting order
and now sent third base prospect Aramis Ramirez back to the minors.
The upheaval reflects the urgency ownership has created for this
team to be a contender. They don't have a strong alternative to
Ramirez was will use a pair of 34-year-old utility players -- Mike
Benjamin and Luis Sojo -- to cover Ramirez's old spot. ... Jason
Schmidt will have another sideline throwing session today to
determine if he's ready to come off the disabled list. Manager Gene
Lamont said he wants to see Schmidt really cut loose with his
pitches to show that he's over the shoulder inflammation that put
him on the DL. If Schmidt passes this test, he will start Tuesday's
game in St. Louis.
Astros-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Geoff Jenkins entered Friday night's game tied with
five other players for the NL home run lead with eight. ....
Milwaukee hopes to get starting catcher Henry Blanco back from the
injured list (April 8, lacerated right index finger) next Tuesday
after a two-game rehab with Triple-A Indianapolis starting Sunday.
.... Brewers starter Jaime Navarro entered the game with a 0-4
record and an 11.57 ERA, not much of a payback for a player earning
$5 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros Friday night began their longest road trip
of the season, 10 games against Milwaukee, Chicago and Los Angeles.
They are not back home until May 8. .... The Astros were probably
happy to get out of Houston, anyway, after losing five of six games
on their just completed homestand.
Mets-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets, off to their best start since 1988, when
they won the NL East, embarked on a 13-game, four-city road trip --
their longest since 1995. ... RHP Paul Wilson, the first overall
pick of the 1994 draft, was scheduled to join New York's Triple-A
affiliate Norfolk on Monday as he tries to make a comeback from
elbow and shoulder surgery. He has not pitched in the majors since
1996. He was 2-0 with a 1.40 ERA in five games with Class A St.
Lucie. ... Friday night's starter Mike Hampton entered the game 4-0
at Coors Field, while C Mike Piazza was hitting .408 with 12 homers
and 43 RBIs in 30 games at Coors.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: RHP Jerry Dipoto was placed on the 15-day disabled
list Friday and could miss the rest of the season because of
lingering problems with a bulging disk below his neck. Mike DeJean
was recalled from Triple-A Colorado Springs to replace Dipoto in
the bullpen. ... Pedro Astacio made his first start since April 19.
His scheduled start Monday was rained out, and he did not travel
with the team to Montreal on Tuesday and Wednesday because he did
not want to risk visa problems. ... The Rockies played just their
eighth home game.
Braves-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves and Padres met for the first time since
their blockbuster trade in December that sent Ryan Klesko and Bret
Boone to San Diego in exchange for Quilvio Veras, Wally Joyner and
Reggie Sanders. ... Sanders is an 0-for-30 slump.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Placed RHP Brian Boehringer on the 15-day disabled
list retroactive to April 21st with a right shoulder strain and
recalled RHP Rodrigo Lopez from Triple-A Las Vegas. Lopez will make
his major league debut on Saturday night against Atlanta's John
Burkett. RHP Woody Williams is being watched day-today after
developing numbness and possible circulation problems in a finger
on his pitching hand after his last start. ... LHP Rodney Myers,
coming off a partially torn rotator cuff is expected to make a
minor league rehab assignment on Sunday. ... RHP Steve Montgomery
experienced soreness in a bullpen workout trying to return from a
right shoulder strain. He was scheduled for an MRI exam on Friday
night.
Marlins-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Florida sent INF Luis Castillo on injury rehab to
Triple-A Calgary. Castillo will join the Cannons for the team's
weekend series in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: LHP Jeff Williams, originally optioned to Triple-A
Albuquerque on April 24, instead has been placed on the disabled
list retroactive to April 20 with a left wrist strain. The Dodgers
requested changing Williams' status and major league baseball
granted it.
Expos-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: LHP Kirk Rueter has been tough on the Expos since
they traded him to San Francisco for Mark Leiter on July 30, 1996.
Rueter (2-1) will start against the Expos on Saturday. So far,
Rueter is unbeaten in seven career starts against Montreal, going
4-0 with a 3.12 ERA. Rueter was 25-12 in 59 games for the Expos
from 1993-96. ... The Giants' defense has been taking a beating.
San Francisco has surrendered an NL-high 19 unearned runs while
committing 17 errors in its first 20 games. ... Giants OF Calvin
Murray, a former first-round pick who spent seven years in the
minors before making the big league club this spring, has had a
considerable impact as one of the team's reserves. He's batting
.407 (11-for-27) and his speed on the bases has ignited some key
rallies for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos became the last team in the majors to play a
game on the grass when they opened a three-game series at San
Francisco's Pacific Bell Park on Friday night. The team's first 20
contests all were played on artificial turf. ... Playing the Expos
is no walk in the park. Heading into Friday night's game at San
Francisco, Montreal pitchers have allowed the fewest walks in the
majors with 47. The Expos ranks ahead of the Atlanta Braves (61)
and Arizona Diamondbacks (68).

<HEADLINE> Police Chief Cited for WTO Chaos  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE M. CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Law enforcement experts hired by the mayor to
determine what went wrong when massive protests disrupted last
year's World Trade Organization meeting say former Police Chief
Norm Stamper should bear the brunt of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   But in their report released Friday, the experts, R.M. McCarthy
and Associates and Robert Louden, also pointed a finger at Mayor
Paul Schell, Assistant Police Chief Ed Joiner and all government
agencies involved in security planning, as well as the
demonstrators and the media.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 protesters mobbed Seattle during the WTO
meetings Nov. 30 through Dec. 5. Overwhelmed police were unable to
control the crowds, forcing the cancellation of opening ceremonies
and leaving more than $2.5 million in vandalism and property damage
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard was called in to clear the protesters, and
more than 500 people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chief Norm Stamper was virtually absent from any role of
leadership or direction related to the preparation and planning for
the World Trade Organization conference,'' the report said, citing
documents and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said they were told that was Stamper's
management style. ''If so, it was a mistake of a large
proportion,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stamper, 55, announced his retirement Dec. 7, just days after
the WTO trade talks collapsed, and left office in February. He
could not be located for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-page report, part one of a larger report due this summer,
focuses exclusively on security planning surrounding the WTO
meetings. Schell hired the independent reviewers to provide an
objective look.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, most prominent among the lessons learned from this
report ... is that planning must begin earlier and be more
thorough,'' Schell said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   An internal report released this month by the Seattle Police
Department also conceded that police were ill-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he would work with the City Council to ensure
that every major event ''will get such a thorough city review that
we will never be caught facing protests of the scale Seattle
experienced during the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to bring an Asian Development Bank meeting to Seattle
has already been scrapped, he said.
