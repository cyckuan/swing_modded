<HEADLINE> U.S. Ex-Im Bank Helps Enhance Exports to Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of President Bill
Clinton's recent visit to six African nations, the U.S.
Export-Import Bank announced Friday the launching of a special
committee to increase exports to Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
A new five-member Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee (SAAC)
chaired by Rev. Dr. Floyd Flake will counsel the Export-Import
Bank on developing policies to strengthen support for U.S. exports
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The congressionally-mandated committee will meet at least twice
a year, for four years, in an open forum.
</P>
<P>
"The potential of the Sub-Saharan market with approximately 700
million people is significant. This advisory committee will help
the Ex-Im Bank improve its efforts to encourage U.S. exporters to
use our loan, guarantee and insurance program," said James A.
Harmon, chairman of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The SAAC represents various sectors of the U.S. economy that
have experience doing business in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the Ex-Im Bank has financed 652 million
U.S. dollars in exports to nine Sub-Saharan African countries. In
fiscal year 1997, 217 million dollars in exports were supported.
</P>
<P>
The bank is a federal government agency that supports U.S. jobs
by financing the sales of U.S. goods and services abroad.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stays Up All Night for Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
spent almost all the night on a series of telephone discussions
with the parties involved in Northern Ireland peace talks, the
White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Clinton had two conversations with Gerry Adams,
leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, to encourage him to agree to a peace deal on the future of
Northern Ireland, said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
Clinton then had a three-way conversation after midnight with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, which led to phone calls to other talks participants,
including John Hume of the moderate nationalist Social and
Democratic Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The president made a call at about 5 a.m. East Daylight-saving
Time to Adams. Clinton also had a long conversation with the U.S.
special envoy to the Northern Ireland negotiations, George
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
However, McCurry would not give details of what Clinton talked
about.
</P>
<P>
"We're at a very critical moment right now," said White House
spokesman Mike McCurry. "It looks like things are going well."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the president had some specific things to do in
these calls but he also generally encouraged the parties to take
advantage of this opportunity to make progress to achieve what
would be a historic agreement for the people of Ireland," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
After laboring through the night, negotiators in Belfast neared
an agreement aimed at ending the 30-year conflict over the British
province Friday.
</P>
<P>
As talks continued Friday morning, Alastair Campbell, spokesman
for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, told reporters that the
deal was "in the bag."
</P>
<P>
At daybreak, the eight participating parties mapping Northern
Ireland's future received a revised draft agreement, running 69
pages, from Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's call last month for negotiators to reach a pact by
midnight Thursday has inspired two weeks of intense negotiations
at Stormont, the center of British administration in east Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, were both in
Belfast for the marathon negotiations that continued through the
night, with all parties motivated by the desire to end years of
bombings, murders and other sectarian violence.

<HEADLINE> China Proposes Principles for Peace Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has put forward
principles for peace restoration in war-torn countries at the
99th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in
Windhoek, Namibia, the Chinese delegation told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
China asked the international community to respect the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the
countries concerned and take into full consideration the national
conditions of those countries.
</P>
<P>
"To help countries emerging from war in their reconstruction,
the international community must, first and foremost, respect the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of the
countries concerned and refrain from interfering in their
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"This principle represents not only the basic norms of the
international law and international relations but also the
prerequisite for countries to carry out cooperation," a member of
the Chinese delegation, Tong Zhiguang, told the conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"China is firmly opposed to the exertion of political and
economic pressure on recipient countries under the pretext of
providing assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
China urged the international community to take into full
consideration the local conditions and respect the choice of the
people there. "The road to development must be suited to each
country's actual conditions."
</P>
<P>
"We are against moves by some countries to impose their own
political model and ideology upon countries emerging from war,"
Tong said.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are inseparable from each other.
Therefore, assistance by the international community should be
directed to address root causes of conflicts, particularly causes
relation to economic and social development questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the repatriation of refugees, China said the question
should be jointly resolved by the countries of origin, sanctuary
countries, donor countries, relocation countries and relevant
international organizations in accordance with the principle of
"international unity and responsibility sharing."
</P>
<P>
"Voluntary repatriation is the most ideal and practical way of
addressing most of the existing refugee questions in the world."
</P>
<P>
Tong said China was ready to work with other countries and
continue to make contributions in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Freezing of Embryos Does Not Affect Children's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Freezing of embryos does not
adversely affect health of the children born after the process,
Swedish doctors reassured Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ulla-Britt Wennerholm and colleagues from the University of
Goteborg, Sweden, compared children born after freezing as embryos
with those born after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) with fresh
embryos, and those born after natural pregnancies up to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
IVF involves the combination of sperm and egg outside the
mother body before it is implanted in the womb. Eggs taken from
the mother can be used either fresh or frozen.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the British medical journal The Lancet, researchers
said that for children born from frozen embryos, they have found
no increase of major malformations or chromosomal abnormalities
compared with other two categories.
</P>
<P>
"Children born after cryopreservation (freezing) as embryos
develop and grow normally up to the age of 18 months," they
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Provocative Acts by Greek Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Friday strongly condemned
the vandalization of the bust of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of
the Republic of Turkey, by Greek Cypriots in Pyla village in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said "We
harshly condemn the new provocative acts which happened in Pyla
village in the buffer zone (in Cyprus) on April 8."
</P>
<P>
The bust of Ataturk was sprayed with blue paint and a Turkish
flag was stolen from a school in Pyla village.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey condemned such "aggressive" acts
which further increase non-confidence atmosphere between the
Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
"We expect officials of the Peace-Keeping Forces of the United
Nations (on the island) to do their best against this ugly act and
to take effective measures to prevent the repetition of such
similar provocative acts," it said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops intervened and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000-strong Turkish troops are reportedly stationed in
the northern part of the divided island to protect the security
of the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> French Economists Suggest ECB Copy American Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Two French economists, Michel
Aglietta and Christian de Boissieu, proposed Friday that the
European Central Bank (ECB) copy the model of the American central
bank so that it can give full transparency to its policy.
</P>
<P>
In a report sent to French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the
two economists expressed the regret that the Maastricht treaty "is
very poor" in stipulating how the ECB will maintain transparency
of its policy-making process.
</P>
<P>
They said that the American model for a central bank is the
best, as the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is responsible for its
monetary policy but in the meantime submits it to the U.S.
Congress twice a year for examination.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, while being independent in decision-making, the ECB
should also publish its policy and submit it to the European
Parliament for approval, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The legitimacy of the monetary policy depends on the
transparency of the central bank and its capacity to make what it
does understood," they added.
</P>
<P>
The ECB will be formally set up on May 1 prior to the launching
of the European single currency euro.

<HEADLINE> Historic Northern Ireland Peace Deal Finally Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited peace deal
resolving three-decade-long conflict over British rule of Northern
Ireland was finally struck on Friday by the political parties
involved in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The deal was scheduled to be signed by Thursday midnight but
delayed due to some thorny issues yet to be sorted out by the
feuding pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics.
</P>
<P>
British government officials said the breakthrough came after
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone on Friday afternoon
with the main pro-British Unionist leader David Trimble, Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and Irish
nationalist leader John Hume.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a Northern Ireland assembly will have 108
seats elected by proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
It will initially be set up as a "shadow body" for about six
months while the British and Irish governments maintain contact
over planned new cross-border bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government will change Articles 2 and 3 of its
constitution which claims the territory of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The British government will also modify the Government of
Ireland Act to include a consent clause.
</P>
<P>
The final agreement will be mailed to every household in
Northern Ireland and put to a referendum on May 22, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will also be held in the Irish Republic, but
probably not on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Association of Air Traffic Controllers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Guild of Air Traffic
Controllers of Zambia (GATCZ) has been suspended from the
International Federation for Air Traffic Controllers Association
(IFATCA), Zambia News Agency ZANA reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision of suspension follows GATCZ's failure to heed
directives from the international body which ordered the Zambian
association not to allow its members to take up jobs in Zimbabwe
when air traffic controllers in that country went on a strike,
ZANA reported.
</P>
<P>
However, ZANA did not clarify when the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
After the suspension which still needs to be endorsed at the
IFATCA meeting to be held next month, the air traffic
controllers' licenses given to Zambians will not be recognized
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted a "reliable" source at the Lusaka International
Airport as saying that after some Zambian controllers left for
Zimbabwe last December, IFATCA sent its president from Belgium to
persuade the Zambians not to take up the jobs of their Zimbabwean
colleagues, which was refused by the Zambian association.
</P>
<P>
The mother body had no choice but to de-register the
association and told it to defend itself at a meeting to be held
in France later this year.
</P>
<P>
Peter Kangai, Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia,
confirmed to ZANA here Friday that 10 Zambian air traffic
controllers who were recruited when their counterparts in
Zimbabwe went on strike to press for better working conditions
are still in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian sources also said that the departure of the 10
officials who are mostly officials in the association has left a
big gap at Lusaka airport which requires for the over-work on the
part of the remaining controllers.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Denies Illegal Entry Into Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Foreign Minister
Theo-Ben Gurirab Friday denied the previous day's claims by
Botswanan President Festus Mogae that Namibian troops illegally
entered Botswana last month.
</P>
<P>
The border crossings allegedly occurred on March 26 at
Kaputura and on March 31 at Mohembo where the Okavango River
feeds in the Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian troops patrolled along a veterinary cordon fence,
20 meters inside Botswana, which is erected as part of the
measures to contain an outbreak last year of contagious cattle
lung disease.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Gurirab said he was surprised and dismayed by
Mogae's allegations and claimed Mogae had contacted neither the
Namibian High Commission in Gaborone, nor Namibia's Foreign
Affairs Ministry about the matter.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has alleged that its troops believed the cordon fence
marked the border. However, Botswana said the border at that
point was clearly marked with beacons and the Namibian government
had been consulted before the erection of the veterinary fence.
</P>
<P>
The incidents are the latest in a row between the two
countries over Botswana's northern border.

governments to promote peace in Northern Ireland, is delighted at
the historic agreement which has just been signed in Belfast,"
said the French Foreign Ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
It said that the agreement "answers the aspiration of the
people of Northern Ireland to put an end to the climate of
violence which during the past 30 years has killed more than 3,000
people in Ulster."

participants in the talks, in particular the unshakeable
determination and will as are shown by the prime ministers of
Great Britain and Ireland," it said.

<P>
It said that the European Union has helped create an
environment favorable to looking for a political solution by
providing economic aid in support of the Northern Ireland peace
process through the International Fund for Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement, which has just been concluded, should allow
ratification of the reconciliation between the communities of the
province and establishment of harmony among all the people in
Northern Ireland," it added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Suspends Talks With Israel on Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Friday suspended talks to
sell gas to Israel because of the "political differences between
Israel and its Arab neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Announcing the government's decision, Minister of Petroleum
Hamdi Ali Abdel Wahab Al-Banbis said Israel's incapacity to erect
a gas network is another reason to freeze the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is not the main consumer of the Egyptian gas," Al-Banbi
said in his remarks, adding that "the talks on the gas pipeline
are suspended at present and are not expected to resume at the
short run."
</P>
<P>
On April 6, Egypt agreed on Israel's request to restart the
talks on the pipeline after a several-month halt.
</P>
<P>
The talks were suspended by Egypt due to the political standoff
between Israel and its Arab neighbors after the Israeli incumbent
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel sought to import gas from countries other than Egypt but
to no avail due to technical and economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt is considering other potential gas importers
than Israel and Jordan such as Turkey which is supposed to import
up to 10 billion cubic meters of liquefied gas a year.
</P>
<P>
The planned Egyptian-Turkish gas project envisages the erection
of a gas-liquefying plant west of northern city of Port Said in
cooperation with U.S. and Italian firms.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Deal Finally Reached </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A historic peace agreement was
finally reached Friday afternoon by the political parties at
Northern Ireland's marathon peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the
political parties of Northern Ireland have reached agreement,"
former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, the talks chairman, told a
final session of the talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"I have been in politics for 30 years and never have I felt
this sense of gratification and responsibility and gratitude that
I feel today," Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which will end the 30-year-long bloody conflict
in the divided British province, was agreed more than 17 hours
after the midnight deadline. The violence has cost the lives of
more than 3,000 people.
</P>
<P>
At the plenary session, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
praised the signatories to the deal for having the courage to bury
their differences.
</P>
<P>
"I believe today that courage has triumphed," Blair said. "I
said when I arrived here on Wednesday night that I felt the hand
of history upon us. Today I hope that the burden of history can at
long last start to be lifted from our shoulders."
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, co-sponsor of the 22-month
talks with Blair, also hailed the deal as a new start for people
across the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
"Today's historic agreement marks a new beginning for all of
us, in Northern Ireland, the island of Ireland and across these
islands," he said after the announcement of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came after U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke
by telephone Friday afternoon with the main pro-British Unionist
leader David Trimble, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern and Irish nationalist leader John Hume.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be put to referenda in Northern Ireland and
in the Irish Republic on May 22.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The 99th
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference ended Friday in
Windhoek, Namibia, after four resolutions were adopted, the
Chinese delegation to the conference told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution on Kosovo, the IPU said it was gravely
concerned about the situation in the region and condemned the
killing of civilians, especially women and children.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for a peaceful solution of the issue and
said the UN Resolution 1160 adopted on March 31 should be seen as
the guideline for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Unrest erupted in Kosovo after clashes between Serbian police
and ethnic Albanians who are seeking independence from the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The IPU resolution affirmed its respect for the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia but called for "a
meaningful self-determination" of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Serbian police force to stop operations against
civilians and relax control over the area. It also asked for free
access to the area of international humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
The document appealed to the parties concerned to return to
the principle of non-violence, engage in peaceful negotiations
and unconditionally cooperate with the international community.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference also adopted resolutions on conflict
resolution, AIDS and foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Irish Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
praised the historic accord on Northern Ireland as "the best
chance for peace in a generation" Friday after he spent almost all
the night on discussing with the negotiators by telephone.
</P>
<P>
"In the days to come, there may be those who will try to
undermine this great achievement, not only with words but perhaps
also with violence," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"All the parties and all the rest of us must stand shoulder to
shoulder to defy any such appeals," he told reporters at the White
House shortly after the agreement was announced in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement that has emerged from the Northern Ireland peace
talks opens the way for the people there to build a society based
on enduring peace, justice and equality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Clinton had two conversations with Gerry Adams,
leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, to encourage him to agree to a peace deal on the future of
Northern Ireland, said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
Clinton then had a three-way conversation after midnight with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern, which led to phone calls to other talks participants,
including John Hume of the moderate nationalist Social and
Democratic Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The president made a call at about 5 a.m. East Daylight-saving
Time to Adams. Clinton also had a long conversation with the U.S.
special envoy to the Northern Ireland negotiations, George
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
However, McCurry would not give details of what Clinton talked
about.
</P>
<P>
"We're at a very critical moment right now," said White House
spokesman Mike McCurry. "It looks like things are going well."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the president had some specific things to do in
these calls but he also generally encouraged the parties to take
advantage of this opportunity to make progress to achieve what
would be a historic agreement for the people of Ireland," McCurry
said.

CAIRO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with visiting Jordanian King Hussein on the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process in Sharm El-Sheikh,
South Sinai, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the efforts made by the United States
and the European Union to break the deadlock of the peace process
on the Palestinian track, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled for a
year due to Israel's construction of settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem and other hard line policies.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Hussein called on Israel to implement the signed
agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the positive Palestinian
stance towards the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority has reportedly accepted a
U.S. proposal to demand a 13.1 percent withdrawal of Israeli troops
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also expressed hope for reviving the talks on
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks with a view to reaching a fair and
comprehensive settlement and allowing the people of the region to
direct their resources to development and construction.
</P>
<P>
Hussein arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh earlier Friday upon an
invitation from President Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have reached
peace treaties with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Justice Seeks Probe of Whitewater Witness Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
has been urging Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to look into
allegations that David Hale, a crucial witness in his Whitewater
investigation, was tainted by payments from Richard Mellon Scaife,
a conservative philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Thursday, the department also cautioned Starr
against a potential conflict of interest in investigating the
matter because Scaife is a major backer of California's Pepperdine
University school of public policy, which Starr had announced he
would abandon the investigation to head last year before
reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder left Starr the option of
having the department itself investigate the matter if Starr felt
constrained by even the appearance of a conflict of interest, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in Little Rock, Arkansas where the Whitewater
investigation is going on, a lawyer seeking to overturn Whitewater
figure Susan McDougal's conviction told reporters that Hale was
"tainted from day one" by cash payments from Scaife, a Pittsburgh
publisher and Clinton critic.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mark Geragos said he had witnesses willing to testify
about what he described as "six-figure" cash payments made to Hale
while he was cooperating in the Whitewater probe.
</P>
<P>
Geragos also said he had contacted witnesses from the American
Spectator magazine who are willing to testify that Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr knew of the payments being made to Hale.
</P>
<P>
Geragos said he would ask that McDougal's conviction be thrown
out or that her sentence of 24 months be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Hale pleaded guilty in March 1994 to Whitewater charges of
conspiracy and making false statements on the Whitewater case, and
was sentenced to 25 months in prison and a halfway house.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank
(Ex-Im Bank) has offered to provide short-term export financing of
up to 1 billion U.S. dollars for U.S. exports to Indonesia, the
bank announced in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is encouraged by the efforts of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Indonesia government to
address financing and banking issues that are critical to
Indonesia's economic future, the bank noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the bank approved a similar increase in
short-term financing to South Korea, which has helped continue
U.S. exports through the use of letters of credit and other export
financing program. The bank also initiated a cooperative effort in
February among the Group of Seven and 12 other export credit
agencies to maintain financing for exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank is a federal government agency that helps the
U.S. jobs by financing U.S. exports to other countries. In fiscal
year 1997, the Bank supported 15 billion dollars in U.S. exports.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Trade Deficit Increases in 1997 </HEADLINE>

<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' trade deficit in 1997
increased by 4.2 percent, reaching 1,259.3 million Cyprus pounds
(2,518.6 million U.S. dollars), according to latest official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
A report by the official Department of Statistics and Research
released Friday attributed the deficit increase to a strong import
and a weak export.
</P>
<P>
The imports last year totaled 1,899.3 million Cyprus pounds
(about 3,798.6 million dollars) in 1997, or 2.2 percent more than
those in the previous year. The exports fell by 1.4 percent to
stand at 640 million pounds (about 1,280 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the European Union (EU) was still
Cyprus' leading trade partner.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the EU supplied 47.6 percent of
Cyprus' total imports in 1997, compared to a share of 48.6 percent
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries last year absorbed 49.4 per cent of the

<HEADLINE> Russia Backs U.N. Peace Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia will try to give a new
boost to the U.N. Security Council's efforts to push the Cyprus
peace process forward, a Russian diplomat said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency quoted Russian ambassador to Cyprus, Georgi
Mouradov as saying that Moscow is trying "to give new support" to
the Security Council's effort through a debate on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"We will see how this will develop, but we will definitely
continue supporting the Security Council's and the
Secretary-General's efforts," Mouradov told local reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue under discussion now is "when a meeting of
the Security Council permanent members could take place and what
its result could be".
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat said that the Security Council president
could issue a statement or take some other concrete steps to back
the Cyprus peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov reiterated his country's support to the
U.N. Secretary-General's good offices mission in Cyprus and the
efforts of his special advisor for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia supports the continuation of talks
between the leaders of the two communities of Cyprus aiming at
finding a just and viable solution.
</P>
<P>
Mouradov made these remarks following a warning from the
Russian government that the situation in Cyprus is particularly
dangerous after the refusal of the Turkish Cypriot leadership to
return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday
that the outcome of the recent visits to Cyprus by the Russian and
U.S. envoys prove that the situation on the island is serious.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed is an intense effort by the permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council on the basis of their permanent
coordination in such a way as to break today's deadlock," the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and U.S. envoys visited the island last week, but
they failed to persuade the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has refused to participate in the bicommunal peace
talks due to the European Union (EU)'s decision to start
accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third
of the island following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin Friday welcomed Indonesia's agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, and hoped the agreement would restore financial
stability and growth in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, a 117-point economic reform program and also
the third such agreement between Indonesia and the IMF, was agreed
after three weeks of talks between the two sides, which will
overhaul the way business is done in Indonesia if fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the agreement between the government of Indonesia
and the International Monetary Fund on a revised letter of
intent," Rubin said in a statement. "This agreement supports a
comprehensive program designed to restore financial stability and
growth in Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States and the international community
have a major stake in seeing Indonesia succeed in its efforts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Rubin called on Jakarta to follow the
examples set by South Korean and Thailand, countries hard-hit by
the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Korea and Thailand really have taken hold of reform and made
it their own," Rubin said after his talks with Philippines
President Fidel Ramos in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"While they obviously have enormous challenges to deal with
going forward, they really have made these programs their own and
that is what hopefully Indonesia will do," he said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Calls on Angolans to Dispel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Government of
National Unity Friday called on its people to unite to dispel
animosity and overcome difficulties caused by the prolonged civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The government of national unity and reconciliation made this
call on the first anniversary of its establishment. The
government of national unity and reconciliation was set up on
April 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
National unity and reconciliation are the prerequisites for
achieving economic growth and solving other social problems
facing the people, the government said in a statement, calling on
the Angolans to devote themselves to the restoration and
development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
But the government regretted that it failed to achhieve its
target because the efforts to carry out its economic and social
policies were greatly hindered by the instability in many parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government believed that peace is its prime goal
for without a peaceful environment, the national economy could
not be revitalized and civil rights could not be exercised.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the establishment of the government of
national unity and reconciliation symbolized a new chapter of the
Angolan history and it was an important step toward peace,
bringing new hope for the Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
The government is dominated by the People's Liberation
Movement of Angola which won the first multi-party elections in
1992. It has included some other political parties occupying
seats in People's Assembly, mainly the members of the biggest
opposition party, the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA). Four of the 28 ministers in the government are
UNITA members.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Defense Minister Veiga Simao, who just finished his
three-day visit to the southern African state, told the press
that encouraging progress had been made recently in the peace
process and now it has come to the final stage.
</P>
<P>
Simao said he was pleased that the two warring sides had
pledged to complete the peace process soon.
</P>
<P>
In this critical stage, all sides should make more efforts to
finish the remaining tasks stipulated in the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Accord, said the visiting Portuguese defense minister.

<HEADLINE> Zambia: Hard Discs Containing State Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thieves stole two computer hard
discs containing information on Zambian government houses, motor
vehicles and parliamentary queries Thursday night from the
Ministry of Works and Supply.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation Television
(ZNBC-TV) Friday evening quoted police spokesman Beenwell
Chimfwembe as confirming the break-in, which was discovered early
morning.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the theft will affect the on-going
sale of government pool houses to sitting tenants.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe said that apart from the two hard discs, the
thieves also stole two computer screens, two keyboards and two
mice and destroyed one disc box container.
</P>
<P>
He said there are no leads at present as to who might have
been involved but the police are actively pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the property stolen is estimated at nine
million Kwacha (about 5,000 U.S. Dollars) and the motive is at
present not known.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says to Continue Struggle for United Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
vowed on Friday to continue struggle for a "free and independent"
Ireland even after a historic agreement on Northern Irish future
was reached in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the agreement that will end
three-decade conflict in Northern Ireland, Adams said Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, would remain
"committed to Irish republican aspiration" and would go on seeking
a free and independent Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This is a phase in our struggle. That struggle must continue
until it reaches its final goal. Sinn Fein has a vision of the
future of an Ireland free from division and conflict, a society in
which there is equality for all citizens and where all our people
can live together in peace," Adams told reporters in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The deal, preserving Northern Ireland's links with Britain
while building closer ties with Ireland, marks the biggest
upheaval in the province's political arrangements since the island
of Ireland was partitioned in 1921.
</P>
<P>
Adams added that the peace agreement contained some positive
elements but others would need to be worked on.
</P>
<P>
"But for now it is time to draw a breath. It is time to
reflect. Republicans and nationalists will come to this document
with scepticism but also with hope," Adams said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Friday evening that he was delighted at the
Northern Ireland peace accord and congratulated leaders involved
in the peace process, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that this agreement will bring the opportunity
for peace and prosperity to the people of Northern Ireland,"
Mandela said in a statement as the news of the long-awaited peace
agreement flashed around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to encourage all parties to work toward the
successful implementation of the details of the agreement."
</P>

of Northern Ireland," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The South African president commended the leadership of the
people of Northern Ireland and the prime ministers of Ireland and
Britain for their bold and unstinting efforts to bring peace and
stability to the area.
</P>
<P>
"Their leadership will continue to be of crucial importance in
the weeks and months ahead."
</P>

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Ready for Big Push on Junta Remnants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force ECOMOG is preparing a big push on the last remnants of
Sierra Leone's junta forces and rebel allies in the eastern part
of the country, especially in the diamond-rich Kano region.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has started a major battle on the
highway between the northern town of Makeni and Kano district,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The Kano-Makeni highway witnessed heavy artillery exchanges
Thursday between ECOMOG and the junta forces and allied
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was initiated by an ECOMOG rapid reaction force
to dislodge the junta forces from two miles stretch of the road,
while in the past two days there had been serious disrupting
traffic.
</P>
<P>
There have been several ambushes, including one on an ECOMOG
truck Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's mop-up operation along the highway, 20 junta
soldiers were killed with a large amount of arms and ammunition
seized.
</P>
<P>
Col. Maxwell Kobe, who is the commander of the ECOMOG
operation, assured residents in the area Thursday that ECOMOG was
now pointing to liberate the whole Kano region once and for all.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 19 junta soldiers who previously
surrendered to ECOMOG were three days ago killed after they
re-grouped and launched an attack in a village in Kabala,
northern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the remnants of the junta forces and RUF rebels are
still holding out in the eastern part of the country and have
reportedly been killing civilians in the areas under their
control, along with looting, raping and other destruction
activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Surplus Expected to Topple 50 Billion U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the continuing
robust economic performance in this country, the government could
reap as much as over 50 billion U.S. dollar surplus for fiscal
1998, according to mass media here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office raised its
surplus prediction from 8 billion dollars to 18 billion dollars.
Some private analysts are predicting surplus could hit 80 billion
dollars. Any government surplus would be the first since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Official figures are available for October through February,
the first five months of the fiscal year, and the budget office
has made public its estimate of the size of the March deficit.
According to those figures, the cumulative deficit for the six
months was 71 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fed's Board of Governors said in a written
statement:"The size of the Fiscal Year 1998 federal surplus
remains highly uncertain with official and private estimates
varying over a considerable range,"
</P>
<P>
But tax revenues from the April 15 tax deadline will boost
government revenues and bring the budget back into the black for
the year. If the surplus for April and the rest of the budget year
are equal to the 89 billion dollars surplus posted in the second
half of fiscal 1997, then the surplus for all of 1998 would amount
to the 18 billion dollars forecast by the Congressional Budget
Office.
</P>
<P>
If revenue continues to grow in the second half of the fiscal
year, the surplus for 1998 could reach 75 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> UK Former PM Major Hails N. Irish Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Former prime minister
John Major on Friday warmly congratulated Tony Blair on the
Northern Ireland agreement reached a few hours ago.
</P>
<P>
"He's taken risks. It was right to do so," Major told the BBC,
adding: "I hope he enjoys the success he has had. He deserves to."
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister of Conservative party, who was
defeated by Blair in last May's general election and resigned as
Conservative party leader, hailed the agreement as a beacon of
hope and he was delighted the agreement was finally struck.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely delighted. I haven't of course had a chance to
see the details of the agreement, but the fact that there has been
an agreement -- and across such a wide spread of opinion -- is
extremely good news," Major said.
</P>
<P>
Major paved the way for Friday's deal by negotiating the 1993
Downing Street Declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said he was under no illusions that some very difficult
decisions still lay ahead but he hoped the deal would work.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Compliance With Sanction on UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations sanction chief
warned Thursday that the U.N. will not condone any of its members
violating the sanction against Angola's former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
Njugura Mahugu, Chairman of the United Nations Security
Council Committee on Sanction against the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), warned Thursday that the
United Nations will not condone any of its members violating the
sanction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy, who arrived here on Wednesday to discuss with
Zambian officials on the security along Zambian-Angolan border,
said that all U.N. member countries are required to comply with
the sanction.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when touring Maheba refugee camp in the
northwest of Zambia, according to the Zambia National
Broadcasting Corporation Television.
</P>
<P>
The camp are accommodating about 27,000 Angolan refugees among
others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was alleged that UNITA soldiers have replaced
refugees at Maheba refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Manuel Augusto charged on March 5
that Zambians are supplying arms to UNITA through Zambian border
area.
</P>
<P>
He warned that while his country does not wish to have a
repeat of the Congo-Brazzaville and Congo-Kinshasa incidents
where the Angolan government participated in dislodging the
governments there.
</P>
<P>
"Angola does not rule out any option if UNITA does not stop
getting arms from some territories."
</P>
<P>
But Zambian President Frederick Chiluba on March 12 denied
that his government has any involvement in the supply of arms to
any country.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said that his government will
investigate into the allegations that Zambia is being used as a
transit point for arms to UNITA, which fought a civil war of
about 20 years against the Angolan government after the country's
independence in 1976.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Recognize Turkish Cypriot Regime, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. ambassador to Cyprus,
Kenneth Brill has reiterated that his country would not recognize
the breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting Friday with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, Brill said "we're working toward the
goal of a bicommunal, bizonal federation in Cyprus and the direct
talks that are necessary to let that happen," Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts to resume direct talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides to settle the Cyprus problem are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
"It's rather clear that we are working hard to move the Cyprus
issue back to a direct negotiation," the U.S. ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that U.S. State Department Special Cyprus
Coordinator Tom Miller will be back in Cyprus later this month and
Presidential Emissary, Richard Holbrooke, will return in May.
</P>
<P>
Both men were in Cyprus last week for contacts with the
leaders of the two communities on the island in a bid to get peace
talks going.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile we're having a variety of other contacts to keep
the process that ambassador Holbrooke is engaged in moving
forward, Brill said, but refrained from revealing his contacts.
</P>
<P>
After European Union (EU)'s reconfirmation last December that
accession talks with Cyprus would open this March, Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash announced he will not participate in
negotiations unless his breakaway state in northern island is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
So far peace talks between the two sides have been carried out
by the leaders of the two communities in accordance with the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktash now insists that the peace talks be taken
place between the "two states," a position rejected the Greek
Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Repubic of Northern Cyprus" in northern part of the island, which
was only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Most UK Businesses Unaffected to Internet: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Despite the attention being given
in the media, Internet is something that still doesn't seem to
affect most UK businesses, a new report by the Internet Marketing
and Development Agency (IMDA) showed.
</P>
<P>
From a telephone survey of 1000 businesses, the IMDA research
found that although 98 percent of those called had "heard of the
Internet", only 12 percent believed that it had any bearing on
their present business.
</P>
<P>
Findings showed that most British businesses had been so lax in
their understanding of the Internet that they had ignored the
opportunity offered to use their company names for domain
registration.
</P>
<P>
Only 14 percent of the companies surveyed had registered domain
names and fewer than five percent realised that there was any
issue of brand or marketing strategy when picking a domain name.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of trading names have been bought by
rouge companies who are seeking to sell them back at inflated
costs.
</P>
<P>
Many domain names which could be registered as little as 60
pounds(100 U.S. dollars) are now changing hands for thousands of
pounds, the report said.
</P>
<P>
British businesses are falling behind their American
counterparts and facing exclusion from global commerce on the
Internet, the IMDA report warned.

<HEADLINE> Investors Pour More into Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Investors poured their money
into U.S. stocks, bonds and mutual funds with a record 37.5
billion U.S. dollars in net new cash in March, the Wall Street
Journal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The historic investing surge, which means investors put about
1.7 billion U.S. dollars a day into mutual funds during the month,
easily surpassed the previous monthly record of 32.7 billion
U.S. dollars in net mutual-fund investing set in January 1996, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts caution that the statistics are the latest sign
that investors have gotten overheated about the seemingly
unstoppable market. Now even veteran fund-industry officials were
struck by the enormous numbers released Thursday, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Most of the torrent of money has been going, as usual, into
stock funds rather than bond funds, and creating a kind of
feedback effect: The roaring stock market attracts more cash from
investors, and that helps the market soar further.
</P>
<P>
Stock funds took in an estimated net 27.5 billion U.S.
dollars in March, according to the Investment Company Institute,
a mutual-fund trade group that makes the monthly estimates. That
sum was 14 percent more than February's 24.2 billion U.S.
dollars. It's also the third-largest monthly intake for stock
funds on record. Stock funds took in more than 28 billion U.S.
dollars on two occasions, January 1997 and January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that a lot of this mutual-fund cash came from
paychecks into individual retirement accounts and corporate
retirement plans. But some of it may be coming from investors who
are selling closely held businesses and investing the proceeds in
the stock market via mutual funds, it said.
</P>
<P>
But some reports indicated that investors were drawing more
money from than putting back into stock funds over the past year.
So some analysts ask if individual investors are truly pushing up
stock prices with their fund purchases.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Continue Suffering from Loss of Revenues: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would continue to
suffer losses of revenues in the third quarter of this year due to
the inability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to revive oil prices, an economic report said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly report, Al Shall Economic Consultants, an
independent non-government counseling and predicting body, said
the OPEC agreement on cutting oil production would not have a
noticeable effect on shoring up world oil prices as it fails to
cut its oil production to the minimum level of 1.6 million barrels
a day.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Members last month reached an agreement, under which
the signatories would cut oil production by a total of 1.245
million barrels per day from April 1 to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait pledged to reduce its oil production by 125,000 barrels,
accounting for 5 percent of its total production quota.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shall, downplayed the agreement, saying it has failed to
tackle the vital issue of overproduction despite cooperation from
non-OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
It forecast the downward pressure on oil prices would reach its
climax in the second and third quarters this year.

<HEADLINE> Black and Carlsen Qualify for Salem Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's unseeded Byron Black
saved himself from a cliff-hanging battle to qualify for the men's
singles final of the Salem Open Hong Kong tennis tournament, with
a three-set win over Canada's Sebastien Lareau on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
And eighth-seeded Dane Kenneth Carlsen became the only seed of
the week-long tournament to qualify for the championship final,
after his semi-final victory over Sweden's Thomas Johansson.
</P>
<P>
Black saved three match points in the thrilling semi-final
which lasted two hours and 40 minutes before he won 6-7 (5/7),
7-5, 7-6 (7/4).
</P>
<P>
Black looked to be on his way to seal up a victory after
leading 5-2 in the final set and serving for the match.
</P>
<P>
But a determined Lareau made unbelievable efforts to force the
match to a tiebreak, which brought Black to the edge of a defeat.
</P>
<P>
"He (Lareau) seems to play better when he's down," Black
admitted after the win.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Black is to face Denmark's eighth seed
Kenneth Carlsen, who upset an off-form Swede Thomas Johansson in
the other semi-final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Seeking his first ATP-Tour title win after turning professional
in 1992, the 24-year-old Dane proved himself too strong for the
third-seeded Swede by sweeping his opponent two sets to none, 6-2,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I played more steady. It just worked a little bit
better... came out very strong and I was feeling very confident,"
Carlsen, ranked 76th in the world, said after the match.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't make the mistakes -- I let him make them instead," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Carlsen has advanced to the final of
the Salem Open after three appearances.
</P>
<P>
This year's Salem Open was the first ATP tournament where
players were allowed to receive on-court coaching. But Carlsen
said he did not need his coach to come on court because "I was
playing well."
</P>
<P>
"I did not make many mistakes," he added.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen had advanced to the semifinals with a 7-5, 6-1 victory
over qualifier Neville Godwin of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 43rd-ranked Johansson beat Australian Sandon Stolle 7-6
(8-6), 7-5 in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen was the only one out of the eight seeds of the event to
survive for the final. Top seed and defending champion Michael
Chang was ousted in the first round, with his left knee injury
greatly limiting his trademark swift on-court movement.

<HEADLINE> Two Somali Factions Bury Hatchet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from the Sa'ad and
Suleman sub-clans of Habar Gidir has concluded a largely
applauded peace agreement over the armed conflict between the two
sides in the Somali coastal town of Hobyo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Friday after over 10 well known
businessmen and highly respected traditional elders left
Mogadishu on a small Cesna plane early in the week to stop the
hostility in Hobyo which began late last month.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued in Hobyo Town, 650 km
northeast of the capital, the two sub-clans have agreed to
separate their combat militiamen, retreating militiamen each side
30 km backwards from the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Sa'ad people would be in El-Du'ale village 30
km west of Hobyo, while the Sulemans would withdraw their four
technical vehicles to Dawa'ole village, 30km south of Hobyo.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the two sub-clans also agreed upon the
restoration of properties looted or confiscated during the armed
confrontations, which include small arms and other valuable
equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement read to reporters on the VHF radio
in Mogadishu Saturday, the Sa'ad sub-clan has accepted the blame
for igniting the two-day fighting which led to the death of 13
people while more than 15 others sustained gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
The Suleman people were driven out of the town in the second
day of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 12-member joint committee was established for
peace promotion activities between the two sides in Hobyo, a
central coastal Town which is rich in marine resources. The two
sub-clans have been living together on exporting shark fins and
lobsters to the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the two sides is believed to have been
triggered when gunmen from the Suleman sub-clan ambushed and
killed a lobster exporting businessman in Mogadishu on March 26.
</P>
<P>
Since then, prominent figures and businessmen from both sides
have been on the hiding or trying to find a way in which they
could end the hostility.

<HEADLINE> Paris National Opera Ballet Debuts in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua)-- The world-renowed Paris National
Opera Ballet staged its premier performance in Beijing this
evening, receiving resounding acclaim from an audience which
included Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
The ballet, recommended by President Chirac as an "envoy of
dancing art", treated the audience to the classical masterpiece
"Giselle".
</P>
<P>
Prior to the performance, Jiang met the head of the art troupe,
Hugues Gall, and some leading dancers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended a warm welcome to the French artists, noting
that their performance was an important event in cultural exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The governments of both countries have attached great
importance to this visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and President Jacques Chirac have both referred to the
performance in letters to each other, and they both wrote
inscriptions for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Gall agreed that the performance will usher in a new era for
exchanges between art communities and even the whole sphere of
culture in France and China.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1661, the Paris National Opera Ballet is one of
the world's oldest ballet troupes.
</P>
<P>
Based on two poems by the German poet Heinrich Heine and the
French poet Victor Hugo, respectively, "Giselle", which tells the
story of the love between country girl Giselle and Albrecht the
Count, is considered the very essence of the romantic ballet
movement.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 French artists joined hands with some 80 Chinese
musicians this evening and jointly presented the romantic story
based on the original 1841 version.
</P>
<P>
The French National Opera Ballet, at the invitation of the
Chinese Ministry of Culture, will present two more performances at
the Great Hall of the People on April 12 and 13.

<P>
SIEM REAP, CAMBODIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk returned Saturday to the historic northern town
of Siem Reap -- home of the fabled 12th century Angkor Wat temple
complex -- after a three-month stay in China for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
This was the king's first trip home since pardoning his son
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and setting in motion a Japanese-brokered
peace plan for the fractured nation.
</P>
<P>
The king and queen were greeted at the airport by First Prime
Minister Ung Huot, President of the National Assembly Chea Sim and
other government officials and Chinese Charge d'Affaires She
Chunshu.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who had canceled all public
engagements until the end of April due to his mother's death last
month, was not present for the king's return.
</P>
<P>
The second prime minister is expected to arrive in Siem Reap at
the beginning of May to hold talks with the king, said his senior
adviser.
</P>
<P>
The king will also meet with his son Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
former first prime minister, who ended his nearly nine-months of
self-exile after receiving the king's pardon.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who is now in Thailand, was deposed by Hun Sen
following a conflict last July. He returned to Cambodia for a
brief four-day respite beginning March 30.
</P>
<P>
The king said at the airport that he was very happy to come
home and hoped his country would achieve true national
reconciliation as early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Privatize 3 State-Owned Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Mines and
Energy has announced that preparations are finalized to privatize
three state-owned companies, namely the Kalub Gas Company, the
Tantalum Exploration Project and the Adola Gold Mine.
</P>
<P>
Izedin Ali, Minister of Mines and Energy, was quoted Saturday
by the official Ethiopian News Agency as saying that bidders have
proposed initial offers following the auction to privatize the
Kalub Gas Company in accordance with government decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he said, the company had sold stakes to individuals
willing to work in partnership with the government. But after a
policy amendment, the government has put up its 85 percent stake
in the company for auction.
</P>
<P>
Various companies have appeared at the auction for the
Tantalum Exploration Project, Ali said, adding that negotiations
are underway to either extend an invitation for another bid or
look for an alternative as bidder companies failed to meet the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are also underway with winners at the auction to
privatize the Adola Gold Mine, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government believes that the companies could be
more productive if transferred into the hands of the private
sector as they demand huge investment, skilled manpower and the
application of modern technology.

Exchanges Between Medium-Sized and Small Enterprises in the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) countries will be held October
8-14 this year in Yantai City in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
This is another important event for the coastal city, following

the city's mayor Yang Jinjing said today.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the seminar is "friendship, cooperation,
development and prosperity", and it aims at enhancing
technological exchanges and cooperation between medium and small
enterprises in APEC member countries so as to promote regional
economic development, Yang said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Bring Pressure on Israel, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
said Saturday that U.S. Mideast Peace Envoy Dennis Ross will push
Israel to accept the U.S. peace proposal in another round of
shuttle diplomacy in Mideast region later this month.
</P>
<P>
"Ross will be carrying nothing new when he returns to the
region later this month," Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat
told the Cairo-based Voice of Arab Radio.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected back in the Mideast in what is viewed as his
last bid to press the U.S. initiative via quiet diplomacy to break
the year-old deadlock in Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that Ross aims at getting an answer from Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the U.S. proposal on Israeli
pullback from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly wants substantial further Israeli
withdrawal accompanied by security cooperation from the
Palestinians. Israel said it can accept no more than 9 percent
before beginning talks on final borders, while the Palestinians
have reportedly accepted in principle the U.S. ideas.
</P>
<P>
During his shuttle tour in the region last month, Ross floated
verbally most of the ideas included in the U.S. initiative, he
said. The U.S. has not publically or officially announced its
initiative yet.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expected that the coming visit to the region of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, which apparently overlaps Ross' tour,
will help press the Israeli government to accept the
U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
Blair plans next week a multi-leg tour to the region, his first
since taking over Britain's premiership. Britain is now holding
the rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled for a year over
Israeli construction of a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
and long-delayed troop redeployment in the West bank.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hails Northern Ireland Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Saturday
hailed the historic Northern Ireland peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
said the deal shows that "wherever there is a political will by
the parties involved, as well as international support,
long-standing and difficult problems can finally be resolved to
the benefit of peace and prosperity for all."
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited peace agreement was announced in Belfast on
Friday evening after a marathon talk between the concerned parties
and was aimed at ending nearly 30 years of strife in the area.
</P>
<P>
The rival parties and the British and Irish governments have
agreed to hold referenda on new institutions and the future of the
disputed British province. The agreement preserves Northern
Ireland's links with Britain while building its closer ties with
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"After achieving the accord on North Ireland, a continuation
of present situation in Cyprus and the occupation of 37 percent
of the island's territory by Turkey, constitutes an historic
anachronism and poses a great responsibility for everyone of us
in resolving the Cyprus problem," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister expressed the hope that the
international factor will now decisively turn its attention
toward Cyprus in reaching a just solution.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Cleared over Alleged Arms Supply to UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official Saturday
cleared Zambia over its alleged involvement in arms supply to
Angola's opposition movement, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held here with Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba, Njuguna Mahugu, chairman of the U.N. Security Council
committee on sanctions against UNITA, said the findings he has
gathered so far showed that there is no trace of Zambia's alleged
involvement in the arms supply to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
These remarks made by Mahugu, also Kenya's ambassador and
permanent representative to the U.N., came after he made a
physical check on some areas in Zambia's North Western Province
which borders Angola, including the city of Zambezi and Meheba
refugee camp in Solwezi, accommodating about 27,000 Angolan
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said he did not find anything that can link
Zambia to the allegations that the concerned areas are being used
as supply points for arms supply or training grounds of UNITA
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
People in those areas told him that as far as they were
concerned, they did not see any strange persons or any training
of soldiers, said Mahugu.
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not see any trace of heavy traffic except
a small number of people doing cross-border trading when he
visited the border between Zambia and Angola in Zambezi in the
company of Zambian government officials.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahugu urged Zambia to continue supporting the peace
process in Angola by implementing the sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council in 1997 to force UNITA to comply with the
resolutions of the Lusaka Peace Protocol signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mahugu, who had visited the Democratic Republic of Congo,
South Africa and Angola before he came to Zambia, arrived in
Lusaka Wednesday for a three-day investigation mission to find
out if the allegations against Lusaka are true.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Zambia has been supplying arms to UNITA
and the land is used to train UNITA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Augusto, Angola's Ambassador to Zambia, also made the
allegation on March 3 at a news briefing in Lusaka where he even
warned Zambia of military aggression if the development can not
be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has denied the allegation by assuring Mahugu that his
government is committed to the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president noted that it will be "absurd" for
Zambia which has been so instrumental in fostering peace in
Angola by hosting the signing of the Lusaka Peace Protocol to
destroy what has already been built.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth that aircraft were flying from Zambia into
Angola," he said, adding that since the allegations were made,
his country "has left no stone unturned" in the search for truth.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated that Zambia will work closely with Angola
to enhance good neighborly ties and restore peace to that country
which has been ravaged with a civil war for nearly 20 years.

<HEADLINE> North-South Korean Talks Open in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK)
ended their first round of vice-ministerial level talks in Beijing
this evening, with both sides expressing the hope for improvement
of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour-long talks ended after both sides made clear their
basic stances and agreed to resume their discussions tomorrow. The
talks proceeded "in an open and friendly way" with both sides
hoping for "sincere cooperation", according to the ROK side.
</P>
<P>
This represented the first inter-Korean government-level
contact in nearly four years, and it followed the conclusion of
the inconclusive second round of the Four-Party Korean peace talks
in Geneva March 21.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing talks, which started at 16:00 and ended at 18:00
today, discussed supplies of food and fertilizer from the ROK to
the DPRK, meetings of separated families, exchange of special
envoys and implementation of the North-South Basic Agreement
signed in 1991, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chun Kum Chul, counsellor of the DPRK Administration Council,
heads a five-member delegation, while Jeong Se Hyun, vice-minister
of the ROK National Unification Board, also leads a five-member
delegation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who flew to Beijing earlier today, was quoted as saying,
"I came to this meeting with a lot of hope and expectation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this meeting will turn out to be a watershed in
improving North-South ties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jeong said that today's talks were proceeding "quite well",
adding "We must secure a turning point for improving South-North
relations so that we may bring about joy and hope to the whole
Korean people, who are looking forward to reconciliation and
co-prosperity."
</P>
<P>
He said the new ROK government "considers the achievement of
peace on the Korean Peninsula, and reconciliation and cooperation
between the south and north as top priorities, and has taken
measures for these priorities to be achieved."
</P>
<P>
An official from the ROK Embassy here said he did not know ``how
long the talks will last, as it depends on the progress of the
talks".
</P>
<P>
It was the DPRK which proposed Beijing as the venue for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
China is the only country in the world which maintains formal
diplomatic ties with all three political powers directly involved
in the Korean Peninsula -- the DPRK, the ROK and the U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Young people from Macao and the
Chinese mainland gathered here today to mark the fifth anniversary
of the promulgation of the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (Macao SAR).
</P>
<P>
The Macao Basic Law was passed at the First Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress on March 31, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more and more people from both Macao
and the mainland have been studying the basic law, and young
people in Macao especially have made great efforts to publicize
the basic law.
</P>
<P>
Kon Hoi In, vice-chairman of the All-China Youth Federation and
director of the Youth Committee of the Macao Chamber of Commerce,
told today's symposium that the Macao Basic Law has formulated the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Macao people
governing Macao".
</P>
<P>
It needs the active participation of all Macao residents in all
kinds of political and social affairs to implement these
principles, as required by the basic law, Kon added.
</P>
<P>
He said Macao is now in the critical period of its late
transition period, pointing out that unremitting hard work by the
younger generation is needed to build a bright future for Macao.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that young people in both Macao and the
Chinese mainland would work hand in hand to contribute more to the
smooth transition of Macao and to maintaining prosperity and
stability in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Youth representatives from Beijing's economic and cultural
communities and members of the All-China Youth Federation attended
the symposium and discussed with their Macao counterparts how to
increase exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the Youth Committee of the Macao Chamber of
Commerce arrived in Beijing on April 10 at the invitation of the
All-China Youth Federation.

<HEADLINE> Top Procurator Calls for Rectification of Procuratorate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Han Zhubin, procurator-general of
China's Supreme People's Procuratorate, today ordered a stern
rectification of the country's juridical sector, vowing to
resolutely punish procurators who violate the law.
</P>
<P>
Han's order came in the wake of the exposure of a fatal
accident committed by Tan Anzhou, former chief procurator of the
People's Procuratorate of Heishan County, in northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
On November 29, 1997, Tan killed two cyclists while driving a
car under the influence of alcohol, and tried to cover up his
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Tan unsuccessfully attempted to block the investigation into
the accident by the local police.
</P>
<P>
Han urged procurators at all levels to learn a deep lesson from
Tan's case and increase their self-education and self-examination.
</P>
<P>
"The procuratorial sector must be overhauled to avoid similar
cases, and violators of the laws and regulations must be dealt with
severely," Han said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Supreme People's Procuratorate decided at a
meeting Friday that it would deal with in the near future on Tan's
case and another 22 cases involving procurators.
</P>
<P>
A work team led by Zhao Hong, deputy procurator-general, is
in Liaoning to supervise the handling of Tan's case, Han said.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, in a
meeting with South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki here this
evening, said that good prospects exist for cooperation in a
variety of areas between China and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He recalled his visit to South Africa at the end of last year,
when he signed a communique on the establishment of diplomatic
relations with South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral ties have been developing well since the
forging of diplomatic relations. He added that exchanges between the
two sides have been greatly expanded.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for the unremitting efforts
made by Mbeki for the normalization of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China places great importance on its relations
with South Africa. "Since China is a large country in Asia, and South
Africa is an influential nation in Africa, the further development
of relations between the two countries is of great significance for
the promotion of Asia-Africa ties," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is prepared to enhance exchanges, mutual
understanding and mutual trust with South Africa so as to promote
the development of bilateral relations in a stable manner.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the new South Africa is playing an ever-more
important role in international affairs, especially in African
affairs. He added that China is ready to reinforce consultations
and cooperation with South Africa in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that South Africa is prepared to learn from China as
they develop their respective economies. He added that his nation
is willing to promote friendship and cooperation in a
comprehensive way.

<HEADLINE> IPR Protection Benefits Sino-US Trade Cooperation: Pincus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Enhancing the protection of
intellectual property rights is beneficial to Sino-US commercial
ties, Andrew Pincus, general counsel of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, said during the ninth Sino-US Commercial Law Seminar
here this week.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and China are societies showing great
creativity in movies, recordings, computer software, and all other
kinds of creative spheres, said Pincus. Therefore, it is important
for talented people in both countries to reap the benefits of
their creations.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that China had made progress in intellectual property
rights protection, and said that he was always confident in
China's efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that China's intellectual property rights system
has seen rapid advances since it was set up in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs reportedly confiscated 9.37 million illegal
publications, and audio and visual products, including 5.03
million pirated compact discs last year; they also closed down
five underground pirate CD production lines.
</P>
<P>
China is continuing to improve its legislation and law
enforcement in this field.
</P>
<P>
As for the two countries' legislation in the economic and trade
areas, Pincus said, one of the most significant clauses in the
Sino-US joint statement made when Chinese President Jiang Zemin
visited Washington last November was a commitment to mutually
explore commercial law issues.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the two nations were to establish a
liaison group to seek cooperation in the field of commercial law
and arbitration.
</P>
<P>
One of the results of this endeavor is the Sino-US commercial
law seminar, which is hosted in turn by China's Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the U.S. Commerce
Department since the 1980s. This year's seminar featured
commercial arbitration and anti-dumping issues.
</P>
<P>
Pincus pointed out: "The legal framework provides a structure
that allows economic relationships to function. The stronger the
legal system, the stronger those relationships can become.
</P>
<P>
"As our economic relationship grows, necessarily more issues
will arise. But we can discuss them as friends, and come to mutual
understandings."

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity Threatens Nigeria's Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's five political parties
may ask the government to shift the April 25 national assembly
election, if the current nationwide fuel scarcity continues.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Magaji Abdullahi, national chairman of
the National Center Party of Nigeria, at a press conference
Friday in Abuja, the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi said unless the government immediately moves to
ensure adequate supply of fuel, the parties would have no choice
but ask for postponement.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to wonder how we could have a successful national
assembly election in a couple of weeks in the face of the biting
fuel scarcity all over the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman disclosed that the party leaders have been
meeting over the issue "and may soon make a formal request to the
federal government for the adjustment of the election date."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, one of the major oil producer worldwide, has been
suffering from periodical outbreak of fuel shortage, due to
illing refineries, poor management of resources and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fuel shortage has been nearly one month
old, leading to extraordinary hardship to the ordinary people who
are already groaning under widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi confirmed on the same occasion that his party will
hold a national convention in Owerri on April 18, on which a
presidential candidate will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
He, however, refused to confirm if that candidate is General
Sani Abacha, the head of the military government.
</P>
<P>
There have been media reports saying that the five political
parties will have General Abacha as their common presidential
candidate.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After 30 years of bloody conflicts, the Catholics and
Protestants of Northern Ireland concluded a peace agreement Friday
in Belfast, in the wake of seven months of negotiations. The
agreement was achieved thanks to an intervention by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern,
co-sponsor of the negotiation.
</P>
<P>
-- The Russian State Duma (the lower house of parliament)
Friday snubbed President Boris Yeltsin with only 147 out of its
deputies voting for Sergei Kiriyenko to be the prime minister, far
from the 226 votes required. Yeltsin immediately re-nominated
Kiriyenko for the post, thus continuing his arms wrestling with
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Northern Ireland peace agreement signed Friday in
Belfast will maintain the British sovereignty over the area, but
install a real sharing of decision-making power between the
Catholic minority and the Protestant majority within the local
parliament. The Catholic nationalists also obtained the creation
of a trans-frontier institution which gives the government of the
Irish Republic the right to propose on certain aspects of life in
Ulster.

<HEADLINE> S'pore To Increase Penalties For Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The current economic
difficulties might aggravate the drug situation in Singapore and
the government is to increase the penalties for Ice and Ecstasy
traffickers, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on drug abuse, attended by some 300
people from local community organizations, Wong said people in
financial straits might resort to drug pushing and trafficking,
while others might turn to drugs to try to escape harsh realities.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the drug situation in Singapore, Wong said the number
of drug abusers arrested fell almost by a quarter from 6,160 in
1994 to 4,750 last year, while the number of new drug addicts
arrested fell from 1,340 to 1,130.
</P>
<P>
However, Wong said: "There is no room for complacency in our
fight against drugs. The rising number of Ice abusers arrested is
a warning that we must never let our guard down."
</P>
<P>
He noted that only five were arrested for Ice abuse in 1996,
but the number rose to 82 last year.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent these new drug abusers from becoming a threat, the
government intends to increase the penalties for Ice and Ecstasy
traffickers," he said.
</P>
<P>
For example, he explained, the Misuse of Drugs Act will be
amended to provide for the death penalty to be imposed on persons
convicted of trafficking in more than a certain amount of Ice.
</P>
<P>
The Act will also be amended to make it easier for persons to
be charged for trafficking in Ice and Ecstasy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This will be done by extending the presumption clause to those
in possession of these drugs. Penalties for trafficking are
generally more severe than those for possession," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yahoo's Strong Quarterly Profit Brightens Internet Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Internet bellwether Yahoo
Inc. reported strong net profits earlier this week, showing that
there is a formula to make money in a largely unprofitable
industry.
</P>
<P>
For the quarter ending on March 31, Yahoo, the first major
Internet directory company, reported revenues of 30.2 million
U.S. dollars and net income of 4.28 million dollars, up from
revenues of 10 million dollars and a net loss of about 700,000
dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Silicon Valley company said the average daily usage of its
sites surged from 65 million page views in December last year to
95 million last month. A page view is defined as one electronic
page of information displayed in response to a user request.
</P>
<P>
The report prompted a Web-stock buying frenzy Thursday. Yahoo
soared 17.25 dollars, to a record 114.50 dollars. Propelled by the
surge in Yahoo's stock, shares of other Web search companies also
shot to record levels on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Yahoo was the best-performing U.S. stock last year, with a
growth of 511 percent. Last spring, Yahoo traded at 32.69 dollars
a share. Its shares have nearly doubled since late January, and
the company now has a market value of 5.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growing popularity of Yahoo and other Internet companies
has helped win over a skeptical Wall Street, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Financial investors, who a year ago openly questioned whether
the young industry was more hype than substance, are now eager to
plunk their money on Internet stocks, realizing these Internet
media companies are real businesses.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that advertisers are expected to spend 1.87
billion dollars on on-line spots this year, more than twice what
they did a year ago. Meanwhile, the number of households with
accesses to the World Wide Web is expected to more than double to
56 million worldwide in 2002, from the current 25 million.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Develops High-yielding Pulse Varieties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi scientists and
researchers have developed high-yielding variety pulses in an
effort to boost the country's pulse production, press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the new varieties, the per-hectare
output of pulse would reach as high as 2,000 kilograms, against
the present output of between 600 and 700 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual demand for pulses is about 2 million tons,
but the production stands at about only 500,000 tons. The
shortfall is met by imports through official and unofficial
channels, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
To increase pulse production so as to reduce import and lessen
pressure on the national exchequer, the Agriculture Research
Institute, with assistance from the government, launched a 932
million-taka program last year to develop and introduce the new
pulse varieties to farmers, the reports quoted the Agriculture
Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the three-year program, the production
of pulses in the country is expected to reach 1.1 million tons by
the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Opposition Party Urges Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese rightwing National
Liberal Party leader Dory Chamoun has urged the Lebanese
government to seriously consider Israeli offer to withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon in exchange for security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with the Daily Star newspaper
published Saturday that the Lebanese government is making a grave
error in dismissing Israel's withdrawal offer.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to Lebanon that it intends to implement the
United Nations Resolution 425 and withdraw its troops from south
Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees on its negotiated
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria firmly rejected the offer, accusing Israel
of linking implementation of the resolution with preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"The government is not being serious in its response to Israel
and it is taking a big risk, instead of profiting from this
proposal," Chamoun said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government shouldn't ignore the issue just
because Syria is not willing to discuss the Israeli offer.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has great influence on Lebanon, has been accused
by Israel of holding south Lebanon as a "bargaining chip" in
forcing Israel to return the Golan Heights seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Chamoun, a critic of Syrian military presence in Lebanon, who
returned from a tour of the United States, Brazil and Europe on
Wednesday, said Washington could use the Israeli withdrawal offer
as a platform to resume the regional peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the U.S. is seriously looking for something to get
the peace process going again and this is one way of doing it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are growing signs that the U.S. is beginning to take
Israeli withdrawal plan seriously after initial doubts over his
sincerity in wanting to withdraw, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A possible indication of U.S. interest in the offer came Friday
when Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz received an urgent
written message from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
delivered to his home in Paris by the US charge d'affairs.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the letter were not disclosed but it arrived as
Boueiz is seeking the support of France to counter the Israeli
initiative on the resolution 425 which calls for an unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer buffer zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its northern
villages and towns from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border
attack.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Forum for African Women
Educationists (FAWE) has launched in Kenya a continental media
award for women journalists who consistently highlight issues of
women development, the Daily Nation report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The award came against a backdrop of declining enrollment
rates in primary schools and widening gender gaps at the
university level in this east African country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The FAWE Award for Media Excellence is aimed at rewarding
efforts by women media personalities who focus on the obstacles
which hamper gender equality.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka said the award was designed to encourage positive
reporting on women education issues in the media.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, FAWE Executive Director Eddah Gachukia
said the initiative was a recognition of the role of the media in
supporting girls' education.
</P>
<P>
According to Musyoka, gender gaps have been reduced at the
primary school level with the ratio standing at 50.8 percent
males compared with 49.2 percent females.
</P>
<P>
In arid and semi-arid areas, the Kenyan minister said, the gap
stands at 68 percent males and 32 percent females.
</P>
<P>
At the secondary level, the gap records at 54.1 percent males
and 45.9 percent females while at the university, the females
constitute less than 30 percent of the student population, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The prize is open to women journalists in both the print and
electronic media, including freelance writers.
</P>
<P>
The award had started in Ghana, Senegal and South Africa and

JOHANNESBURG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Nine out of 10 South
Africans had not heard of the government's Growth, Employment and
Redistribution (Gear) macro-economic strategy, a recent poll
showed.
</P>
<P>
The lack of awareness of Gear should be cause for deep
concern, said Brian Culross, conductor of the poll.
</P>
<P>
"Only little more than one in a hundred urban adults think
their household has benefited from Gear and only three percent
believe they will gain any future benefits. These figures are
much the same across all demographic categories," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For a policy with a macro-economic dimension, it is
noteworthy that only four percent foresee benefits accruing for
the country," Culross cautioned.
</P>
<P>
The Multibus survey of 2,498 adults scientifically represented
92 percent of the country's urban population and 53 percent of
the total population, according to the Saturday Star newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Gear, which was announced in June 1996, took as its goals a
competitive fast-growing economy which creates sufficient jobs
for all workers, a redistribution of income and opportunities in
favor of the poor and sound health, education and other services
available to all.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has so far failed to reach most of the
targets of the ambitious plan. The annual economic growth rate
lagged far behind the required six percent, which recorded only
1.7 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for British Role in Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has said he hoped British Prime
Minister Tony Blair can help negotiate an Israeli-Palestinian
peace deal in his upcoming visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks after a historic peace agreement for
Northern Ireland was announced in Belfast on Friday, which was
aimed at ending nearly 30 years of violence in the area.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed welcome to the peace accord and the hope that
the deal would improve the relations between England and Northern
Ireland, Israel radio reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Blair could do the same to the Middle East to
help the Palestinians and Israel reach an agreement during his
upcoming visit to the region starting from April 17. Britain now
is holding the rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for months
over the extent of the next Israeli troops withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has expressed cautious welcome to a U.S. peace
proposal, which reportedly calls on Israel to hand over 13.1
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians during the second
redeployment, in return for the implementation of the Palestinian
commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Israel categorically rejected the proposed withdrawal
extent, saying it would damage the national security interests of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton also hailed the peace
agreement for Northern Ireland on Friday, saying it was an example
for the Middle East and urging the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
to make compromise.

<HEADLINE> North-South Korean Talks Open in Beijing (Urgent) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The North and South of Korea
opened talks at the vice-ministerial level in Beijing this
afternoon, the first inter-Korean government-level contact in
nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
This landmark talks came when the second round of the
Four-Party Korean peace talks ended in Geneva on March 21 with no
agreement reached after six days of talks.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks, which started at a local five-star hotel at 4:00
pm, are said to "discuss how to improve inter-Korean ties and
matters of mutual concern", including the Republic of Korea (ROK)
supply of food and fertilizer to the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), who proposed Beijing as the venue for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the DPRK suggested the talks discuss issues
related to food and fertilizer assistance. But the ROK reportedly
will tie the fertilizer supply issue with the reunion of
inter-Korean separated families, the exchange of special envoys
and implementation of the South-North Basic Agreement signed in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The talks are still going on at press time.

<HEADLINE> New Cholera Wave Looms in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The second cholera wave within
five months looms in Uganda with at least 110 people claimed by
the epidemic, The New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sam Okware, chairman of the National Cholera Task Force, noted
that the new wave appeared at the beginning of April.
</P>
<P>
"We have received many new cases in four districts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The affected districts currently are Kabarole with 36 deaths
and 1,433 cases, and Bundibugyo with 28 deaths and 598 cases in
west Uganda, and Mbale with 26 deaths and 561 cases, Tororo with
15 deaths and 100 cases in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Other affected districts are Soroti and Tororo in the east,
where early reports put the death toll at 34.
</P>
<P>
The indication of the new wave of the epidemic appeared in
February in the wake of a new rainy season in the country.
</P>
<P>
The previous cholera wave broke out late last November and
ended in January this year, killing more than 800 local
residents.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper put the total death number of the disease since
last November at 1,043, with 21,787 recorded cases.
</P>
<P>
"We expect more cases," said Nicholas Okwana, director of
medical services in Soroti.
</P>
<P>
In Soroti, the authorities concerned have ordered the closure
of some schools and markets to prevent spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Flood submerges drainage and hygienic facilities, which causes
contamination of water sources for local people. Lack of clean
water is the main cause of the rampage of the epidemic. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Have Women Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will for the first
time introduce women into its men-dominated police ranks, Kuwaiti
Interior Minister was quoted as announcing by a local daily
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Mohammed Khaled Al-Sabah, during a tour to a number of
ministry agencies to mark Eid Al-Adha Friday, announced that his
ministry would appoint female investigators at police stations to
handle some social cases, local English daily Arab Times said.
</P>
<P>
He said the idea will be put into effect in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Women constitute 50.4 percent of the Kuwaiti 710,000
population. The constitution grants equal right and obligations
for women and men.
</P>
<P>
There are women scientists, professors, doctors and other
professionals working in various fields of social life in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, women in the small Islamic Gulf state can not enjoy
equal political right with men as they are still denied the right
to vote or to be voted.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti women have maintained constant struggle demanding for
political right since 1960s. But so far no results have been
brought about.

<HEADLINE> Average Annual Salary of Shanghai Workers Hits 11,400 Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Average annual salary income
reached 11,400 yuan (1,373.5 US dollars) for workers of this large
economic center of China last year.
</P>
<P>
The amount is about 3.8 times the 1991 figure, according to
figures of the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
As Shanghai's economy entered a period of rapid growth in the
1990s, the average salary of workers here has also risen fast in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that Shanghai workers' average salary
soared by 26 percent annually from 1991 to 1995. Between 1996 and
1997, during which price rises slowed down significantly, the
average salary growth rate reached 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that the salary levels are markedly
diverse among workers of different professions, with that of
workers in banking, insurance, real estate, government
institutions, science, education and public health above the
municipal average.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita salary for workers in industry, commerce,
transportation, agriculture, forestry and fishing was lower than
the municipal average, with that for agricultural, forestry and
fishery workers standing at merely 77 percent of the municipal
average.
</P>
<P>
While average salary level keeps going up, Shanghai should
further improve its personal income tax system in a bid to narrow
sectoral salary differences, experts suggested.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A forest fire in Barangay Rogoon,
near the Southern Philippine city of Iligan, has damaged 6,000
hectares of forest and continued to rage in the area, the
Philippine News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Alejo Yanez, Mayor of Iligan, as saying there
are no reports about casualties yet, but people are evacuating
from the area.
</P>
<P>
Yanez said firemen and disaster experts have already reached
Rogoon but so far failed to control the fire, which started
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Rogoon fire might have started due to
an old system used by farmers where they burn the land to rid of
wastes before cultivating it for another planting season.
</P>
<P>
Since January, forest fires have hit eight provinces of the
country. The fires on the island of Palawan have eaten up at least
15,000 hectare of forest in the past month. Most of the forest
fires have been under control now, the government said.
</P>
<P>
Rogoon, a rich forest and agricultural area, is located some 40
 kilometers away from Iligan in the Southern Philippines.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The East African Law Society has
called for the formation of an East African Court of Appeal to
address social, economic and political issues in its member
countries, the Daily Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day meeting which closed Friday in Malindi of Kenya's
Coast Province, lawyers from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania said the
regional court would be conferred by a treaty recognized by three
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Such a court, they indicated, would be competent in addressing
various issues including the interpretation of the treaty,
development of a body of common laws and consideration of appeals
from member countries.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers suggested that the society should be fully
involved in discussions of the draft of the East African
Community Treaty to be signed later this year.
</P>
<P>
A committee should be established to solicit the views of
members, consider issues raised and prepared a report on the
draft treaty, they added.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended meeting adopted 13 resolutions on facilitation
of cross-border legal practice, creation of a mechanism for
conflict resolution and solutions to the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the refugee issue, the society decided to form a
standing committee to monitor potential conflicts and situation
which may occasion displacement of population within the region.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Expects Balance in Housing Supply, Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 11 (Xinhua) -- This largest port city in north
China is expected to register a balance in supply and demand of
residential housing this year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of residential housing in Tianjin municipality has picked
up recently, with total sales volume in the first quarter of this
year up three percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
If the brisk sales momentum continues in the later months, this
year's residential housing sales volume will reach three million
sq m, which means that all housing inventory left over from the
previous years will be absorbed by the year-end, industry experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put Tianjin residents' demand for
residential housing at three million sq m this year, compared with
two million sq m of new housing expected to be constructed.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that currently Tianjin has 900,000 sq m
of unsold housing quarters.
</P>
<P>
When all possible factors are taken into account, there will be
a balance in housing supply and demand, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
As China moves to a market economy, the traditional
welfare-type housing distribution system is being replaced by a
commercial one. The authorities have taken various measures to
encourage residents to buy houses, something that is expected to
help boost China's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Cases Drop Remarkably in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has gained remarkable
achievements in preventing malaria outbreaks and step by step puts
the disease under control during the recent six years, the Vietnam
news reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The number of malaria deaths, malaria patients and malaria
epidemics reduced, respectively, by 59.2 percent, 96.7 percent and
92.4 percent as compared to the figures in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 36 of the total 61 provinces and cities throughout
Vietnam had no malaria deaths reported. Some provinces have had no
malaria cases in four or five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have particularly been made to reduce malaria cases in
remote, isolated and border areas, to strengthen village-based
health networks and to raise awareness about malaria among people
in these localities.
</P>
<P>
However, the Vietnam news said, an outbreak of malaria is still
threatening the country due to the quick moving of population in
malaria-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
Poor living conditions, little awareness of malaria, and weak
health networks in the mountainous areas are other reasons for a
possible spread of the disease.

120,000 U.S. dollars in Tirana and Gjirok Aster recently.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Huge Investment Planned to Ensure Railway Safety in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian railway company Ferrovie
Dello Stato (FS) will invest 10 trillion lira (about 5.5 billion
U.S. dollars) over the next three years to improve safety of
railway transportation, FS told unions Friday.
</P>
<P>
The FS's 1998 draft safety plan promises greater efforts to
make sure train drivers do their job properly, black box recorders
be installed on more trains and the number of level-crossings
reduced.
</P>
<P>
It also promised that an additional 1.2 trillion lira (667
million dollars) would be spent each year to maintain tracks,
trains and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
FS has come under heavy fire recently following a string of
railway accidents, which have thrown a spotlight on the country's
aging rail system and chronic problems with efficiency and safety
measures.
</P>
<P>
FS said the number of railway accidents fell from 174 in 1996
to 146 in 1997. It conceded, however, that last year's accidents
had been more serious, provoking eight deaths and 39 injuries,
compared with five and 14 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the main cause of accidents to "the failure of
train personnel to observe signals and other procedures correctly."
</P>
<P>
Thus the company decided, among other things, to step up
on-the-job training for drivers and to begin an internal enquiry
to identify potential dangerous habits of train and station
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were partly a response to an FS-commissioned
study on its operations, which found that "company strategy lacks a
clear approach to safety" and that "there is no formal process
aimed at continual improvement" in this area.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Steady Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The economy of this, China's
largest economic center, continued its healthy growth momentum in
the first quarter of this year, according to major economic
indices.
</P>
<P>
The municipal gross domestic product grew eight percent to
77.35 billion yuan-worth in the first three months, with the
service industry making up 49.3 percent of the total value.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly consumer price index, which includes the cost of
labor and services, was up 0.7 percentage points from a year ago,
while the retail price index dropped four percentage points
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that the financial sector grew a marked 15.2
percent in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also indicate that Shanghai's industrial
output value reached 124.34 billion yuan in the first quarter, up
8.3 percent over the same 1997 period. Foreign-funded enterprises
saw their combined industrial output value up 14.7 percent to
46.28 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first quarter, Shanghai reported 36.26 billion yuan
in retail sales of consumer goods, an increase of 8.2 percent on a
yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
However, affected by the Asian financial crisis, Shanghai's
export growth slowed down to 4.3 percent in the first three
months, with total exports valued at 3.456 billion US
dollars. Exports from overseas-funded enterprises, however, soared
30.9 percent to 1.31 billion US dollars-worth.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai approved 256 new overseas-funded projects in the first
quarter, down 46.7 percent from a year ago. However, the

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Plans to Issue Bonds for Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
expected to issue bonds worth 155 trillion rupiah (about 19.4
billion U.S. dollars) in an effort to restore the financial
condition of the banks now under the supervision of the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
Of the whole bonds, those worth 80 trillion rupiah (10 billion
dollars) have been issued, part of which to be sold by IBRA to
Bank Indonesia (central bank) and the rest worth 75 trillion
rupiah (9.4 billion dollars) will be issued this year, according
to the supplementary memorandum on the national economic and
financial reform received by Xinhua here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum signed by the Indonesian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday noted the government
is to accelerate the restructurization of the banking sector and
to solidify the IBRA.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, the government froze the operations of seven
national banks and placed seven others under the IBRA's
supervision to reform the country's troubled banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the seven banks were frozen because they had
borrowed liquidity funds from Bank Indonesia in excess of 500
percent of their paid-up capital and in excess of 75 percent of
their total equity.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, the priority was to take over the
management of the seven large banks which received the largest
liquidity funds prepared by the national banking system.
</P>
<P>
This measure was also aimed at curbing the central bank's
credit expansion which has rapidly increased during the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
The provision of the liquidity funds for the unsolved banks
would be under tight control, it said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Faces Shake-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Financial Ministry is
planning a major shake-up of the Bank of Thailand in a bid to
restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Central Bank Governor Chaiyawat
Wilbulswasdi would be affected in the expected change.
</P>
<P>
A central bank official on Saturday refused to confirm the
reports but said the revamp of the bank was under consideration
and a team of international experts would help restructure the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The initial shake-up would be based on findings of the Nukul
Prachuabmoh Committee, which is responsible for identifying the
central bank's past errors, said the official who refused to be
named.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said earlier that
after the shake-up any decision made by the bank would be executed
based on "reasons and not emotions."
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat has reportedly offered to resign if the findings
identified him as being the cause of the bank's mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has been criticized for allowing the country
to fall into an economic crisis because of its decisions to use
treasury reserves in defending the baht from speculative attacks
and to allow the massive use of the financial institutions
development fund to protect ailing finance companies.

BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- As the traditional Songkran
festival (Thai New Year) draws near, Bangkok is not beset by heavy

People began pouring out of the city on Friday to spend the

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rejects U.S. Humanitarian Assistance Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Castro Friday
rejected a U.S. offer to ease economic embargo against Cuba,
saying that the only thing his country demands is the end of the
blockade.
</P>
<P>
He stressed to the press that Cuba does not need the
U.S. humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader made the remarks in response to a March 20
offer by the U.S. government to make "more flexible" sanctions
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
To speak of humanitarian assistance while the embargo is
maintained is something really absurd, Castro commented.
</P>
<P>
"The country (Cuba) cannot accept that because it would be an
affront to the dignity of our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that those who tossed up that offer are precisely the
same who promoted the intensification of the embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"What we demand is the ceasing of the blockade, and when the
blockade is lifted, then we will not need humanitarian assistance
from the government of that country," said the Cuban president.

BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- "If you are looking for the
perfect day-trip, or an excuse to get out of the city as spring
creeps into the countryside, look no further than Tianjin,"
today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
The historic, formerly semi-colonial city is awash in memorable
sights, from the movingly elegant Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao
Memorial to the bustle and bargains of Ancient Culture Street,
according to a signed story by Author Judy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is just 100 km southwest of Beijing. Trains run
regularly from Beijing, and an excellent expressway also connects
the two cities. The seaport boasts some of the loveliest beaches
on the Bohai Bay, which are perfect for swimming and a sun bath.
</P>
<P>
The city is also home to Food Street, a mall filled with
delicacies from all over China, including some of the most
interesting cuts of meat you will ever find anywhere.
</P>
<P>
The city is also the site of the famed Goubuli Baozi
Restaurant, where they serve you platter after platter of the
delicate steamed dumplings filled with all sorts of treats.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Culture Street is also a place that should not be
missed. Several blocks long, the winding lane is lined with stalls
whose vendors entertain with their wares. Tops spin, pipes are
played, artists will turn your name into a work of art ... all for
some of the best prices you can find in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, all the traditional Chinese arts and crafts can be
found there: bone carvings, paper cuts, seals waiting to be carved
with your name or crest, cloisonne baubles, Chinese chess sets in
jade or wood, mah-jong sets of every description, silks and
tapestries and paintings galore.

<P>
SANTIAGO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile earned 281.3 million
U.S. dollars in fishery produce exports in the first two months of
this year, a 14.5 percent drop over the the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Fishing Ministry said Friday that the reduction was
attributed to a 32.6 percent decrease in sales to the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Chilean fishery products was 1,833 dollars
a ton in the two months, 3.5 percent down from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The hardest blow was a 29.6 percent reduction in the prices of
frozen fishery products. Up to 51 percent of the total value of
exports in the months, the item's average price was 2,941 dollars
per ton as against 1997's 4,161 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the world's fifth fishery producer, with fishery
exports being its second largest source of hard currency, after
copper.

BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Pattaya, a tourist resort 200
kilometers south of Bangkok, has set up a police center to fight
against foreign mafia believed to be gaining a foothold in the
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
The center will coordinate all concerned agencies to crack down
on foreign crime syndicates, Saturday's Nation newspaper quoted a
Pattaya district chief Prasert Thanasethakorn as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will also open a post office box to receive complaints
about 'mafia in uniforms' who have frightened tourists more than
the foreign mafia," Prasert said in reference to policemen
suspected of blackmailing tourists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pattaya Mayor Pairat Suthithamrongsawat said the
city was willing to financially support the center's anti-mafia
operation but opposed the idea to deploy police commandos in the
city, which could ruin the tourism atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Crimes have been on the rise in the city recently. a Russian
man has been convicted of a gangland-style murder in the city and
sentenced to life imprisonment following a brisk one-day trial by
Thailand's Chon Buri provincial court.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old man, Hardo Kerz, was found guilty of killing a
Russian pub owner on March 31 in Pattaya.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Liaoning to Reduce Use of Coal as Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial base in northeast China, is resolved to gradually
eliminate the direct use of coal as fuel.
</P>
<P>
This is part of an urban planning report, the emphasis of which
is on economizing on resources and reducing pollution.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the direct use of coal as fuel is 2.5 to three times
that of the cost of electricity for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the province has stepped up the construction of various
kinds of power plants, in an effort to encourage more residents to
use electricity and gas as fuel sources.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province is promoting such new energy sources
as solar, wind, geothermal and nuclear power, the prospects for
which are said to be bright.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Sets Targets for Sweeping Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
announced sweeping measures Friday to help the country recover
from its worst economic crisis in decades, and set the target
dates for the implementation of key reforms it Signed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
According to an official document published Friday night, the
20-point supplementary Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies stipulated that a new anti-monopoly law is scheduled to
be completed by the end of this year, while moves to create a new
bankruptcy law and a special bankruptcy court should be in place
by April 22.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, regulations for the winding up of companies, mergers
and acquisitions are expected by the end of September, said the
document.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also make some adjustments to the country's
macro- economic indicators. Inflation, which has already recorded
a high of 27 percent in the first three months this year, is
forecast to remain between 45 percent and 50 percent in this
calendar year. The inflation rate for 1998-99 fiscal year
(starting April 1) is expected to reach between 17 to 22 percent,
excluding the inflation rate for the first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth (GDP), based on preliminary estimation, is
predicted to contract by 5 percent for the 1998 calendar year, and
by 4 percent for the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The 20-point document, a revision to a 50-point Memorandum of
Understanding signed by President Soeharto in January, has
culminated three-week intensive negotiations with the IMF, which
has organized a 43-billion-U.S.-dollar rescue package for
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement Friday, Coordinating Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the value of the
rupiah (national currency) should strengthen rapidly in the second
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the exchange rate will eventually stabilize
below 6,000 rupiah against the U.S. dollar," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned against overoptimism about inflation and
growth projections. "The level of uncertainty in respect of the
economy is still relatively high, and such assumptions might be
adjusted again in the future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's New Bankruptcy Act Gains Royal Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's new bankruptcy act has
been approved by King Bhumibol Adulyadej and passed into law on
Friday, the Bangkok Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The law was hailed by legal experts as a vital step in healing
the economy and as positive for troubled businesses, giving them
leeway to revitalize operations rather than shut them down, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand amended its bankruptcy laws under the requirement of
the International Monetary Fund, which attached the condition to
its 17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout package to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Parliament passed the law early last month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the law, based on the American model, offered
creditors more security by giving corporate debtors more time to
draw up and implement rehabilitation plans.
</P>
<P>
The law also gives lenders flexibility to inject more funds
into businesses without prejudicing creditors' rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the old law, creditors could be left empty-handed if it
was found that they loaned funds to companies they knew were in
trouble.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Foreign Trade Goes into Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's foreign trade has gone
into the red this year under the attacks of the El Nino warming
effects and the Asian financial crisis, the Ecuadoran Central Bank
(BCE) said in a balance report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report showed a trade deficit of 13 million U.S. dollars in
the first two months of this year, in contrast with a surplus of
111 million U.S. dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports went down 10.8 percent to 725 million dollars while
imports grew by 5.12 percent to 738 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It said climate changes brought by the El Nino have seriously
affected the country's agricultural output and the sectors of
services and communications.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the drop of crude oil prices on the international
market and the Asian financial crisis have diminished the markets
for Ecuadoran exporters.
</P>
<P>
These factors also caused a negative impact on the country's
inflation and economic growth indexes for January and February
1998, the report added.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the deterioration of the balance of trade might
persist in the first half of 1998.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: As Asian Crisis Hits, More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian financial markets
have seen a gradual stabilization in the last two months, an
indication that the worst of the nine-month old regional crisis
may be finally over. But for hundreds of thousands of East Asians,
the worst has yet to come as lay-offs have just started in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Across Southeast Asia, constructions of massive projects have
been postponed or canceled, numerous factories closed, and many
companies declared bankruptcy with the full-blown impact of the
crisis being felt since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
And accordingly, tens of thousands of workers have joined the
jobless rank during the past few months in countries like South
Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
But this is just beginning, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the high interest rates maintained by Southeast
Asian central banks to keep the currency stabilization will force
more closures of companies; the austere plans implemented by
governments will mean more cancellations of construction projects;
and the slower growth demanded by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) as conditions for assistance will reduce job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
All these factors will keep the unemployment rates soaring in
the months ahead, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank recently expected jobless rank to swell to 1.8
million in Thailand, and 1.2 million in South Korea this year.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian congress reckons that a total of 560,000 workers
will lose their jobs this year, mostly from the construction,
manufacturing and retail sectors.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, the government estimated in January that nearly 2
million people had lost their jobs since the crisis began last
July, and now the jobless people reached about 8.7 million, or
some 10 percent of the 90 million workforce.
</P>
<P>
The state news agency Antara said that 1.1 million people
entering the job market this year would swell the ranks of the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The growing jobless would mean rising poverty and more social
problems. It is estimated that Indonesians living in poverty will
jump nearly three-quarters to 40 million as thousands of people
lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are worried about the social cost of the
increasing unemployment, saying that it may lead to more riots and
crimes. Actually, most countries in the region have not been
spared such social problems in the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
Facing growing unemployment problem at home, some countries
have started to deport illegal foreign workers. Malaysia and
Singapore have for years suffered labor shortage, but now have
begun crackdown on illegal foreign job-seekers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 117 illegal immigrants in Singapore were sentenced
to up to six weeks in jail and four to six strokes of the cane.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which estimates 800,000 of its 2 million foreign
workers are illegal, has already sent back 27,500 Indonesians this
year, and plans to send back about 200,000 foreign workers whose
work permits expire in August.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the government has set May 1 as the deadline for
some 800,000 illegal workers to leave the country in order to save
jobs for its own people.
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is the best way to ease the unemployment situation
for these countries, but the deportation of foreign workers has
made their neighbors unhappy, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The economies of most Southeast Asian countries have embarked
on the path of recovery, nevertheless the unemployment situation
may deteriorate this year and unlikely to change for the better
before the economies bottom out of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Mass Media to Play Bigger Role In City Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Local mass media has been called
to enhance coverage on topics the people would be interested in
and which are the key aspects of residents' life.
</P>
<P>
Related topics include improving the environment, developing
the social security system, strengthening the management of
municipal transportation, promoting the development of collective
and private enterprises, eradicating poverty and backwardness in
the mountainous area around Beijing, and the re-employment of
lai-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Chen Guangwen, chairman of Standing
Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Political Consultative
Conference (BMPPCC) as saying that media has become more and more
important in Chinese people's life, and that "We surely should
make full use of this powerful tool to let more Beijing people
know what we are up to, and then join us to make out city a better
place."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local mass media was also called to to intensify
news coverage on cooperations between the Party, municipal
government and the BMPPCC, as as to better address possible
difficulties stemming from China's deepening reform.
</P>
<P>
As Beijing's local political advisory body, BMPPCC has played a
significant role in promoting Beijing's socialist democracy, and
also in the city's social construction.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, members of the BMPPCC have, in the past five years,
helped introduce nearly 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars)
into the Chinese capital from abroad in forms of donations and
financial aid.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers to Plant Trees to Offset Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of more than 200
volunteers from Hong Kong and Beijing arrived at the desert in
Chifeng of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region today to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
It is the first group from thousands of volunteers, who will be
organized by the Hong Kong-based Conservancy Association to plant
107.4 hectares of trees and 60 hectares of grass in the desert
area, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The action will lend impetus to Chifeng's efforts to fight
against desertification and construct a more ecologically friendly
environment, so as to enhance the city's comprehensive
agricultural production capacity.
</P>
<P>
With 27 percent of its land covered with sands, the city mapped
out this year an eight-year ecological construction plan to put
sandy lands under control and improve its grasslands.
</P>
<P>
That will include planting trees along 200 kilometers of roads,
fostering 66,000 hectares of forestry and improving 80,000
hectares of grasslands.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the forestry coverage rate in the city is
expected to rise from the current 22 percent to 30 percent. And 80
percent of the 2.42 million hectares of sands will be put under
control.
</P>
<P>
As the "cancer of the earth," desertification had spread to 2.6
million sq km of land in China by the end of last year, accounting
for 27.3 percent of the country's total area, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 million people, or one-third of the country's total
population, are now living in areas plagued by desertification.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Students Pen Impressions of China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides Beijing Opera, hot-pot and traditional calligraphy,
which are the most common things that intrigue foreigners, China's
economic takeoff has also impressed them a lot.
</P>
<P>
"There are building sites everywhere, but it is not a chaotic
scene. What I have seen is a robust China undergoing massive
construction," said a French girl who gave herself the Chinese name
of Dai Xiaoqian.
</P>
<P>
Sachiko from Japan said that ten years ago, when she first came
to China, she found that people were too particular about even one
cent. "Now, you can pick up evidence anywhere that Chinese are
becoming better off. Can you guess what China will be like in ten
years' time?" she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Many students say that they have come to a spiritually
self-enriched country. A student from the Republic of Korean
wrote: "In China, I have got back my long-lost love and human
relationships."
</P>
<P>
Some of them told of their true experiences: How their wallets
were returned by Chinese who refused to leave their names, how
they were helped by strangers in trains, and so on.
</P>
<P>
They say they have also become admirers of traditional Chinese
merits, including frugality and hard work.
</P>
<P>
New trends have also the foreign students' attention. Anna
Ivanorwich from Yugoslavia admired the extremely polite behavior
of traffic policemen in Jinan City, Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
"After I found out that they are role models in a national
campaign to improve people's ethical and moral conduct, I hoped
that cops in Yugoslavia would learn from them, and that would
certainly reduce the number of traffic accidents in my country,"
she noted.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dai Xiaoqian's view might be widely accepted by her
international schoolmates. "The China in my eyes is a little
different from the China in my dreams. China is firmly advancing
towards the future -- This is the most typical characteristic I
would say, of this country," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice-minister of education, said at the awards ceremony
that there are 40,000 foreign students studying in China, and more
and more countries are paying attention to the teaching of and
research into Chinese language and culture.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, the increasing number of foreign students in
China is a result of China's rapid economic growth, growing
national strength and rising international status.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, approximately 260,000 foreigners have
come to study in China. The number is close to that of Chinese
people who have gone to study abroad, which is 270,000.

<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 China East-West
Cooperation and Investment Trade Fair, an annual economic
promotion for mutual development in China's eastern and western
regions, closed Friday in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In the five-day fair, 130 contracts for joint-venture projects
have been signed with a total investment of 2.05 billion US

7.86 billion yuan (947 million US dollars) and 325 cooperative
agreements with a total investment of 781 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The most noticeable improvement from the fair is the
breakthrough of property rights trading, which provides a new way
for the cooperation between eastern and western regions. With

participants actively promoted property re-organization across
different regions, trade sectors and ownership systems, the deputy

He added that the total volume of all trade among the
participants was 10.3 billion yuan (1.24 billion US dollars), 163
percent more than the last fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair, initiated in 1997 and co-sponsored by Tianjin and
Shanghai municipal governments, and Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan and
Shaanxi provinces, has become an integral part of national
economic promotion.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair attracted 25 delegations from 22 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions, 23 representatives from
ministries and commissions of the State Council and some 1,000
overseas investors and business people.

<HEADLINE> Trade Ties Focus of Italian President's Visit to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The strengthening of economic ties
between Italy and Japan will be the dominant theme during Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's state visit to Tokyo, Italian
Foreign Ministry said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro will begin his week-long visit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The visit comes at a time when trade relations between the two
countries have been seriously affected by the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The weekness of the yen and the Japanese economy has led to an
increase in Japanese exports to the United States and the European
Union and a reduction in imports.
</P>
<P>
Italian exports to Japan fell by 2.7 percent in 1997 to 10
trillion lira (5.6 billion U.S. dollars) whereas imports from
Japan jumped 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This trend gathered momentum during the first two months of
1998: Italian exports to Japan dropped further by 9.4 percent
compared to January and February in 1997, while imports were up
25.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Italy has so far managed to hold on to its position as
Japan's fourth biggest supplier in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Torrential Rain Brings Chaos And Tragedy To Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 11 (Xinhua) - Torrential rain, floods and snow
blizzards brought chaos and Bank Holiday tragedy to Britain Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two people confirmed died and two others were feared drowned as
the worst floods for more than 50 years hit the Midland and East
Anglia, England, according to BBC TV report.
</P>
<P>
Worst affected was in central England which included
Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire,
Cambridgeshire and the West Midlands.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Agency said the affected areas were suffering
the worst flooding in living memory. Red alerts were issued along
most of the River Avon, the River Cherwell in Oxfordshire, and for
the first time in 25 years, the River Evenlode in Oxfordshire.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Holiday was washed out by rain and snowfalls of up to
three inches. Roads and public transport were in chaos and
sporting programs were badly hit.
</P>
<P>
The A1 Motorway was closed between Peterborough and Brampton in
Cambridgeshire, the A14 was shut at Huntingdon, and hundreds of
trains were cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The London-to-Glasgow sleeper arrived eight hours late. Virgin
Trains said it might have to suspend services if flooding around
Rugby worsened.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services were stretched to the limit as dozens of
rescue operations were carried out in badly hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Office predicted that flooding over the
whole country will worsen considerably before the end of Easter as
rain over the hills drains to areas of lower ground by Monday.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Students Pen Impressions of China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreigners who came to China in
the early 1990s said that the first three Chinese expressions they
became familiar with were "Ni Hao?" (How are you?),
"Xiexie"(Thanks) and "Meiyou" (There isn't any).
</P>
<P>
Imai, a Japanese student who is studying at Beijing's People's
University, said the most frightening and disappointing thing in
his first days in China was to hear a "Meiyou" blurted out from a
cold-faced Chinese saleswoman's mouth.
</P>
<P>
"But I seldom come across the situation now," he said.
</P>
<P>
This might be a result of China's rapid economic growth, which
has added enough goods to supermarket shelves, as well as the
improvement in people's courtesy level, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Imai wrote down his feelings and thoughts and entered them in a
composition contest sponsored by the overseas edition of the
"People's Daily", the leading Chinese newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The competition was designed for foreigners who are studying
the Chinese language here.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 students from 37 universities across the country took
part in the event, with the theme "What I have seen and heard in
China", writing in Chinese, fluent or poor.
</P>
<P>
One-quarter of them were given prizes Friday. "These honest
young people have told true stories," said Fan Jinyi,
editor-in-chief of the "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
According to the compositions, many foreigners come to China
with the purpose of finding the answer to a question: What does
a 5,000-year culture mean? How were the terracotta warriors
produced? How long is the Great Wall?, etc.
</P>
<P>
"I had long been dreaming of coming to this country," wrote a
Russian, who gave himself the Chinese name of Jie Nisi.
</P>
<P>
Unluckily, after they arrived in China, all the outsiders
found that they have been trapped in more myths than they had
expected.
</P>
<P>
"The most incredible thing for me was to see 'Kaidangku'
(open-seat pants) worn by Chinese kids. If the Japanese people
would follow suit, what a great amount of cloth could be saved in
our country!" wrote a Japanese student studying at Wuhan
University.
</P>
<P>
An American who calls himself Lanchi in Chinese said that he
had thought he would stay in China for only six months, but he
has already stayed for three years.
</P>
<P>
"China is a profound and extensive book," he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Gives up his FIFA Post for Eight Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter
has decided to take an eight-week leave from his post as he
challenges Lennart Johansson to succeed Joao Havelange as FIFA
president.
</P>
<P>
His temporarily lay-off comes after vigorous protests from
Johansson and his supports.
</P>
<P>
The UEFA president wanted Blatter to resign immediately when he
announced his candidature in Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
But the 62-year-old Blatter said earlier that he would continue
to work as secretary general from home and hand over some
responsibilities to his deputy Michel Zen-Ruffinen.
</P>
<P>
His decision was critizied by Johansson, and this week Blatter
told Havelange he would stop acting as secretary general until the
 FIFA Congress on June 8 when a new president will be elected.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Finds Vast Cloud of Water in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. astronomers has
identified a large concentration of water vapor in a cloud of
interstellar gas close to the Orion Nebula, the European Space
Agency (ESA) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The concentration of water vapor in the Orion Molecular Cloud,
a giant interstellar mass composed primarily of hydrogen
molecules, is twenty times larger than that measured previously in
other interstellar gas clouds, ESA said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the cloud could generate enough water
molecules in a single day to fill the Earth's oceans 60 times
over.
</P>
<P>
Professor Martin Harwit, at Cornell University, carried out the
observations with other astronomers using ESA's Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO), which is operated with the participation of the
U.S National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
</P>
<P>
Looking at long infrared wavelengths, the astronomers saw the
characteristic signature of emission by water vapor.
</P>
<P>
The interstellar gas cloud observed is found being pummelled by
shock waves that compress and heat the gas.
</P>
<P>
The shock waves, the astronomers believed, are the result of
the violent early stages of starbirth, in which a young star
sprays out gas that slams into its surroundings at high speed, and
the heated water vapor is the result of that collision.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the water vapor will cool and freeze, turning into
small solid particles of ice. Similar ice particles were
presumably present within the gas cloud from which the Solar
System originally formed.
</P>
<P>
So the discovery "may provide an important clue to the origin
of water in the Solar System," ESA said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes U.S. for 's Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- No one had the right to dictate to
public figures in Greece how they should protect national
interests and only the Greek people were entitled to decide this,
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Reppas said that Greece's
public officials, who were dedicated to defending the public and
national interests, had the right to do just that as they saw
best.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental principle of democracy which, as the U.S.
spokesman acknowledges, was born in Greece, was dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue was nothing more than the free exchange of views, he
said, adding that within the framework of this dialogue, everyone
had the right to express their opinion.
</P>
<P>
Greek Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis accused Monday
U.S. ambassador in Athens, Nicholas Burns, of acting like a Roman
consul, following remarks by the latter about Greece's domestic
issues such as labor relations.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
criticized Kaklamanis, saying that Greek politicians who object to
the outspoken opinions of Burns were "almost antidemocratic."

<HEADLINE> Ramos, Clinton Discuss Bells Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Philippine President
Fidel Ramos on Friday held brief talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton with agreement to strengthen economic ties, but failed to
solve disputes over return of two Philippine church bells.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, speaking to reporters alone after his meeting with
Clinton, said the U.S. president had "many words of praise" for
Philippine economic and social advances.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippine model shows that good governance produces good
growth and that the open society and sustainable development are
compatible," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he and Clinton had not reached any immediate
resolution of key issues including the return of the two church
bells and benefits that Filipino veterans who fought with American
forces in World War II want to get.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said officials are working on a formula to fulfill his
country's desire to have two 100-year-old church bells returned to
the Philippines from Wyoming. He said Clinton would like to push
the idea of sharing the bells -- with one going back and a replica
produced for each site.
</P>
<P>
The two church bells were originally installed in the village
of Balangiga on the island of Samar, the Philippines. They were
used to signal the villagers.
</P>
<P>
They were taken by the U.S. 11th Infantry in 1901 when the U.S.
troops captured the village and burned Balangiga to the ground and
killed every male over the age of 10,in retaliation on behalf of
the 9th Infantry, one of its company which had been attacked by
the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Later, the 11th Infantry took the two church bells to Wyoming
in 1904 when the troops were sent back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bells are now displayed in a memorial at the F.E. Warren
Air Force Base west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The Philippine
government wants the bells returned, But Wyoming veterans groups
and state's three-member congressional delegation want the bells
to stay where they are.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the Philippine government has proposed having
the bells copied so that both countries could disply one original
and one replica. But the compromise has been rejected by the
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Ramos held several talks with administration officials during
his stay in Washington, including Defense Secretary William Cohen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. B-2 Bomber Damaged in Wing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force's B-2 bomber
has suffered wing damage probably caused by a lightning strike,
the service said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The damage to the warplane based at Whiteman Air Force Base in
Missouri would cost the service more than 1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Air Force said it did not immediately know when the the damage
occurred.
</P>
<P>
The damage amounts to "small holes" in the stealth material on
one of the wings. The material helps the bombers avoid being
detected by radar.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the cost of repairing the damage to the 2
billion-dollar could be between 1.5 million to 2 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are eight B-2s in operation in the country, but no one
has yet been used in combat.

<HEADLINE> Santorini Meeting Agrees on Creation of Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece, Bulgaria and Romania
Friday agreed in principle to establish a multinational
peacekeeping force in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a two-day meeting in the Greek island
of Santorini where Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
discussed with his Bulgarian and Romanian counterparts, Nadhezda
Mihailova and Andrei Plesu the situation in the Balkans,
particularly in Kosovo, the expansion of the European Union (EU)
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said that the rapid deployment of task force would be
possibly headquartered in the center of the Balkan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting of Balkan defense ministers in Sofia,
Greece proposed that a Balkan multinational force be created with
the aim of safeguarding the region's security and stability, as
well as doing other humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
The Santorini meeting, which opened Friday, is the fourth
tripartite meeting ever held by the countries since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Blair Hails N. Irish Deal as Triumph of All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
hailed on Friday the Northern Ireland peace agreement as the
triumph of courage and triumph of all involved in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that if one side wins something in Northern Ireland
the other loses, that's gone. The essence of what we have agreed
is a choice: we are all winners or all losers. It is mutually
assured benefit or mutually assured destruction," Blair said in a
statement at the plenary session after the announcement of the
peace accord struck late in the afternoon by the eight political
parties in the talks.
</P>
<P>
"This is because the package is based on balanced principles,
which for ages people have thought contradictory, but which are in
fact absolutely compatible. We can all win. Put this agreement
into practice, and we do all win."
</P>
<P>
Realizing there is still a lot to do to implement the accord,
Blair urged the feuding parties and communities to work together
and to replace hatreds and fear of many years with trust and
fellowship.
</P>
<P>
"Today is only the beginning though. It isn't the end," he
said. "Unless we can extend the hand of friendship to those who
were once foes. Unless, before we condemn, we at least try to see
the other side. Unless we take it into our hearts that others can
reach different conclusions in just as good faith as we reach our
own conclusions."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who exerted tremendous efforts to push the
peace talks moving, said he hoped that "the burden of history can
at long last start to be lifted from our shoulders."
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people in Northern Ireland to grasp the
chance to live in peace and to raise children out of the shadow of
fear.
</P>
<P>
"The work to win that prize goes on. We cannot, must not, let
it slip from our grasp."
