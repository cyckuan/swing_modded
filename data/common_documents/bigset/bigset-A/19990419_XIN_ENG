<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Four people including two soldiers
were killed in the elections in central Turkey on sunday, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of terrorists launched a rocket attack
at 15:00 local time (1200 GMT) against a military vehicle of the
Turkish gendarme soldiers, which carried staff members for the local
and parliamentary elections at Kizicaoren village in Hafik town of
Sivas province.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers and two staff members were killed in the terrorist
attack in the province, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that four soldiers and one staff member were also
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
This was the biggest terrorist attack in the elections in
the whole Turkey Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Over 37 million voters have cast their votes in the elections and
this was the first time that the local and parliamentary elections
were held at the same date in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 political parties participated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Turks crowded polling stations Sunday to vote in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP) and the central-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit are fighting a
battle for the number one spot to win the leading numbers of votes
in Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the FP and DSP are running a neck and neck
race and may each win about 19 to 21 percent of the votes in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported Sunday that following the FP and DSP,
the central-right Motherland Party (ANAP) will become the third
before the central-right True Path Party (DYP) led by former
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Interior Ministry has taken strict security measures to
prevent possible terrorist attacks in the elections throughout Turkey.

<HEADLINE> NATO Hits Chemical Plants, Ecological Disaster Feared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANCEVO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Aerial concentration of a
cancer-inducing substance rose over 10,000 times near Belgrade
Sunday as a result of NATO bombings on chemical plants in the
area, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Serbian environmental protection inspector Simon Bancov said a
chemical factory in Pancevo, 20 kilometers northeast of Belgrade,
was hit overnight, and that the level of vinyl chloride monomer
(VCM) in the air was 10,600 times above the normal readings
between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told Radio Pancevo that VCM, though not particularly toxic,
can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
Bancov urged environmentalists around the world to raise their
voices against NATO bombings on Yugoslavia, which entered the 26th
day Sunday, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
When a group of foreign and Yugoslav journalists arrived at the
Hip Azotara fertilizer plant, thick, black smoke could still be
seen spewing over 100 meters into the air.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old factory, hit three times in the past two days,
is now totally destroyed and can no longer produce the much-needed
fertilizers at a time of spring sowing, said Mirlan Dzindo, the
general manager.
</P>
<P>
"They wish to make our people ill and die of hunger," Dzindo
said.
</P>
<P>
Solobodan Tosivic, a toxicologist with the Serbian Medical
Center, said bombing of the chemical facilities, besides polluting
the air, soil and water nearby, will also cause an ecological
disaster in other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said some toxins will eventually end up in the Danube river
and then be washed into the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Pancevo took buses out to the Deliblato sand
waste to be away while the worst of the noxious gas blew over,
Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Pancevo Mayor Srdjan Mikovic told local television that "This
is an unprecedented crime. This is an attempt to kill an entire
town. They knew exactly what they were targeting and what the
consequences for the environment would be."
</P>
<P>
As the reporters were about to leave, a thunder storm started.
</P>
<P>
"Even the sky above us is crying," Dzindo, the manager, said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Get Loan from Kuwaiti Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will provide Egypt 21 million
Kuwaiti dinars (about 67.65 million U.S. dollars) in loan under an
agreement signed here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was sealed by Egypt's Ministry of Planning and
International Cooperation and the Kuwaiti official Arab Fund for
Social and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used by Egypt's Social Fund for Development (SFD)
to finance and develop small enterprises, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 99.7 percent of Egypt's non-governmental private businesses
are small enterprises, each of which has fewer than 50 employees. The
small enterprises provide 80 percent of the value produced by Egypt's
private sector and employ 75 percent of its labor force.
</P>
<P>
Ali Suliman, first undersecretary of the Egyptian ministry, who
signed the agreement for the Egyptian side, said the loan is the
second to be obtained by the SFD from the Kuwaiti social fund.
</P>
<P>
The first, worth 50 million dollars, was offered by the Kuwaiti
fund last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to sign another agreement in the coming
weeks, under which the Kuwaiti fund will provide the SFD a further 15
million dinars (about 48.3 million dollars) in loan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Suliman disclosed that Egypt has been offered a
total of 8 billion Egyptian pounds (2.3 billion dollars) worth of
loans by Arab countries' financial funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is
to pay a brief working visit to Egypt on Friday, Russian ambassador in
Cairo said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Vladimir Gudev told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that
the upcoming trip is part of Ivanov's Mideast tour that will also take
him to Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ivanov will hold talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa on the Mideast peace process in the light of
the approaching of the deadline of the Palestinian autonomy on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced that he would
declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year
interim self-rule period enshrined in the Oslo Accord signed with
Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been trying to win support from the international
community for the Palestinian plan and world recognition for the
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But most countries that he has visited recently have reportedly
advised him to postpone the planned declaration of the Palestinian
state to avoid further complicating the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will discuss ways of promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Russia maintain close ties both at political and economic
levels. And the two countries often coordinate stances on regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also cover the latest developments of the
situation in Yugoslavia, which is under continued airstrikes by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
NATO launched air raids against Yugoslavia on March 24 to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sign a peace agreement
granting autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo
and allowing the Western military alliance to deploy troops there as
peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Observe Independence Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zimbabweans Sunday
thronged the National Sports Stadium in the capital Harare to
celebrate the country' s 19th independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, President Robert Mugabe said his
government recognized the need to review the current constitution
which was a Lancaster compromise to end the liberation war.
</P>
<P>
He said such views on the constitution from both within the
government and outside had compelled the government to hold "wide
consultations" with various groups, a process which led to the
establishment of the constitutional commission which is expected
to begin work soon.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also appealed to all Zimbabweans "to renew your
commitment of loyalty and service to your country and guard
jealously Zimbabwe's sovereign independence."
</P>
<P>
"There are, among us those, but very few, who readily subject
themselves to the will of our external and internal hostile and
inimical forces seeking to undermine our national unity and
sovereign independence through division, disunity and subversion,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic situation, Mugabe said a generally
unstable macro-economic environment has marred the overall
performance of the economy in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar had created
strong cost- push inflationary pressures in the economy causing
inflation to rise from 24 percent in January to 46.6 percent by
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, interest rates had also gone up to over
45 percent, making it difficult for business enterprises to
finance their operations.

the bombings by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

<HEADLINE> Report of Museveni Demanding More Power Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The President's Office in Uganda
has refuted a report carried in Sunday's Monitor which said
President Yoweri Museveni had demanded power to dissolve
parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Sunday evening, the office said the
president has not instructed Mayanja Ngangi, Minister of Justice
and Constitutional Affairs, as reported in the paper, to draft a
bill which amends the constitution and to allow the executive to
dissolve parliament in case of a clash between the two arms of
government.
</P>
<P>
"President Museveni has not given Fox Odoi, the minister's
legal assistant, any instructions concerning the issue and neither
has he instructed Mr. Ngangi to draft a bill to this effect," the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
"He did not at any time suggest that the president be given
powers to dissolve parliament as the Monitor alleges," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the president talked about the issue
of a possible stalemate between the executive and parliament when
chairing a meeting of the National Executive Committee in the
eastern town of Jinja on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The president was giving his views about building the state and
what could help this process in the future. His views were
presented to the meeting for reflection, discussion and debate as
other people's views were, the two-page statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said both the executive and the parliament should
go in case of a serious paralysis on an important issue so that
the people elect a new president and a new legislature, it

<HEADLINE> Compromise Proposed on Nazareth Land Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli committee Sunday
proposed a compromise on a land dispute which has triggered violent
clashes between Muslims and Christians in Jesus' boyhood town of
Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
The proposal approves the building of a mosque on the disputed
land, but at a smaller scale than Muslims have demanded. Meanwhile,it
allows the Christian municipality to build a plaza in the area,
according to Israel television reports.
</P>
<P>
The dispute centered on a downtown plot of land near the Church of
the Annunciation, where the Bible says the Angel Gabriel told Jesus'
mother, Mary, that she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The municipality planned to build a plaza on the site for the
upcoming millennium, but Muslim residents said the area was once a
Muslim holy place and wanted to build a large mosque there. The
conflicting claims over this two-dunam (half acre) land sparked
violent clashes early last week, injuring several people and causing
property damages.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of the dispute, coupled with fears that the Christian
minority will suffer under possible one-sided solution, has prompted
Pope John Paul II to reconsider a planned visit to Israel in March,
2000, officials at the Religious Ministry warned.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Noises Meant to Harm Sino-Japanese Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The newly-elected governor of
Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, has recently been busy making statements
against China which are proved to be nothing but noises meant to
harm Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-rightist politician made anti-China noises repeatedly
before and after his election as governor of Tokyo, brazenly
making irresponsible comments on China's internal affairs,
including the country's political system and the Tibet and Taiwan
issues. This is really disgraceful for a Japanese government
functionary.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's anti-China statements, aimed at disrupting and
ruining the Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation, have only
served to arouse the wariness of the people.
</P>
<P>
However, Ishihara is nothing new to the general public as a
rightist politician. In the early 1990s, when he was a member of
the Japanese Diet (parliament), he worked hard trying to reverse
the verdict on the crimes committed by the Japanese aggressors
during wartimes.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that "the Nanjing Massacre is a fabricated lie" and
Japan, by staging the war of aggression, "saved Asian nations from
the colonial rule of the whites," a nonsense condemned by the
Chinese people and peoples of other Asian countries, and
criticized by the Japanese of insight as well.
</P>
<P>
As history demonstrates, maintaining and developing Sino-
Japanese friendly relations for generations to come not only meets
the fundamental interests of both the Chinese and Japanese peoples,
but is also a common aspiration of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese President Jiang Zemin paid a historic visit
to Japan, further promoting the Sino-Japanese relations of
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On such a matter that concerns the fundamental interests of the
Japanese people, Ishihara should have repented of his previous
statements and deeds and stop doing more things harmful to Sino-
Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he tried hard to reverse the verdict on the
Japanese aggression once again before the gubernatorial election,
and, afterwards, re-attacked the Chinese political system and told
lies on the Tibet issue, willfully distorting the fact that Tibet
is a part of China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he openly identified himself as "pro-Taiwanese,"
claiming he would pursue "gubernatorial politics" independent of
the Japanese government so as to create "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's attacks on China's political system are not worth
refuting. It is totally the internal affairs of a country to
adopt its own political system; and no foreigner has any right
whatever to interfere in it.
</P>
<P>
History proves that China has scored achievements that attract
worldwide attention under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party. And, Ishihara anti-China statements are nothing but futile
efforts.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Tibet has been an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory since ancient times. Since the 13th century,
successive central governments of China have exercised effective
sovereignty over it, including the stationing of troops and the
appointment and dismissal of local government officials.
</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty over Tibet has never been an issue as the
governments of Japan and other countries have all recognized it.
So, Ishihara's remarks on the Tibet issue are obviously not out of
ignorance, but with ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, on the Taiwan issue, Ishihara has also played an
infamous role. Since the normalization of the Sino-Japanese
relations, successive Japanese governments have adhered to the "
One China" policy, recognizing Taiwan as an inalienable part of
China.
</P>
<P>
The "Sino-Japan Joint Statement," "China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty" and "Sino-Japan Joint Declaration on the
Establishment of Friendly and Cooperative Partnership Devoted to
Peace and Development" have laid down the principle of mutual
respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and provided that Japan should only have non-official, regional
contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, as a newly elected local official, should understand
the Japanese government's commitment on the Taiwan issue, abide by
the "One China" policy and refrain from any official contact with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, however, has deliberately conducted activities meant
to split China and attempted to undermine the foundation of
friendship between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
And to cater to the ultra-nationalist trend of thought in Japan,
Ishihara has openly misrepresented Japan's history of aggression,
even at the cost of harming the overall situation of Sino-Japanese
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's sinister intentions have already been sensed by the
broad peace-loving Japanese people who cherish the friendly
cooperation between China and Japan. His efforts to reverse the
verdict on Japan's history of aggression have drawn criticism from
far-sighted people in Japan; and most Japanese media have rejected
his anti-China statements. All these show that Ishihara's remarks
designed to confuse people's minds have found little support among
the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan's devotion to a friendly and cooperative
partnership conforms to both the present-day world trend and the
basic interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should respect each other, treat each other as
equals and maintain good neighborly relations. Only by so doing
can they maintain and develop their relations in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, spreading anti-China remarks, sowing discord between
the Chinese and Japanese peoples and harming their friendly
cooperation, is doomed to be despised by peoples of both China and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> 25 Injured in Bangladesh Hartal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people, including five
policemen, were injured in the Bangladeshi capital on Sunday
during the dawn-to-dusk countrywide hartal (strike) called by the
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The hartal was largely "peaceful," despite some home-made bomb
blasts in different parts of the capital city, sources told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 71 people from the capital, but no clashes were
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance, comprising the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the
Islami Oikya Jote, enforced the shutdown to protest the "worsening
law and order situation," price hike of essentials, water and
power crisis and political repression on opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
The strike was staged a day ahead of the two-day meeting of the
Bangladesh Aid Consortium in Paris.
</P>
<P>
To maintain law and order during the hartal hours, the
government deployed some 5,000 police and para-military personnel
at strategic points of the capital city.

<HEADLINE> Blair: All Options Under Review for Nato Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Sunday that NATO had to see through its air campaign
against Yugoslavia but kept other options, including the use of
ground troops, under review.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CBS News, Blair was asked about ground
forces and said there were dangers inherent in a land force
invasion of Kosovo. But he added: "Our task is to make sure we
...drive (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic's forces out.
of course, as was said a few days ago, we keep every single option
under review."
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is to see the strategy we have through,"
Blair was quoted by Reuters as saying of the air attacks on
Yugoslavia, begun by NATO on March 24.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we are sending additional forces to the region and
additional planes, additional weapons as well. But the dangers of
a land force invasion are those that we set out right at the very
beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, Blair said that it was difficult to envisage Kosovo
remaining under the rule of Milosevic once the conflict is over, a
remark apparently echoing comments by U.S. President Bill Clinton
that the Balkans could not be secure while Milosevic was in power.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt...that for people in Kosovo to return to
their homes and be expected to live in any sense under the rule of
Milosevic is now extremely difficult to contemplate," Blair said.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Friendly Ties With ASEAN: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- With efforts from both sides,
China and the ASEAN countries can become "good neighbors, friends
and partners," Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress (NPC), said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Chinese reporters accompanying him on a
six-nation tour, Li said there are no conflicts of fundamental
interests between China and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN). "Both of us are developing countries and are
living in the same region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On further development of bilateral ties, he said China and
ASEAN countries should follow the four principles: keeping the
momentum of political contacts to further mutual understanding and
trust; expanding mutually beneficial cooperation in such areas as
trade, technology and financing; resolving the issues left over
from history through consultations on an equal footing; and
strengthening mutual coordination and supporting one another in
both international and regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's stance on the Meiji Reef of the Nansha
Islands in the South China Sea, he said the dispute between China
and the Philippines is only one part in the overall Sino-
Philippine relations, and is definitely a matter between China and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We still want to resolve the existing differences through
friendly consultations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li left here for home on Sunday after concluding a goodwill
visit to Thailand, the last leg of his six-nation tour which has
also taken him to Greece, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 18 (Xinhua)--The German government is preparing for
the visit of Iranian President Mohammed Chatami possibly in the
next month, a key cabinet member said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chatami will be the first Iranian state leader that pays a
visit to Germany since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The visit will end the ice age in the German-Iranian relation,

newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"...now the relationship between the two countries will develop
fast and powerfully," Hombach said. He visited Tehran earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The German enterprises can now freely take part in the projects
in Iran, Hombach said. A German business delegation is ready for
the visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Charrasi is expected to
visit Germany on Monday, when he will meet with his German
counterpart Joschka Fischer in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Further steps include reconstructing the parliamentary ties
between the two countries and opening a Goethe Institute in

<HEADLINE> Khatami Underlines Regional Cooperation for Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Sunday underlined cooperation among regional countries to maintain
security and stability without foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Foreign Affairs Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal, Khatami said that there is no
way but cooperation among the neighboring states to provide stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the aliens spare no time to sow discord in the region
because internal conflict helps them prolong their presence in the area,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We should do our best not to allow the discords to turn into a real
confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Iran, in light of its detente policy, is moving
toward helping security and tranquility in the region and "if we
cooperate with each other, we can be optimistic about the future of
the region."
</P>
<P>
Turning to Tehran-Sanaa relations, he said there is no limitation
for development bilateral relations in political, cultural and
international areas.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal, who arrived here on Saturday, delivered a written message
from Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Khatami on bilateral relations and the latest developments
in the region and called for further development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni government works to develop public participation to
provide necessities of the country and needs Iran's cooperation in
restoring democracy and strengthen civilized society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ba-Jammal said Iran plays a constructive role in establishing peace
and stability in the region and in the campaign against terrorism.

Some 80,000 troops had been earmarked for the operation and

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Expects Further Development of Sino-Thai Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), said here
Sunday that the good neighborly relations between China and
Thailand will be further developed in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in an joint interview to eight media bodies
of Thailand at the end of a goodwill visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the friendship between China and Thailand
dated from ancient times and that the two countries have supported
and helped each other on many world or regional affairs as both
are developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed sincere gratitude for the hospitality of the royal
family, the government and congress of Thailand extended to him on
his current visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Taiwan issue, Li said that the reunification of
China is the trend of the times and also a common aspiration of
all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that, after the reunification of the
motherland, the policy of "one country, two systems" will be
adopted in Taiwan and Taiwan can enjoy even greater autonomy than
that of Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said the reunification should not be indefinitely postponed.
The delay is not good for the people of China's mainland and
Taiwan, nor for regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the relations between China and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), he said the relations between
the two sides are of equality, mutual benefit, support and
development.
</P>
<P>
The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are still of
guiding significance for the development of relations between
China and the ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Though there are some problems in relations between China and
some ASEAN countries left over from history, they should be solved
by peaceful negotiations and friendly consultations, said the top
legislator of China.
</P>
<P>
When asked about how China views the issue concerning former
leaders of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge group, Li said he approved the
statement of the Cambodian government that this is an internal
affair of Cambodia and that only the Cambodian government itself
is entitled to handle the issue appropriately.
</P>
<P>
Li left Thailand for home later Sunday, concluding the six-
nation tour, which has also taken him to Greece, Turkey, Syria,
Pakistan and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Albania Not "Surprised" by Yugoslavia's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Albania said Sunday that it was
not surprised by Yugoslavia's decision to sever diplomatic
relations with it.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Albanian Foreign Ministry said the
decision by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to break diplomatic
relations is not "a surprise for the Albanian government and
people."
</P>
<P>
Belgrade had done so because of Albania's direct commitment to
giving support to the United States and the NATO, which has been
bombing Serbian targets from March 24 and caused massive damage to
Yugoslavia both in terms of property and human lives.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Kosovo crisis could be solved only
on the basis of the conditions set by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government will continue to support all the
efforts by the United States, the European Union and NATO for a
final solution to the crisis, the Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hands down Sentences on Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military tribunal Sunday
sentenced nine militants to death in a major trial in the government's
crackdown on Islamic insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Eleven others, convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government,
received life sentences with hard labor, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accused were among 107 persons charged with belonging to the
Jihad insurgency group that assassinated former President Anwar Sadat
in 1981, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The foremost accused, Ayman el-Zawahri, leader of the Jihad, was
sentenced to death with his brother Mohammed Rabie el-Zawahri. They
were among the 62 defendants tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The trial, which began on February 1, was the largest-ever case
brought by the state against Muslim insurgents.
</P>
<P>
Jihad and the Islamic Group, Egypt's largest militant group, have
been fighting since 1992 in an attempt to topple Egypt's secular
government and replace it with strict Islamic rule. More than 1,200
people have died in the insurgency, mostly militants and policemen.
</P>
<P>
The charges brought against the defendants included criminal
conspiracy, subversion, membership in an outlawed group, plotting to
carry out attacks on officials and police, attempting to prevent
security forces from carrying out their duties, and forgery.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced 17 accused to 15 years in jail with hard labor,
one to 15 years without labor, 19 to 10 years with labor, and 12
accused to seven years with labor. It acquitted 20 defendants.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has recently contained the insurgency by
increasing security measures, especially in southern provinces and by
arresting thousands of suspected militants and putting hundreds on
trial.

<P>
AMMAN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Sunday that Libya and Jordan shared identical views on regional
and world issues and Tripoli has promised to open its market for
Jordanian labor exports.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks upon his arrival in Amman from his
tow-day visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Abdullah and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
discussed bilateral economic cooperation and the stalled Middle East
peace process, Jordanian news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to Gaddafi, Abdullah thanked Libya for its
"generous and warm" reception accorded to him during his visit and
reiterated congratulations to Gaddafi on the suspension of U.N.
sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council suspended sanctions imposed on Libya in
1992 after Tripoli handed over recently two suspects of the 1988
Lockerbie bombing of a Pan Am jetliner which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has called for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit also prompted Libya to open its market for Jordanian
labor exports.
</P>
<P>
Labor exportation is one of the three pillars of Jordan's economy
together with tourism and foreign aid.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soldiers Arrive in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A second contingent of 400 Italian
soldiers arrived in Albania Sunday to take part in what the NATO
called the humanitarian "Allied Harbor" operation.
</P>
<P>
The Italian soldiers reached the Albanian port Durres by two
freighters, the Albanian news agency ATA said.
</P>
<P>
The freighters also carried 130 military vehicles and
logistical supports the soldiers would require to carry out their
mission of providing humanitarian service to the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia began more than
three weeks ago, as many as 321,739 ethnic Albanians fled their
homes in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of such a great number of Kosovo refugees posed a
grave problem for Albania, a country with a population of merely
two million.
</P>
<P>
Albania has appealed to the international community for
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
The ferry boat Major, which sails between Italy and Albania,
Monday brought 40 containers of food items to Albania while
another ferry boat Schilla carried ten vans outfitted with medical
equipment and ten buses to be used to transport Kosovo refugees in
Kukes, a small town in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven volunteers of the Italian Civil Defense and the Red
Cross Society also arrived in Durres by the Schilla.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of 400 Italian soldiers came to Albania
four days ago.

<HEADLINE> WTO Grants U.S. Right to Impose Sanctions Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A panel of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has formally granted the right for the United
States to impose sanctions against the European Union (EU) over
their long-lasting banana dispute, trade officials said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO decision, to take effect immediately, will allow the U.
S. to levy 100 percent tariffs on European exports to the U.S.
worth 191.4 million U.S. dollars for losses caused by the EU's
banana import regime.
</P>
<P>
The overall value of the WTO-approved tariffs, however, was
less than half of the original 520 million dollars sought by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU lost a previous WTO case against its banana regime in
1997. It amended the rules from the beginning of this year, but
the changes were considered unsatisfactory by the United States
and Latin American producer countries.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said the U.S. sanctions would go on
theoretically as long as the EU refused to change the banana
import policy.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, officials said the EU was unlikely to fight the
WTO ruling and would instead make changes to the controversial
system of banana imports.

will bring the enterprises cadres closer to the ordinary employees
and give more incentive to both sides.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia would utilize radio
programs as an alternative vehicle in education so as to meet the
classroom shortage, Education Minister Goderey Miyanda said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on the educational broadcast symposium
for school leavers in Lusaka Monday, the minister said the
government has decided to launch the education broadcast programs
as a way of increasing access to basic education for most of the
children by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said radio broadcast, which is able to cover the whole
nation, was one of the most effective avenues to extend education
to children with no access or were unable to continue with their
education.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has realized that there is no way to
depend only on classroom education and other non-formal education
and training efforts without the use of media such as radio.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000, or about 45 percent of seven-year-old
children in the southern African country could not be admitted to
primary education and more than 250,000, or 15 percent of children
aged seven to 13 were not attending school every year.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 percent, about 40,000 of the boys and girls were
failing to complete their education while 123,000, about 68
percent grade seven school leavers failed to proceed to grade
eight because of lack of school places.

broadcasting services, was actively pursuing the launching of an

day.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 1,500 meters freestyle final, Liu Yu from southern

<P>
The champions meet also served as one of the two qualifying
meets for the National Cities Games, with the other one slated for
June in Dalian, of the northeastern province of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
China's ace female swimmer Chen Yan, world number one last year
in 400m freestyle and 400m individual medley after her victories
at the World Championships in Perth, originally entered the Daqing
swimming meet to qualify for the National Cities Games. But an
under-par form forced her quit ahead of schedule to her native
town of Dalian, where she has to compete in the only other Cities
Games qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
At two meetings held here before the champions meet opened,
officials of the Chinese Swimming Association (CSA) announced its
three-stage plan for the preparations for next year's Olympic
Games in Sydney. The sport national body also declared that it
would try by every means to bring a drugs-free team to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee this, all the qualified Chinese Olympic swimmers
have to take their pre-Games training in the Beijing-based CSA
camp, where they have to receive compulsoty doping tests including
blood tests.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Warns Against U.S. Attempts to Control Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday warned against what he claims is an attempt by the U.S. to
bring Yugoslavia under its control.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is attempting to make Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic concede and thereby make Yugoslavia
an American protectorate, said Yeltsin in a meeting with Russian
media chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not allow this to happen because the Balkans is a
strategic place, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to play a role as a mediator and will
petition NATO to stop the bombing and return to peace negotiations
between the United States and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin described as a priority his wish that Yugoslavia accept
the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Kosovo in order to avoid
ground attacks by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also said that a Russian reconnaissance ship cruising
on the Adriatic Sea is collecting data about NATO's airstrikes on
Yugoslavia, but Russia has decided not to send more ships there.
</P>
<P>
Local observers have noticed a subtle change in Russia's stance,
which previously urged respect for the sovereignty of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday began to meet in a closed-door session to discuss the
latest developments in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan briefed the 15-member
Security Council on the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who just returned from his Europe tour, last Friday met
in four separate sessions with ambassadors of the five permanent
members of the Security Council to exchange views on Kosovo and to
stress with them the need for the Council to find a way to work
together on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"He believes that only when there is unity of purposes and
effective coordination, can progress be made," said a brief
statement issued after the separate meetings between the U.N.
chief and the five ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, which started the bombing of Yugoslavia on
March 24, has created a large exodus of refugees and a serious
humanitarian crisis in the embattled province, observers here
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, which went ahead with the military act without the
authorization of the Security Council, has violated the U.N.
Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security in the
world at large.

<HEADLINE> Greek Political Leader Criticizes NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Coalition of the Left and
Progress (SYN) leader Nikos Constantopoulos Monday criticized the
airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after briefing Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
on his recent trips to Yugoslavia and Macedonia, Constantopoulos
said that the masks and pretexts have fallen, and the magnitude of
the immense destruction that has been incurred by the war raids
against Yugoslavia is now apparent.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the developments are now dramatic as the U.S.
and NATO are making war against everyone, against the Balkan
countries, against the European Union (EU) and against legality,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader also accused the U.S. of isolating Kosovo Albanian
leader Ibrahin Rugova and supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
While saying NATO is preparing ground operations,
Constantopoulos urged the Greek government not to provide
facilities in ports and airports for use in NATO's such
operations.
</P>
<P>
Greece opposes NATO's air bombings on Yugoslavia, but allows
the alliance to use the airport and port of the country's northern
city of Thessaloniki to move supplies and troops into neighboring
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a poll published in Monday's News daily showed that
57 percent of Greeks are opposed to continuing to provide
logistical support for NATO in Greece for its bombing raids
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Greece's former Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos also
expressed his opposition to NATO's use of Thessaloniki for any
preparations for a land invasion of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the longer the crisis continues, the higher the
prospect of a partitioning of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, various groups are expected to stage an anti-NATO
and anti-U.S. protest outside the U.S. embassy here later Monday.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

deliveries of oil to Yugoslavia by sea, which have continued even

on land, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of the opposition Congress Party in India began
trying to patch together a new coalition a day after Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Jannata Party lost by a single vote.

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mobile Phone Users To Increase By 15 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of mobile phone
subscribers in China will increase by 15 million this year,
according to sources from the '99 Spring China Electronic Products
Commodities Fair.
</P>
<P>
The number of mobile phone subscribers exceeded 25 million last
year, making the sector a pillar of the country's
telecommunication industry. And the demand for mobile phones in
China is growing faster than that for other household appliances
like ordinary telephones, television sets and refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
The fast-mushrooming mobile phone market in China is attributed
partially to the participation of overseas investors, including
the US's Motorola, Sweden's Ericsson, and Finland's Nokia, which
occupy about 90 percent of the market share.
</P>
<P>
China has given priority to mobile communications since they
were introduced into the country a decade ago, with 50 billion
yuan (six billion US dollars) invested in the sector every year.
However, most of the products are imported or assembled with
imported parts.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Jurists Allowed to Take Part in Ta Mok's Trial: Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign judges and prosecutors
would be allowed to take part in the trial of Ta Mok, the Khmer
Rouge leader, a statement released Monday by the Cabinet of Prime
Minister Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
The statement reaffirmed Hun Sen's position which he made in
the meeting with the U.S. Senator john Kerry on April 6 while
touching upon the issue of the trial of Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
On the trial of Ta Mok, Hun Sen said that to meet international
standards, the trial of Ta Mok would be conducted by the existing
national court with the assistance from foreign countries, in
which foreign judges and prosecutors would be allowed to take
part.
</P>
<P>
But Hun Sen pointed out that "in order to allow foreign judges
and prosecutors to participate in the domestic trial, Cambodia
would enact additional pieces of legislation." Cambodia's laws ban
any foreign jurist to involve in court's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Whether the other Khmer Rouge leaders would be also indicted or
prosecuted, Hun Sen insisted it was the sole competence of the
court. "The Royal Government is not entitled to give order to the
judicial branch to do this or that," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that Hun Sen's latest position was new,
just weeks ago Hun Sen still insisted that foreign legal experts
would be limited to an advisory role.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's new stance opened the door for international
involvement in Khmer Rouge trial which has been a sticking point
in talks between the government and the United Nations on how to
try Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ta Mok, the last Khmer Rouge leader who was captured by the
government on March 6, was still detained in Phnom Penh waiting
for trial.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh's high-profile lawyer Benson Samay, 56, who was also
the ruling CPP's lawyer, had agreed to defend Ta Mok after Ta Mok
rejected the Military Court-appointed lawyer as too young and
requested Benson Samay as his counsel.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said he preferred to end Ta Mok's case
before the 21st century comes.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Says More to Be Done to Break Deadlock in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble said on Monday more work was needed in order to
achieve a breakthrough in the deadlock over arms decommissioning
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after crisis talks at Downing Street with Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern,
Trimble also denied that the stalled peace process was not about
to collapse.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, leader of IRA political wing Sinn Fein Gerry Adams
said the peace process was in freefall as calls for IRA
decommissioning continued.
</P>
<P>
"I am very disappointed in those comments. I think the process
is much more robust than that," Trimble, also leader of the Ulster
Unionist Party, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite sure this process is not in freefall and is not
going to be in freefall. This (peace) is what people voted for,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, including the two prime ministers, are anxious to
achieve progress. We believe the best thing to do is to continue
working at this process... We have agreed to keep in touch,"
Trimble added.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern, anxious to end years of bloodshed in Northern
Ireland, were meeting leading politicians on the issue that has
threatened the peace process since the Good Friday deal signed at
the start of the Easter holiday weekend in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern will on Monday also meet the other two parties
that signed the deal -- the Ulster Unionist Party and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionst Party refuses to sit in a coalition
structure with Sinn Fein until the IRA hands in arms but Sinn Fein
says the decommissioning was not a precondition of the peace
agreement for the party to join the local executive.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP To Hold Annual Meeting to Address Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) will hold its 55th annual
meeting on April 22-28 to address the ongoing economic crisis, the
agency said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The theme topic for this year's session is "Asia and Pacific
into the twenty-first century: information technology,
globalization, economic security and development", according to an
ESCAP press release.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and senior officials from 60 member and associate
member countries and territories of ESCAP are expected to
participate in the meeting. ESCAP is the only region-wide forum in
the Asian and Pacific region which meets annually at the
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
The commission meets against the backdrop of the current
economic crisis that began in Asia in 1997 and has turned out to
be more long lasting, widespread and deeper than had been
foreseen, causing dramatic and severe social problems with
unemployment and poverty increasing rapidly in several Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Seven Asian countries suffered negative growth in 1998 compared
to none in 1996 and only one in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Delegates are expected to discuss implications of recent
economic and social developments in the region and suggest policy
responses required.
</P>
<P>
Also to be discussed are environmental and natural resources
development, socio-economic measures to alleviate poverty in rural
and urban areas, transport, communications, tourism and
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
The session will be divided into two segments: the senior
officials' meeting on April 22-24 and the ministerial meeting on
April 26-28.

<P>
NICOSIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State at the
Home Office Joyce Quin will arrive in Cyprus on Thursday to help
move forward the stalled Cyprus peace process, the Cyprus News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy High Commissioner in Nicosia John Buck Monday
met with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides to discuss some of the
issues which could be raised during the visit.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission said Quin's visit is in the light
of the written statements issued by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and United States President Bill Clinton last December that
"there would be a big push" this year in efforts to settle the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Clinton issued the statements after the United
Nations Security Council approved resolutions 1217 and 1218
backing the U.N. Secretary-General's good offices mission in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Quin will have a working breakfast with Clerides on Friday,
followed by a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.

She will be accompanied by British government's envoy for the
Cyprus issue David Hannay.

working people, like the Dutch, who have fashioned a dynamic
environment which successfully blends the cultures of the east and
the west.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Tung said, the ties between the Netherlands and
Hong Kong have traditionally been close, going back to the
earliest days when cargoes were carried in the holds of ships of
the United East Indian Company.
</P>
<P>
"This has continued today: perhaps the most spectacular example
is when you flew into our magnificent new airport earlier today,
you were touching down on the land largely formed by the Dutch
dredging fleet," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the Dutch community plays "an important role in
Hong Kong's status as an international city. Last year, the
Netherlands was Hong Kong's 12th largest trading partner with a
total trade amounting to some 37 billion HK dollars (4.7 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Dutch guests were present at a welcome ceremony hosted by
the SAR government shortly after their arrival. They are scheduled
to conclude their China visit Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for EU Action to Restrain Yugoslav Oil Shipments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- France called on the European Union
(EU) Monday to impose restrictions on oil shipments to Yugoslavia,
after reportedly having a dispute over a U.S. proposal to ban such
shipments by sea.
</P>
<P>
"France suggests the adoption as soon as possible of a common
EU stand on the restriction of delivering hydrocarbon to FRY (
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), which the countries concerned,
particularly the neighbors of FRY, will be invited to join," said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The French proposal falls short of a U.S. call to block oil
supplies to Yugoslavia through the coast of Montenegro and
pipelines running through the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times quoted NATO officials as saying on Sunday
that the U.S. wants NATO to prepare plans to "choke off" the
supplies of oil that are still reaching Yugoslavia by sea.
</P>
<P>
But the American proposal ran into objections from France when
it was presented at a closed-door meeting of allied ambassadors in
Brussels last week, said the report.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes have been bombing Yugoslavia's oil stocking
centers and refineries.

<HEADLINE> Militiamen Violate Human Rights in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- While the people in southern
and central Somalia are suffering from the prolonged droughts and
diseases, outlawed militiamen are making their life even more
miserable.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here in Mogadishu, while the
people of southern Somalia in general and those in Lower Shabelle
region in particular are suffering from the droughts, heavily
armed militiamen scattered in the region are also extorting money
from the subsistent farmers, villagers and nomads.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center, the local human rights
organization in Mogadishu, expressed concern over the
deteriorating situation in southern Somalia, especially those
human rights violations committed by armed militiamen against the
defenseless and unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Sunday, the rights center graphically
 described its findings on the human rights situation in Qoryoley
district of Lower Shabelle region following its month-long
assessment trip to 15 villages surrounding Qoryoley town.
</P>
<P>
As water scarcity has been one of the major problems, the
militiamen have forcefully taken control of the troughs and other
man-made water reservoirs, making each barrel of water up to
20,000 Somali shillings (about 2.5 U.S. dollars) which can hardly
be affordable to anyone. The militiamen have also created
check-points along the river where the people can reach the water
for their animals and charge them 500 shillings for each time they
take water from the river.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the militiamen also imposed 1,000 Somali shillings
on each person going into or outside the town. The press release
signed by Dr Marian Owreye, one of the two co-chairpersons of the
center, said women in those villages also face indiscriminate
rape. Whoever fails to comply with the orders of the militiamen
faces penalties varying from the confiscation of all his or her
possessions or even gets shot on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Lower shabelle, the richest region in both farming and
livestock industries in Somalia, has become one of the poorest
since the civil war broke out in the country almost nine years
ago due to the large influx of immigrant militiamen. One of the
factors that discouraged the farming industry is the imposition by
the armed militiamen of 100,000 Somali shillings (about 11 U.S.
dollars) on each farmer before any farming season, an amount not
affordable by the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center has appealed to the relevant
authorities to carry out their own investigation into rights
violations committed against unarmed civilians in Lower Shabelle
region. It also asked the militia leaders to control their men
and prevent them from evil activities they are undertaking.

<HEADLINE> Training of Securities Regulators a Must, Says CSRC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese securities official
Zhou Zhengqing has stressed the need to improve the education and
competence of securities market regulators through systematic
training programs.
</P>
<P>
Zhou made the remarks in his capacity as the chairman of
China's securities market watchdog, the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), at a recent training session held in
Beijing for securities regulators from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
A release today by the CSRC said officials from its nine
regional offices and representatives' offices at the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock exchanges as well as officials from the two stock
exchanges took part in the training session from April 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC chairman said that as the reform of China's securities
market supervision system is bearing fruit and a united
supervision system is taking shape, it is high time to improve the
education and competence of regulators so that they will work more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
He furthered noted that the country's first securities law is
going to come into effect on July 1, which will not only play a
major role in regularizing the operation of the securities market
and protect the interests of investors, but will also make it
vital for regulators to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a systematic training of regulators in finance,
securities, law, accounting and auditing, adding that the training
sessions may be longer in the future.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Mobilizes Students, Medics to Donate Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals here hit by blood
shortages are now trying to mobilize university students and
medical workers to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 volunteer blood donors have registered at the
Municipal Blood Donation Office so that they can be called on at
anytime when blood is needed.
</P>
<P>
And the army of volunteers is expected to increase.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai needs about 70 tons of blood for clinical use each
year, which is never totally covered by donated blood.
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons for blood shortages in the city,
according to health officials, is a deeply-rooted opinion amongst
the people, which has been proved wrong, that donating blood may
be harmful to health.
</P>
<P>
College students, medical workers and those in the military are
often encouraged by the government to "set a model example" for
blood donation.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers in Shanghai will be neither paid nor given vacations
as a kind of compensation.
</P>
<P>
Some volunteers whose blood type is AB recently provided the
first aid to injured people in a serious traffic accident,
according to a local government official.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Government officials and medical
experts from 17 African countries gathered here Monday to discuss
how to control malaria in the region.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, organized by the World Health
Organization (WHO), is attended by more than 80 delegates from
Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea,

Ethiopia, Kenya, Egypt, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"Deaths due to malaria are estimated to be between 1.5 and 2.7
million annually," said WHO representative to Kenya Rufaro
Chatora at the opening of the regional meeting.
</P>
<P>
WHO recently introduced the global Roll Back Malaria (RBM)
Project, which has received positive responses from some African
governments, said Chatora.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is important to continue the process of
sensitization and awareness of the danger of malaria in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Chatora said the consensus building and planning meeting should
be able to set the 25-year malaria control program in motion.
</P>
<P>
lso assess the situation on the spread of malaria
and work out strategies to curb the top killer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is responsible for one out of every four childhood
deaths in Africa and contributes to poverty and under-development
in many countries, especially in sub-Sahara Africa, according to
WHO.
</P>
<P>
The WHO statistics also indicate that each year there are more
than 300 million cases of malaria in the world and last year
nearly five times as many as malaria cases were reported as TB,
AIDS, measles and leprosy cases combined.

<HEADLINE> China to Embrace Comprehensive Procuratorial Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua)-- A comprehensive reform of China's
procuratorial system is planned ranging from the introduction of
powerful regulating committees to empowering individual
prosecutors with independent decision-making authority.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guoqing, deputy procurator-general of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate (SPP), detailed the reform measures at a
national conference that ended here today.
</P>
<P>
Two other major innovations will see the further opening up of
prosecution procedures to the public and the setting up of expert
consultative committees, the meeting was told.
</P>
<P>
"Methods and regulations relating to the reforms, which are
aimed at establishing judicial fairness and efficiency, will soon
be promulgated by the SPP," he said.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorial committees will be relieved of their all
encompassing duties to enable them to focus on significant issues
and important cases, according to Liang.
</P>
<P>
"The decision-making process must be regulated to allow
democracy to flourish," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Chief prosecutors, who will be selected by their peers and who
will head prosecution teams, will handle the everyday decisions
relating to individual cases," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Within the peramaters of a pilot scheme to test out this
procedure, which will be introduced to part of the SPP and on
selected 10 cities, bureaucratic positions like "department heads"
or "section chiefs" will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"A chief prosecutor shall be held accountable for all the legal

Liang also explained that appeals and investigations into cases
will be carried out by separate divisions not actually involved in
those cases to avoid irregularities and ensure that procuratorial
bodies are subject to proper public supervision.
</P>
<P>
All accused should have their rights explained to them, such
as details for the exemption from prosecution. "And regulations
governing appeals against exemption from prosecution should also
be established," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors should show support for defending lawyers in
exercising their rights in lawsuits according to law. "But they
are not allowed to meet defending lawyers in private or accept
gifts or other benefits," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Regulations laying down recommended conduct for prosecutors
dealing with defending attorneys will be issued soon by the SPC.
</P>
<P>
The senior prosecutor said that in the first half of this year,
the SPC and provincial level procuratorates should hire experts to
form expert consultative committees which, in view of their
specialized knowledge, will be expected to provide recommendations
for decisions in specific cases, as well as providing training
programs for prosecutors.

MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev claimed Monday that NATO was preparing to send ground
troops into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"According to our information, energetic preparations are
underway for a NATO ground operation," Sergeyev was quoted as
saying by the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO was preparing to send troops in as either peace
keepers or combatants, but he said no final decision had been made.
He did not cite the source of his information.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow's firm opposition to
the NATO strikes has not changed. "Russia's position is correct.
There can be no military solution to the problem," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a most difficult process of political negotiations, of
looking for points of agreement. We are prepared to cooperate
closely with whomever is interested in trying to resolve the
situation politically."
</P>

The two ministers spoke after President Boris Yeltsin gathered
several senior officials in the Kremlin on Monday to seek a
diplomatic solution to the Yugoslavia conflict.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Arrives in London for Northern Ireland Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
arrived in London Monday to co-chair, with his British counterpart
Tony Blair, discussions aimed at breaking a deadlock over
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Downing Street No. 10 will be joined later in
the day by leading Northern Irish politicians who have been at
loggerheads over the decommissioning, which has threatened the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern will have separate meetings with three parties
that signed the deal -- Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionist Party and
the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
The talks come in the wake of a warning from Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams that the Good Friday Agreement will be finished if
demands for the IRA to hand over its weapons continue.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Good Friday Agreement is in freefall," Adams told
reporters in Belfast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going into these talks positively and constructively.
However, if the unionists stick to their position and the
governments don't move to implement the agreement, then
unfortunately this agreement is as good as dead," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Leading Protestant politician David Trimble, who is also
Northern Ireland's First Minister, said urgent progress was needed
to break the deadlock in the province.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to see if it is possible, as soon as possible,
to implement all aspects of the agreement of last year, which
includes the very crucial aspect of (weapons) decommissioning," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who represents the province's pro-British Protestant
majority, urged the Protestant paramilitary to hand over their
arms, suggesting this could prompt the IRA to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to appeal to them to discharge their
responsibility as well, and I remind the Loyalist paramilitaries
that they said before the agreement they would be prepared to
decommission alongside Republican paramilitaries," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Solving Y2K Problem (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
confident that the nation will solve the year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, director of the Information Products Administrative
Department under the Ministry of Information Industry (MII), said
today that major government departments and crucial sectors are
capable of solving the Y2K computer bug.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference sponsored by the Information
Office of the State Counicl today, Zhang supported her statement
by pointing to the fact that major sectors, including the banking,
securities, telecommunications, petrochemical and civil aviation
sectors, have basically completed revisions of their computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
Related sectors are currently testing, undertaking risk
evaluations and drafting contingency plans, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K is a problem caused by computer software and chips
which have used the last two digits of a year to save programming
space. Defective computers are expected to malfunction when
failing to recognize the arrival of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Estimates for fixing the millennium set global costs at
anything between 300-600 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank,
started revising its computer systems in 1996. The bank was the
first Chinese organization to deal with the year 2000 glitch and
has allocated over five billion yuan for related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, director of PBOC's Payment and Technology Department,
said China's banking system has completed revisions, tests and
contingency plans. "I'm confident of the timely solution," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank plans to change its annual settlements date to
December 30 this year, one day earlier than normal in order allow
more time for last minute work.
</P>
<P>
The plan must be approved by the State Council prior to
implementation.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom, the nation's largest public telecommunications
service provider, is also confident of solving related problems.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has been in Libya for talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on
west African situation, a report from the north African country
reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Images of Taylor's arrival on Sunday night at the airport of
Sirte, some 450 kms (280 miles) east of the capital Tripoli were
screened on Libyan state-run television Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am here essentially to congratulate Colonel Gaddafi"
following the suspension of U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya since
1992, the television quoted Taylor as saying at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, including an air ban, had been suspended
earlier this month after Tripoli handed over for trial in the
Netherlands two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
flight over Lockerbie in Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
This was former warlord Taylor's second trip to Libya in two
years. Taylor came to thank Gaddafi for having trained and funded
Taylor's guerrillas who launched in 1989 Liberia's civil war in a
fight among rival militias.

ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
is expected to tender his resignation to President Suleyman Demirel
Monday evening after the final results of the 21st parliamentary
elections were revealed.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit will go to the presidential palace at 18:00 local time
(15:00 GMT) to submit his resignation as prime minister of the 56th
minority coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit's central-left Democratic Left Party (DSP) has ranked the
first by winning 21.52 percent of the over 37 million votes in the
local and the 21st parliamentary elections on Sunday. The DSP has won
139 seats in the 550-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that local and parliamentary elections were
held simultaneously in Turkey. And the turnout rate was about 85
percent.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing National Movement Party (MHP) took the voters by
surprise by winning 18.66 percent of the ballots and will assign 131
deputies to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MHP has won support from young people and from many who had
supported the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), which has only got 15.14
percent of the votes and 108 seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The central-right Motherland Party (ANAP) led by former Prime

</P>
<P>
He noted that 90 percent of the company's computer equipment
has been revised to fit the turn of the century requirements, with
revisions of equipment needed to networks scheduled for completion
by July 1.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom will focus on contingency planning during the
remaining six months of the century.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Civil Aviation (CAAC) is
committed to flight safety, according to Lu Zongping, director of
CAAC's Y2K work. He stressed that normal flight schedules will be
maintained between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lu announced that flight intervals between 22:00 on December 31
and 02:00 on January 1 will be extended to 15 minutes, five
minutes longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, certain problems and difficulties remain, with an
investigation conducted by the State Economic and Trade Commission
that state-owned enterprises face "very serious" Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
For example, the sector must still update almost 50 percent of
systems and applications software, as well as 33 percent of
hardware. The situation is even worse for businesses which use
computers and chips more extensively.
</P>
<P>
Liu Li, deputy director of the Commission's Information Center,
called for state-owned enterprises to gain an increased awareness
of existing challenges. He urged related enterprises to meet the
June 30 deadline for computer system revisions, testing and
contingency planning.
</P>
<P>
However, funds shortages and the lack of punctual allocations
are hindering attempts to fix the glitch.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has pledged priority efforts to help
solve related problems, with the PBOC pledging to grant special
loans.
</P>
<P>
Zhang acknowledged China's inadequate preparation with regard
to potential legal conflicts related Y2K, and pointed the pressing
need for international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Denies Test-Firing of Long-Range Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Monday denied a media
report that it has test-fired a missile with a range of up to 300
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
It's true that South Korea test-fired a missile on April 10 off
its western coast but it was merely a routine training session,
not a newly-developed longer-range missile, said General Chae Woo-
seok, Director of the Research and Development Bureau of the
Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, Chae said, "The fired missile flew 40 kilometers and
its maximum range fell short of 180 kilometers, the permissible
limit under a South Korea-U.S. missile pact."
</P>
<P>
The Agency for Defense Development under the auspices of the
Defense Ministry conducted the test-firing after upgrading
existing missiles.
</P>
<P>
Vernacular Chosun Daily Sunday reported that the missile had a
maximum range of 300 kilometers although it flew only 40
kilometers and that U.S. military authorities vented anger at the
test-firing.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, South Korea signed a U.S.-proposed treaty banning the
development of missiles with a range of more than 180 kilometers
in exchange for U.S. missile technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
Under the decade-old missile agreement, South Korea could
develop missiles with ranges of less than 180 kilometers, but the
limitation, since last year, has invited strong protests from the
South Korean military, which is said to have asked the U.S. to
revise the treaty for the development of longer range missiles.
</P>
<P>
Seoul also reportedly wants to join the Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR) which allows member nations to freely

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Ocean Shipping Sectors Mark 20th Anniversary of Inaugural Voyage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the China Ocean
Shipping Company (COSCO) today left for Seattle in the USA to
participate in a celebration to mark the 20th anniversary of the
firm's first Sino-American voyage.
</P>
<P>
 On April 18th 1979, Liulinhai, a COSCO ship flying the
Chinese flag, arrived in the port of Seattle to mark the
resumption of cargo ships between China and the United States
after a 30 year break.
</P>
<P>
 Wei Jiafu, president of COSCO, said, "Liulinhai's voyage
opened a new era in Sino-US shipping history. Since then, the
scale and volume of our ocean transportation have increased
enormously."
</P>
<P>
 Mick Dinsmore, executive director of the Port of Seattle,
still has fresh memories of the Liulinhai's arrival.
</P>
<P>
 He said in an article to mark the voyage, "Since that
inaugural voyage, a strong bridge of commerce has been built
between China and the United States."
</P>
<P>
 Trade volume between the two countries increased from a low
of two billion US dollars in 1980 to exceed 63 billion US dollars
in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
 With the vigorous development of China's foreign trade over
the past 20 years, COSCO, a State-owned shipping company, has
become one of the largest shipping companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
 Since 1982, COSCO has expanded its shipping lines to
northeast, southeast and eastern America, where COSCO operates 23
liners, including the corporation's five most advanced container
ships.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan said Monday that the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China (HKSAR) will have much to gain if
China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference held here today, Chan noted that
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States has
increased the possibility of a further opening up of the inland
market and that China's access to WTO seemed to be all that closer.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the early accession of the inland to the
WTO. In our view, China's membership will provide all WTO members
with better market access, improved transparency and
predictability of trade policies and measures, and a means to
settle disputes multilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"Since the inland is our No. 1 trade partner, the HKSAR too has
much to gain from China's accession. We very much want to see
China successfully assuming its rightful role in the world trading
system," Chan said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A recent urban study revealed
that young Chinese are adopting a more open, tolerant and
independent attitude toward love and marriage.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted jointly by the Chinese Youth Studies
Center and Chinese Youth Development Foundation, found that
younger urban residents express a greater tolerance for pre-
marital sex.
</P>
<P>
Only 35.1 percent of respondents voiced agreement with the
traditional notion that "pre-marital sex is immoral and should not
be permitted under any circumstance."
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming number of respondents voiced opinions in stark
contrast with the traditional concepts.
</P>
<P>
Some 12.6 percent of the younger generation agreed sex before
marriage is acceptable so long as the couple eventually get
married.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 32.2 percent of respondents pre-marital sex in a
loving relationship is acceptable. Some 20 percent of respondent
endorsed pre-marital sex based on mutual consent.
</P>
<P>
However, a further analysis found men and women hold differing
opinions. Some 43.9 percent of female respondents, or 18.5 percent
more than male counterparts, pointed to the immorality of pre-
marital sex.
</P>
<P>
Respondents with higher education levels voiced a greater
tolerance towards pre-marital sex; with individuals living in
economically developed regions voicing greater tolerance than
counterparts in less-developed regions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Approves Final Draft on E.Timor Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
and his ministers Monday approved the final draft of the proposal
to grant East Timor a wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"If (the proposal) is rejected by the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), the government will ask the next MPR general
session to let East Timor separate from Indonesia," Foreign
Affairs Minister Ali Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a special cabinet meeting to discuss
the autonomy package for East Timor here, Alatas said the
proposal, which consists of 60 articles and 21 clauses, if
accepted by the East Timorese, will become an annex to an
agreement between Indonesia and Portuguese, the former ruler of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama are scheduled
to meet in New York on April 22-23 for the next round of talks on
East Timor under the auspices of the United Nations secretary
general. Alatas would present the final autonomy proposal at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the wide-ranging autonomy offered to East Timor,
Alatas said: "The autonomy has met the international norms and it
does not violate the Constitution as well as other relevant laws."
</P>
<P>
The autonomy offered to East Timor should be in line with
Indonesia's basic interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah said Habibie had
a telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister John
Howard on the East Timor issue prior to the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Habibie told Howard that Indonesia has urged the conflicting
parties in East Timor to disarm their troops.
</P>
<P>
Howard had phoned Habibie to express Australia's deep concern
about the actions of the pro-integration militia in the province.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people, including the son of pro-independence
fighter Manuel Carrascalao, were confirm dead when armed
militiamen rampaged unchecked through Dili, capital of East Timor,
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One person died and several were injured in a clash between
groups for and against East Timorese independence in Hera, east of
Dili, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on Sunday, Habibie's spokeswoman Dewi
Fortuna Anwar said the government accepted the blame for the
bloody violence in East Timor, but remains committed to a U.N.
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister and Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto Monday
dissuaded East Timor's pro-integration and pro-independence groups
from using weapons or physical strength in settling the problems
of the province.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said he had ordered the military and the police to take
stern action against anyone in East Timor who breaks the law.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 sq. km, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975 and became
an Indonesian province in 1976. The U.N. never recognized the
move.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced in January that it was
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy was refused by the people in the region and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Australia Attacks E.U. Agriculture Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia, together with other
Cairns Group members, Monday denounced European Union reforms to
agricultural subsidies as inadequate and a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
While reducing price support for farmers, the European Union
(EU) has largely replaced this with direct compensation payments
for farmers.
</P>
<P>
But Australia and other members of the Cairns Group argue that
it will do little to remove distortions which undermine prices.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has clearly missed a valuable opportunity to make
meaningful reforms to its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP),"
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The package is extremely disappointing. As it stands,
continuing high levels of agricultural support in the EU inhibit
the ability of efficient exporters to benefit from the growth of
world agricultural trade."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the CAP severely distorted world trade and cost
European taxpayers 42 billion U.S. dollars a year -- almost half
the EU's budget.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the EU's failure to tackle farm reform had damaged
prospects for reform of trade in agriculture, leading to a renewed
buildup in unwanted surpluses and cheap products dumped on world
markets.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement received by Xinhua, the Cairns Group
said the EU reforms were greatly disappointing.
</P>
<P>
"Levels of support will continue to be massive while barriers
to trade will remain as high as ever," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairns Group members include Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, Colombia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, the
Philippines, Thailand and South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
Experts participating in the survey listed three main reasons
for the increasing tolerance of young Chinese for pre-marital sex.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the younger generation is reaching sexual maturity
much earlier than previous generations, while their sexual
psychology and social maturity lags behind.
</P>
<P>
Next, the Western culture has prompted young people to reflect
on traditional culture, especially the "asceticism" which peaked
during the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the fact that the general public as a whole is
exhibiting greater tolerance towards pre-marital sex reduces costs
young people must pay for related behavior.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the young urban Chinese are becoming
increasingly open-minded and selective before in terms of issues
related to marriage and children.
</P>
<P>
Between 40-50 percent of respondents either expressed
skepticism about or disagreed with the traditional notion that
people should get married in due time and have children.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether marriage is worthwhile, some 16.7 percent
of respondents answered "extremely so", with 29.6 percent noting
that marriage is better than remaining single.
</P>
<P>
However, 41.9 percent expressed uncertainty and 11.9 percent
said staying single is the best option.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven percent of respondents said married couples should
have a child, with only 10.2 percent voicing the opposite response
and 32.8 percent expressing uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The increasing divorce rate and enhanced sense of private
property on the part of urbanites have promote an increasing
number of younger people to notarize individual assets prior to
marriage.
</P>
<P>
Some 52.4 percent of respondents endorsed the "notarization of
assets," with 24.4 percent expressing categorical opposition and
the remainder voicing uncertainty. (

<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard will meet Indonesian President BJ Habibie in Bali next week
for urgent talks on the soaring death toll in East Timor,
Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Howard made the arrangements Monday after pro-Indonesian
paramilitaries allegedly took control of the East Timorese capital
Dili over the weekend and murdered between 13 and 30 people in a
deliberate attempt to intimidate supporters of an independent East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled talks were announced after Howard rang President
Habibie earlier Monday to tell him of Australia's deep concern at
what was now happening on East Timor," the ABC said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would be accompanied at the meeting by Defense
Minister John Moore and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer.
</P>
<P>
"I said that there was a strong and inescapable impression in
Australia that (Indonesian armed forces) ABRI had not done enough
to discourage the violence and discourage the killings," Howard
told the ABC.
</P>
<P>
Howard said President Habibie did not dispute his assessment
during the 15 to 20 minute call that ABRI was at the very least
guilty of not preventing the massacres in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he has agreed to meet me shows he respects our
concerns," the Australian prime minister said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will further implement the
current monetary policies to ensure the stability of its currency,
the yuan (Renminbi), and fuel economic growth, according to the
People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Policy Committee under the PBOC, the country's
central bank, said that China will continue to increase the money
supply to prevent deflation.
</P>
<P>
The committee urged all financial institutions to improve
services and use credit leverages to support agricultural
development, infrastructure construction, technical upgrading, the
urbanization of small towns and external trade.
</P>
<P>
Greater importance will be attached to developing the money
market and a healthy money market will promote the development of
the capital market, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC has adopted a series of highly effective monetary
policies since 1998 to increase the money supply.
</P>
<P>

CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Starts Daily Forex Transaction at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
will start daily transactions Monday on foreign exchange at the
Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM), media reports here
said.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the CBN last week to all authorized dealer
banks said the IFEM will operate in tandem with the on-going
regular weekly intervention in the Autonomous Foreign Exchange
Market (AFEM).
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has selected 20 financial institutions for the
pilot program which is expected to run initially for not more than
two months.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the logistics are in place, more banks in this west
African country would be accommodated in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Tony Ede, assistant director of the Central Bank, explained at
the weekend that for the period of the pilot scheme, the other
banks would continue to participate in the AFEM transaction.
</P>
<P>
The daily transactions in forex involve two-way quote where the
Central Bank would be a buyer and seller at the market, according
to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is aimed at further enhancing market confidence and
sustaining stability in the exchange of local currency naira as
the two-way dealing could lead to achieving realistic rate of
exchange, it noted.
</P>
<P>
But industry sources said the daily quote would not solve the
problem of exchange rate instability as the rate in the market
would depend largely on the availability of enough forex to fund
the market.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a whopping 171.336 million was demanded at the
autonomous foreign exchange market, an increase of some 94 percent
when compared with the previous week's 88.348 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, some 1.46 billion U.S.
dollars was demanded in the market, which was 33.3 percent of the
1999 AFEM budget of 4.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Money market analysts said if the demand pattern at AFEM
continues, the Central Bank of Nigeria may pretty soon run into
difficulties with its intervention fund.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Nigeria's foreign reserve has already reached a
level where it cannot be further drawn down to defend the weakness
of naira.

<HEADLINE> China to Ease Controls on Overseas Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
ease control on overseas listings for domestic companies,
according to Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
Zhou said today that any Chinese company fulfilling requirement
will receive approval to seek listings on overseas stock markets,
with no restrictions on the scale and number of companies.
</P>
<P>
The CRSC chairman made the remark during a meeting with Lord
Mayor of London Peter Levene.
</P>
<P>
He called on foreign investors to actively participate in
overseas listings for Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
"China is striving to improve its investment environment," said
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He described London as the financial center of Britain and
indeed the world, as well as one of the major venues for overseas
listings by Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou hailed Sino-British cooperation in the financial arena,
and noted that a recent London seminar on the Chinese securities
market and overseas listings for Chinese companies have helped to
publicize the nation's securities market.
</P>
<P>
He said the Securities Law China adopted late last year will be
implemented on July 1, this year, and noted that the CSRC is
currently drafting supportive regulations governing implementation
of the law.
</P>
<P>
Lord Levene said he was deeply impressed with London seminar
sponsored the CSRC.
</P>
<P>
He added that British investors are greatly interested in
China's securities market and have expressed their desire to help
Chinese companies gain listings in London.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises Urged to Use Renovation Funds Wisely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
urged state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to use bank loans to upgrade
technology and products instead of earmarking related funds for
expansion programs.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) released a list
of priority areas for industrial and commercial investment.
</P>
<P>
Bank loans will represent the major source of investments in
fixed assets for SOEs, according SETC Deputy Minister Zhang
Zhigang.
</P>
<P>
However, bank loans will not be used to fund the construction
of new plants, with the exception of selected high-tech or
promising product renovation projects.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds will be channeled to upgrading existing SOEs
in order to renovate the country's industries and restructure the
economy. Profitable SOEs and ongoing construction projects,
especially projects scheduled for completion this year, will enjoy
priority in terms of investments.
</P>
<P>
The majority of investments will be earmarked for the
development of products with potentially large markets and high
competitiveness on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said technological renovation funds will focus on
altering the economic growth pattern by strengthening the
innovative capacity of SOEs and their ability to complete
technological upgrades. The funds represent an important part of
the pro-active fiscal policy adopted by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang emphasized diversified funding channels for technological
renovations, and called for the establishment of efficient
investment decision-making and supervision systems.

<HEADLINE> Japan Not to Change China Policy: Cabinet Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka reiterated Monday that Japan will not change its
policy toward China despite the recent anti-China remarks by newly-
elected Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara.
</P>
<P>
Japan's policy toward China will remain unchanged, and the
friendly relationship between Japan and China must be protected,
the top Japanese government official said at a press conference in
response to a question relating to China's recent criticism of
Ishihara's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, in an interview with Japanese media on April 12,
flagrantly attacked the Chinese government and its policy on Tibet
and uttered provocative words on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's ties with Taiwan, Nonaka said the Japanese
government has no intention to change the framework which was made
on the basis of the Japan-China Joint Communique, under which
Japan could only keep nongovernmental, working-level relationship
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nonaka also said it is undeniable that the Imperial Japanese
Army killed civilians and engaged in looting after the fall of
Nanjing in late 1937.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara had flatly denied the crimes committed by Japanese
aggressors in Nanjing, saying that the criminal act was a "
fabrication".

<HEADLINE> Israel's Election Campaign Gains More Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- As the election date draws near,
Israeli political parties have intensified their campaigns in order to
snatch more seats in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prime ministerial candidates such as the incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyanu and the opposition Labor party leader Ehud
Barak and the Center party leader Yitzhak Mordechai have speeded up
their campaign activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Likud, headed by Netanyahu, kicked off another election
campaign Sunday night in the Old City of Jerusalem with an open-air
rally.
</P>
<P>
Making an election issue out of Jerusalem's future status,
Netanyahu told the Likud members at the rally that the Israeli flag
must wave in Jerusalem forever and the Likud will never let the
Israeli flag be changed in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Like a pop star manipulating his audience from the stage,
Netanyahu allowed the crowd to shout out slogans against the Labor,
which he said would make more compromises to the Palestinians in
future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
While focusing on his government's economic achievements such as
creation of a free market economy, Netanyahu also attacked the Labor
for its reaching the Oslo Accords with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Jerusalem rally drew sharp criticism from other political
parties. Mordechai said Netanyahu's attempt to raise the Jerusalem
issue damages the national consensus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Barak promised again on Sunday in Tel Aviv to set
new budget priorities in order to restore economic growth if he
forms the next government after the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the Labor's 16-point economic policies as part of its
election platform, Barak said if he elected, he would revise the
1999 state budget to increase spending on education with the target
of creating 30,000 new jobs over four years.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party headed by Mordechai suffered another blow on
Sunday with Alex Lubotzky, former key member of the Third Way party,
announcing his decision to quit the Center party for his 12th place on
the Knesset list.
</P>
<P>
Isarel's new elections for Knesset members and prime minister
are schedueld on May 17. If a prime minister can not be decided on
that date, a run-off will be held on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Though the election campaign is gaining momentum, it is still hard
to predict who will be the next prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Consider Financing Egyptian Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Eight Arab financial institutions are
considering financing seven Egyptian development projects with a total
of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Doha on Sunday to attend an annual meeting of
the Arab Development Fund, Egyptian Minister of Public Business Sector
Atef Ebeid told reporters that three of the seven projects are in the
field of irrigation and the rest four are related to industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting starting on Tuesday in the Qatari capital of
Doha, Ebeid will present feasibility studies of the projects to the
eight institutions, which are members of the Arab fund. But he did not
give their names.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would hold separate talks with heads of the Arab
delegations to the meeting on the projects.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid, also
member of the Egyptian delegation, said that he would brief the
participants on the three irrigation projects in particular.
</P>
<P>
Abu Zeid said the first project is to dig the fourth branch of the
Toshka Canal in southern Egypt, the second is to elongate the Gaber
Canal in the Sinai peninsula and the third will renovate Nile barrages
in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
He termed the meeting as a good opportunity for Egypt to seek
foreign aid to its agricultural development projects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is carrying out ambitious projects in the south and Sinai to
channel Nile water to the desert to reclaim land. The mega-projects
are aimed at luring Egyptians to leave the overcrowded Nile valley for
the newly-developed areas.

KATHMANDU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Man Mohan Adhikari, chairman of
the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML)
and the party's prime ministerial candidate for the May general
elections, was hospitalized Monday, sources said.

A source said Adhikari felt "very uneasy" Monday morning after
returning home from a campaign in the capital. He was at the
intense care unit of the Teaching Hospital here.
</P>

It was not clear what illness struck him, the source said.

Adhikari, 79, was last hospitalized in January this year due to
an attack of asthma.

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Chief: Ousting Milosevic Not NATO Aim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Monday that NATO was not trying to oust Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"It's not our objective to remove Milosevic from power. His own
people will eventually do that to him because of the damage he has
done to his country, the stain he has left over Serbia," Robertson
told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged Milosevic was proving more "stubborn" than NATO
had expected, saying "his obstinacy is a surprise but the reality
is that he has to take us for the long term. We are not going to
go away."
</P>
<P>
It had always been clear the NATO campaign would be a long one,
he added.
</P>
<P>
But British Prime Minister Tony Blair had indicated on Sunday
that driving Milosevic from power had become a main aim of NATO's
campaign, while U.S. President Bill Clinton had predicted earlier
that the Balkans could not achieve peace while Milosevic "
dominated" the region.

<HEADLINE> NATO Discusses Air Dropping Aid to Displaced Kosovars: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO countries are discussing the
possibility of air dropping aid materials to the displaced
Kosovars who are still remaining in the Yugoslav province, said a
top French military officer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of General Staff of the French Army, General Jean-
Pierre Kelche, said that France is ready to stage air dropping
operation over Kosovo, but it needs to wait for a coordination
from other NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
He said an air dropping operation by NATO would have a limited
effect in helping the displaced in Kosovo, but it is better to do
something than do nothing.
</P>
<P>
Kelche also announced that France is reinforcing the means of
intelligence reconnaissance of Kosovo by deploying in Macedonia
two "Drone" reconnaissance planes without pilot and a "Horizon"
radar helicopter.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said that France would
seek all means to help the Kosovars driven from their homes and he
suggested that NATO establish a special force to take charge of
air dropping operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the displaced civilians in Kosovo usually gather
in small groups on the road or are hiding in the forests.
</P>
<P>
The displaced Kosovars are often under great pressure from the
Serb forces, who often move together with the convoys of the
civilians, he added.

<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has
registered 735,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees, or more than one
third of the 1.8 million Kosovo Albanian population living in the
Yugoslav province in 1991. In the refugee camps of Albania and
Macedonia, the situation is becoming more and more difficult.
Meanwhile, NATO launched on Sunday its most intensive bombings
against Yugoslavia since the beginning of the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- Three weeks of air campaign by NATO has not stopped Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic from realizing his objective:
Emptying by force Kosovo its majority population of Albanian
origin. After several days of exodus of refugees which resulted in
a unilateral closing of the frontier, the uninterrupted flow of
the deportees over the past three days into Albania is the most
certain sign of this.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO said on Sunday that it possessed photographs which
could represent 43 mass graves in Kosovo. The U.S. ambassador in
charge of issues of war crimes David Schefer said that the
whereabout of some 100,000 Kosovo Albanian men is unknown.
Meanwhile, the debate on an eventual territorial invasion of
Kosovo by NATO has reappeared suddenly.
</P>
<P>
-- In Macedonia, the feeling of hostility of the local
population toward NATO troops is becoming more and more bitter.
Meanwhile, French officials engaged in medical and health
cooperation with Albania pointed out that the health and medical
care situation in Tirana, which badly lacks medical and health
facilities, is worsening dramatically because of the influx of a
huge number of Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> Agreement to Resolve DRC Crisis Signed in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The regional summit on the
situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which started
in Sirte, Libya Saturday, has ended with a communique calling for
an immediate cessation of fighting to pave way for peaceful
resolution of the eight-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
The summit was chaired by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and was
attended by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, DRC President
Laurent Kabila, Aissaias Afwerki of Eritrea and Idriss Debie of
Chad, a press release from the Ugandan President's Office said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique signed by the regional leaders, they
stressed the need for security and integrity of the borders of all
the states concerned and agreed on the deployment of a neutral
African peace-keeping force in areas under foreign troops in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
The summit condemned all acts of violence and mass murder and
affirmed the need to pursue the murderers and punish them.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of a peaceful settlement of the issue, the leaders
agreed that the DRC should encourage and pursue a policy of
national dialog involving all concerned parties in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
They held that as soon as a peaceful agreement is reached, all
foreign forces in the DRC should be withdrawn and called for a
commitment to respecting the principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of countries.
</P>
<P>
The war in DRC erupted in early August of 1998. The DRC
government has military support from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and
Chad while the Tutsi rebels fighting to oust Kabila are alleged to
be backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The war has never ceased in spite of regional and international
efforts to bring the armed conflict to an end. The prolonged war
has exerted a heavy economic burden on all the key players in the
war.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Expand Cellular Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vodacom has invested 2.8 billion Rand (460 million dollars) in
the last financial year beginning from March 21, and more than
nine billion Rand (1. 5 billion dollars) since it began operations
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This massive investment will ensure best cellular service for
our existing two million subscribers and... ensure adequate
capacity for the constant growth in new subscribers," Vodacom's
chief executive officer Alan Knott-Craig was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new investment would be pumped into six new switches, voice
mail platforms, transmission equipment and home location
registers.
</P>
<P>
The main suppliers would be Siemens of Germany, Alcatel of
France and Motorola of the United States.
</P>
<P>
At present Vodacom's network consists of more than 3,000 base
stations, covering 13,000 km of national roads and 80 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are two cellular phone operators in South

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects New Chapter in Jordanian-Syrian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein is
to start an official visit to Syria Wednesday for talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad on the bilateral ties and the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Sunday evening that his visit to Syria "is bound to
open a new chapter in the Jordanian-Syrian relations, which had been
affected by the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel."
</P>
<P>
Assad had been at odds with late Jordanian King Hussein, who died
of cancer on February 7, over the peace treaty. However, Assad
declared a three-day mourning in Syria for Hussein and paid a first
visit in years to Amman to attend Hussein's funeral on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Assad's good-will gestures met with a positive response from the
Jordanian government, which later expressed support for Syria's
conditions to resume peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials described Abdullah's upcoming visit to Syria as
part of the Jordanian-Syrian consultations and coordination of Arab
stands in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria hoped to resume the peace talks with Israel from where it was
suspended while the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu insisted that the peace talks should be conducted on new
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Damascus has blamed the Netanyahu government for being reluctant to
keep the promises made by the former Israeli Labor government to carry
out the "land for peace" arrangements and withdraw Israeli troops from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the fifth leg of Abdullah's regional tour in April, which
has already taken him to Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The visits have been intended to drum up support for the stagnant
economy of Jordan and to coordinate Arab stands on the deadlocked
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Encourages Local Businesses to Invest Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
issued a decree to encourage local businesses to invest abroad,
Vietnam's English business newspaper Saigon Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the decree issued last week by Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai, businesses investing abroad must be those set up under
Vietnam's corporate law.
</P>
<P>
The decree, which will take effect on April 29, only applies to
direct investment abroad by local businesses. It does not apply to
foreign-invested enterprises and those involved in business
cooperation contracts.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese businesses investing abroad must have feasible
projects which they are financially able to implement, and must
fulfill all their financial duties to the state.
</P>
<P>
Appraisal of their overseas projects will take 30 days after
submission of applications. Within five days, Vietnam's Ministry
of Planning and Investment (MPI) will garner opinions from
localities on the projects, and agencies must respond in writing
to the ministry within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Projects worth over 1 million U.S. dollars must be submitted to
the prime minister for consideration over at least 15 days and the
investors concerned will be informed of the prime minister's
decision seven days after it is made.
</P>
<P>
The MPI is authorized to appraise projects worth less than 1
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese businesses, according to the MPI, currently have 20
overseas projects worth around 3 million dollars in total, mostly
in Laos and Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has set up several pollution
monitoring systems in a number of newly-built industrial towns, the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of State for Environmental Affairs Nadia Makram
Ebeid was quoted by the paper as saying the new geographical
information systems have been set up in the towns of 10th Ramadan, 6th
October and Sadat.
</P>
<P>
Together with 10th Ramadan, the towns of 6th October and Sadat,
which were named after the 1973 war with Israrel or the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat respectively, were built around the capital of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the systems, as part of a program worked out
by the World Bank, is aimed at monitoring pollution problems including
toxic waste and those resulting from environmental activities, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Terming the systems as a model for analyzing the condition of
pollution, she said they will help decision-makers seek solutions to
the problem on an economic basis.
</P>
<P>
The systems are to be implemented in five months, the minister
said, adding that a database has been set up for 500 out of 600
industrial enterprises in the town of 6th October.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Involvement in Uganda Bomb Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
denied any involvement in the recent spate of bomb blasts in
Uganda's capital city Kampala, which killed several people and
injured many others.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister for Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwas said in a
 statement over the weekend that his country does not train
terrorists and has no program for terrorizing anyone or any
country, according to a New Vision daily report Monday.
</P>
<P>
His government was interested in the identity of the so-called
" Zimbabwean terrorist" and hoped that the Ugandan police through
their normal Interpol channels would liaise with the Zimbabwe
police, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
A man, identified by Ugandan security as a Zimbabwean, was
arrested last Monday at a Sheraton Hotel shopping arcade as he
tried to change money at Speedbird Forex Bureau.
</P>
<P>
They did not divulge his name but believed that was meant to
finance the bomber. They said he is a Zimbabwean carrying a
Ugandan passport under a Kiganda name.
</P>
<P>
The security authorities here remained tight-lipped about the
suspected terrorist's fate.
</P>
<P>
Three bombs went off within 48 hours last week, killing at
least four people and maiming many others. Security sources
suspected that one of the bombs was meant to explode during the
Uganda-Tunisia football match at Nakivubo Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Record Flooding Exacerbates Yangtze Silting Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Recent rainfalls have increased
the water level along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River, allowing normal aviation in China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
Last summer's record flooding created unprecedented silting in
the Yangtze River valley and in turn compounded difficulties
related to winter navigation, according to a recent issue of
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze Navigation Administration reported that flood
waters deposited 220 million cubic meters of silt in 20 low-lying
river sections, up by a substantial 130 million cubic meters on
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted in February indicated that the Yangtze water
level was some 0.1-2.09 meters lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, 17 dredges and massive volume of
explosives have been used to remove over 4.9 million cubic meters
of silt in the middle and lower reaches of the river and ensure
the uninterrupted passage of ships, according to Zhou Guanlun,
director of the Yangtze Navigation Administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted the annual drop in the Yangtze's water level in
recent years has greatly hampered navigation along 1,600 km in the
middle and lower reaches of the river. He added that dredging
operations have been completed for only two of over 30 low-water
sections.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that banks and levees along the river have been
strengthened in the wake of last year's flooding, but noted that
silting remains serious.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments to stress silt removal and
efforts to further strengthen dikes and levees.
</P>
<P>
"The removal of one meter of silt will be much more effective
against flooding than raising the height of levees by an equal
measure," said Zhou.

<HEADLINE> S'pore NTUC to Focus on Strengthening Social Cohesion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore union leader Lim Boon
Heng Monday vowed to step up the pace in carrying out six key
programs in a bid to strengthen social cohesion in the city state.
</P>
<P>
In announcing corporate plans of the National Trades Union
Congress (NTUC) for the financial year 1999/2000, NTUC Secretary
General Lim said the labor movement will continue to focus its
efforts on strengthening social cohesion by implementing and
consolidating its initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Lim said Singapore has effected the cuts in wages and Central
Provident Fund (CPF) to help restore competitiveness for the sake
of strong social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the welfare for workers is inextricably linked to the
country's stability and economic growth and to a company's
profitability and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said the tripartite relationship between the government,
employers and unions is an important component of social cohesion
in Singapore and the labor movement will continue to broaden and
deepen the cooperation with employers and the government.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Industrial Relations for Competitiveness
program which tops the six NTUC programs and focuses on
strengthening tripartism and bipartism, Lim said constructive
industrial relations are a key to strengthening social cohesion in
the work place.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the Productivity Push program, Lim said it is
designed to enlarge the economic pie for all in the company and in
the economy and to ease social tension and conflict when the
economy is weak and the community is poor.
</P>
<P>
"In the past year, we have had to cut costs to prevent the pie
from shrinking too quickly and drastically," he added.
</P>
<P>
The other programs NTUC have adopted include the Workplace
Health program, Employment Assistance program, skill Certificate
program and Community Development program.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's unemployment rate surged up to 4.3 percent last
year and the country managed to maintain its stability. However,
the problem remains a major concern of the country.

JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leaders will ask for U.S. commitments this week to
pressing Israel to implement the Wye agreement and conclude
final-status talks within a year, in exchange for scrapping the idea
of declaring an independent state on May 4. A Palestinian negotiator
reportedly said the U.S. administration has agreed to give the
Palestinian National Authority a letter stating its position on the
peace process and on settlements.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's population rose by 2.3 percent last year to 6.038
million, according to the 1998 data published Sunday by the Central
Bureau of Statistics. The number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip grew by 7 percent last year to 172,000, after rising by
9 percent in 1997 and 9.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<HEADLINE> China Needs Further Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The development of townships is
an essential method for promoting the growth of the domestic
market and expanding domestic demand, according to Professor He
Wei of the People's University of China.
</P>
<P>
China has 900 million rural residents, and if their purchasing
power can be released through urbanization, a huge market
incomparable to any other in the world will emerge.
</P>
<P>
Many products, such as household electrical appliances, do not
sell well in rural areas, not because they are not needed, but
because living conditions there restrict their use, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, rural residents, accounting
for over 70 percent of the nation's population, consumed 40
percent of all commodities in 1997, while this figure was as high
as 50 to 60 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Du Runsheng attributes this declining trend to
a slow urbanization process. He said that problems in urban and
rural areas are interrelated, and the problems of farmers can be
solved by turning them into urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Du's point of view was echoed by economists attending a recent
forum on China's market economy, many of whom pointed to the fact
that urbanization is crucial for resolving problems in many
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China had 18,402 towns in 1997, about
8.5 percent for each county, on average.
</P>
<P>
Wan Dianwu, president of the China Business Association,
projects that 100 to 200 million rural residents can be resettled
if 10,000 more townships are developed in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
But He Wei warns that townships should not be developed in a
random fashion, adding that the government should promulgate a
unified policy and render strong support where needed.

<HEADLINE> Zambia May Become Big Agro Exporter: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Out-going Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) Representative in Zambia, George Mburathi, said
Zambia will turn itself into the net exporter of agricultural
products in the region if granted a proper communications network.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper quoted Mburathi as saying
at the weekend in Lusaka that the country stood to gain from its
favorable climatic conditions in the agricultural sector as long
as the necessary infrastructural development was prioritized.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Zambia has a lot of potential to feed the whole
region. All that it requires is to maximize the utilization of its
resources and continue with the vital road network development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The representative was optimistic about the relevance of the
agricultural policies in place which he said would add an impetus
to agricultural productivity and export performance.
</P>
<P>
He singled out the policies behind the Zambia forestry plan,
small scale irrigation and the revitalized agricultural sector
investment program as appropriate initiatives that would spearhead
the country's agricultural development efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In my term in office, I have seen these policies take shape
and I feel they are essential elements in the country's efforts of
improving the agricultural industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mburathi, who has served in the Zambia office since 1993, has
been transferred to Accra, Ghana, to serve as FAO's deputy
representative in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Danish Agency Withdraws Aid to kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Danish International
Development Agency has withdrawn a 130-million-shilling (about
two million U.S. dollars) sponsorship for a major immunization
program in Kenya..
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the Kenyan authorities failed to
meet several conditions set by the agency, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency urged the Kenyan government to formulate a strategic
 plan for the health sector and gazette names of district health
management boards before last December 31.
</P>
<P>
Following a request by the Kenyan government, the paper said,
the Danes would fund the procurement of vaccines for the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
A counsellor at the Danish embassy here, Birger Friedrickson,
said following the Kenya's request, his government had decided to
grant the program 65 million shillings (one million dollars) for
next six months.
</P>
<P>
However, he maintained that his government was not "supporting
the Ministry of Health anymore, at least for the time being."
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal, Kenya's immunization program faces
uncertainty because the Danes had been the leading donor to the
the health sector, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Danish parliament was expected to discuss the issue this
month to resolve whether or not to release the withheld funds.
</P>
<P>
But a source from the Danish embassy said that Kenya was
unlikely to receive any further assistance from his country
because of high level corruption and bad governance.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Asian Economy to Recover Gradually in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Asia's developing economies will
experience a 4.4 percent growth in 1999 and a more robust recovery
in 2000 with the easing of a regional financial crisis, the Asian
Development Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 1999" released here, the
Manila-based bank predicted that gross domestic product (GDP) in
developing economies in the region are expected to grow 4.4
percent this year and 5.1 percent in 2000 after a modest 2.6
percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
"The slowdown in Asian growth that began with the export
deceleration of 1996 and worsened with the 1997 currency crisis
turned into a widespread regional contraction in 1998," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that growth in the developing economies of East and
Southeast Asia, excluding China, was "the lowest since World War
II," averaging minus 6.9 percent in the economies of Southeast
Asia and minus 1.4 percent in the newly industrialized economies
-- China's Hong Kong and Taipei, South Korea, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"But the crisis had only a mild impact on the People's Republic
of China (PRC) and South Asia, and the PRC succeeded in
maintaining the external value of its currency," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the richer and traditionally more dynamic
Asian economies generally fared the worst during 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Southeast Asia remained at the center of the crisis, with
Indonesia suffering a huge contraction and Malaysia and Thailand
hit by substantial declines," it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the four newly industrialized economies, it said, only
China's Taipei weathered the storm with little damage, and South
Korea suffered a major contraction.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, economies in Southeast Asia will
increase 0.8 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, and the
newly industrialized economies will grow 2.3 percent this year and
4.3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook (for Southeast Asia) for 1999 depends on the fate
of current reform initiatives and the mood of world capital
markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, both last year's performance and this year's
situation are better than the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian economy registered a 5.7 percent growth in 1998
and will grow 5.5 percent this year and 5.8 percent next year, the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
On capital flows in Asia last year, the bank said that private
capital flows to emerging Asia, which reached 105 billion U.S.
dollars in 1996, turned negative in 1998 as foreign investors
scrambled to move money out of supposedly risk markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
"That forced central banks into monetary contractions, reducing
domestic demand and exacerbating an already large bad debt
problem," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the inflation situation in regional economies, the
bank said currency devaluations drove up inflation rates in
several crisis-affected economies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's sharp depreciation in late 1997 sparked high
double-digit inflation in Indonesia, while more moderate
depreciations in South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand also prompted increases in inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Across Asia, the average rate of consumer price inflation rose
to 6.5 percent (in 1998) from 4.6 percent in 1997," it said.
</P>
<P>
But the banks estimated that average inflation should moderate
to about 4 percent in 1999 as the shock of the late 1997
depreciation dies out.
</P>
<P>
On the current accounts situation in the region, the bank said
that from approximate balance in 1997, Asia's aggregate current
account moved to a surplus of 3.6 percent of GDP in 1998, but most
of that improvement came from import reductions as overall exports
failed to increase as expected.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that next private capital outflows from Asia are near
zero and that import demand recovers only slowly, the region's
aggregate current account should remain in surplus in 1999," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that although many of the worst hit
countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have instituted
significant financial sector reforms since the crisis began, the
ratio of non-performing loans to total lending continued to rise
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The regional non-performing loan ratio of 20 to 30 percent
represented an equivalent share of output, as financial leverage
in Asian economies remained at about 100 percent of GDP, it said.

<HEADLINE> Newly Industrialized Economies to See Positive Growth in 1999         (Embargoed Until 1601 GMT, April 19) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- After suffering a negative growth
in 1998, Asia's newly industrialized economies (NIEs) will see a
2.3 percent growth this year and a 4.3 percent growth in 2000, the
Asian Development Bank said in a report here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's "Asian Development Outlook 1999" said that aggregate
growth for the NIEs -- China's Hong Kong and Taipei, South Korea
and Singapore -- was minus 1.4 percent in 1998 as the Asian
financial crisis engulfed the region's richest economies.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's recession turned out to be worse than anticipated
at the end of 1997 and its annual output fell by 5.5 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"GDP (gross domestic product) in China's Hong Kong was sharply
negative, while Singapore managed positive growth of 1.5 percent,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said inflation in the NIEs rose in 1998, primarily
because of price increases in South Korea stemming from the won's
steep depreciation.
</P>
<P>
China's Hong Kong and Singapore actually had lower inflation in
1998 than in 1997, largely because of the steep drop in asset
prices, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the NIEs' export performance in 1998 was not
encouraging and weak demand from other crisis-affected Asian
economies was largely to blame.
</P>
<P>
"Weak global demand for electronic products also hurt exports
from the NIEs," it added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the outlook for this year, the bank said world
capital flows will continue to exert a major influence on the NIEs
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Recovery of the Japanese economy and a stronger yen would help
stimulate recovery in this group of economies," it said.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, the bank said, South Korea is expected to have growth
of 2 percent, while China's Hong Kong is likely to experience a
further contraction of 0.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Singapore should post 1 percent GDP growth in the year, while
growth in China's Taipei is projected to remain stable at about 5
percent in 1999, it said.

<HEADLINE> Southeast Asia Outlook Depends on Reform process-ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Economies in Southeast Asia could
grow 0.8 percent in 1999 after a sharp decline in the previous
year, but the outlook for this year still depends on the fate of
reform initiatives and the mood of world capital market, said the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"After 4 percent growth in 1997, the region contracted by about
7 percent, underperforming even the most pessimistic expectations
for the year (of 1998)," the bank said in its "Asian Development
Outlook for 1999" released here.
</P>
<P>
It said that more than 30 billion U.S. dollars fled Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia continued to bear the brunt of the crisis as exports
and investment collapsed, reducing output by 13.7 percent in 1998,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand implemented a series of financial reforms, but its
gross domestic product (GDP) still suffered an 8 percent
contraction, it said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the bank said, at first "appeared to avoid the worst
effects of the crisis, but capital outflows late in the year
brought growth down to minus 6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, tight monetary policy to defend the peso
constrained investment demand, while poor agricultural performance
caused by bad weather limited growth from the supply side, it
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the Philippines' relatively low level of financial
leverage, about 60 percent of GDP, and continued strong export
demand helped save it from some of the worst effects of the year,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said growth in Laos and Vietnam slowed from the
previous year, as the former was hurt by the baht's depreciation
and the drop-off in Thai investment, and the latter suffered from
a fall in foreign direct investment from newly industrialized
economies.
</P>
<P>
Laos' real GDP growth fell to about 4 percent in 1998 from 6.9
percent in 1997, while Vietnam's from 8.2 percent in 1997 to 4
percent in 1998, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's prediction, this year's GDP growth will
be zero percent in Indonesia and Thailand, 0.7 percent in
Malaysia, and 2.4 percent in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's economy will increase 3.7 percent this year, but
Laos' economic performance could be better than last year's if its
government is able to reduce the inflation rate and stabilize the
exchange rate, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On inflation in the region, the Manila-based bank said
inflation in 1998 increased fourfold from the previous year,
driven by currency devaluations and in some cases, food price
increases arising from the impact of the El Nino drought.
</P>
<P>
But with the exception of Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos,
Southeast Asian economies will experience single-digit inflation,
it said.
</P>
<P>
As Southeast Asian economies have a high level of
non-performing loans, the bank said, restructuring and
recapitalization of banks and firms will be high on the priority
list.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that even though fresh capital from several
donor countries and multilateral institutions will be disbursed in
1999, the sharp reduction in the availability of private capital
will keep the overall supply of foreign exchange to the region
well below pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
Reduced domestic demand will bring continued positive
improvements to trade and current account balance in the region in
1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The (region's economic) outlook for 1999 depends on the fate
of current reform initiatives and the mood of world capital
markets," it said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Sees 2.4 Pct GDP Growth for Philippines in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
sees a recovery of the Philippines' economy for 1999 with its GDP
expanding 2.4 percent led by the growth in agriculture and
services.
</P>
<P>
"The agriculture and service sectors will lead the recovery,
while industry is unlikely to recover before the second half of
1999," the bank said in its Asian Development Outlook 1999
released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, the bank considered continued export growth
and government's fiscal stimulus plan as major contributors to get
the economy moving.
</P>
<P>
"Continued export growth, although at lower rates than in 1998
owing to slower economic growth in Europe and the United States,
is also likely to provide a demand stimulus to the economy," the
bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The government's planned fiscal stimulus through a larger
budget deficit will also help revive aggregate demand," it added.
</P>
<P>
Although the bank expected the Philippines to perform much
better than most other crisis-hit East Asian economies in 1999, it
believed that a general Asian recovery will be a critical factor
in the country's economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
"Persisting recessions in the neighboring economies of
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand in 1999 and the instability of
the Japanese economy could continue to dampen the domestic
investment climate in 1999," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On the economic policy, the bank suggested the country pay
attention to stimulating domestic demand, maintaining stability in
the balance of payments and the exchange rate, and mitigating the
social impact of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Monetary policy should shift to a focus on stimulating
domestic credit for productive investment and reducing inflation,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Philippines shrank by
0.5 percent in 1998, compared with a growth of 5.2 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil continued to take its toll in the
economy last year and the El Nino phenomenon caused a large
contraction of agriculture output.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the bank cited factors favoring the economy.
Those include greater attention on the banking and financial
sector improvement, continued demand stimulus through exports and
private consumption, and adroit handling of the crisis by the
monetary and fiscal authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Export growth of almost 17 percent in 1998 helped prevent a
more severe slowdown," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with its neighbors, the Philippines demonstrated
greater resilience to the economy turmoil," the bank said.

<HEADLINE> ADB: World Economy to Repeat Last Year's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The world economy is expected to
repeat last year's slow growth performance in 1999, with growth in
developing economies slightly accelerating and growth in
industrial nations slowing down, said an Asian Development Bank
economist Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"World output growth fell sharply in 1998 from a strong 4.2
percent in 1997 to 2.2 percent. In 1999, we expect world output
growth to be about the same as last year. While many developing
nations' economies will start to pick up, the North American and
European economies will begin to slow down," ADB Chief Economist
Jungsoo Lee said in a statement issued here together with the
bank's "Asian Development Outlook 1999."
</P>
<P>
Lee said spells of turmoil in Russia, Asia and Latin America
reverberated through world trade and financial networks as
international flows of private capital slowed.
</P>
<P>
But despite the often negative tone of world markets in 1998,
growth in Europe and the United States was generally robust, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in its economic outlook, the Manila-based bank said
that after many years' progress, globalization took a step
backward in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Total world trade measured in value terms, actually contracted
dramatically as investors in the industrial countries shielded
away from the turbulence in developing countries, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the near failure of a sophisticated hedge fund in the
United States raised a warning flag that caused governments and
international investors to re-examine their strategies for
managing risk in a world of fluid, short-term capital flows.
</P>
<P>
International capital flows continued to drop precipitously as
private lenders moved to reduce their exposure to the turbulence
prevailing in many developing economies, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"Net private capital flows to developing countries were about
29 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, down from a peak of 177 billion
dollars in 1996," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said equity markets in Asia, Latin America and most of the
transitional economies also had a poor year, although markets in
South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand rallied strongly from
their losses in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stock market registered double-digit percentage gains
for the eighth straight year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
For nearly all the developing countries, 1998 was a bad year,
it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian developing economies experienced their slowest
growth in a decade, with many economies in East and Southeast Asia
actually shrinking," it said.
</P>
<P>
But in the industrial countries, except Japan, growth was
strong in 1998, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the world economy's slowdown last year, the bank said,
few doubt the inevitability of increasing integration in world
trade and finance.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Shows Robust Growth, ADB Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite Asia's financial turmoil
last year, economic growth continued to be robust in China, with
its economy expanding 7.8 percent in 1998, said an Asian
Development Bank (ADB) report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 1999," an annual publication
of the ADB which forecasts short-term economic trends in the
region, the bank said gross domestic product (GDP) in China will
grow 7 percent in 1999 and 6.5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although the Asian crisis has not had a major impact on China's
economic performance, the bank said, it did adversely affect its
exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Largely because of Asia's recession, (China's) exports grew by
only 0.5 percent, compared to 21 percent in 1997," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that despite a marked slowdown of foreign capital
flows to emerging markets in the aftermath of the Asian crisis,
foreign direct investment of 45 billion U.S. dollars in China was
slightly higher than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank said China's growth prospects for the next two years
depend on a number of factors, including implementation of the
remainder of its public investment stimulus package and the course
of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy remains robust, the excess capacity in
domestic industries will decline, and in addition, the scope for
relying on inventories as substitutes for imports will diminish,
it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the challenge facing China's
macro-economic management is to maintain a robust growth rate
through prudent use of monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
It must also generate job opportunities in order to curtail the
country's unemployment, it added.

<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Asian exports will not recover in
the short-term due to the low growth in intra-regional and world
trade and Japan's economic recession, the Asian Development Bank
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Exports have been one of the main engines of Asian growth and a
number of successful Asian economies have pursued a development
strategy of export-led growth, using policy to shift their
industrial structures toward exports and to exploit economies of
scale, the bank said in an economic outlook released here.
</P>
<P>
"However, starting in 1996, in most of Asia a deceleration in
export growth interrupted some 30 years of export-led growth," it
said.
</P>
<P>
After growing by 20 percent in 1994 and 22 percent in 1995, the
bank said, Asian exports grew by only 4.3 percent in 1996, and
this deceleration in export growth affected economic performance
across the region.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis that erupted in Asia in 1997 provided a
stimulus to exports through depreciating exchange rates, it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, despite large depreciations in Asian currencies (83
percent in Indonesia, 57 percent in South Korea, 55 percent in
Malaysia and 46 percent in the Philippines), Asian export growth
continued to be slow," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said part of the explanation for continued sluggishness in
exports lies in the structure of intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
"As Asian economies compete with and export from one another,
the currency depreciations did not have a strong immediate
impact," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
As more than half of total Asian exports are intra-regional,
the collapse in growth in the region has caused a significant
reduction in volume, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, import demand fell by 25 percent in
affected Asian economies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The credit crunch and loss of trade credits have also adversely
affected the supply response in the crisis countries, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Total export volumes contracted by about 5 percent in the
region in 1998, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Asian exports are unlikely to recover in the
short-term because of the low growth in world trade, the recession
in Japan and the weakening of intra-regional trade.
</P>
<P>
"However, over the medium-term, as the regional economy pulls
out of the crisis and world trade picks up, Asian exports should
start to recover," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said an immediate priority in Asia is the expansion of
trade financing, because it will not only help establish
export-led recovery, but also bolster intra-Asia demand.

<HEADLINE> ADB: Financial Crisis Causes Great Social Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Tuesday that the Asian financial crisis has caused turmoil
throughout the affected economies in such areas as employment,
prices, human development, poverty and social capital.
</P>
<P>
"The social consequences of the crisis vary across countries
according to the extent of the downturn and dislocation," said the
bank in its "Asian Development Outlook 1999" released here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the poor and vulnerable groups, such as women, children,
and migrant workers, are invariably most at risk, the bank said,
the impact of the 22-month-old crisis is pervasive, hurting all
social classes, particularly middle-and-lower-middle-income ones.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the unemployment rate in Indonesia rose to 5.5
percent in 1998 from 4.7 in 1997, and in Thailand the rate reached
5.3 percent, compared with just above 1 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in South Korea more than doubled to 6.8
percent last year, while in the Philippines it climbed to 9.6
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"However, these figures probably underestimated the true extent
of the problem, as underemployment is also likely to have
increased markedly," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the bank said, the crisis has reduced household
expenditure in a number of important social areas, including
health and nutrition, education, and family planning.
</P>
<P>
"With reduced incomes and higher prices for such items as
medicines and school supplies, households tend to cut down far too
much on their consumption of these important items," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the crisis also has had a serious impact
on education in the most affected economies like Indonesia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, 6 million students have dropped out of school
while in Thailand, the number is about 250,000, it said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, The bank said, the crisis is setting back the
spectacular strides made in the fight against poverty during the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
About 6 million Indonesians and 1 million Thais are falling
below official poverty lines, it said.
</P>
<P>
"These are huge numbers that require urgent policy attention,
but are far less than claimed by earlier reports," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said the adverse social consequences of the crisis are
clearly severe and require urgent action on the part of
governments to provide adequate social safety nets.
</P>
<P>
"However," it said, "the only long-term solution is to ensure a
return to broadly based and sustained growth."

<HEADLINE> South Asia to Grow Faster Than Rest of Asia in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Together with China, South Asia's
economic performance could be better than the rest of the region's
this year as it has managed to evade the main impact of the Asian
financial crisis, the Asian Development Bank said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its "Asian Development Outlook 1999" released here Tuesday,
the ADB said India's growth in 1998 was slightly higher than in
1997, while growth picked up in Pakistan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' gross domestic product (GDP) increased 5.8
percent and 5.4 percent respectively last year and are expected to
grow 5.9 percent and 3.4 percent this year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the impact of massive flooding on agricultural
and manufacturing output, Bangladesh's 5.7 percent growth was
slightly lower than expected for the year. Sri Lanka managed a
fairly robust 5.3 percent growth rate, down slightly from the
previous year," it said.
</P>
<P>
For the whole sub-region, GDP increased 5.7 percent in 1998 and
will grow 5.5 percent this year, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"In the short-run, weather fluctuations of the kind that the La
Nina Phenomenon might cause will have a large impact on actual
growth results in South Asia," it said.
</P>
<P>
And over the longer-run, the bank said, growth will depend on
accelerated progress in privatization, deregulation and trade
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Inflation will fall to 7.6 percent, assuming that governments
do not resort to printing money to finance their large budget
deficits, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that with continued slow growth and the reduction
in world capital flows, South Asia's current account deficit will
be fairly low at 3.1 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Rising GDP Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- An analytical report released
today by veteran economists with the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) predicts that the Chinese economy will gain
momentum and generate 7.9 percent growth for the year.
</P>
<P>
The report outlines a solid future for the Chinese economy
under the conditions of "a stable world economic situation and
continuation of the government's current macro-control policy."
</P>
<P>
The value-added for the agriculture sector is projected to grow
by 3.3 percent, with 9.4 percent growth anticipated for the
manufacturing sector and a 7.7 percent rise for the service sector.
</P>
<P>
The country's 1998 GDP growth rate stood at 7.8 percent, with
the government's economic growth rate target for this year set
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
China continues to enjoy one of the world's fastest growing
economies in spite of slight slippage for five years running.
</P>
<P>
The report noted the economy has exhibited signs of a rebound
since the second half of last year, with the trend likely to
continue in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
However the report warned of the simultaneous existence of
signs of weakness, including falling prices, a negative growth of
exports, inactive nongovernment investments and weak expectations
for consumption.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed asset investments are expected to reach 3.19
trillion yuan for the year, up 12.2 percent on the previous year,
with retail sales expected to grow by 8.8 percent to well over 3.
17 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Total export is expected to hit 184 billion U.S. dollars at an
anticipated zero growth rate.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Builds Largest Wind-Driven Energy Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China is building a large wind-power center
with an installed generating capacity of 63,600 kilowatts (kw) in
Dabancheng.
</P>
<P>
The Dabancheng wind zone, 80 kilometers long and 20 kilometers
wide, in the central part of the Tianshan Mountain, is estimated
to have a potential installed generating capacity of 2.5 million
kw.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's first wind-driven generating station was
set up in Dabancheng on a trial basis in 1986, Xinjiang has been a
lead in researching and developing wind energy, with installed
generating capacity amounting to 100,000 kw, making up one-third
of China's total installed wind power capacity.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is rich in wind resource. Statistics from the
autonomous regional meteorological department showed that Xinjiang
has nine wind zones covering a combined area of 150,000 square
kilometers. The total potential generating capacity in the zones
is estimated at 80 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Wind power, also called "green energy," has become an important
part of Xinjiang's power industry and has great potential in
improving the local environment.

<HEADLINE> China Still Has Problems Solving Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China still has some problems in
attempting to solve the Year 2000 computer bug, such as inadequate
experience in risk evaluation, insufficient legal preparation for
possible lawsuits related to the computer millennium bug, also
known as Y2K, and emergency planning, a senior official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, head of the working group of Chinese officials
attempting to solve the problem, said that China has established a
state-level experts group, which is engaged in research and
drafting laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also provided preferential policies
and financial support to help Chinese enterprises solve Y2K. The
People's Bank of China, the central bank, has pledged to provide
loans to Chinese enterprises in this respect.
</P>
<P>
She said that directors of the state administrations of
industries under the State Council have promised that China's
efforts to solve the Y2K problem are fully backed with financial
support, and will never be undermined because of a shortage of
funds.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that insufficient legal preparation for Y2K is a
worldwide problem, and she suggested increasing international
cooperation to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
She said a delegation of computer experts from the Ministry of
Information Industry and six other ministries and departments
under the State Council will visit the United States later this
year, and the Chinese experts will discuss and exchange views with
their American colleagues on how to solve Y2K and what laws may be
needed.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom and the General Administration of Civil Aviation
of China have required their overseas component suppliers to
stipulate in their contracts that they will take legal
responsibilities and to help solve the Y2K problem if difficulties
occur.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Auction Earns Tanzania over $8mln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has auctioned
39,169 tons of clean coffee worth more than 8.09 million U.S.
dollars since last August, according to the state-run Tanzania
Coffee Board (TCB).
</P>
<P>
TCB Managing Director, Leslie Omari, said that Germany remains

coffee, followed by Japan with 18 percent, the Netherlands, 14
percent, Belgium, 10 percent, and Italy, three percent.
</P>
<P>
Other destinations accounted for 11 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper Monday said Tanzania's coffee output
for the 1998/99 crop season, which ends this month, is expected to

the auction market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the target will be reached and even surpassed as

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China Export and Import Bank (
Eximbank) today signed an export seller's credit agreement calling
for loans totaling 800 million yuan to support the container
export operations of the China International Ocean Shipping
Container Company Ltd. (CIOSC).
</P>
<P>
CIOSC, one of the world's largest container manufacturers,

to 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank, one of China's three policy banks, uses policy-
oriented financial tools to support exports of machinery and
electronics products. The bank places priority on exports of high-
tech and high value-added products including ships,
telecommunications products and power station equipment.

<HEADLINE> Nutritionist Suggests Increased Milk Intake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese nutritionist
has suggested the initiation of a nationwide campaign to increase
the milk intake for children who run the risk of diseases related
to insufficient consumption of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jianping, deputy director of the National Food and
Nutrition Council, recently pointed out that many Chinese children
suffer from rickets and osteoporosis due to inadequate milk
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guangming Daily quoted Jiang as saying that a
nationwide campaign should be initiated to improve nutrition by
encouraging the daily consumption of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Inexpensive milk products made with protein-rich soybeans
should be a regular item on the Chinese dinner table, according to
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
A national campaign launched in 1996 to promote the consumption
of soybean milk has proved highly effective. The extensive
programs was launched by the Ministry of Agriculture, the State
Administration of Light Industry and the ministries of Education
and Health.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of anemia for male and female students
attending 22 schools in 10 provinces dropped by 7.9 and 8.5
percentage points respectively following the introduction of
soybean milk as a regular breakfast item, said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Policy to Develop High-Tech Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) - China has announced new
regulations designed to encourage scientists and technicians to
establish high-tech ventures to commercialize scientific
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at news conference this morning, Xu Guanhua, deputy
minister of science and technology, said the regulations stipulate
that research units or scientists will be permitted to contribute
scientific achievements for as much as 35 percent of total shares
in high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and technicians were previously able to contribute
scientific achievements for a 20 percent share in related ventures.
</P>
<P>
Xu added that the percentage could rise even higher for
promising high value-added high technology products.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the new policy is one of 10 polices the
Chinese government plans to adopt to develop the nation's
technology innovation system and accelerate the process for
industrializing related discoveries.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate that over 17,000 research achievements win
state or provincial level science advancement awards each year.
Nonetheless, only a small portion of items formerly emerged as
marketable commodities due to lack of policies for implementation
and the high risks involved in marketing.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations also stipulate that scientists can earn as
much as 20 percent of total sales for scientific achievements, as
well as various other rewards for industrializing discoveries.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are designed to encourage more scientists to
operate high-tech ventures, but at the same time allow them to
return to their original units within a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will be allowed to engage in outside development of
high-tech products after finishing their required duties.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also include preferential tax policies and
measures for building a risk investment system.

<HEADLINE> Pork Price Expected to Rebound in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Pork prices are likely to rebound
in China this autumn due to the shrinking pig population resulting
from the landslide drop in prices, according to the State
Administration of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
The downward spiral in pork prices since the beginning of the
year has caused piggeries to shoulder heavy losses. The March
price for piglets fell by an annual rate of 50 percent, with pork
prices falling 21.8 percent to 6.42 yuan per kilogram. In addition,
the per kilo price for piglets fell to 9.9 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The administration report indicated that China's meat market
will remain oversupplied in the first half of this year. However,
emerging signs suggest a noticeable change in the supply situation.
</P>
<P>
The pig population continues to fall, with the number of
piglets down by 2.5 percent to the current 35.4 million head.
</P>
<P>
"The shrinking pig population is most obvious in flood-stricken
areas mainly in south China," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Rising grain prices have also increased costs for pig
production and have prompted many farmers to raise other animals.
</P>
<P>
The report projected that pork prices will rise in the second
half of the year.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will take measures to
encourage well-performed companies to initiate new overseas
businesses in a bid to enhance exports, according to the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission was quoted by the Economic Daily
as saying that new businesses, wherein companies use their own
equipment and technologies for assembling and processing overseas,
will fuel the country's exports amidst a weak market brought on by
the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
These new operations could include light industry, particularly
more competitive sectors such as textiles and household electrical
appliances, he said.
</P>
<P>
A package of favorable credit, tax, and insurance policies have
already been worked out by the government to assist new businesses,
the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's New Governor Told to Mind His Own Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's only English-language
daily newspaper Monday carried a signed article criticizing Tokyo
Governor-elect Shintaro Ishihara for his recent anti-China remarks
and telling him to mind his own business.
</P>
<P>
The article in China Daily quoted Ishihara as telling a
Japanese television on April 12 that Tokyo's association with
Beijing as sister cities was something left over by his
predecessor and against his will.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara also said he is "resolutely against" the "dictatorial
rule" of the Communist Party of China and "cannot tolerate"
China's "annexation of Tibet."
</P>
<P>
By issuing such remarks, the article said, Ishihara "abused our
dignity as a nation and sovereignty as a country."
</P>
<P>
The article said that apparently Shintaro Ishihara has a "
strong desire to expand the jurisdiction of his governorship to
include things intrinsically Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Such a desire is "absolutely not out of friendship or
hospitality," the article said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the article said, it was not surprising for
Ishihara, a China-basher and an ultra-nationalist, to utter such
remarks.
</P>
<P>
the article recalled that Ishihara proposed in 1967 to amend
Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution and to develop nuclear
weapons; he co-authored in 1989 the book "The Japan That Can Say
No;" he denied in 1990 the occurrence of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre
committed by Japanese aggressor troops and called it a Chinese lie;
he still refers to China by a derogatory term.
</P>
<P>
"So, even if some of the repeated occurrences of China-bashing
by a handful of prominent Japanese officials can be explained away
with lame apologies, Ishihara's remarks are by no means a slip of
the tongue," said the article.
</P>
<P>
"It would be hard to reason such a veteran China-hater into
recognizing the ever-increasing freedom and prosperity in China
and the historical facts that both Tibet and Taiwan are
inalienable parts of China," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Ishihara should have the common sense that those are domestic
affairs of another country, things far beyond the jurisdiction of
a Tokyo governor," the article added.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state
visit to Japan late last year and a consequent communique signed
by leaders of the two countries were "a testament that both
governments and peoples of China and Japan want friendly ties."But
Ishihara's current political stature won't allow him to change
national strategy, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The article said "a true statesman knows what his business is
and where his authority ends" and advised Ishihara "to mind his
own business:" tackling the 1.7 billion U.S. dollar budget deficit
and a record high unemployment in his prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavians in Zambia Condemn NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav community in Zambia
held a memorial service Sunday in honor of the people who died in
the bombings by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the service held at the Greek Orthodox Church
in Lusaka, Charge d'Affaires of Yugoslavia Dusan Zupan condemned
the NATO for perpetrating the aggression.
</P>
<P>
Zupan noted that a number of schools, hospitals and other vital
institutions have been destroyed in the air raids.
</P>
<P>
Many people have lost their lives while the United Nations has
remained silent on the aggression, he said.
</P>
<P>
The aggression has brought nothing but misery and mass
destructions of property in Yugoslavia, Zupan noted.
</P>
<P>
He further maintained that his government will not give up any
part of the country but will fight for their land.
</P>
<P>
Zupan condemned the western media for portraying a negative
image of Yugoslavia in relation to the attack.
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to the Zambian people for their
understanding and support.
</P>
<P>
The memorial service was attended by a number of diplomats and
ambassadors accredited to Zambia as well as some government
officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Observe Independence Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Zimbabweans Sunday
thronged the National Sports Stadium in the capital Harare to
celebrate the country' s 19th independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, President Robert Mugabe said his
government recognized the need to review the current constitution
which was a Lancaster compromise to end the liberation war.
</P>
<P>
He said such views on the constitution from both within the
government and outside had compelled the government to hold "wide
consultations" with various groups, a process which led to the
establishment of the constitutional commission which is expected
to begin work soon.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also appealed to all Zimbabweans "to renew your
commitment of loyalty and service to your country and guard
jealously Zimbabwe's sovereign independence."
</P>
<P>
"There are, among us those, but very few, who readily subject
themselves to the will of our external and internal hostile and
inimical forces seeking to undermine our national unity and
sovereign independence through division, disunity and subversion,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's economic situation, Mugabe said a generally
unstable macro-economic environment has marred the overall
performance of the economy in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar had created
strong cost- push inflationary pressures in the economy causing
inflation to rise from 24 percent in January to 46.6 percent by
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, interest rates had also gone up to over
45 percent, making it difficult for business enterprises to
finance their operations.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Y2K Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China started the "Y2K Week"
today to further boost the nationwide effort to tackle the
millennium bug that the world faces at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day-long event is organized by the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII), the Information Office of China's
State Council announced at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
MII spokeswoman Zhang Qi said that during the event, the
ministry will join hands with government at various levels to
introduce on news media and the Internet the progress China has
made in regard to the Year 2000 Problem. Exchange activities will
be included in the program as well.
</P>
<P>
By conducting the activities, China is following the call of
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation last November on its members
to organize a Y2K week between April 19 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The MII will also hold international seminars on the question
on April 22 in Shenzhen, a special economic zone where the
information industry has developed rapidly, and on May 6 in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen major State Council organs and key sectors including
banking, civil aviation and telecommunications services seen by
the central government as the most concerned will examine each
other's development in the dealing with the Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"The Year 2000 Problem is a global issue, and to fix it needs
international cooperation," said Zhang Qi. Therefore, the MII has
been working closely with other countries such as the United
States, Britain, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
It held a China-U.S. Y2K seminar with the U.S. Department of
Commerce on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the MII has had two national tele-
conferences to deploy the measures to tackle the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The major 18 government organs and sectors have made big
progress in treating the problem. The banking, securities,
telecommunications, civil aviation and petrochemical industries
have basically completed the revision of their computer systems,
and have started testing, risk evaluating and working on an
emergency plan.
</P>
<P>
Problems remain, she said, including insufficient funds,
inadequate awareness of possible bug with embedded devices, and
inadequate preparation on legal conflicts concerning the Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (40) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 40 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can non-permanent residents become public servants of the Macao
Special Administrative Region?
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Article 97 of the Basic Law, public servants
of the Macao Special Administrative Region must be permanent
residents of the MSAR. This is in keeping with the principle of
Macao people administering Macao. However, taking into
consideration the history and the present status of Macao, the
Basic Law has made exceptions for this provision under the
following circumstances:
</P>
<P>
1. Public servants who previously served in Macao. In
accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law,
upon the establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region,
public servants including the police and supporting members of the
judiciary previously serving in Macao may all remain in employment
and continue service, regardless of their nationality and no
matter whether they are permanent residents or not. Of course,
they shall not fill posts which are open only to Chinese citizens
who are permanent residents according to the provisions of the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
2. Advisors, professionals and technical personnel. In
accordance with the provisions of Article 99 of the Basic Law, the
Macao Special Administrative Region may also employ Portuguese and
other nationals as advisors or to fill professional and technical
posts. The Portuguese and other nationals employed in such a
manner do not have to be permanent residents of Macao. They do not
have to be Macao residents either. But they can only be employed
in their individual capacities and shall be responsible to the
Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
3. Professionals and technical personnel of certain categories
and junior public servants. These people may not necessarily be
permanent residents. But the Macao Special Administrative Region
will have to decide on the kind of professions it needs to employ
people for, the necessity and the number of junior public servants
it needs to employ in the light of its own conditions.

<P>
Spokeswoman for the Ministry of Information Industry (MII)

<P>
Director of the technology department of the People's Bank of
China Chen Jing said the banking sector has already finished an
emergency plan for the Y2K.
</P>

He said that since 1996, a total of five billion yuan has been
invested by banks to fight the millennium bug, and the battle has
been very successful so far.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zongping of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of
China said the administration has also drafted an emergency plan,

<HEADLINE> Italy's Referendum Announced Failed for Lack of Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the final results released by the Italian news
agency ANSA, the turnout of the referendum which reached 49.6
percent of electorate has not achieved the 50 percent of quorum,
so the result of the vote will not be valid.
</P>
<P>
ANSA said that 91.5 percent of voters in the referendum, which
started at local time 7:00 and ended at 22:00 on Sunday, had
backed abolition of proportional representation while 8.4 percent
had opposed it.
</P>
<P>
Only 49.6 percent of the 49 million Italians eligible were
reported to have turned out to vote, and almost all the voters
favored curtailing the use of proportional representation to
allocate 25 percent of the 630 seats in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, 155 seats of the Lower House were
allocated to political parties according to the parties'
percentage of the overall national vote, the other 475 seats are
decided by a first-past-the-post system which means the candidates
who gain the most votes in constituency will gain a seat.
</P>
<P>
The promoters of referendum are struggling to change this
system which is seen as one of the major reasons for Italy's
unstable political situation.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of the referendum is to grant 155 seats of the
Lower House to the "best-voted losers" in the constituency first-
past-the-post voting.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the final result, it's clear that the country
remains firm in its desire for a modern, governable, two-bloc
system," said Luigi Abete, one of the chief promoters of the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The referendum promoters believe that the new electoral system
will quicken the move towards a two-party system, make less
important the small parties in the political scene and hold the
government a long life.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Announces New Action Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The opposition alliance in
Bangladesh has announced an eight-day action program to protest
"deteriorating law and order situation, price hike of essentials
and water and power crisis," following a one-day countrywide
shutdown on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The program includes sit-in demonstrations at electricity
offices across the country, public rallies and mass contact
through processions from April 23 to 27, and a mass procession in
all cities, districts and thana (sub-district) headquarters on
April 29.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the agenda on Sunday, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan,
secretary general of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), said the programs were also aimed at protesting
"rising terrorism, frequent murder, hijacking, snatching and toll
extortion," press reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the opposition alliance would go for tougher
programs if the government failed to resolve the crises
immediately, demanding that the government step down immediately
and announce mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
But the government would not back down. "We are not only
elected, we are also a strong government. It cannot be toppled by
the opposition's threat," Home, Post and Telecommunications
Minister Mohammad Nasim said.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 people, including five policemen, were injured in
Dhaka, Chittagong and other parts of the country on Sunday during
the dawn-to-dusk strike, enforced by the BNP-led opposition
alliance including the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami and the
Islami Oikya Jote.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 71 people in the capital for possessing or
throwing bombs, obstructing movement of vehicles and setting them
on fire and sporadic clashes between police and pickets were

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up 20 Polytechnic Institutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
undertaken a plan to set up 20 polytechnic institutes including
five for women to introduce need-based technology and train
skilled manpower in the country, a senior technical education
official said.
</P>
<P>
The new initiatives also include modernization of the existing
20 polytechnic institutes to cope with the challenges of the new
century, The Financial Express daily newspaper Monday quoted
Professor Ziaur Rahman, director-general of the Directorate of
Technical Education, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide 3.04 billion taka (62.7 million
U.S. dollars) for constructing 15 polytechnic institutes and
Islamic Development Bank (IDB) will offer 513.8 million taka (10.6
million dollars) for three women polytechnic institutes, Rahman
said, adding that the government has also requested the IDB to
finance the construction of the rest two women institutes.
</P>
<P>
The construction work of the 18 institutes, which just began
this month, is expected to be completed in the year 2002, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government is implementing a plan to introduce a
vocational course in 500 private secondary schools and a business
management course in 200 non-government colleges for developing
technically-sound human resources, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to increase trained technical manpower
from the existing 3.3 percent to 10 percent by the year 2000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The manpower export sector is a major foreign exchange earner
in this South Asian country.

Bangladesh earned 1.599 billion dollars in remittances from an
exported labor force of 267,667 in 1998 and 260.24 million dollars

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Host Global Migration Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will host an
international symposium on migration this week which is expected
to provide much-needed direction for governments in the region to
deal with the pressing issue, organizers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, beginning on Wednesday, aims to create a
political will so that governments can begin to seriously tackle
the problem, said Regina Boucault, an official of the
International Organization for Migration.
</P>
<P>
"It is a growing issue and a very sensitive one for the
countries in the region. We hope the governments will start
addressing the issue, not forgetting that in the end we are
talking about human beings and human rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of its kind in the region, will bring
together foreign ministers, deputy ministers and high-ranking
officials from 18 countries, along with experts from Africa, North
America, Central and South America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"In every region the issue is sensitive and by showing how
other regions have solved this problem, it can help the region
here," Boucault said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a learning process, how other regions have overcome
the sensitivities in order to address the issue that is a concern
to all," she said.
</P>
<P>
Surapong Posayanond, director-general for the Department of
International Organization at Thailand's Foreign Ministry, said
the economic crisis has aggravated the migration problem but
because the flow is not documented, it is difficult to quantify
it.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will call for the cooperation of
neighboring countries, particularly Myanmar, to "document workers"
so that authorities can regulate the flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, which sends workers abroad and receives foreign
workers from neighboring countries, is facing an uphill task in
trying to register foreign workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 1 million Myanmar workers are
currently working in Thailand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Surapong said the problem of illegal migration has proven
increasingly complex to deal with, given the fact that it is deep
rooted in politics. It also has a negative impact on international
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
A Bangkok Declaration will be issued at the end of the meeting
to show that the symposium is serious about addressing the issue,
he said.

BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Companies in 11 sectors listed on

recovery last year, according to a recent survey.
</P>

Corporate performance for companies outside the financial

the 306.99 billion baht (8.3 billion dollars) in losses in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the gains were attributed to the stronger
baht. The appreciation of the baht from 47.55 to the U.S. dollar
at the end of 1997 to 36.89 baht at the end of 1998 allowed
companies to book a total of 135.12 billion baht (3.6 billion
dollars) in foreign exchange gains.
</P>
<P>
But operating losses increased for the 11 sectors, from 6.5
billion baht (175 million dollars) at the end of 1997 to 45.7
billion (1.2 billion dollars) at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the 11 sectors surveyed by Capital Nomura showed net
profits of 88.59 billion baht (2.4 billion dollars) for the whole
of 1998, including foreign exchange gains of 135.12 billion baht.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parties Divided Over NATO Air Corridor Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's major political forces
are divided over a NATO request for unlimited access to the
Bulgarian airspace for military operations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF)
and the Popular Union reiterated its stand in the two National
Assembly declarations, of October 23 last year and March 25 this
year, that Bulgaria would not join any military actions in
Yugoslavia, but was ready to grant NATO access to its airspace.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that granting access to our airspace
constitutes direct or indirect involvement in military operations
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," said UDF chief Ekaterina
Mihailova, alluding to the top item of March 25 declaration saying
that "the Republic of Bulgaria will not join, whether directly or
indirectly, any military operations" in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that additional information was needed to react to
the request, which was received on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that a positive reaction to the NATO note would
precisely contravene this clause of the declaration, the Euro-Left
is opposed to granting unlimited access to its airspace.
</P>
<P>
"A positive answer to this NATO request would be tantamount to
Bulgaria's embroilment in the military conflict," said Euro-Left
leader Alexander Tomov. The party has so far concurred with the
ruling coalition when casting votes in parliament over the Kosovo
issue.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) again
opposed any involvement in any form by Bulgaria in the Kosovo
conflict. "I do not see a reason why the party should change
anything in its position," said its Deputy Chairman Roumen
Ovcharov.
</P>
<P>
The Open Forum Initiative within the BSP urged that the
parliament rejects the NATO request for using Bulgarian territory
and called for a referendum on Bulgaria's membership of the
Alliance. The extra-parliamentary Social Democracy Union also
wants a referendum on NATO's airspace access request.
</P>
<P>
The largely ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (
MRF) "will back NATO's request for an air corridor," MRF leader
Ahmed Dogan said. "Bulgaria has no other  alternative in these
hard times; and our stand is clear and categorical. Fence-sitting
does not meet with understanding from the U.S. and the North
Atlantic Alliance. We can't want to be both good neighbors and
NATO members."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, who earlier in the day briefed
representatives of the principal political forces on the
development of the Kosovo crisis, has not made a statement so far.
He had requested an urgent meeting with the NATO ambassadors in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Because of the NATO request, President Peter Stoyanov returned
halfway from a trip to the United States, where he was to attend
the alliance's summit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"If Bulgaria has to provide logistical support or a passage
through its airspace, I call on the Council of Ministers and the
National Assembly to respond positively, as Slovenia, Croatia and
Slovakia did," Stoyanov said in a national broadcast address
before he left on his trip.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks More Overseas Funds to Boost Building Materials Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has so far introduced over
five billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds into its building
materials industry and is trying to attract even more to increase
the scale.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds will be mainly used to produce new building
materials, inorganic non-metallic materials, and equipment to
manufacture building materials, according to Liu Jingzhou, deputy
head of the Building Materials Branch of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the State Administration of Building
Materials Industry is asking overseas enterprises involved to
strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and take account of
the needs of and advice offered by the administration.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the use of overseas funds should take the
industry's product-mix readjustment and environmental protection
into consideration. All overseas-funded projects must meet
international environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that funds will be introduced mainly for production of
cement, glass, and ceramics. The country is encouraging
construction of large cement projects and technology upgrading in
small cement plants. In sanitary ceramics production, the focus
will be on improving product quality.
</P>
<P>
Co-funded technological transformation or share-holding by
overseas investors in key state-owned building materials
enterprises, whose products are listed in the country's production
plans, will be allowed only with the approval of government
departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, overseas-funded projects should pay attention to
technical upgrading. China particularly encourages the
establishment of research and development centers for glass fiber
reinforced plastic and other new building materials for sustained
development of related technology.
</P>
<P>
The administration has required that production equipment in
overseas-funded cement, glass, and ceramics enterprises should be
purchased through domestic and international bidding, and at least
50 percent of the equipment should be domestic.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of the Macao SAR Basic Law (39) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 39 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Is the Procuratorate of the MSAR a judicial organ?
</P>
<P>
Before Macao is returned to China, the Procuratorate of Macao
is a judicial organ according to the statutes in Macao.
</P>
<P>
It mainly has the following functions and responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
-- Participate in the judicial proceedings on behalf of the
region, the Public Monetary Bureau and other institutions;
</P>
<P>
-- Assist workers and their families in protecting their lawful
rights and interests; Exercise legal supervision over case
adjudication by the courts to ensure their independence;
</P>
<P>
-- File criminal lawsuits and guide the criminal investigation;
Perform the consultation functions according to law or at the
request of the Governor of Macao; and
</P>
<P>
-- Participate in the legal proceedings involving bankruptcy
and other public interests. There is only one procuratorate in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
As such, there is no hierarchical classification of it.
However, there is a chain of command between procuratorial
officers with different ranks, in which subordinates must obey the
instructions of their superiors.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the operational procedures, all the judicial
officers of the Macao Procuratorate are dispatched to work at
various courts according to the provisions of law.
</P>
<P>
The Procuratorate follows its own code of conduct. It is not
affiliated to any other government organs and performs its duties
and functions free from any interference.
</P>
<P>
However, the Governor of Macao has the power to give
instructions to the Procuratorate within the scope as provided for
by law when the latter is participating in civil proceedings on
behalf of the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisions of the Basic Law, the Procuratorate
of the MSAR shall remain a judicial organ after Macao is returned
to China and shall exercise procuratorial functions as vested by
law, independently and free from any interference.
</P>
<P>
The Procurator-General of the MSAR shall be a Chinese citizen
who is a permanent resident of the Region, shall be nominated by
the Chief Executive to be reported to the Central People's
Government for appointment.
</P>
<P>
The candidates for other procurators shall be nominated by the
Procurator-General and appointed by the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Detailed provisions in separate laws will be enacted on the
organizational composition, powers and functions as well as
operation of the Procuratorate.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Looks Forward to New Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his historic
visit to Russia, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
expressed the hope that the trip will lay the foundation for a new
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries "are entering a new phase in our
relationship. It is our endeavor to break the inertia and build a
relationship in conformity with today's changed world," Sharif
said in an interview with the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS.
</P>
<P>
Sharif left here for Moscow on Monday for a four-day official
visit which will be the first by a Pakistani prime minister after
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's tour of the former Soviet Union in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Islamabad's ties with Moscow have
always been far from perfect. They have been characterized by
bitter animosity caused and accentuated by Pakistan's friendship
with Washington, Moscow's number-one enemy during the cold war and
the Indo-Soviet alliance, perceived by Islamabad as the reason for
New Delhi's domineering regional attitude and its military
build-up.
</P>
<P>
The lingering legacy of the Afghan war, where Moscow suffered
their most humbling military experiences, and the differences
between Islamabad and Moscow over the long-running civil war in
Afghanistan have kept the two at arm's length even after the end
of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is also worried about the Moscow's continued military
supplies and assistance to New Delhi, which in Islamabad's view is
further tipping the conventional weapons balance in favor of
India.
</P>
<P>
What's more, there is a yawning gap between the positions of
the two countries on the current Kosovo crisis. Russia strongly
opposes the NATO military strikes on Yugoslavia while Pakistan
supports the NATO action.
</P>
<P>
Against the background, Sharif, however, hopes to seek common
ground and establish certain "closer and sustainable" links with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believes that there is an opportunity to build a new
Pakistan-Russia relationship on a more positive basis in the new
global situation.
</P>
<P>
"The cold war and the Afghan war are both behind us," said
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz. "I feel today the points
of convergence of our common interest with Russia are stronger and
larger than any points of divergence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's relations with the Russian Federation should develop
irrespective of their ties with other countries, the foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The defining theme of relationships between states and regions
today is economic interaction," Aziz said, adding that the
"immense" potential for Pakistan-Russia economic cooperation "must
be fully exploited."
</P>
<P>
To begin the process, two agreements are expected to be signed
during Sharif's visit, one on economic and trade cooperation, and
the other on cooperation between the national chambers of commerce
and industry of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also focus on ways to develop mutually
beneficial interaction in the fields of science and technology and
defense-related areas.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here maintain that Pakistan, though unhappy
over Russia's close military links with India, is also willing to
purchase cheaper high-performance arms from Moscow to diversify
its supply sources.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here suggested that Sharif is likely to formally
ask the Russian leadership to sell Pakistan its advanced SU-27
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Sharif is expected to reiterate Pakistan's
known position for peaceful settlement of the long-running crisis.
However, it is believed that Pakistan will still be under pressure
to halt providing military support to the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Russia is reported to have built a military base recently on
the Afghan-Tajik border, indicating Moscow's increased interest in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is also expected to seek Russia's understanding and
support of Pakistan's position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
However, it is yet to be seen whether Sharif will be successful in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad knows this very clearly. "Nobody should expect that
everything will be resolved and the relationship will take off due
to one visit," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"The visit will provide us something to build on," he said,
adding that "after all, it is taking place after a gap of 25
years. It is a significant start."

TIANJIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The elderly have become the
reason for concern about medical services in the northern Chinese
city of Tianjin, according to a recent survey by the Municipal
Statistics Bureau and the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences.

With Philadelphia fighting for playoff position, Iverson hit
just 2-of-17 shots from the field in his personal battle against
Stephon Marbury and the 76ers fell to the New Jersey Nets 86-79.
</P>
<P>
The 76ers (21-19) dropped into a tie with Cleveland for seventh

The top eight teams make the playoffs, where the sixers have not

</P>
<P>
Iverson finished with just six points, barely surpassing his
season-low of five in an 85-80 loss to Cleveland. In the game,
Iverson was benched for the final three quarters by coach Larry
Brown following a sideline disagreement.
</P>
<P>
"Today, it was a case of me missing shots I normally make,"
Iverson said. "I just couldn't get it going. I couldn't get into
any type of flow. I just had a bad game."

Tyrone Hill led Philadelphia with a season-high 23 points and

<HEADLINE> China Sees Promising Chain Store Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's chain store industry is
expected to prosper this year, thanks to the country's continued
efforts to expand domestic demand and increase infrastructure
investment.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Asian economic turmoil and the natural disasters
last year, the chain store industry distinguished itself by
maintaining the highest growth rate in the country's retail sales
sector," Guo Geping, head of the China Chain Store and Franchise
Association, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Commercial Information Center
indicate that sales volume of chain stores last year exceeded 100
billion yuan (12 billion U.S. dollars), soaring 70 percent on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total retail sales of consumer goods stood at 2,900
billion yuan (349 billion U.S. dollars), up 6.8 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of cities and the improving living standard
of the people, the market potential for the chain store industry
this year is growing tremendously, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In order to tap the market potential, chain store corporations
have adopted measures including merger, restructuring, acquisition
and partnership with an aim to sharpen their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
They have also turned to exploiting the huge rural market while
keeping tapping potentials of urban markets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts held that strengthening of management in the trade and
wholesale markets will help fuel growth of the chain store
industry.

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Tolerance by Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Medical and hospital patients are
not likely to stage protests against infringement on their rights
and are willing to tolerate poor services, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 respondents in a recent survey said they did not
feel like consumers when receiving medical or hospital care.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by the Economic News Department of the
China Central Television Station (CCTV) and the Beijing-based
Horizon Survey Company.
</P>
<P>
About 1,300 urban residents in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Wuhan as well as 1,042 rural residents in Shandong, Jiangsu and
Sichuan provinces took part in the survey.
</P>
<P>
More than 55 percent of the respondents replied they always
feel humbled in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The survey cited consumer tolerance and biased opinion towards
patients among some medical workers as major causes of poor
medical services.
</P>
<P>
When asked to explain the reason, they said they dare not
disobey orders from doctors and nurses, for fear that they may be
refused the medical advice and other services.
</P>
<P>
They would rather choose to endure infringements on their
rights in hospitals rather than file complaints to consumer
associations or relevant administrations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the survey found some 80 percent of the polled
medical workers also believed patients are nothing like ordinary
consumers in stores or hotels.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses from more than 100 hospitals in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan provided their answers in the survey.
</P>
<P>
They insist that, as they form their own opinions and judgment
based on diagnosis and experiences, they should not be required to
do as they are told by patients who have no specific knowledge nor
training.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of medical services, they say
consumers can choose to buy or not to buy a certain commodity or
service, but patients have to go to hospital if they are sick.
</P>
<P>
Dai Wei, an official with the complaint handling department of
the China Consumers Association (CCA), agrees that medical
services are one of the focal points of consumer dissatisfaction,
says the paper.

YANGON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
destroyed eight narcotic drug refineries since the beginning of

</P>
<P>
The refinery camps included the latest two uncovered in Muse

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Guangdong Prefers Quality to Quantity in Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- After sustaining
double-digit economic growth for nearly two decades, Guangdong
Province, south China's major economic powerhouse, has adjusted
this year's growth rate to 8.5 percent in pursuit of high-quality
performance rather than just speed.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a rather conservative goal for economic growth,
" said Ceng Muye, a noted Chinese economist. "But it is also a
down-to-earth and rational growth target, which leaves room for
identifying problems and solving them."
</P>
<P>
Ceng, head of the provincial economic association, points out
that Guangdong's free-wheeling economy has been boosted by mammoth
cash in-flow and exports, which is quantified growth and lacks
parallel technological development and renovations to back it up.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of economic growth is hard to carry on for a longer
period, and has already caused such 'bubbles' as duplicated
construction, irrational industrial structure, and inferior profit
returns," he said.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic product has maintained an annual
growth rate of 14.2 percent on average over the past two decades.
It soared to 793 billion yuan last year from 18 billion yuan in
1978, the year China's economic reform took off.
</P>
<P>
However, it is both necessary and inevitable that the economy
should slow its pace now, which will be good for a sustained
economic development, said Ceng.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong can place itself in an opportune position in a new
round of economic takeoff by making a strategic adjustment in tune
with the law of economic development and in focus with the overall
background of a weak domestic market and an uncertain
international economy," Ceng noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest provincial statistics, Guangdong
realized 173 billion yuan in GDP growth in the first quarter of
this year, up 8.9 percent on year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that this figure is close to the yearly forecast,
which means "things are going just as expected".
</P>
<P>
"What we want is honest and non-inflated economic growth based
on an optimized structure and increased profitability," said Li
Changchun, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Guangdong has given this year's priorities to
agricultural development and non-staple agricultural products,
telecommunications, information services, high-tech materials
industry, and medical and health sector.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has developed an export-oriented economy taking
advantage of its proximity to Hong Kong, and it still leads the
country in most major economic indexes including GDP, fixed asset
investment, retail sales, local fiscal revenues, foreign trade and
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it did 75 billion U.S. dollars of export business,
accounting for one tenth of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The province's projected GDP growth remains higher than the
seven percent national economic growth forecast for this year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Daily Lashes Out at New Tokyo Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing newspaper Sunday
criticized new Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara for his recent
anti-China remarks, saying they were rude, irresponsible and
ignorant.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Japanese television on April 12, the day
he was elected Tokyo governor, Ishihara attacked China's Tibet
policies and uttered provocative words on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He also flagrantly declared, "It was my predecessors who
decided to make Tokyo and Beijing sister cities. It has got
nothing to do with me."
</P>
<P>
A signed article entitled "Governor Ishihara Lacks Common Sense
" carried on the Beijing Daily said Ishihara's irresponsible
remarks showed that he treated international relations by personal
preferences, ignoring Tokyo people's good wishes and his
predecessors' work.
</P>
<P>
History has proved the correctness of the decision by the then
leaderships of Beijing and Tokyo for the two cities to enter into
a sisterly relationship on March 14, 1979, the article said.
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, exchanges and cooperation between the
two cities have developed steadily and produced fruitful results
in many fields.
</P>
<P>
People of both sides cherish the friendship and are pleased
with the development of the friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring these facts indicates that Ishihara does not respect
history, nor the wishes of the people and his predecessors, it
added.
</P>
<P>
His remarks also show that he lacks the vision and wisdom
required of governors of big cities, as well as manners of an
ordinary person, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
History has proved and will prove in the future that the
decision made 20 years ago was in line with world's main theme of
peace and development and with the wishes of the peoples of the
two countries to carry on this friendship from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
The article urged the new Tokyo governor to realize the
significance of the decision and learn from his predecessors to
make due contribution to the friendly exchanges and cooperation
between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The article also asked him to be clear that the traditional
friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two sides are
irreversible and nobody can ruin them.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Marion Jones,
who plans to win four gold medlas in this summer's World Athletics
Championships, cruised to an easy 400-meter victory Sunday in the
M. SAC Relays in California.
</P>
<P>
Jone's husband, C.J. Hunter, upset world champion and world No.
1 John Godina in the shot put.
</P>
<P>
Jones clocked 50.79 seconds. She ranked in the world first in
the 100, 200 and long jump.
</P>
<P>
"This is my last open 400-meter race of the year, but I hope to
be selected for the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team for the World
Championships in Spain this August," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't run a personal best today, but I'm still happy with
my time. I was hoping to run below 50 seconds because this is a
homecoming meet for me. It's my only race in Southern California
this year."
</P>
<P>
Jones slowed clearly in the final strides, still winning easily.
LaDonna Antoine of Canada finished a distant second in 52.94.
</P>
<P>
Jones lost just once in 35 finals last year, her only defeat
coming in the World Cup long jump won by Germany's Heike Drechsler.
</P>
<P>
Jones hopes to compete in both sprints, the long jump and a
relay in Spain, and hopes to add another relay for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Ato Boldon, whose 9.86 last year at the Relays turned out to be
the year's fastest time, came back to win the 200 meters in 20.19.
</P>
<P>
Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 400
hurdles, won the men's 400 meters in 48.71.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
projecting a growth of 0.8 percent in the country's GNP for the
first quarter of 1999, a turnaround from the 1.2-percent
contraction for the same period last year, The Philippine Star
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth is below the government's target of 1 to
1.8 percent for the first quarter this year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) was
quoted as saying leading the first-quarter recovery was the
agricultural sector which is projected to have grown 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NEDA projections showed that the service sector posted a
growth of 3 percent in the period, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output, on the other hand, remained low, sliding
back 2.3 percent, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the country's economists warned that due to the
continued weak demand for credit, growth would continue to remain
low, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to stimulate economic activity
by bringing down interest rates which would finally prod
businesses and individuals to start borrowing for production.

<HEADLINE> Senior Police Officer Calls for Better Service to People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The case of a couple in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who spent 22 years
waiting to get a residence permit for their adopted daughter has
triggered a nationwide campaign among the police to improve
services.
</P>
<P>
This anti-corruption campaign and drive launched by the
Ministry of Public Security last June to provide better service to
the people has accelerated solutions in 500,000 similar cases
since then.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is committed to greatly improving the work of the
residence-registration police, the patrolling police, and police
stations this year," said a senior police officer from the
ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that various problems such as arbitrary
overcharging and abusing power for personal gains do exist in the
national police force because of imperfect working mechanisms and
incomplete managerial regulations.
</P>
<P>
Two police station officers in south China's Guangdong Province
were recently punished for their incompetence in dealing with "
prostitution, gambling and narcotics" within their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the ministry is establishing a
responsibility system aimed at improving professional skills of
those officers who misjudge cases, and punish those who repeatedly
make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ministry is closely watching trial
administrative operations at residence-registration centers in
east China provinces which are dealing with residence identity
cards, temporary residence permits, and border permits, rather
than relying on police stations to tackle these tasks. A computer
system has been set up for this purpose.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- If the Seattle SuperSonics
fail to make the playoffs for the first time in nine years, they
can blame the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
Clifford Robinson scored nine of his 23 points in the fourth
quarter to help the Suns solidify their hold on seventh place in
the Western Conference with a 99-93 victory over Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix beat Seattle for the second time in five days and swept
a season series from its Pacific Division rival for the first time
in franchise history, although the teams met just three times in
this shortened season.
</P>
<P>
"It's not about season sweeps or anything, but how you finish
the year and do in the playoffs," Suns coach Danny Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
The Suns (21-20) won their third straight and moved over .500
for the first time since March 17. They trail sixth-place
Minnesota by one game.
</P>
<P>
Seattle (19-21) is sputtering down the stretch with eight
losses in its last 12 games. The Sonics are clinging to eighth
place in the West, one game ahead of Sacramento and Golden State.
</P>
<P>
In a stretch of three games in three days, the Sonics lost to
Phoenix on Wednesday, won an ovetime thriller at Sacramento on
Thursday and were embarrassed at home by the lowly New Jersey Nets
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In today's game, Gary Payton had 21 points and 11 assists and
Detlef Schrempf added 20 points and 10 rebounds for Seattle. Tom
Gugliotta led Phoenix with 27 points and 12 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Official Stresses Development of Organic Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will improve its
agricultural production by promoting traditional organic
agriculture, according to an international symposium held here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the volume of fertilizer used in China
had shot up 90 percent. However, the growth rate of its grain
output was less than 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"China should maintain and enhance the tradition of developing
organic agriculture," Vice-Minister of Agriculture Lu Ming was
quoted by China Daily as saying at the symposium.
</P>
<P>
Lu also said that China had come to realize the side-effects of
overuse and inefficient application of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
On average, China applies 261 kg of fertilizers to one hectare
of farm land a year, compared to 29 kg in Russia and 60 kg in
Canada, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China's fertilizer utilization rate stands at 30-40 percent, or
some 20 percentage points below the average level in developed
countries, resulting in a deplorable waste of resources and
serious pollution of environment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture is launching a new land
fertilization project, which is designed to improve soil fertility
by balancing the proportion of soil, water and fertilizers in
every hectare of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Some agronomists at the symposium suggested that China develop
Integrated Pests Management, a strategy that will help curb
disasters with crops and contribute to the sustainable growth of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They also urged more to be done to explore the advantages of
bio-pesticides instead of chemical pesticides.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan Looks Forward to New Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of his historic
visit to Russia, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
expressed the hope that the trip will lay the foundation for a new
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries "are entering a new phase in our
relationship. It is our endeavor to break the inertia and build a
relationship in conformity with today's changed world," Sharif
said in an interview with the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS.
</P>
<P>
Sharif left here for Moscow on Monday for a four-day official
visit which will be the first by a Pakistani prime minister after
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's tour of the former Soviet Union in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Islamabad's ties with Moscow have
always been far from perfect. They have been characterized by
bitter animosity caused and accentuated by Pakistan's friendship
with Washington, Moscow's number-one enemy during the cold war and
the Indo-Soviet alliance, perceived by Islamabad as the reason for
New Delhi's domineering regional attitude and its military
build-up.
</P>
<P>
The lingering legacy of the Afghan war, where Moscow suffered
their most humbling military experiences, and the differences
between Islamabad and Moscow over the long-running civil war in
Afghanistan have kept the two at arm's length even after the end
of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is also worried about the Moscow's continued military
supplies and assistance to New Delhi, which in Islamabad's view is
further tipping the conventional weapons balance in favor of
India.
</P>
<P>
What's more, there is a yawning gap between the positions of
the two countries on the current Kosovo crisis. Russia strongly
opposes the NATO military strikes on Yugoslavia while Pakistan
supports the NATO action.
</P>
<P>
Against the background, Sharif, however, hopes to seek common
ground and establish certain "closer and sustainable" links with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believes that there is an opportunity to build a new
Pakistan-Russia relationship on a more positive basis in the new
global situation.
</P>
<P>
"The cold war and the Afghan war are both behind us," said
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz. "I feel today the points
of convergence of our common interest with Russia are stronger and
larger than any points of divergence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's relations with the Russian Federation should develop
irrespective of their ties with other countries, the foreign
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The defining theme of relationships between states and regions
today is economic interaction," Aziz said, adding that the
"immense" potential for Pakistan-Russia economic cooperation "must
be fully exploited."
</P>
<P>
To begin the process, two agreements are expected to be signed
during Sharif's visit, one on economic and trade cooperation, and
the other on cooperation between the national chambers of commerce
and industry of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also focus on ways to develop mutually
beneficial interaction in the fields of science and technology and
defense-related areas.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here maintain that Pakistan, though unhappy
over Russia's close military links with India, is also willing to
purchase cheaper high-performance arms from Moscow to diversify
its supply sources.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here suggested that Sharif is likely to formally
ask the Russian leadership to sell Pakistan its advanced SU-27
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
On the Afghan issue, Sharif is expected to reiterate Pakistan's
known position for peaceful settlement of the long-running crisis.
However, it is believed that Pakistan will still be under pressure
to halt providing military support to the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Russia is reported to have built a military base recently on
the Afghan-Tajik border, indicating Moscow's increased interest in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is also expected to seek Russia's understanding and
support of Pakistan's position on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
However, it is yet to be seen whether Sharif will be successful in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad knows this very clearly. "Nobody should expect that
everything will be resolved and the relationship will take off due
to one visit," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"The visit will provide us something to build on," he said,
adding that "after all, it is taking place after a gap of 25
years. It is a significant start."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Condemns E. Timor Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Sunday
took the blame for bloody violence that killed several people in
East Timor, but said it remains committed to a U.N.-brokered peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"It's our responsibility because we are the only ones here. We
condemn the act of violence... and we hope that it won't disturb
the agenda for next week's meeting of foreign ministers,"
President B.J. Habibie's spokeswoman Dewi Fortuna Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people, including the son of pro-independence
fighter Manuel Carrascalao, were confirmed dead when armed
pro-integration militiamen rampaged unchecked through Dili,
capital of East Timor, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a continuation of violence on Sunday, one person died and
several were injured in a clash between groups for and against
East Timor independence in Hera, east of Dili.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tension continued to shroud Dili and
surrounding areas as rumors circulated among residents that
further violence would take place on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dewi said the government remained committed to a peaceful
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"For Indonesia, we don't want to let the violence disturb our
commitment to the political process aimed at finding a solution.
What we want is a peaceful solution. If East Timorese stay with
Indonesia, we want that to be peaceful, and if they separate we
want to have peaceful relations with East Timor," she was quoted
by national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal Ali Alatas and
Jaime Gama are scheduled to meet in New York from Thursday for
U.N.-sponsored talks on a ballot to allow the former Portuguese
colony to choose between independence and enhanced autonomy within
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has suggested that the U.N.-sponsored
direct balloting to determine if the East Timor wants autonomy or
independence should be held in July.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the United Nations
never recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced in January that it is ready
to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider autonomy
is refused by the people in the region and the international
community.

BRUSSELLS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Belgian rider Frank
Vandenbroucke of the Cofidis team took his first World Cup victory
in the 264-km Liege-Bastogne-Liege cycling classic in Ans, Belgium
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Vandenbroucke broke ahead with six kilometers to go and

the oldest cycling classic, the fourth of 10 World Cup races.
</P>
<P>
"It's a dream come true", said Vandenbroucke.
</P>
<P>
Dutch rider Maarten Den Bakker came in third, ahead of top
ranking world cyclist Michele Bartoli of Italy, who won this event
the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
A group of 16 riders, including all the race favourites, apart
from France's Laurent Jalabert, broke away from the pack at Saint-
Nicolas, the Italian quarter of Liege.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Nigeria Stumbled at World Youth Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Nigeria, favourites at
the on-going 10th World Youth Soccer Championship, suffered on
Sunday the same fate as former World Youth champions Argentina and
Portugal in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
In one of the two big continental showdowns scheduled this
afternoon, Uruguay shocked football giant Brazil with a 2-1 win
following a penalty goal four minutes before the end of the match.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, three-time winners of the champinship and highly
favourate to lift the trophy, had started off on a good note at
the National Stadium in Lagos with their excellent passes and fine
combinations paying off with a goal by Fernando Baiano in the 27th
minute.
</P>
<P>
But, Uruguay, against the run of play, got the equalizer when
breakway Jorge Anchen fired a superb shot which sailed into
Brazil's net unhindered.
</P>
<P>
After the break, the Uruguayans stepped up their attacks,
forcing the panicky Brazilians to resort to illegal tactics to
stop advancing Uruguayan attackers.
</P>
<P>
One of such tactics backfired, resulting in the penalty that
sealed the fate of the Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
In Enugu, Nigerian police Sunday fired teargas to disperse an
angry crowd of football spectators when host Flying Eagles lost 1-
3 to Mali in the quarter finals of the championship.
</P>
<P>
The Malians began the match with a first minute goal, scored by
Bagayoko Mamadou, who capitalized on a relaxed Nigerian defence to
slot in the opener.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's musa Abubakar restored hope to the capacity crowd of
Nigeria's supporters with a strike in the 17th minute off a cross
from Pius Ikedia.
</P>
<P>
The Malians struck again in the 44th minute through an unmarked
Mamadou Diarra, who powered home a level drive after the entire
Nigerian defence had been torn apart.
</P>
<P>
To put victory beyond the Nigerians, Bagayoko initiated a
dribble run, displacing at least four defenders in the process
before tucking the ball into the left corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's coach Thius Libregts said at a post-match interview
that the quarter-final stage was the best the Nigerian team could
achieve.

<P>
LAGOS, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Mali, Uruguay, Japan and Spain beat
their respective rivals Sunday and surfed safely to the semi-final
of the World Youth Championship (WYC) being held in Africa's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Nigeria, two favorites of the World Youth
Championship, stumbled Sunday evening in the quarter-finals in
Nigeria, to the surprise of soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
The two suffered the same fate as former World Youth Champions
Argentina and Portugal in the round of 16, at the hands of Mali
and Uruguay respectively this time.
</P>
<P>
In one of the two big continental showdowns scheduled Sunday
afternoon, Uruguay shocked next-door giant Brazil with a 2-1 win
following a penalty goal four minutes before the end of the match.
</P>
<P>
The two South American teams have played a total of three head-
to-heads in FIFA competitions.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Mali have never met in a FIFA competition final
phase. This is the first time a match is played between two
African teams at such a late stage in WYC final phases, and
Nigeria lost to its Mali brothers 1-3, to the disappointment of 22,
000 fans and hence eliminated from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Later, Japan eliminated favorite Mexico 2-0 thanks to two early
goals and a strong performance, while Spain beat Ghana 8-7 through
penalty kicks after a 1-1 first half and fruitless second half.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Hurt in Hotel Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- England and Liverpool striker
Robbie Fowler has suffered a suspected broken nose after a hotel
fracas.
</P>
<P>
A man has been charged with assaulting the England star after
an incident at the Moat House Hotel, in Liverpool city center.
</P>
<P>
Paul McCarthy, 41, from Liverpool, will appear before local
magistrates on May 25. He is also charged with assaulting a second
man.
</P>
<P>
A earlier statement from Merseyside police said: "On the
morning of April 18, an incident occurred at the Moat House Hotel,
in Liverpool, involving Liverpool footballer Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this incident Mr Fowler and another male
received injuries. In Mr Fowler's case this included a suspected
broken nose."
</P>
<P>
Fowler played his last game of the season on Saturday when his
team lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 24-year-old decided, after discussions with
Liverpool officials including French manager Gerard Houllier, not
to appeal against a six match ban imposed by the Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
He was banned for four games, fined 32,000 pounds by the FA and
a similar sum by Liverpool after he appeared to mimic taking after
scoring a penalty in the Merseyside derby with Everton two weeks'
ago.
</P>
<P>
The striker, who joined Liverpool as a schoolboy, was also
banned for two games after a well-publicised dispute with fellow
England international, Graeme Le Saux.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sponsor Withdraws 30 Million Olympic Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Johnson and Johnson became the
first sponsor to pull out of the 2002 Winter Olympics, backing off
an estimated 30 million US dollars deal for the scandal-ribben
Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
The company today said the bribery was a factor to force them
to change mind.
</P>
<P>
"We can't say that it didn't have anything to do with it,"
company spokesman John McKeegan said. "It was certainly in the
background."
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake scandal sparked several investigations after it
was revealed the city's bid committee offered 1.2 million dollars
in cash, scholarships and other gifts to the International Olympic
Committee members and their relatives during the successful
campaign to win the games.
</P>
<P>
Ten IOC members have been removed or have resigned after being
linked to the cash payments. Ten others have been censured or
warned about their actions in the worst ethics scandal in the
history of the modern Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Johnson, a health care product company in New
Brunswick, had just signed a letter of intent to increase
financial support when the bribery accusations surfaced late last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Games still needs to raise about 300 million dollars in
cash, and services to meet SLOC's 1.45 billion dollars budget.

WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Boston Celtics forward Antoine
Walker suffered a sprained left ankle during today's victory over
the Washington Wizards and could miss the remainder of the season,
according to coach Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
Walker suffered the injury with 6 1/2 minutes remaining in the
first quarter of a 101-98 victory when he came down awkwardly
after scoring his sixth and final point.
</P>
<P>
"I stepped on someone's foot after I hit the layup," Walker
said. "It rolled on both sides. I can't even walk. I've never been
hurt. I don't know when I'll be back."
</P>
<P>
"It's a very serious sprain," added Pitino. "I think we will be
lucky if he returns."
</P>
<P>
Walker entered today's contest leading the Celtics in scoring
with 19.1 points per game, but has failed to live up to
expectations following his 1997-98 campaign, when he averaged 22.4
points and 10.2 rebounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's central-left Democratic
Left Party (DSP) led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is taking the
lead in about 30 percent of over 37 million voters in Sunday's
local and 21st parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The DSP has won 23.5 percent of the votes counted in the opened
boxes and the National Movement Party (MHP) ranked the second with
16.0 percent, showing its surprising rise for the people.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Islamic Party, which was reportedly fighting a battle
for the number one spot to win the leading numbers of votes in
Sunday's elections, has dropped to the third with 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central-right Motherland Party (ANAP) has become the fourth
with 14.2 percent and the central-right True Path Party (DYP) with
11.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) has only won 8.9 percent of
the counted votes in the opened boxes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish election law, a political party should enter
into the parliament by winning at least 10 percent of the votes in
the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The now-defunct pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), predecessor of
the FP, took the lead by winning 21.23 percent of the votes, the

WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Sunday spoke to leaders of the countries neighboring Yugoslavia,
asking for their support for NATO's air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In telephone conversations with leaders of Albania, Hungary,
Romania and Bulgaria, Clinton vowed to press on with the air war
until it was successful, National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"All of the leaders made clear that they stand behind what NATO
is doing, that President (Slobodan) Milosevic is isolated and that
his brutality and repression will not go unanswered," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"The president wanted to thank them for their cooperation with
NATO," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"The president wanted to make clear that the United States and
NATO will persevere with the air campaign until our objectives are

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton also spoke of deepening cooperation in the
future in areas including military issues with these countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on
Sunday that there would be no ground invasion against Yugoslavia
now, but it may occur later.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the program of the American Broadcasting Company
(ABC), Albright said that there was no immediate plan for ground
troops, based on the assessment of the consequences of such a move
right now.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Bill Clinton) has said he has no intention for
ground forces," Albright said. "We had a plan developed for
putting forces in to implement a peace agreement and an assessment
was made about ground forces in a non-permissive environment."
</P>
<P>
However, she added,"That plan, that assessment can be quickly
updated and that is where we are."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair made similar remarks on a program of the
Colombia Broadcasting System (CBS).
</P>
<P>
"Our position on ground forces remains as it has been, that
ground forces will be necessary to get people back safely into
Kosovo," he told CBS.
</P>
<P>
"But the difficulties of a land force invasion against
organized Serb resistance remain as we set them out a few weeks
ago," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Albright also said that the NATO will intensify its
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's extremely important to remember that in any
event, the air campaign is where we would be, and we've got to
carry on, we've got to intensify it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, President Bill Clinton spoke to leaders of the

<HEADLINE> Urgent Measures Taken to Shore up Erosive Acid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BARIC, Yugoslavia, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Upwards of 30,000
plastic bags were used to contain sand to form a protective wall
around three colossal tanks containing strong erosive acid against
possible NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
Milosh Kovic, director of the Prva Iskra Chemical Factory, said
that bags of sand were resorted to as emergency measures after
NATO fired two cruise missiles against one part of the factory
early on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the factory were preparing more bags of sand to
reinforce the protective wall and they had put out warning signs
on large fabric of yellow color on the tanks.
</P>
<P>
The chemist said that his factory had some 180 tons of hydro
fluoric acid, a strong erosive acid used to erode metals and once
heated by fire, the acid could form a large cloud as wide as 30
kilometers in diameter and shift as far as 100 kilometers in
distance.
</P>
<P>
"Not only Yugoslavia but its neighboring countries like
Hungary, Croatia and Romania could be affected by the polluting
cloud," said the director.
</P>
<P>
Scientists warned that NATO air strikes had already caused air
and water pollution in the country and that they were afraid that
NATO may attack the tanks containing the hydro fluoric acid in the
factory.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Slobodan Radovic said that only the United States had
experimented with the pollution potential of this acid with some 4
tons and the cloud thus formed was as big as three kilometers in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombing earlier on Sunday had caused fires and smokes from
fires in some chemical factories in Pancevo. The black smoke
could be seen from 20 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The black smoke was drifting with the wind toward the
northeastern part of the country.
